Biology is becoming the leading science in this century. As in all other sciences, progress in biology depends on interactions between empirical research, theory building,
and modeling. However, whereas the techniques and methods of descriptive and experimental biology have evolved dramatically in recent years, generating a ﬂood of highly
detailed empirical data, the integration of these results into useful theoretical frameworks has lagged behind. Driven largely by pragmatic and technical considerations,
research in biology continues to be less guided by theory than seems indicated. By
promoting the formulation and discussion of new theoretical concepts in the biosciences, this series is intended to help ﬁll the gaps in our understanding of some of
the major open questions of biology, such as the origin and organization of organismal
form, the relationship between development and evolution, and the biological bases of
cognition and mind.
Theoretical biology has important roots in the experimental biology movement of earlytwentieth-century Vienna. Paul Weiss and Ludwig von Bertalanffy were among the ﬁrst
to use the term theoretical biology in a modern scientiﬁc context. In their understanding
the subject was not limited to mathematical formalization, as is often the case today, but
extended to the conceptual problems and foundations of biology. It is this commitment to
a comprehensive, cross-disciplinary integration of theoretical concepts that the present
series intends to emphasize. Today, theoretical biology has genetic, developmental, and
evolutionary components, the central connective themes in modern biology, but also
includes relevant aspects of computational biology, semiotics, and cognition research and
extends to the naturalistic philosophy of sciences.
The “Vienna Series” grew out of theory-oriented workshops, organized by the Konrad
Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research (KLI), an international center for
advanced study closely associated with the University of Vienna. The KLI fosters research
projects, workshops, archives, book projects, and the journal Biological Theory, all devoted

to aspects of theoretical biology, with an emphasis on integrating the developmental,
evolutionary, and cognitive sciences. The series editors welcome suggestions for book

Innovation has long played a signiﬁcant role in the social sciences in structuring arguments
about how and why human behavior changes. Certainly innovation was implicit in the
nineteenth-century writings of ethnologists such as Edward B. Tylor and Lewis Henry
Morgan, as it was in the mid-twentieth-century work of Julian Steward and Leslie White.
For these cultural evolutionists, the appearance of cultural innovations was almost a preprogrammed process, which kicked in whenever a cultural group “needed” to overcome
social- or physical-environmental problems. Archaeological explanations of cultural
change, too, have long centered around the introduction and spread of novelties. American
culture historians of the twentieth century routinely looked to diffusion and trade as a
source of innovations, in the process adopting, often without comment, the models of their
ethnological colleagues as to how and why the innovations arose in the ﬁrst place.
With the renewed interest in evolution that became noticeable in the social sciences,
particularly ethnology and archaeology, in the 1980s, researchers began to reconsider the
role of innovation in the evolution of cultural systems. Importantly, modern evolutionary
research in the social and behavioral sciences is being geared toward identifying innovation not only as a product but also as a process. In that vein, a recent workshop at the
Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico, centered on the issue of innovation, building on the work
of Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter, who made the distinction between invention—
the creation and establishment of something new—and innovation—an invention that
becomes economically successful and earns a proﬁt. This distinction had been made previously in biology—introduction of a novelty versus long-term success of a species—but
not in the social sciences. There, the long-held belief that humans were somehow exempt
from Darwinian processes such as natural selection ensured that the only brand of evolutionism discussed was of the unilinear Tylor–Morgan–White brand.
To build on the growing body of work on cultural innovation, we organized a workshop
at the Konrad Lorenz Institute for Evolution and Cognition Research (KLI) in Altenberg,
Austria, in September 2007. We adopted something of a similar topical approach to the
Santa Fe workshop, but our emphasis was decidedly on innovation and its role in
the evolution of cultural systems. All 17 participants had extensive experience with

<-----Page 10----->x

Preface and Acknowledgments

researching innovation and had made signiﬁcant contributions to the literature on the
subject. We assembled what we believe to be an impressive list of participants from a
number of different disciplines—anthropology, archaeology, evolutionary biology, philosophy, and psychology. We asked the participants to prepare and circulate papers before
arriving in Altenberg, which allowed us to move ahead with meaningful discussion once
everyone was assembled. Additionally, we asked various individuals to concentrate on
select aspects of innovation so that we achieved wider coverage than we might otherwise
have gotten.
By all measures, the KLI workshop was a success—a point hopefully underscored by
the content of the chapters included here. The book consists of a general introduction and
three sections. The introduction documents the role that innovation has played in the
explanation of cultural phenomena from roughly the late nineteenth century to the present.
Ethnologists working early in the twentieth century paid particular attention to what typically were termed “culture traits,” using them as a means of linking related cultures
together. Archaeologists did the same. Rarely, however, was there consensus on what a
culture trait entailed and at what scale it should be examined. Beginning in the 1980s there
occurred an emerging interest in applying evolutionary principles to the study of culture,
and one area in which considerable advance was made was the study of cultural inheritance. As interesting and valuable as these studies are, there remain areas that need indepth research, especially with respect to the production of cultural innovation and the
scale and tempo at which it is produced.
Part II, “The Biological Substrate,” offers detailed discussions of innovation from
several standpoints—epistemology (André Ariew), animal studies (Kevin Laland and
Simon Reader), systematics and phylogeny (Jeffrey Schwartz), phenotypic plasticity and
evolvability (Daniel Larson), and EvoDevo (Werner Callebaut). One thing becomes clear
after reading the papers in this section: It no longer is sufﬁcient to think of selection as
“tinkering” with subtle variations, slowly effecting change over long periods of time.
Rather, there are times when innovation appears as larger packages, the product of emergent human behaviors at fairly large scales.
Part III, “Cultural Inheritance,” documents the relevance of modern insights into innovation, including the simulation of cultural innovation in the laboratory (Joseph Henrich;
Alex Mesoudi), the characterization of innovation using the random-copying (neutral)
model (Alexander Bentley), the demographic analysis of culturally inherited skills (Adam
Powell, Stephen Shennan, and Mark Thomas), evolutionary advantages of noninnovation
(Craig Palmer), and variation in diffusion and rates of cultural change (Anne Kandler and
James Steele).
Part IV, “Patterns in the Anthropological Record,” presents case studies that have
examined cultural innovation in the archaeological and ethnographic records. Topics
include technological innovation, developmental trajectories, and modes of social organization (Valentine Roux); the study of cultural variation from a behavioral perspective

<-----Page 11----->Preface and Acknowledgments

(Michael Schiffer); and innovation as a social institution (Todd VanPool and Chet
Savage).

Issues in Anthropological Studies of Innovation
Michael J. O’Brien and Stephen J. Shennan

It would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a topic in anthropology that has played as central a role as
innovation in attempts to explain why and how human behavior changes. Likewise, it
would be difﬁcult to ﬁnd a topic that has caused more debate and resulted in such a lack
of consensus. At ﬁrst glance, this might seem a little odd, given that the term innovation
is used so widely and has what appears to be a straightforward deﬁnition: something new
and different. Although there is nothing wrong with that deﬁnition, it barely scratches the
surface of what in anthropology has turned out to be a complicated concept. For example,
the deﬁnition doesn’t tell us how we would recognize an innovation, nor does it tell us
anything about its origin.
Of course, a simple deﬁnition shouldn’t be held to such a high standard, but it might
be helpful if those using the term for more than casual purposes were speciﬁc about such
matters. Such has rarely been the case in anthropology, although it hasn’t been for lack
of trying. Anthropologists for over a century have recognized the complexity of the conceptual and methodological issues surrounding innovation, especially with respect to units
and scale. In short, how do we identify not only innovations but the units involved in the
transmission of those innovations? Are they the same units that we can use to measure
transmission? Are there different scales of units, with units at one scale subsuming those
below them?
Here we brieﬂy examine those issues, bypassing extended discussion of any single topic
and focusing instead on the development of some of our current notions of innovation.
Deﬁnitions of this term and its relation to “invention” have varied considerably. Fagerberg
(2005), for example, regards invention as the ﬁrst appearance of an idea for a new product
or process, whereas innovation represents the ﬁrst attempt to put it into practice, which
may occur considerably later. Moreover, innovation may be seen not as a “one-off” but
as a continuing accumulation of changes (see chapter 9, this volume). Barnett (1953: 7–8),
on the other hand, claims to be following popular usage in regarding inventions as physical
things, whereas an innovation is deﬁned as “any thought, behavior or thing that is new
because it is qualitatively different from existing forms,” which sets the bar quite high

<-----Page 16----->4

M. J. O’Brien and S. J. Shennan

with its emphasis on the qualitatively novel. The distinction made by Elster (1986) in his
study of technical change corresponds closely to that advocated by Fagerberg, in that
innovation is viewed as “new technical knowledge” (p. 93) and invention as the generation
of a new idea. Elster also points out that diffusion often involves innovation, as modiﬁcations to a product or process are made in response to a new context, whereas substitution,
making a change in some process using existing technical knowledge, also easily shades
into innovation.
Schumpeter (1934) placed his main emphasis on the qualitative disjunction side—
“[Innovation] is that kind of change arising within the system which so displaces its
equilibrium point that the new one cannot be reached from the old one by inﬁnitesimal
steps. Add successively as many mail coaches as you please, you will never get a railway
thereby” (Schumpeter 1934: 64). Schumpeter also gave a role to adaptive technical change
and the importance of the accumulation of small changes over time (Elster 1986). Whether
such innovations, small and incremental or large and discontinuous, will be successful is
another matter again and depends on the various selection and bias processes discussed
below.
Most discussions of innovation have focused on the technical dimension, including the
organizational aspects of technical processes, as the discussion above suggests. However,
there is no reason why fashions should not be included, and here success, in terms of
increasing frequency, may be simply the result of the vagaries of random copying (see
chapter 8, this volume). Indeed, as contributors to this volume make clear, the issue of
innovations in cultural systems is almost unlimited in terms of scope, and we leave it to
our colleagues to explore the myriad directions that lie beyond our focus.
Although it is sometimes forgotten, much of what we take for “modern” perspectives
is actually built to varying degrees on decades of thoughtful research by our forebears.
We were reminded of this recently while perusing the abundant social science literature
on memes, which some social scientists argue underlie the spread of innovations. It would
be worthwhile for those interested in memetics to spend an afternoon or two looking at
how ethnologists and archaeologists of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century wrestled with
what culture traits are. The parallels in thought processes, analytical approaches, and even
research dead ends are enlightening.
Anthropological Views on Innovation
Innovation was explicit in the nineteenth-century writings of ethnologists such as Tylor
(1871) and Morgan (1877), both of whom viewed the production of novelties—new ideas,
new ways of doing things, and the like—as the underlying evolutionary force that propels
cultures up the ladder of cultural complexity. Innovation was equally important in the
work of later cultural evolutionists such as Steward (1955) and White (1959). For them,

<-----Page 17----->Issues in Anthropological Studies of Innovation

the evolutionary process was less orthogenetic than it was for the earlier evolutionists,
with the source of innovation wrapped up in the kind of mechanisms a group needs to
meet the challenges of its physical and social environment.
Innovation has also played an essential role in American archaeology (Lyman 2008;
Lyman and O’Brien 2003; Lyman et al. 1997; O’Brien et al. 2005). Culture historians of
the twentieth century routinely looked to diffusion and trade as sources of innovations,
and hence of culture change, adopting without comment the models of their ethnological
colleagues. Sometimes innovations were viewed as having been borrowed, often from
incredible distances (e.g., Ford 1969; Meggers et al. 1965). Other times they were viewed
as products of what Adolf Bastian referred to in the mid-nineteenth century as the “psychic
unity of mankind” (Lowie 1937: 35). These two contrasting processes—diffusion versus
independent invention—were at the heart of discussions of cultural relatedness. Thus,
Steward (1955) argued that if the ethnologist (or archaeologist) could determine which
traits were at the core of a culture and which ones were secondary, then the traits could
be used to assess the degree of cultural relatedness between that culture and others. The
more core traits that two cultures possess, the more historically related they are. If two
cultures hold few or no traits in common, then either the cultures are unrelated or they
were once related but at such a distant point in the past that the phylogenetic signal has
all but disappeared.
Units of Culture in Twentieth-Century Anthropology
Despite the widespread use of culture traits as measures of relatedness or of functional
convergence, there was much less emphasis on trying to ﬁgure out exactly what a culture
trait is. This raises particular difﬁculties if our focus is innovation because if we cannot
even deﬁne the cultural features we are dealing with, deciding what represents an innovation is problematical in the extreme. Researchers universally assume that such traits are
mental phenomena that one acquires through teaching and learning, but through much of
the twentieth century there were few explicit theoretical deﬁnitions of a culture trait
(Osgood 1951). This was highly problematic and meant that the units varied greatly in
scale, generality, and inclusiveness (Lyman and O’Brien 2003). There were numerous
efforts to resolve the difﬁculties of classiﬁcation and scale (e.g., McKern 1939; Willey
and Phillips 1958), but they did little to resolve the issue.
Biologists might well point out that there are also procedural problems in their discipline, where there is no standard set of characters used in the creation of taxa, but the situation is murkier in anthropology (see chapters 3 and 4, this volume). The one place where
anthropologists have made insightful comments is with respect to what early in the twentieth century became known as trait complexes—minimally deﬁned as “groups of culture
elements that are empirically found in association with each other” (Golbeck 1980).
Although trait complexes have traditionally been used as another means of comparing
cultures, the concept has a role to play in modern cultural evolutionary analysis, if for no

<-----Page 18----->6

M. J. O’Brien and S. J. Shennan

other reason than it reminds us that cultural phenomena may evolve as complex wholes,
not as tiny parts (Boyd et al. 1997; Guglielmino et al. 1995; Henrich and McElreath 2003;
Pocklington 2006; Shennan and Steele 1999; chapter 14, this volume). Selection can, and
often does, act as a tinkerer—and “one who does not know exactly what he is going to
produce but uses whatever he ﬁnds around him” (Jacob 1977: 1163)—but it is the potential
“cascading” effects (Schiffer 2005; chapters 13 and 14, this volume) of that selection that
may be important. A key goal of evolutionary analysis is to identify which applies in any
given case, rather than making blanket assumptions about the holistic or atomistic nature
of innovation and change.
Our point is that novelties are often more than simple character-state changes (Basalla
1988; Reid 2007). This is more or less what Trigger (1998: 364) apparently had in mind
when he said that evolutionary archaeology should abandon a “reductionist biological
terminology in favor of one that explicitly takes account of the unique, emergent aspects
of human behavior.” Of course, the insistence on human uniqueness is overdone; biological evolution has plenty of examples of the emergence of entirely new phenomena (see,
e.g., Maynard Smith and Szathmary 1995). Nevertheless, “emergent aspects”—aspects
that have irreducible novel properties—are important considerations in any discussion of
cultural innovation (O’Brien 2007; Sawyer 2005; Shennan 2002a). Recent evolutionary
approaches to culture have had to address the “units of culture” issue head-on, and their
contribution is outlined below.
Cultural Transmission—The Spread of Innovation
From the beginning, regardless of how ethnologists and archaeologists viewed culture
traits, and irrespective of their arguing over whether a particular trait was transmitted
vertically (cultural ancestor to cultural descendant) or horizontally (cultural group to
unrelated cultural group),1 there was agreement that traits are learned, not genetically
inherited (see chapter 3, this volume). Transmission, particularly between parents and
offspring of the same sex (Shennan and Steele 1999), creates what archaeologists have
long referred to as traditions—patterned ways of doing things that exist in identiﬁable
form over extended periods of time (chapters 9, 10, 13, and 15, this volume).
It seems naive, given what we know of the archaeological record, not to believe that
forms are modeled on preexisting forms. Further, cultural phenomena are parts of human
phenotypes in the same way that skin and bones are, and as such they are capable of
yielding data relevant to understanding both the process of evolution and the speciﬁc
evolutionary histories of their possessors.
With the growing interest in evolution that became noticeable in anthropology in the
1960s and accelerated through the 1970s and 1980s (e.g., Campbell 1965, 1970, 1975;
Dunnell 1980; Durham 1976, 1978, 1979, 1982; Rindos 1980), researchers began to

<-----Page 19----->Issues in Anthropological Studies of Innovation

7

reconsider the relationship between biology and culture (see chapters 2 and 5, this volume),
and nowhere was this more evident than in attempts to understand the role of innovation
in the evolution of cultural systems. One area of sustained focus not only in anthropology
but in the social sciences in general was cultural transmission (e.g., Boyd and Richerson
1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1973, 1981; Cloak 1975; Durham 1991; Lumsden and
Wilson 1981; Pulliam and Dunford 1980; Richerson and Boyd 1978, 1992; chapters 7–9,
11, and 12, this volume).
A key question that arose within this evolutionary context was, What, exactly, is the
unit of cultural transmission? Further, how would we know if we found one (Pocklington
2006)? Various names were proposed for units—menemotype (Blum 1963), sociogene
(Swanson 1973), instruction (Cloak 1975), meme (Aunger 1999, 2002; Blackmore 1999,
2000; Dawkins 1976), and culturgen (Lumsden and Wilson 1981)—but there is still considerable debate over what the units embody (Atran 2001; Sperber 1996, 2000). Although
perhaps a bit more sophisticated, these debates, with one major exception, are similar to
those seen decades earlier with respect to culture traits (Lyman and O’Brien 2003; O’Brien
2007).
The exception concerns the nature of the units of cultural inheritance: Do they have a
physical nature similar to genes? No ethnologist or archaeologist of the twentieth century
ever assumed that the ideas behind the physical manifestation of culture traits had a physical presence, but some modern researchers in memetics have made that proposal (e.g.,
Aunger 2002). However, Henrich et al. (2008; see also Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich
and Boyd 2002) have shown that it is possible to build a valid theory of cultural evolution
on Darwinian foundations without assuming particulate inheritance. This is good news for
those of us interested in cultural evolution because we can focus on understanding where
the units that get culturally transmitted come from in the ﬁrst place.
Simply because the units of cultural inheritance are not particulate in the same way
genes are (assuming this to be the case, at least at the phenomenological level) does not
mean that biology is incapable of offering helpful analogues when it comes to understanding the production and transmission of novelties (Eerkens and Lipo 2007; Mesoudi and
O’Brien 2009; Shennan 2002b; chapters 3–5, this volume). The key point is that the “calculated heritabilities for human behavioral traits are as high as or higher than measurements for behavioral and other phenotypic characters in natural populations of non-cultural
organisms. . . . Thus it may be that [social learning] is as accurate and stable a mechanism
of inheritance as genes” (Boyd and Richerson 1985: 55). Even where there is considerable
noise in transmission at the individual level, there are powerful evolutionary mechanisms
that can lead to stability at the population level (Henrich and Boyd 2002; Henrich et al.
2008).
Innovation, then, becomes a key area of analytical focus in any evolutionary study,
especially with respect to the form of the innovation, its composition, and the process that
created and maintained it. It is one thing to know how and under what conditions an

<-----Page 20----->8

M. J. O’Brien and S. J. Shennan

innovation is transmitted, but it is a different matter to understand where it came from.
Even more important is understanding that, especially with respect to cultural transmission, which is exponentially faster and has less ﬁdelity than biological transmission, the
transmission process itself can be a continuous creator of innovation. Much more so than
is typically the case in biology, tempo and mode can interact in cultural situations to create
a new source of innovation and to create it at scales that may be both large and complex.
This undoubtedly is what Trigger (1998: 364) had in mind when he referred to the “unique,
emergent aspects of human behavior.”
Recipes
In the social sciences there is a tendency to think of innovations as monolithic entities—the
television set, ceramic cooking vessels, and the like. It might be useful, however, to
remember that innovations are amalgams of units of varying scale that are linked functionally (and sometimes not [Shennan 2001; chapters 8 and 9, this volume]). One way of
viewing innovations is in terms of “recipes” (Lyman and O’Brien 2003; Mesoudi and
O’Brien 2008c; Neff 1992)—the materials (“ingredients”) required to construct a tool, for
example, and the behavioral rules (“instructions”) required to construct and use the tool.
Cognitive psychologists (e.g., Weber et al. 1993) have proposed that people represent tools
as interlinked, hierarchical knowledge structures, incorporating behavioral scripts governing their construction and use, much like the recipe concept (Stout et al. 2008). Biologists,
too, use the “recipe” metaphor to describe the development of organisms from genetic
information (Dalton 2000; Ridley 2003).
Krause (1985: 30–31) was one of the ﬁrst to employ the concept of “recipe” in a cultural
context, deﬁning it as a “list of ingredients and amounts” and a “part that tells you what
to do, how to do it, when to do it, and for how long.” Schiffer and Skibo (1987: 597)
developed the notion, deﬁning a “recipe for action” as “(1) a list of raw materials, (2) a
list of tools and facilities employed, (3) a description of the sequence of speciﬁc actions
undertaken in the technological process, and (4) the contingent rules used to solve problems that may arise.” They note that recipes are often culturally transmitted, which requires
a teaching framework that includes imitation, verbal instruction, hands-on demonstration,
and self-teaching by trial and error (see Guglielmino et al. 1995; Shennan and Steele 1999;
chapters 10, 13, and 15, this volume).
The concept of recipe is useful for three reasons (Lyman and O’Brien 2003). First, the
commonsense meaning of the term captures what anthropologists mean when they use the
term “cultural trait”—how, when, where, and why to produce something, whether a behavior or an artifact (a behavioral by-product). Second, the recipe concept contains multiple
parts of two general kinds—ingredients and rules—that can be reconﬁgured to form a
different recipe. Any change in ingredient acquisition, preparation, type, or amount;
change of rules or the order of their implementation; or some combination of each results
in a different product. Third, the recipe concept highlights the ﬂexibility built into virtually

<-----Page 21----->Issues in Anthropological Studies of Innovation

9

all ways of doing something and still producing a usable product (see chapter 14, this
volume).
This again emphasizes the point that units of cultural transmission and replication can
be of different scales. In biology, we know the scale of the unit of transmission and replication—the gene—but we also know that there often is no one-to-one correspondence
between a gene and a somatic character. One phenotypic character of an organism can be
polygenic (inﬂuenced by multiple genes), whereas others can be pleiotropic (a single gene
inﬂuences those several characters). The same applies to cultural transmission, where
conceivably every human behavior is underpinned by a recipe of unique composition,
scale, and complexity (Lyman and O’Brien 2003).
Dual-Inheritance Theory
Boyd and Richerson’s collective work (e.g., Bettinger et al. 1996; Boyd and Richerson
1985, 1989; Henrich and Boyd 1998; Richerson and Boyd 1992; see also Cavalli-Sforza
and Feldman 1973, 1981), often referred to as “dual-inheritance theory” (Richerson and
Boyd 1978; Shennan 2002a), is particularly useful here (chapters 5, 7, and 12, this
volume). It posits that genes and culture provide separate, though linked, systems of
inheritance, variation, and evolutionary change. The spread of cultural information is
viewed as being affected by numerous processes, including selection, decision making,
and the strength of the transmitters and receivers. However, there is much more to Boyd
and Richerson’s work than how and why traits spread. Their models also demonstrate that
some innovation is produced through the intricacies of the transmission process itself. This
calls into question the primacy of selection as the single most important evolutionary
process.
We in no way want to remove selection from its prominent place at the evolutionary
table. Rather, we point out that an overemphasis on selection as the key component of
evolution (e.g., O’Brien and Holland 1990) has shifted attention away from adequate
consideration of how variation is produced and transmitted and the effects that production
and transmission, irrespective of selection, have on evolution (Lipo et al. 1997; O’Brien
2007; Shennan 2001; chapter 8, this volume).
Numerous anthropological studies have made use of models derived at least in part
from the work of Boyd and Richerson and their colleagues to examine patterns of cultural
transmission in archaeological contexts (e.g., Bentley and Shennan 2003; MacDonald
1998; Shennan and Wilkinson 2001; chapters 7, 9, 11, and 12, this volume), and the
variety and complexity of the processes involved is increasingly clear (Shennan 2008a,
2008b). One interesting study of the spread of innovation is Bettinger and Eerkens’s
(1997, 1999) analysis of stone projectile points from the Great Basin of the western United
States. There, the bow and arrow replaced the atlatl (spear thrower) around a.d. 300–
600—a replacement documented by a reduction in size of projectile points. The weight
and length of points manufactured after a.d. 600, however, was not uniform across the

<-----Page 22----->10

region. Rosegate points from central Nevada vary little in weight and basal width, whereas
specimens from eastern California exhibit signiﬁcant variation in those two characters.
Why are there differences, and what, if anything, do they tell us about the production and
spread of innovations?
Bettinger and Eerkens propose that the variation is attributable to differences in how
the inhabitants of the two regions obtained and subsequently modiﬁed bow-related technology. Bow-and-arrow technology in eastern California was both maintained and perhaps
spread initially through what Boyd and Richerson (1985) refer to as guided variation,
wherein individuals acquire new behaviors by copying existing behaviors and then modifying them through individual and independent trial and error to suit their own needs.
Conversely, bow-and-arrow technology in central Nevada was maintained and spread
initially through indirect bias, in which individuals acquire complex behaviors by opting
for a single model on the basis of a particular trait identiﬁed as an index of the worth of
the behavior (see chapters 7, 11, and 12, this volume).
Bettinger and Eerkens propose that in cases where cultural transmission is modiﬁed by
guided variation, human behavior will tend to optimize ﬁtness in accordance with the
predictions of a cost–beneﬁt model in which individual ﬁtness is the index of success,
with little opportunity for the evolution of behaviors that beneﬁt the group as a whole. In
instances where transmission is through indirect bias, which tends to produce behaviorally
homogeneous local populations, conditions may be ripe for the evolution and persistence
of group-beneﬁcial behaviors and cultural group selection (Henrich 2004b). On the other
hand, as a result of the disconnection from current local conditions that indirect bias
implies, the practice or product may be suboptimal.
From the standpoint of innovation, the models present widely differing scenarios. In
both, individuals copy existing behaviors wholesale—innovations can suddenly “appear”
in a new region as large, complex packages (e.g., projectile points), perhaps by diffusion—but in guided variation individuals begin tinkering with certain aspects, whereas in
indirect bias they do not. Under perhaps extreme conditions, individuals may not even be
aware of the underlying principles of how and why something works. All they know is
that it does work, at least reasonably well, and they attempt to reproduce it in toto. Of
course, the copying process itself is rarely faithful, thus presenting plenty of chance for
copying errors, which themselves are novelties (Eerkens and Lipo 2005). Whether or not
the errors are reproduced, and at what rates, are separate matters entirely.
Theoretical models are powerful tools, and applications of the models to actual data are
why we do science, but controlled “middle-range” experiments provide the necessary
bridge between the two (Mesoudi 2008a; chapter 11, this volume). In that vein, Mesoudi
and O’Brien (2008a, 2008b) designed an experiment to examine the cultural transmission
of projectile-point technology, simulating the two transmission modes—indirect bias and
guided variation—that Bettinger and Eerkens suggested were responsible for differences
in Nevada and California point-attribute correlations.

In brief, groups of participants designed “virtual projectile points” and tested them in
“virtual hunting environments” with different phases of learning simulating indirectly
biased cultural transmission and independent individual learning. As predicted, periods of
cultural transmission were associated with signiﬁcantly stronger attribute correlations than
were periods of individual learning. This obviously has ramiﬁcations for how one looks
at innovation. In simpliﬁed terms, more “loners,” more innovation; more conformist individuals who want packages off the shelf, less innovation. The experiment and subsequent
agent-based computer simulations showed that participants who engaged in indirectly
biased horizontal cultural transmission outperformed individual-learning controls (individual experimentation), especially in larger groups, when individual learning is costly
and the selective environment is multimodal (Mesoudi 2008b; Mesoudi and O’Brien
2008a, 2008b).
Cultural transmission in a multimodal adaptive landscape, where point-design attributes
are governed by bimodal ﬁtness functions, yields multiple locally optimal designs of
varying ﬁtness (Mesoudi 2008b; chapter 11, this volume). Mesoudi and O’Brien hypothesized that innovations, represented by divergence in point designs resulting from individual experimentation (guided variation), were driven in part by this multimodal adaptive
landscape, with different individuals converging by chance on different locally optimal
peaks. They then argued that indirectly biased horizontal cultural transmission, where
individuals copy the design of the most successful person in their environment, allows
individuals to escape from these local optima and jump to the globally optimal peak (or
at least the highest peak found by people in that group). Experimental results supported
this argument, with participants in groups outperforming individual controls when the
group participants were permitted to copy each other’s point designs. This ﬁnding is
potentially important to the production of innovation, as it demonstrates that the nature of
the selective environment will signiﬁcantly affect aspects of cultural transmission.
How realistic is it to assume the presence of a multimodal adaptive landscape? Boyd
and Richerson (1992) argue that multimodal adaptive landscapes are likely to be common
in cultural evolution and may signiﬁcantly affect the historical trajectories of artifact lineages, just as population-genetic models suggest that multimodal adaptive landscapes have
been important in biological evolution by guiding historical trajectories of biological
lineages (Arnold et al. 2001; Lande 1986; Simpson 1944). Many problems and tasks faced
by modern and prehistoric people would have had more than one solution, some better
than others, but all better than nothing, and solutions are likely to represent compromises
among multiple functions and requirements.
Tempo and Mode
What about the tempo of the jumps across the adaptive landscape? The ethnological and
archaeological records are replete with evidence that the tempo of cultural change is rarely
constant, but there are few cases in which it has been measured directly (but see Shennan

<-----Page 24----->12

M. J. O’Brien and S. J. Shennan

and Bentley [2008] for changing innovation rates in pottery decoration and Henrich
[2004a] for a broader analysis and discussion). Again, how are scale and tempo correlated?
Is the apparent rapid emergence of a new form actually sudden, or is it an illusion, meaning
that the scale at which we are examining something makes it appear as if the object is new
when in actuality it is the product of myriad small-scale cumulative modiﬁcations that
took place over a relatively long period of time? (See the discussion at the beginning of
this chapter and chapter 13, this volume.)
This same question was asked in paleontology for decades. Darwin’s notion of the
evolution of species was based on gradualism—the slow buildup of small-scale change
over geological time—although his theory did not require that tempo. Simpson (1944)
opened the door on the notion of accelerated tempo, and Eldredge and Gould (1972; Gould
and Eldredge 1977) opened it wider with their concept of punctuated equilibrium. They
argued that cladogenesis—the division of a taxon into itself and at least one sister taxon—
is the general mode under which evolution operates (as opposed to anagenesis, or the
evolution of one taxon into another) and that rapid cladogenesis is orders of magnitude
more important than gradualism as a tempo of speciation.
Paleobiologists have erroneously used punctuated equilibrium to model evolution’s
temporal component, despite warnings from Gould and Eldredge that the model is “a
speciﬁc claim about speciation and its deployment in geological time; it should not be
used as a synonym for any theory of rapid evolutionary change at any scale” (Gould 1982:
84). They issued such warnings to emphasize the cladogenetic aspect of the punctuatedequilibrium model, thus trying to ensure that it was not confused with saltationism—the
belief that evolution depends on the appearance of macromutations that exhibit signiﬁcant
disjunctions with their parents (see chapter 4, this volume).
Discussion
Tempo and mode are only two of the myriad issues that have as yet been inadequately
addressed with respect to the origin and spread of cultural innovation, yet they offer exciting entry points into the discussion (Eerkens and Lipo 2007; O’Brien 2005, 2007; O’Brien
and Lyman 2000). Whether one views punctuated equilibrium as a particularly useful
model in understanding the origin and spread of innovation, there should be no denying
that it calls attention to the linkage between tempo and mode. Clearly, by deﬁnition, any
innovation in a cultural lineage is cladogenetic, creating a new branch in an evolutionary
tree. However, these may be on a relatively trivial scale, those characterized by small
innovations in pottery decoration, for example, or highly signiﬁcant, such as subsistence
innovations that have a major impact on many aspects of the subsequent trajectory of those
who adopt them, differentiating them along many dimensions from the continuing noninnovating branch. Moreover, the second case is likely to be associated with an increased
tempo of change, while the ﬁrst will probably not be.

Conclusion
Given the exponential growth in the evolutionary literature on both the units of transmission and the processes through which information is transmitted and received, the next
decade should witness substantial progress in our understanding of cultural innovation in
all its various guises. On a broader plain, evolutionary anthropology has made great strides
in developing a body of theory that complements biological evolutionary theory as opposed
to borrowing it wholesale and hoping that it contains something of value (Shennan 2000,
2008b; chapter 2, this volume). There is every reason to suspect that this trend will continue, and the chapters in this volume strongly support that claim.

1. Of course, the trait in question is indeed the descendant of its speciﬁc ancestor; it’s just that it now ﬁnds itself
in a milieu where most of the other traits have different histories of descent.

Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View
André Ariew

In Natural Theology, a book that Darwin read numerous times throughout his life, William
Paley argues that the existence of God can be inferred from the existence of exquisitely
functioning natural designs. Paley’s conclusion is based on the inference between artifact
and natural features: “When we come to inspect [a] watch, we perceive . . . that its several
parts are framed and put together for a purpose” (Paley 1802: 1).
Paley’s argument is an instance of what philosophers call a “teleological argument.” The
central inference can be summed up with Aristotle’s dictum “as in art, so in nature.”
Whereas Paley, and numerous philosophers before and after him, used Aristotle’s dictum
to found an argument for the existence of God, it need not have theological implications.
Take, for example, the debate over the legitimacy of Darwinism in archaeology. Bamforth
(2002) argues that Darwinism has nothing to offer archaeology beyond metaphorical language. In response, O’Brien et al. (2003: 574) invoke a rather strong version of Aristotle’s
dictum when considering the distinction between humanity and the natural world: “Like it
or not, culture and its material consequences are the result of biological phenomena.” More
than “as in art, so in nature,” O’Brien et al. appear to be arguing “art is nature.”
More generally, Erwin and Krakauer (2004) wonder whether the conditions for natural
selection can be legitimately applied to explain the dynamics and creation of human inventions and innovations. They take their cue from the economist Joseph Schumpeter’s (1942)
distinction between “inventions” as new creations and “innovations” as inventions that
become economically successful (hence spread) and earn proﬁts. Schumpeter’s distinction
reminds Erwin and Krakauer of natural selection’s explanation of both the process that
gives rise to biological novelties and the process that allows some novelties to spread to
ﬁxation in a population. Aristotle’s dictum is once again summoned, but this time in
reverse: “as in nature, so in art.”
How should we assess the legitimacy and explanatory usefulness of evolutionary theory
to explain cultural artifacts? What should we infer about the parallel between technological
inventions/innovations and biological novelty/ﬁxed traits? For their part, Erwin and
Krakauer (2004: 1117) resolve to meet with biologists, paleontologists, technologists, and

<-----Page 34----->22

André Ariew

economists to “consider the nature of evolutionary novelty and the similarities and differences between biological and technological invention and innovation.” As for the similarity and differences, as one might expect, their answer is “some” for both similarities and
differences. This is an unsatisfying result and does little to resolve the debate.
The problem is Erwin and Krakauer’s approach. A mere list of similarities and differences settles nothing. I doubt any such list would result in “absolutely no similarities” or
“absolutely no differences.” Proponents and critics alike agree that the answer will be
“some.” Taking our cue from classical teleological arguments, we have to put the list in
the form of an inference to a conclusion. What is the form of the inference, and how do
we evaluate it? This is a philosopher’s job, and I am delighted to present some of my
thoughts. Once we settle on the proper form of inferences and establish some ground rules
for evaluating them, we need to consider the scope and limits of natural selection explanations. It would do no good if we invoke a theory to explain a sort of phenomenon that the
theory is not designed to explain.
The ﬁrst section of this chapter presents two inductive-argument forms—argument by
analogy and inference to the best explanation. I suggest that the debate over the legitimacy
and explanatory usefulness of evolutionary approaches to cultural change, including the
analysis of technological innovations and inventions, should be conducted as various
hypotheses under an inference to the best explanation.
Yet, when we consider how to construct the terms of the inference to the best explanation—when we consider what natural selection explains and how it explains it—we will
ﬁnd further logical constraints that impact whether natural selection sufﬁciently explains
both innovations and inventions (technological and biological). This is the subject of the
second part of the chapter. I argue that innovations are appropriately explained by natural
selection but that inventions are not. Natural selection does not make anything—it requires
preexisting variants for its evolutionary effect.
Argument by Analogy
An argument by analogy is a species of inductive inference. By deﬁnition, inductive inferences are defeasible, which means they are open to further information that can undercut
the support that the premises give to the conclusion. Hence, we never say that the conclusions of an inductive inference, analogy or otherwise, logically follow from the premises.
No inductive inference is ever valid. Rather, we evaluate inductive inferences in terms of
strength.
In an argument by analogy, inductive strength depends on the degree to which the
analogues resemble each other. This comports to what I said earlier about the contents of
a list of similarities and differences between biological and cultural traits. No one would
say “none”; all would say “some.” The disagreement is over the degree to which the

<-----Page 35----->Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View

23

analogue resembles the target. Winnie the Pooh somewhat resembles a real-world honeyloving bear but not enough to warrant the conclusion that the latter enjoys the friendship
of a piglet just because the former does. An archaeologist concluding that an excavated
knife was used in ritualistic sacriﬁce because it resembles other sacriﬁcial knives in its
size, shape, materials, and carvings is on much stronger grounds (Fogelin and SinnottArmstrong 2006). Regardless of their different strengths, the three analogies—honeyloving bears, ritualistic knives, and evolution—all have the same common form:
1. Object A has properties P, Q, R, and so on.
2. Objects B, C, D, and so on also have properties P, Q, R, and so on.
3. Objects B, C, D, and so on have property X.
4. Therefore, object A probably also has property X.
Object A is the excavated knife, objects B, C, and D are previously found knives that
are known to have been used in sacriﬁces. Properties P, Q, R, and so on are the size, shape,
materials, and carvings that make A analogous to B, C, D, and so on. X is the property
of something being used for sacriﬁce. If knives B, C, and D have this property, then this
constitutes some (I would say high) degree of support for the conclusion that object A is
probably (to a high degree) a ritualistic knife. Here’s a ﬁrst run at a principle for evaluating an argument by analogy (which will be revised later): The more the analogue and the
target resemble each other, the stronger the inference to the conclusion.
In Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779), Hume offers both a negative lesson
of what cannot constitute a resemblance criterion and a positive proposal about what can.
The negative lesson is that it is not enough to pick and choose the properties P, Q, and R
willy-nilly without rendering the argument susceptible to a charge of bias. There are some
notable similarities between artifacts and biological items, but there are many relevant
dissimilarities that are ignored: Watches are made of metal; mammals are not. Some
mammals hop; watches don’t. Once you remove the bias, the analogy between artifacts
and natural items is weak.
In its place, Hume advocates overall similarity as a criterion to evaluate the strength or
weakness of an argument by analogy. Looking at the overall similarities between particular
artifacts and natural items such as kangaroos and watches, you will conclude after all that
watches and kangaroos are not very similar; hence, an argument from analogy based on
their overall similarity is rather weak (Sober 2001).
Bamforth could be arguing along Humean lines in his critique of applications of evolutionary theory to archaeology. There are signiﬁcant overall dissimilarities between
cultural and biological evolution that would undercut the motivation to use a biological
model to understand technological or cultural innovations and inventions. For instance,
biological evolution involves genetic inheritance, and cultural inheritance is not genetic.
However, something is amiss. The critique that there is little overall similarity between

<-----Page 36----->24

André Ariew

token artifacts and token biological items doesn’t seem to get at the heart of the motivation
for evolutionary archaeology or the heart of Erwin and Krakauer’s proposal to apply
evolutionary theory to understand how inventions become innovations. No modern scientist would claim that a particular arrowhead is the product of random genetic variation
acted upon by natural selection!
Evolutionary archaeologists wonder whether natural selection theory aids in the explanations of general trends like the success of VHS over Betamax, the creation of life-history
graphs for projectile points (Lyman et al. 2008; O’Brien and Lyman 2002), or the evaluation of new engineering designs and optimization strategies. In these instances, the relevant issue is not the overall similarity between biological and cultural artifacts nor
between the process of biological evolution and that of cultural evolution. Rather, the
appropriate issue is methodological; for example, what do the conditions for evolution by
natural selection offer by way of explaining novelty (invention) and conditions for successful spread (innovation)?
Hume’s argument that overall similarities determine an analogy’s strength has to be
modiﬁed in the context of the current debate about the virtues of evolutionary archaeology.
The question is how one determines the appropriate relevant similarities. Remember, in
the face of Hume’s objection, one must avoid appearing biased. Perhaps there is an objective or principled way of distinguishing relevant from accidental or ad hoc similarities. Or
maybe there is an easier way—one that involves abandoning arguments by analogy in
favor of a distinct sort of inference logic.
Inference to the Best Explanation
To sharpen the distinction between analogies and inference to the best explanation and to
highlight other features that will be useful to evolutionary archaeologists and anthropologists, I’ll brieﬂy expound on Paley’s argument. I’m asking that we take lessons from a
creationist argument (see Ariew [2007] for details). How ironic!
Paley’s argument starts with an analogy between living organisms and human artifacts.
If you come across a watch while walking along a dirt path and inquire as to its existence,
you would not take seriously the conclusion that watches are the product of natural forces.
It is highly improbable that natural forces would randomly coalesce matter into a watch.
The possible existence of a designer who can manipulate the parts for his own purpose
makes the existence of watches much more likely. An “inference to the best explanation”—the existence of a designer—best explains watches and living organisms.
To schematize the argument: Take H1 to be the hypothesis that the object in question
was produced by random natural forces (earthquakes, tectonic pressures, wind, rain, etc.).
Take H2 to be the hypothesis that the object was produced by an intelligent designer. Take
O to be the observation of some object, for instance, a watch. The issue is, given O, which

<-----Page 37----->Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View

25

hypothesis—and there can be any number—is most likely? This is an example of what
Sober (1993) calls the “Likelihood Principle.” In this case, the Likelihood Principle ranges
over O, H1, and H2 and can informally be expressed as follows: O strongly favors H1 over
H2 if and only if H1 assigns to O a probability that is much larger than the probability that
H2 assigns to O. In the language of probability theory, we rewrite this to read as follows:
O strongly favors H1 over H2 if and only if P(O/H1) > P(O/H2).
Paley did not explicitly formulate his argument this way, but the Likelihood Principle
does clarify what he seems to have had in mind. Indeed, given the intricacy of the watch,
its observation O strongly favors the likelihood (P[O/H2]) that a watch designer exists over
the possibility (P[O/H1]) that random forces coalesce to produce the watch.
One of the features of the likelihood construal of inference to the best explanation is that
it allows us to postulate unobservables. It is unnecessary to have any sensory experience of
a designer or random forces actually creating a watch. This feature distinguishes inferences
to the best explanations from straightforward inductive arguments, which involve observing
characteristics of a sample and extending those characters to a larger subset (Fogelin and
Sinnott-Armstrong 2006). The truth of the expression P(O/H1) > P(O/H2) is evaluated by
comparing two probability conditionals: the probability that the observation comes about if
H1 is true versus the probability that the observation comes about if H2 is true. It says nothing
about the prior probability of the existence of the thing referred to in either H1 or H2.
This feature—postulating unobservables—makes inferences to the best explanation
useful for science. Sober (2001) provides an apt example of how Mendel conﬁrmed the
existence of genes by means of an inference to the best explanation and without ever
actually observing genes. Paley, too, noticed that his inference is not weakened without
direct evidence: “Nor would it, I apprehend, weaken the conclusion, that we had never
seen a watch made; that we had never known an artist capable of making one; that we
were altogether incapable of executing such a piece of workmanship ourselves, or of
understanding in what manner it was performed” (Paley 1802: 4).
Bamforth (2002: 440) criticizes the usefulness of Darwinism on the grounds that
“archaeologists cannot directly observe the actual processes of evolution that operated in
the past; instead, we are forced to infer the operation of these processes from patterns in
material culture.” Yet, not being able to directly observe actual processes cannot be a
criticism of Darwinism or any other scientiﬁc hypothesis that relies on inference to the
best explanation. Rather, it is an accurate statement of how scientiﬁc practice sometimes
works. Not even the creationist Paley makes this mistake. O’Brien et al. (2003) make a
similar point.
Next, Paley (1802: 554) considered what would happen if we found a self-replicating
watch:
Suppose, in the next place, that the person who found the watch should after some time discover
that, in addition to all the properties which he had hitherto observed in it, it possessed the unexpected

<-----Page 38----->26

André Ariew

property of producing in the course of its movement another watch like itself—the thing is conceivable; that it contained within it a mechanism, a system of parts—a mold, for instance, or a complex
adjustment of lathes, bafﬂes, and other tools—evidently and separately calculated for this purpose;
let us inquire what effect ought such a discovery to have upon his former conclusion.

In addition to serving the function of telling time, this watch has a further extraordinary
feature: It produces well-functioning offspring. The “discovery” of a self-replicating watch
affects the former conclusion—the existence of watchmakers—in two important ways.
First, it strengthens the inference to the existence of a designer at the same time that it
weakens the inference to the hypothesis that the item is the product of natural forces alone.
As Paley (1802: 9) put it, “If that construction without this property, or, which is the same
thing, before this property had been noticed, proved intention and art to have been
employed about it, still more strong would the proof appear when he came to the knowledge of this further property, the crown and perfection of all the rest.” The probability of
natural forces randomly producing a watch is very, very small, but the probability of
natural forces randomly producing something as extraordinary and exquisite as a selfreplicating watch is even smaller.
In our schema, substitute in O a self-replicating watch rather than a garden-variety one.
Now, compare the probability that a living organism appears given H1 (random forces)
with the probability that a living organism appears given H2 (a designer). The point of the
second step is (in our more formal schema) to show how unequal are the two quantities
of the following expression:
O strongly favors H1 over H2 if and only P ( O H1 ) >> P ( O H 2 )
If we thought that the inequality was strongly in favor of P(O/H1) when O is a watch,
then we will believe that the inequality is much stronger in the case where O is a selfreplicating watch. The general lesson is, the more complex the parts, the stronger the
evidence of a designer.
However complex watches are, most of us with average intelligence and skills could
imagine learning, after extensive training, how to create them. But to have the skill of a
self-replicating watchmaker would be extraordinary or even supernatural. The general
lesson here is the more complex the design, the more intelligent (or skillful) the designer.
All that is left for Paley to do is to convince us that because living tissues, organs, organisms, and ecosystems are so much more complex than self-replicating watches, their parts
are much more attuned to the functions they serve.
One might not share the intuition that Paley’s argument from inference to the best
explanation is distinct from an argument by analogy. After all, the analogy between
watches and living organisms plays a central role in the inference to the best explanation.
However, the analogy doesn’t drive the argument; rather, it serves as a means to strengthen
the inference from complex adaptation to the explanation invoking a designer. In other
words, the relevant feature in common between watches and living organisms is their

<-----Page 39----->Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View

27

complexity and suitability for the functions they serve. If designers are the best explanation
for highly functioning artifacts, they will be even better explanations for the more complex
and highly functioning forms found in nature. In this way, Paley avoids Hume’s argument
from overall similarity. Paley’s claim is that an organism’s intricacy ought to be explained
in the same way that a watch’s intricacy is explained. It doesn’t matter if one is made of
metal and the other hops. Overall similarity is irrelevant (Sober 1993).
Readers, especially evolutionary biologists, might have noticed an obvious limitation
to inferences to the best explanation: The success of inference-to-the-best-explanation
arguments depends on the relative success of the given hypotheses, and, as Darwin would
show, there are other hypotheses to consider besides the random action of matter and cause
and an intelligent designer. Therein lies a formal limitation of inference-to-the-bestexplanation inferences: The strength of an inference to the best explanation is only as good
as the proffered hypotheses. For any given set of hypotheses, the interlocutor always has
the option of remaining agnostic as to the cause of the phenomenon in question. To suggest
otherwise—for instance, to argue that because God is a better explanation than matter and
cause, God must exist—is to commit “the only-game-in-town” fallacy (Sober 1993: 34).
If a rival account better explains the observation, it does not follow that the account itself
is even plausible.
What Natural Selection Explains
Suppose we are convinced that evolutionary biology offers the best overall explanatory
scheme for technological invention and innovation. The next issues are (1) what exactly
does evolutionary biology—and natural selection in particular—explain? and (2) how does
it explain it? The questions are relevant for both evolutionists such as Darwin—motivated
to refute Paley—and evaluators of evolutionary anthropology. After all, in a debate over
an inference to the best explanation, we need to know what is being explained (the “Os”)
and how the rival hypotheses (the “Hs”) explain it. The problem is that there is little
agreement among biologists about what natural selection explains and how it explains it.
As O’Brien and Lyman (2002) point out, biologists are in disagreement over what constitutes an evolutionary event! Even Darwin’s answer is not as obvious as it might ﬁrst
appear on a casual reading of the Origin.
In April 1982, one hundred years after Darwin’s death, the New Scientist published an
issue featuring several prominent evolutionists offering their assessment of what natural
selection means today. Strikingly, each had a distinct view about what Darwin’s theory is
meant to explain. To biologist Richard Dawkins, natural selection is the only viable explanation for the existence of adaptations. To paleobiologist Stephen Jay Gould, natural
selection is one of several explanations of the patterns of extinction and speciation.
And to population geneticist Brian Charlesworth, natural selection is one of several

<-----Page 40----->28

André Ariew

explanations for changes in trait frequency over generational time. Not a single author
suggested that Darwin’s theory best explains all three phenomena. Yet, Darwin’s own
vision of evolution by natural selection was just that—a grand, unifying theory.
If we take a close look at the characteristics of each explanation—generational trait
spread, speciation and extinction, and adaptation—it is difﬁcult to imagine how Darwin
thought natural selection could explain all of them in one sweeping, uniﬁed theory. Each
explanation features a distinct category of phenomena. Perhaps this best explains why
modern biologists offer distinct answers to the question “What does natural selection
explain?” Let’s brieﬂy examine each explanation.
Generational Trait Spread
A change in trait frequency over generational time is a population-level phenomenon. It
concerns a pattern that is true in the large scale and detected in the use of averages but
untrue for any particular individual life history or particular lineage. Individuals experience
life, death, and reproduction, but only populations evolve. The explanatory scheme is akin
to that of a theory of gases. Pressure is a property of the aggregate of molecular motion,
not of any particular molecule of gas. To explain pressure, we need not know the movement of any particular gas molecule. However, through the application of probability, we
can predict how in the long run the various molecular motions and collisions would, in
their aggregate, produce the population-level effect, pressure.
Speciation and Extinction
Patterns of extinction and speciation are at a level removed from the patterns of trait
evolution. First, whereas evolutionary patterns concerning changes in trait frequency
emerge from a particular population that varies in individual life histories, the patterns of
speciation and extinction emerge over a variety of populations over a much grander
timescale. Second, trait evolution is determined by a catalog of birth and death rates and
reproductive schedules, as well as by initial population size and population dynamics. But
a uniﬁed theory of extinction and speciation patterns is not necessarily so sensitive to these
factors, given that it must account for the patterns across a variety of contingent events
and conditions, including variations in birth rates, death rates, reproductive schedules, and
population dynamics.
The difference between the two sorts of questions is often characterized in terms of
“microevolution” and “macroevolution” (Lyman and O’Brien 2001). Both are populationlevel phenomena that differ in their level of abstraction. The debate among paleontologists
is whether macroevolution can be explained merely in terms of microevolution on a
grander scale or whether the fossil record, especially the existence of large gaps in the
otherwise gradual transitions, suggests that factors outside of microevolutionary processes
have to be accounted for. Darwin was a uniﬁer; the role of natural selection (and the

<-----Page 41----->Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View

29

principle of divergence) in explaining microevolutionary patterns is sufﬁcient to explain
macroevolutionary patterns as well—a point made by O’Brien and Lyman (2002).
Adaptation
The issue of the origin of adaptation is distinct from the other issues in a more fundamental
way. Rather than explaining population patterns, it involves an existential question, how
to account for the ﬁrst appearance of a biological item. In this context, natural selection
is Darwin’s answer to the argument from design. Contrast the question “How did the
mammalian eye come to exist?” with a question about trait spread: “How did the mammalian eye, once it came to be, become so prevalent in the present-day population?”
The difference in questions about origins of adaptation and changes in trait frequency
reminds us of Schumpeter’s (1942) distinction between invention, the ﬁrst appearance of
something new, and innovation, the spread of a successful invention. Both questions are
asked about adaptations—how do they ﬁrst appear and how do they spread in a population—but they are distinct. For something to spread, it must exist in the ﬁrst place. Darwin
recognized the distinction between populational and existential explanations.
Populational Explanations
Evolution by means of natural selection occurs when the following conditions are in place.
First, there is a struggle for existence as a result of the inherent tendency of organisms to
produce more offspring than could possibly survive in the environment in which they are
born. This is called the “Malthusian condition,” which Darwin thought was universal for
all organisms but which plays little or no role in modern evolutionary thought (Gayon
2003). Second, individuals vary from one another in any way that matters to their struggle
of life. Third, offspring tend to resemble their parents. Fourth, following the three conditions (in a near syllogism), evolution by natural selection occurs. Those variants that
provide their bearer any advantage whatsoever in the struggle for existence will be passed
on to its offspring.
Putting it all together, Darwin (1859: 80–81) wrote as follows:
Can it, then, be thought improbable . . . that other variations useful in some way to each being in
the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can
possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have
the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that
any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection.

What about the populational question concerning speciation and extinction? Here,
Darwin makes a leap—that the mechanism of preservation of favorable variations, natural

<-----Page 42----->30

André Ariew

selection, also explains how life’s diversity forms out of single ancestry: “Several classes
of fact . . . seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable species, genera, and
families of organic beings, with which this world is peopled, have all descended, each
within its own class or group, from common parents, and have all been modiﬁed in the
course of descent” (pp. 457–458). “Modiﬁcation” here refers to the process of natural
selection.
The explanation of speciation and extinction requires two ingredients: the set of
Darwin’s conditions for evolution by natural selection and a condition of isolation of
subpopulations into distinct selective regimes. Suppose the soot from nearby factories
blankets only parts of the English countryside. Some trees retain their light-colored bark
whereas others become dark from soot. In this case, diversity in a moth population subject
to the vagaries of tree color is preserved by the variation in the ecological conditions of
the English countryside. Now, suppose variants within each moth subpopulation experience different ecological conditions such that certain variants in the dark population
prevail in their isolated ecosystem and distinct variants in the light population prevail in
theirs. Eventually, differences between the dark and light moths will widen to other characteristics. In this case, diversity increases.
It is not difﬁcult to imagine cases in which the diversity blossoms—just keep subdividing the populations into distinct selective regimes and let distinct variants prevail within
each subpopulation. It is this sort of story that Darwin thought eventually led to speciation.
Whether it does or not does not concern us. What matters is that some degree of trait
diversity between populations is explained by natural selection plus a condition of
isolation.
Applying these lessons to the debate between Bamforth and O’Brien and colleagues,
let us focus on a statement made by the latter: “The replicative success of these units is
what evolutionary archaeologists seek to explain. Those units that are functional will be
sorted by natural selection; those that are stylistic will be sorted by the vagaries of transmission. Whether the former units, as manifest in artifacts, inﬂuence the biological reproductive success of their human bearers is an empirical matter” (O’Brien et al. 2003: 576).
By “replicative success of these units” we are reminded of Schumpeter’s (1942) notion
of an innovation, a novel trait that successfully spreads to ﬁxation in a population. If so,
then the question O’Brien et al. pose as empirical is whether or not a particular ﬁxed
cultural trait (e.g., a habit particular to some culture or other population) is an “innovation”
or not. Putting their point in the form of an inference to the best explanation, the phenomenon to be explained (the “O”) is a “culturally transmitted” trait. “H1” is natural selection.
“H2” is a non-natural-selection mechanism, one that is not uniﬁed by the bearers having
any sort of reproductive success. The form of the inference to the best explanation follows,
the question being P(H1/O) > P(H2/O)? O’Brien et al. are correct in saying that determining
whether the expression is true or not—whether natural selection or some other transmission scheme (uniﬁed or not) better explains an instance of a culturally transmitted trait—

<-----Page 43----->Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View

31

should be decided on empirical grounds. Bamforth’s attempt to dismiss the question a
priori is contrary to normal science, where inference to the best explanation is one of
several inference forms.
Filtering Explanation
What about the existential question concerning the origins of adaptive traits? This question
is important in order to make sense of Erwin and Krakauer’s (2004) claim that evolutionary biology suitably explains “inventions” as well as innovations. Here matters get complicated. To answer the populational questions without relying on supernatural powers of
creation, Darwin made a conceptual distinction between the internal processes that determine how an organism is formed and the external processes, involving the environment,
that determine whether a trait is to be selected (Lewontin 2000). The process that determines how individuals vary is causally independent from the conditions of selection.
Darwin knew little about the causes of variation, except to say that they are external effects
on the “reproductive functions” (Schweber 1977).
By hypothesizing that the mechanism that produces variations is independent from the
conditions for their adaptive evolution, Darwin’s theory serves as an alternative to
Lamarckian “use and disuse” theories, whereby adaptive variants appear for the sake of
their usefulness. Further, by requiring that variants preexist their spread in the population,
natural selection serves as an alternative to Paley’s view that novel traits appear all
at once.
Natural selection is not, strictly speaking, a primary cause of anything. The mechanisms
of variation ultimately produce novel traits. Natural selection operates over premade variants. Further, natural selection explains not an existential event (such as the cause of an
organic form) but a populational event, the “spread” of a “favorable” trait. Individuals
struggle to live and reproduce, and, on the theory, their existence is a condition for natural
selection, not the object to be explained.
Notice a paradox emerging. On the one hand, Darwin is known primarily for his nonsupernatural answer to the existential question about how exquisite adaptations arise.
However, on the other hand, Darwin’s distinction between how individual variants arise
and how traits evolve by selection suggests that the existential question is not part of
natural selection because, for Darwin, the spread of traits requires the prior existence of
traits. Darwin had nothing (useful) to say about how new variations come about.
If so, this has ramiﬁcations for Erwin and Krakauer’s call for an explanation of innovations and inventions in terms of natural selection. It seems the enterprise of modeling
explanations of innovations and inventions on Darwin’s theory is ﬂawed—Darwin’s
theory is tailor-made to explain only innovations, given that inventions (novel variants)
preexist selection.

<-----Page 44----->32

André Ariew

In the quote above where Darwin deﬁnes natural selection, his conception of “preserving” advantageous traits suggests that natural selection is a type of “ﬁltering explanation.” Abstractly, natural selection explains why “all Qs are P” by referring to a ﬁlter
whose role is to sort out all non-Ps in the population (preserving some, eliminating
others). For example, all descendants of earlier wolf populations are (to some standard
metric) swift because all nonswift wolves were eliminated by selection—the ﬁlter. Now,
one would think that if natural selection explains why all Qs are Ps, then by an explanatory version of the mathematical principle of transitivity the ﬁlter would also explain
why a particular Q is a P in virtue of the fact that all Qs are Ps. Yet, surprisingly, transitivity does not hold in ﬁltering explanations. This is the source of the paradox, and it
harkens back to the distinction between an explanation of how variations arise and the
conditions for which traits are selected. There may be a reason why a particular Q is
P—why Harry the wolf is swift as opposed to slow—but natural selection does not
explain it because natural selection merely eliminates non-Ps and preserves Ps. It does
not create Ps.
Explaining Invention
The upshot of the discussion of “Darwin’s paradox” is that we should draw a line between
the explanation of innovation and that of invention. Natural selection is a ﬁltering process
and hence is well suited to explain innovations—the spread of variants—but not to explain
inventions, the existence of new traits. This preliminary conclusion gives lie to claims
made by popular evolutionary writers, such as Carroll (2006), who claim that natural
selection is the primary cause of adaptation. Carroll prefers the metaphor of “forging” as
in “natural selection for incremental variation forged the great diversity of life” (Carroll
2006: 30).
Darwin (1859: 459) himself recognized the paradox: “Nothing at ﬁrst can appear more
difﬁcult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been
perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the
accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor.”
The key to Darwin’s brilliant way out of the paradox is to attend to the difference between
the process of natural selection and one of its many products or consequences. The process
of natural selection is a ﬁltering of proﬁtable from unproﬁtable variants. When reiterated
over many generations, the product of natural selection is the prevalence in the population
of a single proﬁtable variant. Reiterate natural selection over many more generations and
over many more variations, and the product is the gradual accumulation of forms, each
better adapted than the ones before it. At an even larger timescale, the product of natural
selection and the mechanism of variations is the ﬁrst appearance of an organ of “extreme
perfection,” such as the mammalian eye.

Arrival of the Fittest
Still, reiterated natural selection does not make anything. The mechanisms of variation do
the making; they are the primary cause of the existence of exquisite traits. The role of
natural selection in the explanation of the ﬁrst appearance of a trait is derivative of its
ﬁltering function. To illustrate, suppose after a year of reading lessons there is a selection
for entering the ﬁfth-grade reading class (my example is modiﬁed from Sober 1993).
Suppose Tom and Allison make it and Joel does not. True, in the case of reiterated selection the selection of Tom and Allison to the fourth-grade reading class in part explains
why they are in the ﬁfth-grade reading class. Further, if the question is why Tom and
Allison are in the ﬁfth-grade class, then both selection events—the one for the fourth grade
and the one for the ﬁfth grade—fully explain that. However, if the question is existential,
for instance, why Tom and Allison read at the ﬁfth-grade level, or why there are ﬁfth-grade
readers to be selected in the ﬁrst place, then the selection events are insufﬁcient. The
answers to the latter question might vary—Tom got a tutor, Allison bribed the
committee.
Let me summarize by placing the point in the form of an inference to the best explanation. Let the phenomenon to be explained, “O,” be a novel trait formed from a new variant
and derived from an adaptive trait more or less ﬁxed in the population. Let H1 be natural
selection as the purported cause of the trait “O.” Let H2 be developmental mechanisms,
including the mechanism for variation (e.g., recombination). The question is whether in
this instance P(O/H1) > P(O/H2). My conclusion is that natural selection alone does not
explain novel traits, but a history (etiology) of developmental mechanisms stretching back
through the lineages does. Thus, the answer to the question will be “no.”
And so it remains true, despite Darwin’s answer, that the language of “forging,”
“forming,” and “creating” inherent in the popular discussion of natural selection explanations of adaptations is misleading. Selection is a ﬁlter, and as a side consequence of its
ﬁltering, it provides some explanatory role in the ﬁrst appearance of traits. Strictly speaking, a distinct line remains between innovation and invention—natural selection is tailormade to explain innovations and how they spread, but it explains inventions only
derivatively. Perhaps that is why advocates of evolutionary developmental biology—
“EvoDevo”—state that while Darwin’s natural selection explained “the survival of the
ﬁttest,” EvoDevo explains “the arrival of the ﬁttest.” As Müller (2002) explains, the study
of invention (he calls it “novelty”) addresses causal factors in organismal evolution,
whereas the study of the spread of innovation addresses the macroevolutionary processes
of trait spread.
Nevertheless, there is still a way to apportion explanatory responsibility between the
processes of development and the conditions for selection in the explanation for the origins
of a trait, though it is not straightforward, given that each plays a distinct role. This is akin
to apportioning causal responsibility for the creation of a brick wall between two workers,

<-----Page 46----->34

André Ariew

one of whom spreads the mortar and the other of whom lays the bricks. Take an extreme
case where a mortarless wall is one brick high. The bricklayer is fully responsible (unless
the mortar spreader retains a supervisory role). Label a trait in question as “V.” The
mechanism of variation fully explains the ﬁrst appearance of V. The role of selection as
making probable compound variations is nil. Darwin envisioned the other extreme,
whereby the mechanism of variation produces only minute differences. In this case, the
buildup from the prevalence of V to the prevalence of, say, 10,000V would require 10,000
reiterations of the two-step schema, just as a wall 100 feet high made from standard-size
bricks would require the equal cooperation of the two workers. Yet, imagine a middle case
whereby some bricks are extraordinarily tall. The taller the brick, the less there is a need
for the mortar spreader to exert herself. Likewise, the emergence of a “sport,” or discontinuously large variant, reduces the number of reiterations required from the two-step
schema.
Conclusion
The deﬁnition of novelty I have offered—a new variant—that gives rise to my argument
against natural selection as the best explanation for novelty is open to the charge that the
sort of novelty I am considering is not the sort of thing that interests biologists or cultural
evolutionists. Erwin and Krakauer (2004) recognize that “evolutionary novelty” has
several meanings in evolutionary biology and offer three deﬁnitions polled from a workshop they conducted at the Santa Fe Institute.
First, evolutionary novelties are “rare morphological transitions that result from breaching genetic or morphological constraints, exempliﬁed by a developmental mutation in the
Yucca moth that gave rise to a new antennal limb” (Erwin and Krakauer 2004: 1117).
This is a paradigm example of the notion of novelty that faces the charge that natural
selection derivatively explains novelties because natural selection operates over new variants but does not cause them. Second, evolutionary novelties are changes that have important consequences for the environment, the classic example being the origin of
oxygen-dependent photosynthesis that led to an oxygenated atmosphere. Third, evolutionary novelties are changes resulting in the generation of abundant taxonomic diversity, such
as the cichlid ﬁshes of East African lakes or the diversiﬁcation of ﬂowering plants. For
the purposes of understanding the consequences of my distinction between explaining
innovations and inventions, the third deﬁnition offers nothing that is not inherent in
the ﬁrst.
The lesson learned is, contrary to my simplistic deﬁnition of novelty as a new variant,
no one is particularly interested in the ﬁrst appearance of just any garden-variant, given
that many new variants are disadvantageous and most cause death. Rather, we are inter-

<-----Page 47----->Innovation and Invention from a Logical Point of View

35

ested in the ﬁrst appearance of “successful” traits. Success is indicated either by spread
as a result of selection or by design analysis—the remarkable adaptiveness of the trait to
its local environmental condition. Thus, it is a bit misleading to say (so goes the objection
to my claim) that we are particularly interested in the ﬁrst appearance of traits because
what we are really interested in is ﬁrst appearance of “successful” traits.
Yet, this is not to dismiss the importance of the distinction between an explanation of
a trait’s prevalence and an explanation of a trait’s ﬁrst appearance. Once again, Darwin’s
distinction between the source of variation and conditions of natural selection is important
here. Complex traits are built by the reiteration of two distinct steps. One is the primary
cause of novel traits, and the other describes the conditions for which a trait spreads.
Together (reiterated), they answer the existential question of how traits come to exist, but
natural selection alone answers the question about the prevalence of preexisting traits.
Consequently, if one favors a natural selection explanation for the spread of a particular
trait, it does not necessarily follow that natural selection is the sole explanation for the
diversity of or ﬁrst appearance of a trait or that ﬁltering explanations do the causal work
required to explain the existence of a novel trait.

Comparative Perspectives on Human Innovation
Kevin N. Laland and Simon M. Reader

In 1921 in Swaythling, a village in the south of England, a blue tit began opening milk
bottles left outside homes, drinking the high-energy cream (Fisher and Hinde 1949; Hinde
and Fisher 1951; Martinez del Rio 1993). Ornithologists noted the repeated appearance of
the behavior, and over the next 30 years milk-bottle opening was observed at tens of sites
and in thousands of birds across the United Kingdom and mainland Europe (Hinde and
Fisher 1972), producing the best characterized and perhaps best known example of the
spread of a novel behavior pattern (innovation) in nonhuman animals. Experimental tests
on captive birds (Kothbauer-Hellman 1990; Sherry and Galef 1984, 1990), combined with
wave-of-advance models borrowed from archaeology (Lefebvre 1995), demonstrated that
the innovation rate can be quite high and that the likeliest explanation for the spread of
bottle-opening behavior was local innovation, where milk bottles were introduced, followed by social learning from bird to bird within that locality (Ingram 1998).
Milk-bottle opening is just one example of hundreds of innovations reported in nonhuman animals, with examples ranging from the incorporation of new items or techniques
into avian foraging repertoires and novel elements in the songs of birds to novel courtship
displays, deceptive acts, social behavior, and tool use in primates (Byrne 2003; Casanova
et al. 2008; Lefebvre et al. 2004; Reader and Laland 2003a). Many innovations are in
response to changed circumstances such as human impacts, but innovations are also produced in stable environments, where an animal discovers a new method of exploiting the
environment (Reader and Laland 2001). Thus, many animals invent new behavior patterns,
modify existing behavior to a novel context, or respond to social and ecological stresses
in an appropriate and novel manner (Biro et al. 2003; Kummer and Goodall 1985; Lefebvre
et al. 1997; Reader and Laland 2001, 2002, 2003b). We have long argued that such behavior can sensibly be termed “innovation,” and although the consanguinity of animal and
human innovation is a matter of debate (Reader and Laland 2003a), we believe that experimental, comparative, and observational research on animal innovation can also inform
studies of human innovation.
Research into animal innovation is at a formative stage with many unanswered questions. For example, it is conceivable that a variety of alternative psychological processes

<-----Page 50----->38

K. N. Laland and S. M. Reader

underlie innovation and that innovation is not a unitary phenomenon. There still are open
questions as to what roles innovation plays in facilitating the ﬂexibility of individual
development, survival, reproductive success, and evolution of animal species. Is the ability
to innovate an adaptation, and if so, what factors have selected for a propensity to innovate? Under what circumstances is innovation adaptive? Is innovation a driver of brain
evolution, or is it simply a covariate of more fundamental characteristics (e.g., sociality
or foraging mode) or an indicator of more general abilities (such as behavioral ﬂexibility)?
Many of these issues would be problematic to address using human studies alone but can
be addressed using animal models or through comparative work.
We argue here that a strong case can be made for the assertions that many animals, not
just humans, innovate; that innovation can be regarded as qualitatively distinct from related
processes such as exploration and learning; and that innovation has played an important
role in primate and avian brain evolution. The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview
of some recent research on animal innovation, illustrating comparative and experimental
approaches to the issue.
The Ecological and Evolutionary Signiﬁcance of Animal Innovation
Innovation is phylogenetically widespread, but behavioral scientists have long noted that
species differ in their tendency to innovate (Cambefort 1981; Cousteau 1958; Lefebvre
et al. 2004; Thorpe 1956). For instance, Morgan (1912) speculated that behavior may be
composed of a repetitive component that has occurred before and a smaller proportion of
novel behavior—found particularly in so-called “higher” organisms—that can be regarded
as a creative departure from routine. Although there are long traditions of research into
related topics such as neophilia, exploration, and insight learning in animals, and whereas
innovation in humans has been subject to considerable investigation, animal innovation
has only recently begun to receive attention. A critical paper drawing attention to the topic
was Kummer and Goodall’s (1985) review of primate innovation, which suggested that
some innovations derive from the ability of the individual to proﬁt from an accidental
happening, others result from the ability to use existing behavior patterns for new purposes,
and still others are completely new behavior patterns. Innovation may be prompted by two
factors: need (such as a period of drought or a social challenge) or an excess of resources,
which will allow animals to bear the costs of exploration (Kummer and Goodall 1985;
Laland and Reader 1999a). Necessity is likely the dominant factor prompting animal
innovation (Gajdon et al. 2006; Laland 2004; Laland and Reader 1999a, 1999b; Sol,
Lefebvre, and Rodríguez-Teijeiro 2005).
Two major surveys of innovation have documented over 2,200 examples of foraging
innovations in birds (Lefebvre et al. 1997, 2004)—the most complete survey of animal
innovation—and over 500 examples of innovations in primates (Reader and Laland 2001,

<-----Page 51----->Comparative Perspectives on Human Innovation

39

2002). These surveys collated reports from published literature, using keywords such as
“novel” or “never seen before” to classify behavior patterns as innovations. Although these
kinds of studies are vulnerable to reporting biases, Lefebvre and colleagues have devised
statistical methods for evaluating and counteracting these biases, and there are reasonable
grounds to be conﬁdent that these innovation data represent a valuable, robust measure of
an aspect of behavioral ﬂexibility (Lefebvre et al. 2004).
Furthermore, innovation rate correlates with laboratory measures of learning, supporting the idea that innovation is a cognitive measure (Lefebvre et al. 2004). In both birds
and primates, innovation rate (per avian parvorder or primate species) has been shown
to correlate positively with measures of forebrain size. This parallel ﬁnding in two independent taxa, and at different taxonomic levels, supports the idea that brain volume is
an indicator of behavioral ﬂexibility and raises the possibility that increased innovativeness may have yielded a selective advantage, thus driving brain enlargement over evolutionary time.
Innovative individuals and species tend to show low neophobia and superior performance on a variety of cognitive measures (Bouchard et al. 2007; Reader 2003). The
phylogenetic distribution of innovation suggests that selection may have favored innovativeness as part of a cognitive suite of traits in particular lineages (Lefebvre et al. 2004;
Reader and Laland 2002), with innovation perhaps part of a survival strategy based on
ﬂexibility to cope with unpredictable, changing socioecological environments and to alter
behavior to outcompete others.
The pioneering work of Lefebvre et al. (1997) has inspired further analyses in birds
and in primates that explore the relations among innovation, ecology, and cognition.
There are multiple descriptions of speciﬁc innovations apparently facilitating survival
in changed circumstances (Sol 2003). Innovation might also be of critical importance
to those endangered or threatened species forced to adjust to impoverished environments
(Greenberg and Mettke-Hofman 2001). To test the idea that innovations may facilitate
survival in novel circumstances, Sol and colleagues (Sol 2003; Sol and Lefebvre 2000;
Sol, Duncan, et al. 2005; Sol et al. 2002) took advantage of a series of natural experiments where humans have introduced species into new habitats, ﬁrst in New Zealand
and then in a global analysis. Innovative species were found more likely to survive and
establish themselves when introduced to new locations. If innovativeness is the causal
variable in this relationship, it suggests that innovation can aid survival in changed
environments. Similarly, nonmigratory birds innovate most in the harsher winter months
(Sol, Lefebvre, and Rodríguez-Teijeiro 2005), whereas migratory species are less innovative than nonmigrants, suggesting that migratory birds may be forced to migrate
because of an inability to adjust behaviorally to the changed winter months.
Innovation has been proposed to have a key inﬂuence on the tempo and course of evolution. For instance, Wilson’s (1985) “behavioral-drive” hypothesis argues that innovation
combined with cultural transmission led animals to exploit the environment in new ways,

<-----Page 52----->40

K. N. Laland and S. M. Reader

exposing them to novel selection pressures and increasing the rate of genetic evolution
(see also Wyles et al. 1983). Studies of birds and primates support a key assumption of
behavioral drive—that brain size, innovation rate, and social-learning rate are linked
(Lefebvre et al. 1997; Reader and Laland 2002). Innovation rate and brain size have
recently been shown to correlate with avian species and subspecies richness, suggesting
that, as the behavioral-drive hypothesis predicts, evolutionary rates are accelerated in
large-brained, innovative taxa (Nicolakakis et al. 2003; Sol 2003; Sol, Stirling, and Lefebvre 2005).
When a novel learned behavior spreads through an animal population and as individuals
learn from one another, typically a single individual will have initiated the process. Such
diffusion requires two processes: the initial inception of the behavioral variant, innovation,
must occur, and the novel trait must spread between individuals, which is social learning.
Many books, conferences, and papers have been dedicated to animal social learning (e.g.,
Box and Gibson 1999; Fragaszy and Perry 2003; Galef and Giraldeau 2001; Heyes and
Galef 1996; Shettleworth 2001; Zentall and Galef 1988). In comparison, the ﬁrst step of
the spread of a novel behavior (innovation) received little attention until recently. Innovation is now increasingly recognized as an important component of animal social-learning
research, particularly in relation to population differences in behavior that are proposed
to reﬂect cultural diversity (e.g., Huffman 1996; Laland and Janik 2006; Leca et al. 2007;
Ramsey et al. 2007; van Schaik, van Noordwijk, and Wich 2003; van Schaik, Ancrenaz
et al. 2003; Whiten et al. 1999). Counterintuitively, relatively few innovations appear to
spread through animal groups (Gajdon et al. 2006; Kummer and Goodall 1985; Laland
and Hoppitt 2003)—a phenomenon also noted in humans (Rogers 1995).
Innovation is also key to cumulative cultural evolution, where a careful balance must
be struck between faithful social transmission (to minimize loss of previous innovations)
and innovation (to minimize stagnation and allow adaptive change). Although clear
evidence of cumulative cultural evolution is lacking in animals, tool manufacture in New
Caledonian crows has been suggested to be a possible case (Hunt and Gray 2003).
Evidence is mounting that innovation plays an important role in ecology (e.g., range
expansion), in evolution (e.g., subspecies diversiﬁcation), in cognition (as the ﬁrst step of
social learning), and in cultural diversiﬁcation. Innovation not only is widespread in nonhumans but is conceptually and functionally important.
Deﬁning Animal Innovation
It was only in 2003 that a detailed deﬁnition of animal innovation was ﬁrst proposed,
appearing in the ﬁrst book on the topic. Reader and Laland (2003b) proposed two operational deﬁnitions. Innovation sensu product is a new or modiﬁed learned behavior not
previously found in the population. Innovation sensu process is a process that introduces
novel behavioral variants into a population’s repertoire and results in new or modiﬁed
learned behavior. Thus, innovations are learned, and their novelty is deﬁned at the popula-

<-----Page 53----->Comparative Perspectives on Human Innovation

41

tion level. Innovations can spread by social learning; however, the introduction of a novel
behavior into a population by social learning is not considered innovation. This contrasts
with some deﬁnitions of human innovation, which refer to acquisition of a novel act by
any route as innovation and the initial inception as “invention” (Rogers 1995).
Ramsey et al. (2007: 397) proposed an individual-level deﬁnition of innovation as “the
process that generates in an individual a novel learned behavior that is not simply a
consequence of social learning or environmental induction,” the latter being behavior that
“emerges reliably in all or most individuals exposed to the environmental stimulus.”
However, deﬁning innovation at the individual level and determining environmental
induction pose problems of operationalization (Giraldeau et al. 2007; Kendal et al. 2007;
Reader 2007)—concerns that lead us to prefer the 2003 deﬁnition.
Reader and Laland (2003b) proposed deliberately broad deﬁnitions and made no distinction between totally novel behavior and modiﬁcations of existing behavior, as has been
the practice among researchers studying birdsong learning (Slater and Lachlan 2003).
Although some objectors might prefer to reserve the term “innovation” for qualitatively
new or cognitively demanding tasks or processes, a broad deﬁnition is justiﬁed given the
primitive state of knowledge of animal innovation. The key characteristic of innovation
is the introduction of a novel behavior pattern into a population’s repertoire, and it would
be foolhardy to insist that an innovator must express a previously unobserved motor pattern
or unusual cognitive ability. For example, the milk-bottle-opening birds likely used motor
actions already in their repertoire (Hinde and Fisher 1951); thus, the innovation involved
the application of a familiar behavior to a novel food source. Moreover, subjective judgments of cognitive ability are vulnerable to anthropocentric prejudice, and the ecological
and evolutionary consequences of innovations need not depend on the cognitive sophistication of the innovative process. Making premature distinctions potentially jeopardizes
the ability to see genuine relationships between different kinds of novel behavior.
Experimental Studies of Animal Innovation
How can innovation be studied experimentally? Kummer and Goodall (1985: 213) offered
a suggestion: “Systematic experimentation (such as the introduction of a variety of carefully designed ecological and technical ‘problems’) both in free-living and captive groups
would provide a new way of studying the phenomena of innovative behaviors and their
transmission through and between social groups.” In the last decade, this approach has
started to be implemented in animal studies. Innovation can be studied experimentally in
captive animals by presenting them with novel challenges such as foraging-puzzle boxes
and exploring the factors inﬂuencing innovation (e.g., sex, age, and social rank). Described
below are four experimental studies we have been involved in that illustrate some of the
methods and ﬁndings of experimental studies of animal innovation.

Case Study 1: Innovation in Captive Populations of Callitrichid Monkeys
The prevailing assumption in the primate literature is that young or juvenile primates are
more innovative than adult individuals. This innovative tendency among the young is
frequently thought to be a consequence or side effect of their increased rates of exploration
and play. Conversely, Reader and Laland’s (2001) review of the primate-innovation literature noted a greater reported incidence of innovation in adults than in nonadults, which
they interpreted (in part) as a reﬂection of the greater experience and competence of older
individuals. Within callitrichids (marmosets, tamarins, and lion tamarins) different studies
document different effects of age on responses to novel objects, foods, and foraging tasks.
However, these differences across studies may reﬂect the small samples used (Kendal
et al. 2005).
Kendal (née Day) and colleagues presented novel extractive foraging tasks to a large
number of family groups of callitrichid monkeys in zoos in order to examine whether
there are positive or negative relationships of age with neophilia, exploration, and
innovation and whether youth or experience most facilitates innovation. Novel “puzzlebox” foraging tasks were given to 108 callitrichids in 26 zoo populations ranging in
size from two to eight individuals. Kendal recorded the ﬁrst individual to approach,
contact, and solve each task in each population as well as a variety of other dependent
variables relevant to the subsequent spread of the solution through social learning (Day
2003; Kendal et al. 2005). Her study revealed systematic age differences in callitrichid
innovation, with older monkeys signiﬁcantly more likely than younger monkeys to be
the ﬁrst to solve the tasks. Whereas younger monkeys (particularly subadults and
young adults) were disproportionately represented among those ﬁrst to contact the task,
adults (older than four years of age) were disproportionately ﬁrst to solve the tasks.
Older individuals were signiﬁcantly more likely than younger individuals to turn
manipulations into successful manipulations. This ﬁnding is consistent with Reader
and Laland’s (2001) meta-analysis. Statistical analyses provided evidence that at least
some of the innovations subsequently spread throughout the group by social learning
(Day 2003).
When the overall performance of individuals who interacted with the tasks is considered, the results of Kendal et al.’s experiment suggest that experience and competence
allow older individuals to solve novel problems more effectively than do younger individuals. The positive relationship between age and task success suggests that the greater life
experience of individuals over four years old may enable them to outperform younger
individuals. However, other developmental factors, such as improvements in manipulative
skills, increased strength, and maturity with age, cannot be ruled out.
Individuals over age four produced more successful than unsuccessful task manipulations
than individuals in the younger age categories. This suggests that there may be a developmental watershed (at about four years for callitrichid monkeys) when prior manipulative

<-----Page 55----->Comparative Perspectives on Human Innovation

43

experience generates sufﬁcient competence in extractive foraging for individual callitrichids to efﬁciently translate unsuccessful manipulations into successful manipulations. In
accordance with such a competence hypothesis, Menzel and Menzel (1979) suggested that
Saguinus fuscicollis (brown-mantled tamarin) adults acquire information more efﬁciently
and can recognize and classify objects more quickly than nonadults.
Age was not the only source of variation in innovative performance. The results revealed
consistently shorter response latencies, higher levels of successful and unsuccessful
manipulation, and greater attentiveness to the task and to conspeciﬁcs in Leontopithecus
(lion tamarins) than in both Saguinus (tamarins) and Callithrix (marmosets; Day et al.
2003). This is consistent with the hypothesis that species dependent on manipulative and
explorative foraging tend to be less neophobic and more innovative than other species
(Gibson 1986). Callithrix is classiﬁed as a “specialized extractive forager,” and the
Saguinus species studied have been described as “nonextractive foragers” (Dunbar 1995).
Hence, the experimental results of increasing innovation from Saguinus to Callithrix to
Leontopithecus ﬁt the hypothesis that extractive foraging may have promoted the evolution
of intelligence in the form of an ability to respond to environmental change (Gibson 1986).
The ﬁndings also support Lefebvre’s (2000) hypothesis that there is a positive association
between neophilia and innovation.
Case Study 2: Predictors of Foraging Innovation in Starlings
There are numerous reports of novel learned-behavior patterns in animal populations, yet
the factors inﬂuencing the invention and spread of these innovations remain poorly understood. Boogert et al. (2008) investigated to what extent the pattern of spread of innovations
in captive groups of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) could be predicted by knowledge of
individual and social-group variables, including association patterns, social-rank orders,
measures of neophobia, and asocial-learning performance. Small groups of starlings were
presented with a series of novel extractive foraging tasks, and the latency for each bird to
contact and solve each task as well as the orders of contacting and solving were recorded.
Which variables best predicted the observed diffusion patterns? Object neophobia
and social-rank measures characterized which animal was the ﬁrst of the group to contact
the novel foraging tasks, and the subsequent spread of contacting tasks was associated
with latency to feed in a novel environment (a possible indicator of vigilance). However,
asocial-learning performance, measured in isolation, predicted the ﬁrst solvers of the novel
foraging tasks in the group. In other words, one can predict how innovative a starling will
be on the basis of its previously measured learning performance. If social learning underlies the diffusion of innovations, we would expect individuals acquiring the behavior later
in the diffusion to exhibit shorter learning times, given that they will have more administrators than individuals that acquire the behavior early. This proved to be the case. Contact
latency and solving duration were negatively correlated, consistent with social learning
underlying the spread of solving.

However, perhaps surprisingly, association patterns did not predict the spread of solving:
Birds were no more likely to learn from close associates than from birds with which they
spent little time. This may reﬂect the relatively small size of the groups and enclosures;
innovations may be more likely to spread along networks of association in larger groups
living in more naturalistic environments.
Case Study 3: Experimental Studies of Innovation and Diffusion in Fishes
Laland and Reader (1999a, 1999b) explored individual differences in the propensity to
innovate in ﬁshes. Small populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were presented with
a novel maze task containing food; the ﬁrst individual to solve the task was characterized
as an innovator. Mazes were composed of one or more partitions with small holes or compartments through which the ﬁsh had to swim to ﬁnd the food. The mazes were designed
so that ﬁsh were required to swim away from the smell of the food in order to get to it so
that the task could not be solved merely by swimming up an odor gradient.
Laland and Reader (1999a) exposed small groups of guppies, composed of individuals
varying in sex, hunger level, and body size, to the novel mazes and recorded the category
of the ﬁrst ﬁsh to reach the novel food source. A subsequent study has found a signiﬁcant
correlation in guppies between time taken to complete a maze for the ﬁrst time and number
of trials to learn the maze according to a trials-to-criterion measure (Reader and Laland
2000), legitimizing the use of the ﬁrst individual in a population to swim the maze as a
proxy measure of innovation. Laland and Reader found that females were more likely to
innovate than were males, food-deprived ﬁsh were more likely to innovate than were nonfood-deprived ﬁsh, and smaller ﬁsh were more likely to innovate than were larger ﬁsh.
It appears that differences in innovatory tendencies in guppies are best accounted for by
differences in motivational state. Innovators were neither the most active ﬁsh (males) nor
those with the fastest swimming speed (large ﬁsh). Moreover, the observed patterns disappear when the experiments are repeated with no food in the mazes. Here, the most parsimonious explanation for the observed individual differences in problem solving is that innovators
do not need to be particularly intelligent or creative but are driven to ﬁnd novel solutions to
foraging problems by hunger or by the metabolic costs of growth or pregnancy.
These ﬁndings did not rule out the possibility that over and above these state-dependent
factors there are “personality” differences that affect an individual’s propensity to innovate. To investigate this, Laland and Reader exposed populations of ﬁsh to three novel
foraging tasks, recording whether ﬁsh that completed the ﬁrst two tasks fastest performed
faster in the third task than ﬁsh that had not innovated in the ﬁrst two tasks. Past innovators were found to be more likely to innovate than past noninnovators. The design took
steps to rule out a number of potentially confounding variables, constituting evidence that
there are genuine personality differences in innovative tendency in guppies. It is interesting
that there is evidence for innovative individuals in a species not particularly renowned for
its intelligence or problem-solving capabilities.

To further investigate how motivational state affects innovation, Laland and Reader
(1999b) explored the relationship between past foraging success and foraging innovation.
Weight changes of individuals in two mixed-sex populations of guppies were monitored
over two weeks, and the competitive foraging ability of each individual was measured
by recording the number of food items eaten. These populations were then exposed to
three novel maze tasks, and the time for each ﬁsh to complete the task was recorded.
The prediction was that poor competitors—ﬁsh that had gained the least weight and
obtained the least food items during scramble competition—would be more likely to
innovate when presented with the novel foraging tasks. In male guppies, the latency to
complete the foraging tasks was indeed found to correlate with both weight gain and
the number of food items consumed during scramble competition. There was no such
correlation in female guppies, however. Females appeared more motivated to solve the
foraging tasks than males, regardless of how they had fared during the scramble
competition.
What could explain the ﬁnding that female guppies are more likely to show foraging
innovations than are male guppies, irrespective of past foraging success? Laland and
Reader (1999b) reasoned that parental-investment patterns could account for these sex
differences. In many vertebrate species, female parental investment exceeds that of males,
leading to the suggestion that male reproductive success is most effectively maximized
by prioritizing mating, whereas female reproductive success is limited by access to food
resources (Trivers 1972). This rings true in guppies, where females can store sperm, are
viviparous (thus female parental investment is much greater than that of males), and, unlike
males, have indeterminate growth, with a direct correlation between energy intake and
female fecundity (Reznick and Yang 1993; Sargent and Gross 1993). Consequently,
ﬁnding high-quality food has greater marginal ﬁtness value for females than for males,
which may explain why females should be more investigative than males and are constantly searching for new food sources.
Having established that individual guppies vary in their propensity to innovate, Reader
and Laland (2000) turned to the ways in which innovations spread through animal populations. Mixed-sex populations of guppies were presented with three novel foraging tasks,
and time to complete the task was recorded for each individual over 15 trials. In a ﬁrst
experiment the populations were made up of equal numbers of food-deprived and nonfood-deprived individuals, whereas in a second experiment small, young ﬁsh were compared with large, older ﬁsh. Food-deprived ﬁsh were faster than non-food-deprived ﬁsh at
completing the tasks over repeated trials. Although there was no overall effect of size,
there was a signiﬁcant interaction between sex and size. Adult females completed the tasks
much faster than adult males, but no sex difference was found in younger adults.
In both experiments there was a signiﬁcant sex difference, with novel foraging information spreading faster through female subgroups than through male subgroups. Females
also were found to learn at a faster rate than males. These ﬁndings are most likely a result

<-----Page 58----->46

K. N. Laland and S. M. Reader

of motivational differences between the sexes, corroborating the earlier ﬁndings of Laland
and Reader (1999a, 1999b). The absence of a sex difference in younger ﬁsh is also consistent with the above-mentioned parental-investment explanation, given that younger ﬁsh
are not expected to show investment asymmetries.
These observations are consistent with the ﬁndings of Reader and Laland’s (2001)
meta-analysis of primate innovation (see also van Bergen 2004). They observed more
reported incidences of innovation in low-status individuals than expected and fewer reports
of innovation in high-status individuals than expected, given their representations in the
population. Van Bergen (2004) reports greater innovation in male primates than expected
and fewer reports of female innovation than expected, given their representation. This sex
difference was particularly strong in relation to sexual and courtship behavior and aggression. The latter ﬁnding can be explained in a similar manner to the sex difference in guppy
innovation, except that in the case of the primates it is the males for whom the marginal
beneﬁts of innovation are greater, given that the innovations allow them to access mates.
Case Study 4: Social Transmission of Foraging Information in Rats
Rats have been reported digging for buried foods or foraging in loose litter for food items
(Barnett 1975). Laland and Plotkin (1990, 1992) carried out a series of experiments in
which they explored the social learning and transmission of foraging information concerning buried food and, in the process, shed light on behavioral innovation. Demonstrator rats
were trained to dig for pieces of carrot buried beneath lightly compressed soil in a small
enclosure. Each experimental subject or observer was then placed in a similar enclosure
containing buried food, in the presence of a single demonstrator and separated by a wire
mesh partition, for a 10-minute period. A preliminary experiment established that the
foraging performance of observer rats was enhanced by social learning from a trained
demonstrator conspeciﬁc, with control groups conﬁrming that the elevated performance
could not be attributed to social facilitation or motivational factors (Laland and Plotkin
1990). This established, Laland and Plotkin embarked on a series of experiments with an
“animal A demonstrates to animal B, which demonstrates to animal C . . .” transmissionchain design.
In the ﬁrst experiment the animals were assigned to one of three groups. Two groups
were social-transmission groups in which each animal ﬁrst observed a demonstrator conspeciﬁc that had various degrees of experience in foraging by digging. The observer then
became the demonstrator for the next animal in the line of transmission. In the ﬁrst, or
“standard-transmission,” group, the ﬁrst demonstrator had been trained to dig for carrots
beneath the soil surface of the enclosure. In the second, or “innovator,” group, the initial
demonstrator was untrained, but again each observer became the demonstrator for another
animal. The third group was a control, in that no social transmission could occur and so
there was no transmission chain. Each observer was paired with an untrained demonstrator
that had no carrots buried on its side of the enclosure; thus each animal performed on the

<-----Page 59----->Comparative Perspectives on Human Innovation

47

basis of its own individual learning. After having one such opportunity, the control animals
were removed from the experiment.
Animals in the standard-transmission group exhibited elevated foraging performance
relative to the control group throughout the transmission chain. Animals in this group were
more active, began digging earlier, and dug up more pieces of carrot than did animals in
the control group. It was clear that pertinent foraging information had been transmitted
from the original demonstrators to other animals in the chain. Although this group showed
some decline in performance in the early steps of the chain, this appeared to ﬂatten off at
a level that still was signiﬁcantly above that of the controls. This pattern is consistent with
the interpretation of an initial loss of information at each transmission step, resulting in
each successive animal being a less effective demonstrator for the next animal in the line
of transmission.
The innovator group was so called because, given that the transmission chain began
with an untrained demonstrator, whatever information was being transmitted between
animals was the result of cumulative innovation. Animals in this group also reached performance levels that were signiﬁcantly above that of the controls. Thus, for this group
there seemed to be an accumulation of information during the ﬁrst few steps of the
chain, with performance “asymptoting” at a level similar to that found in the standardtransmission group. The innovator-group data suggest that although there was loss of
information at each transmission step, this can be offset by successive observers’ beneﬁting from the sum of the demonstrator’s social and individual learning. Toward the end of
the transmission chains, both transmission groups appeared to have reached equal levels
of performance, where equivalent amounts of information were gained and lost.
More qualitative data revealed further differences in the digging styles of the rats under
different conditions. Control rats dug boisterously by moving their forelegs away from
them and kicking with their rear legs, and showed little sign of searching for food. Conversely, rats in the standard-transmission group, like demonstrators, dug more carefully
and in a directed manner, moving their forelegs toward them and with little kicking with
the rear legs, in what much more obviously resembled foraging behavior. Interestingly,
rats in the innovator group at early steps in the transmission chain dug with the “wanton”
style of the controls, but as the transmission chain proceeded, they were observed to dig
increasingly in the more directed foraging style of the trained demonstrators.
The performance curves of subjects in the two transmission groups illustrate certain
distinctive properties of social transmission. First, information can be gained as well as
lost throughout transmission. Second, innovation does not necessarily require creative or
clever individuals but can accrue through the accumulated activities of many individuals.
Third, there may be an equal amount of socially transmitted information that can be stably
transmitted throughout a population. Where performance levels are higher than the
equilibrium, information is likely to be lost; where performance levels are below the
equilibrium, information may accrue.

Summary
Numerous animals acquire novel skills and information from others, and behavioral innovations frequently diffuse through natural and captive populations by social-learning
processes. It is instructive to refer to the initial inception of such behavioral variants as
innovation and to investigate the factors that underlie and predict variation in innovation
within and between species. Innovation can be studied experimentally in animals by presenting novel tasks to captive or natural populations and then carefully monitoring the
spread of the solution. Experimental studies of animal innovation in various vertebrates
including ﬁsh, birds, and primates, together with a meta-analysis of primate innovation
(Reader and Laland 2001), suggest that the adage “necessity is the mother of invention”
explains a lot of data. Hungry, small individuals and individuals of low status disproportionately engage in innovative behavior. Sex differences in innovation can be interpreted,
and to some extent predicted, using conventional behavioral-ecology theory such as
parental-investment and sexual-selection theory.
Species differences in innovativeness among monkeys suggest that certain life-history
characteristics, particularly a diet reliant on extractive foraging, may favor enhanced
innovation. Both experimental studies in monkeys and a meta-analysis across primates
in general imply that adults perform a disproportionate amount of innovation, despite the
observation that younger individuals are often quicker to approach novel objects than are
adults (Kummer and Goodall 1985). The greater experience, strength, and maturity of
elder individuals may be necessary to translate exploration into successful exploitation.
In captive birds, asocial-learning performance measured in isolation predicts which individuals will innovate in a social context. Whereas most innovation is the product of a
single animal, sometimes innovation can accrue through the accumulated activities of
many individuals. Animal innovation is a topic that has only recently received recognition,
but one that is starting to command serious attention from behavioral scientists.

Organismal Innovation
Jeffrey H. Schwartz

The theme of this volume—innovation in cultural systems—is certainly in need of serious
discussion. The subtitle of the workshop—contributions from evolutionary anthropology—provokes the question, does the word “evolutionary” have the same meaning in
cultural and biological contexts? More speciﬁcally, can the intellectual construct that
underlies the theme of this workshop—namely, economist Joseph Schumpeter’s (1942)
distinction between “invention” (the creation and establishment of something new) and
“innovation” (an invention that becomes economically successful and earns a proﬁt)—be
successfully applied to both cultural and biological systems? If so, how? If not, why? In
attempting to address these questions, it might be informative ﬁrst to outline what I think
are the relevant elements of biological change and then to see if, and/or how, they map
on or relate to the notions of “invention” and “innovation.”
A Brief Historical Prelude to the Question
With Darwin’s (1859) ﬁrst edition of the Origin, a debate previously pursued largely in
the form of private conversation and correspondence became public, namely, the topic of
evolution, its reality, and its elements. Indeed, in addition to public and religious outcry,
Darwin’s venture into evolutionary discourse immediately prompted a long, and not altogether positive, critique by his supposed bulldog, Thomas Huxley (1860). In that review,
Huxley took Darwin to task on most aspects of the Origin, especially his unjustiﬁed claim
that organismal change generally occurs smoothly and gradually (and thus “natura non
facit saltum” [“nature does not make leaps”]), his unsystematic and disorganized presentation of “data” in support of his claims, and his theoretical and methodological shortcomings in arguing for natural selection.
A second major blow to Darwin’s theory of evolutionary change as a process involving
long-term adaptation mediated by something called “natural selection” came in 1867 with
the publication of Jenkin’s review of the Origin. Jenkin pointed out that, contrary to
Darwin’s claims, not only was there no evidence whatsoever of transitional forms in the

<-----Page 66----->54

fossil record—only the picture of the abrupt appearance of organisms with fully developed
features—or between living species but also Darwin’s conception of natural selection was
incapable of producing change. Rather, Jenkin argued, given that the theory of natural
selection does not preclude the interbreeding of individuals with less advantageous
variants of a trait, the greater number of offspring these presumably less well-adapted
individuals produce will overwhelmingly swamp any contribution to future generations
that the one or two supposedly better adapted individuals could make.
More so than Huxley’s, Jenkin’s review had such a profound effect on Darwin that he
not only wrote in anguish to the former scholar as well as to other colleagues about this
egregious oversight on his part but then, in the ﬁfth and sixth editions of the Origin as
well as in other monographs (Darwin 1868, 1871), he proceeded to diminish the role of
natural selection in producing signiﬁcant organismal change. Although in the ﬁrst through
fourth editions of the Origin Darwin had invoked use–disuse arguments as potential
sources of variation, Jenkin’s review provoked him to situate them much more centrally
in his model of evolution. Indeed, in his theory of heredity—pangenesis—Darwin (1868)
went so far as to propose a scenario as to how the effects of use–disuse could be passed
on from an impacted parent to offspring and then to generations beyond. Yet, despite
reducing the importance of natural selection, both in producing variation and in selecting
the most advantageous variations, Darwin remained intellectually mired in the consequences of his assumptions, which included postulating the existence of enormous amounts
of variation as a requisite for organismal change.
For the most part, Darwin perceived the tempo of organismal change as slow, even
ploddingly so. Consequently, although on rare occasion in the Origin as well as in the
Descent Darwin allowed that change might in some cases occur rapidly, he was committed
to the notion that evolutionary change—that is, the origin of new species—was essentially
the process of adaptation protracted over an incredibly long period of time. Whether it
was gradual or rapid, however, Darwin was so convinced that change was the result of a
smoothly continuous process of transformation by means of a string of transitional forms
that he rejected all evidence to the contrary. This included a lack of conﬁrmation from the
fossil record and the fact that in virtually all recorded cases of the establishment of a new
breed of domesticated animal or plant, the progenitor had emerged “per saltum,” with its
novel feature or features fully formed, and was subsequently bred with “normal” mates to
produce more of its kind (Huxley 1860; Mivart 1871).
These observations were not, however, lost on all evolutionists of Darwin’s day. Huxley
(1860) and Mivart (1871) used some of the same examples of the establishment of new
domesticates to which Darwin denied any evolutionary signiﬁcance to argue for the
saltational appearance of novel features and thus of new species. Jenkin (1867) cited
both the sudden appearance in the fossil record of organisms with novel yet fully formed
features and the absence among living forms of transitional forms as evidence against
Darwin’s claim that evolutionary change is smoothly transitional and predominantly

<-----Page 67----->Organismal Innovation

55

gradual. Mivart (1871) reiterated Jenkin’s refutation and additionally proposed that the
emergence of anatomical novelty, and thus of new species, results from a reorganization
that occurs very early in an individual’s development, when all elements of this reorganization achieve a new state of viable equilibrium.
Although Darwin occasionally remarked that selection could not act on a feature unless
it already existed, his perception of evolution as the process of adaptation extended over
vast amounts of time meant that he conﬂated two different processes, namely, the survival
of species (or the persistence of novelty) and the origin of species (or the emergence of
novelty). Nevertheless, the distinction between the two processes did not escape other
evolutionists. Inherent in Mivart’s (1871) and subsequently Bateson’s (1894) developmentally based formulations about the emergence of evolutionary signiﬁcant change was the
recognition that one should dissociate adaptation or the survival of a species from any
process that led to its appearance. Indeed, this distinction between the origin and survival
of species was central to the botanist de Vries’s (1910a, 1910b) theories of mutation and
intracellular pangenesis and subsequently to Morgan’s (1903), Goldschmidt’s (1940), and
Schindewolf’s (1950) criticism and rejection of Darwinism.
In light of the various counterarguments to Darwin’s conception of evolution, one might
reasonably wonder how Darwinism came to be the dominant evolutionary theory of the
later twentieth century. This shift can be traced to the very same Morgan who had initially
been one of Darwin’s harshest critics (Schwartz 1999). It is a curious twist of history that,
after rejecting all biological endeavors with the sole exception of genetics as being relevant
to the study of evolution (Morgan 1910), Morgan went on to establish the ﬁrst fruit-ﬂy
population-genetics laboratory. Experiments initially conﬁgured to demonstrate the
validity of the “chromosome theory,” and consequently to map “genes” on chromosomes,
eventually led Morgan to propose a scenario in which Mendelism—which was seen by
Mendelians as supporting the notion that traits, the individuals that bore them, and the
species these individuals constituted were distinct and discontinuous entities—could be
melded with Darwinism—in which variation was seen as continuous and, although absent
from the fossil record and between extant species, the emergence of novel features and
of new species was a smoothly continuous process of transformation (see the review in
Schwartz 1999).
To his credit, however, in the course of arriving at this presumed epiphany, Morgan
(e.g., 1916) introduced into the discussion of evolution some missing yet important elements: Mutation is random; mutations underlie the variations upon which selection acts;
the basis of any mutation, large or small, is the same; and observations derived from
laboratory experiments on heredity are relevant to understanding these processes in nature
(Schwartz 1999). Nevertheless, Morgan succumbed to his predispositions. For example,
while rightly asserting that if mutation was random, the probability of subsequent mutations’ continuing a course of transformation that was seemingly foreshadowed by the ﬁrst
mutation was like a coin toss—each toss or mutation reset the probability to ﬁfty-ﬁfty—

<-----Page 68----->56

Jeffrey H. Schwartz

Morgan contradicted himself by claiming that a mutation in a certain direction actually
predisposed subsequent mutations to proceed in that direction.
But Morgan went even further. Like Darwin, he ended up embracing as biologically
relevant only a certain kind of observation derived from his fruit-ﬂy breeding colonies.
That is, although he and his coworkers recorded numerous instances of the sudden appearance in one generation of individuals with large-scale morphological changes as well as
individuals with minor changes, and they successfully bred both “kinds” of these individuals with normal or “wild”-type individuals to produce more of the different individuals,
Morgan (e.g., Morgan et al. 1926) declared that the only evolutionary signiﬁcant mutations
were those that produced minor variations.
Morgan’s reason for discarding the evidence of large-scale mutation as provoking
marked morphological change and yet not interfering with reproductive viability was,
however, pure conjecture: Large-scale mutations and their effects would, he declared, be
too disruptive to the biology of organisms to be viable in nature. Consequently, despite
having argued that large- and small-scale mutation derived from the same mechanism, and
that observations in the laboratory reﬂected natural processes, Morgan consciously chose
to disregard a major source of information as having any bearing whatsoever on evolutionary questions (Schwartz 2006a).
Having eliminated large-scale mutation and morphological change from the realm of
biological reality, Morgan could then argue that, although Mendelism was based on a
model of “discrete hereditary units,” the mutational changes and the morphological
changes they provoked were so slight that, in effect, genetic and morphological variations
were continuous. As such, the decades-long intellectual schism between Mendelians and
Darwinians was unnecessary and imaginary, for, in truth, the two “isms” were completely
compatible (Schwartz 1999). In turn, this conﬂation permitted the recentralization of
Darwin’s earlier presumption that the process that leads to what would be considered
evolutionary change is simply the process of adaptation extended over a vast period of
time.
The Synthesis and Its Aftermath
Morgan’s legacy to what became known as the “modern evolutionary synthesis” (Jepsen
et al. 1963) is obvious and in part explains the resistance of its founders to nonselectionist if not also nongradualistic theories of evolutionary change, especially those of
Goldschmidt (1940) and Schindewolf (1950; Schwartz 1999). Indeed, although not initially fully committed to gradualism or selectionist arguments (Dobzhansky 1937), Dobzhansky (1941) subsequently championed both in reaction to Goldschmidt’s (1940) theory
of systemic mutation, which made central the former scholar’s work on chromosomal
rearrangement in a genetically based theory of developmental reorganization that could

<-----Page 69----->Organismal Innovation

57

lead to large-scale—that is, evolutionary—change. With Mayr’s (1942) emphasis on the
population, individual variation within populations due to micromutation, and selection
pressures and the slowly emerging and ever-changing adaptations they induced as the basis
of evolutionary change, a picture of evolution solidiﬁed in which it was impossible to
deﬁne an evolutionary novelty except by reference to the claimed artiﬁce of discontinuity
between closely related taxa, both fossil and living.
Indeed, in his contribution to the Synthesis, Simpson (1944) used the presence of discontinuities, or “gaps,” in the fossil record not as evidence of the abrupt appearance of
novel morphology (and thus of species) but as the basis of his theory of quantum evolution. Given the unlikely event of an individual’s remains becoming fossilized and subsequently persisting in the fossil record, these “gaps” represented periods when a small
number of individuals were rapidly changing as they adapted under different selection
pressures to different ecological niches. Once they made this rapid but smoothly continuous transformation from one ecological zone or plateau to another, however, individuals
of this new species would continue to change, but now slowly and gradually, as they
adapted to the slowly and gradually changing environment around them.
Although a paleontologist and therefore someone who, from Morgan (1910) on, was
essentially deﬁned as being unable to contribute to a discussion on the origin of species,
Simpson (1944) nonetheless attempted to embrace Mayr and Dobzhansky’s emphasis on
populations and the presumed genetics of intrapopulational variation. He even represented
his theory of quantum evolution diagrammatically in a manner similar to the mathematical
population geneticist Sewall Wright’s (e.g., 1931) shifting-balance theory, with organismal change being mediated and expedited by selection as a species traversed from one
adaptive peak through a valley to get to new adaptive peak (see chapter 11, this volume).
When in a review of Simpson’s monograph Wright (1945) took the paleontologist to task
for misunderstanding the genetics underlying his model of the adaptive landscape, Simpson
(e.g., 1953) became more committed to gradualism as the predominant tempo of evolutionary change.
Is Darwinian Evolution Biological?
Given that the 1940s were not too far removed in time from the clash between the ﬁrst
evolutionists and the creationists, it is not surprising to ﬁnd in the writings of the founders
of the Synthesis passages that sought to address the nonscientiﬁc elements of creationism.
However, perhaps more interestingly, as Burkhardt (1977) argued, the founders of the
Synthesis and their scions sought to clean up Darwin and Darwinism by seemingly
expunging use–disuse argumentation from evolutionary discussion. Yet while speciﬁc
reference to the words “use” and “disuse” may have been excised from the language of
twentieth-century Darwinism, the underlying intent remained the same (Schwartz 2005b,

<-----Page 70----->58

Jeffrey H. Schwartz

2008). Indeed, phrases that typify Darwinian arguments, such as “a feature was selected
and evolved in order to . . . . ,” underscore the persistence of use–disuse thinking despite
the fact that, in their quest to sanitize and rewrite the history of Darwin, the neo-Darwinians
purposefully promoted Lamarck as the sole author of the untenable claim that acquired
characteristics can be passed on from one generation to the next (Burkhardt 1977). Witness
the recent assertion that standing upright on branches with locked knees predisposed the
hominid ancestor to bipedalism, for which speciﬁc signal-transduction pathways were
subsequently selected in order to complete the evolutionary deed (Thorpe et al. 2007).
Further, it is important to understand that any formulation—Darwin’s or the
Synthesis’s—of Darwinism relies on a force or forces external to the individual in shaping
the “born” individual and its “born” descendants (Schwartz 2005a). This focus becomes
obvious upon recognizing that in order for use–disuse and selection to play a role in
molding an organism and its features, the individual and its traits must already be formed
to some extent (Schwartz 2008). Even the concept of “sperm competition” (e.g., Birkhead
and Møller 1998), while initially giving the impression of a focus on a preembryonic
phase, makes sense only in the context of an adult (or at least reproductively mature)
individual producing sperm that, if truly the case, “compete” to fertilize an ovum or ova,
themselves the cellular product of a nonembryonic individual.
Equally situated in the “born” or at least somewhat formed individual is the notion of
“selﬁsh genes” (Dawkins 1976), which use the organism they create in order to replicate
and extend their existence into future generations. Inherent in the conception of “selﬁsh
genes,” which derives directly from the focus of population genetics, is the supposed
existence of “genes for” traits. Thus, if a mutation changes a gene slightly, the trait it
underlies will change accordingly. Indeed, beginning with Morgan, because of the emphasis in population genetics on a direct one-to-one relationship between a trait and a gene,
evolutionists such as Williams (1966) could resort to the abstract, in which a gene is
anything that is heritable and, under the direction of selection, can be molded to allow its
bearers to adapt to their surroundings. A gene that confers a slight advantage to its bearer
over its counterpart in another individual will be selected by means of selection acting on
the trait itself.
But is this really how organisms develop and how novel features may arise? It seems
not. True, there are differences, for example, between fruit ﬂies and mice in number of
orthologous homeobox genes that affect segmentation and the spatial positioning of
appendages (Duboule and Dollé 1989). However, abundant evidence now demonstrates
that differences between invertebrates and vertebrates result less from speciﬁc gene differences between diverse taxa than from different manners, in time and space, in which
the same developmental molecules are recruited and subsequently interact to produce
disparately conﬁgured organisms (e.g., Duboule and Dollé 1989; Stern et al. 2006). Consequently, it is not appropriate or even biologically real to think in terms of “genes for”
any particular trait or structure.

<-----Page 71----->Organismal Innovation

59

This is not to say that one cannot identify what may be called genes in metazoans by
way of recognizing start and stop codons. However, in contrast to bacteria, in which there
is a predominant relationship between the linearity of nucleotide sequences and the coding
of metabolically active proteins, in metazoans a “gene” can produce myriad proteins
depending on how introns are alternatively spliced and whether transcription occurs in
“sense,” “nonsense,” or combined “sense–nonsense” directions (Ast 2005).
Of further note regarding multicellular organisms, which subsume plants as well as
metazoans, is the importance of epigenetic events (e.g., maternally induced DNA methylation, the role of RNA in “reintroducing” DNA nucleotide sequences not present in the
P1 generation but present in earlier generations) in inﬂuencing development (Lolle et al.
2005; Rassoulzadegan et al. 2006; Stotz 2006). This clearly muddles any attempt to speak
intelligibly about the reality of “genes for” any trait or behavior (Pearson 2006). In fact,
accumulating evidence on the effect of molecular signaling from potential predators (vertebrates and invertebrates) on the development of size and shape, as well as on mode of
reproduction (asexual or cloning versus reproductive), of the larvae of potential prey (e.g.,
Gilbert 2003; Vaughn and Strathman 2008) blurs further distinction between the organism,
its genotype, and its environment. This realization makes it that much more wonderful, as
Darwin, Huxley, and other Victorian evolutionists often remarked, that like tends to beget
like. But it also helps focus attention on the real aspects of cells and “genes” and returns
the discussion to the necessity of distinguishing between and disentangling notions of
“evolution” and “adaptation” before embarking on a discussion of innovation.
Evolution versus Adaptation
Examples of invertebrate, amphibian, and ﬁsh larvae or embryos changing size, shape,
and even mode of reproduction in response to chemical cues from potential predators in
their “environment” would at ﬁrst glance seem to validate the long-held belief that organismal change is nothing more than a process of adaptation extended across generations of
individuals. After all, are these organisms not “adapting” to their environments?
Indeed, in the latter part of the twentieth century, the notion of an organism’s features
being so potentially malleable (embodied in the phrase “phenotypic plasticity”) that studying and comparing them for purposes of phylogenetic reconstruction was seen as an
exercise in futility (e.g., Gibbs et al. 2000; Sarich 1971) gained such status that it led to
the virtual abandonment of morphologically based systematics and its replacement by an
endeavor that became known as molecular systematics (see review in Schwartz 2005b).
Curiously, and despite the fact that any molecular change that would affect, for example,
protein folding or the efﬁcacy of DNA repair would have enormous consequences for the
integrity and reproducibility of an individual’s development (Schwartz and Maresca 2006),
molecular systematics rested on the assumption that molecular change had absolutely no
effect on the organism, even though it was viewed as an ongoing phenomenon.

<-----Page 72----->60

Jeffrey H. Schwartz

Clearly lost from this conception is the history that preceded it, namely, that initial
hypotheses about the relevance of DNA sequences and gene products of metazoans were
based on bacteria, in which responses to “environmental conditions” appeared to generate
a response in the individual (Jacob and Monod 1959). It is now known, however, that
approximately 98 percent of a bacterium’s genome is coding (encodes metabolically active
proteins; Eisen 2000). In metazoans, it is approximately the reverse. Even in plants such
as rice, the vast majority of the genome is noncoding (Goff et al. 2002). Nevertheless,
once the realization that bacterial genomic change was correlated with adaptive change
(as seen in Jacob and Monod’s [1959] lac operan experiments) was naively applied to
multicellular organisms, the molecular underpinnings of adaptation and thus also of evolution appeared veriﬁed. Consequently, it seemed entirely justiﬁed to refer interchangeably
to changes in bacterial genomes as adaptive as well as evolutionary (Lenski and Travisano
1994) because the two concepts had been historically so conﬂated.
However, is molecular—nucleotide sequence—change in bacteria the same as molecular change in multicellular organisms? It is not. When bacterial nucleotide sequences
change, and not because of lateral transmission, it is because the bacteria are adapting
to their surrounding circumstances. Jacob and Monod’s (1959) early experiments with
lactose-rich versus depauperate environments were a clear demonstration of bacterial
adaptation. But if, as seems true, mutation in nucleotide sequences is random, then in
multicellular organisms such change would have a much higher probability of affecting
promoter and control regions, or introns, than coding regions (Schwartz and Maresca
2006).
Consequently, given that coordination of the interplay between transcription factors and
other regulatory molecules and promoter and control regions is crucial to the development
of a viable organism, were it true that unconstrained mutation affecting nucleotide sequence
did occur, we would expect to see evidence either of rampant extinction or of unbridled
morphological novelty emerging with virtually every generation. Yet, again as Victorian
evolutionists well knew, like tends to beget like.
The skeptic, however, might ask why instances in which the larvae or embryos of
metazoans alter development, and thus adult size and/or shape, in response to chemical or
other stimuli from potential predators are not evidence of evolution. After all, are these
not examples of the emergence of morphological novelty resulting from an adaptive
response to a cue or stimulus in the organism’s environment? At ﬁrst glance, this might
appear to be so. However, these examples are similar to earlier described cases of progenesis in amphibians and Arctic insects. Here, acceleration of sexual maturation in response
to changing environmental conditions truncates normal metamorphosis into somatic adulthood to create larval forms that can reproduce (de Beer 1930; Gould 1977). That is, the
“ability” to adjust to differing environmental conditions—whether by becoming smaller
in size, producing or increasing “armature,” or switching from sexual to asexual reproduction in response to stimuli from predators—while certainly presenting phenotypic plastic-

<-----Page 73----->Organismal Innovation

61

ity and appearing to be adaptive, more accurately reﬂects genomic plasticity. This can
reasonably also include sex determination in various ﬁsh and reptiles in response to temperature or crowding (see the review in Streelman et al. 2007).
Yet, similar to the necessity of a feature’s being present before selection can “act” on
it, the basis of or potential for genomic plasticity (or reactivity, sensu Gilbert 2003) must
already be present in a gamete’s genome for elements of intra- and intercellular signaling
to be affected by external stimuli. That this should be true at least to some extent comes
from observing that larvae or embryos of generations that are not subjected to such external
cues or stressors develop into the typical adult size and/or form (e.g., as in the axolotl [de
Beer 1930; Gould 1977] and Alaskan sticklebacks [Cresko et al. 2004]). Consequently,
these examples of morphological difference from one generation to the next, rather than
being Darwinian in demonstrating either the gradual appearance of structural change or
the synonymy of adaptation and evolution, more reasonably reﬂect these organisms’
sphere of possible adaptation, the molecular basis of which might have itself been the
evolutionary novelty.
The Origin of Organismal Novelty
On the presumption that there is sufﬁcient biological information to pursue a research
program in which processes underlying adaptation are decoupled from those underlying
the origin of novelty, it might seem that cultural “invention” could correspond to biological
innovation (the emergence or origination of organismal novelty) and cultural “innovation”
to biological adaptation. However, before we can explore this potential correspondence,
it is necessary to understand how organismal novelty might arise.
For example, the emergence of multicellular organisms probably resulted from gene
duplication and a massive increase in DNA, followed by the functional divergence of
new genes (see the discussion in Maresca and Schwartz 2006). New morphologies likely
result from the diversiﬁcation and modiﬁcation of regulatory signaling pathways (Gerhart
and Kirschner 1997) as well as from changes in the expression of developmentally regulated genes via mutations affecting promoter regions and/or transcription factors (Grzeschik 2002). Nevertheless, because individuals of the same species are basically similar
and differ from other species because they all possess the feature or features that make
their species distinct, a biological hurdle must be overcome, namely, how to disrupt
DNA homeostasis and tightly constrained developmental signaling pathways mediated
by stress (heat-shock) proteins that act to prevent change from occurring (Maresca and
Schwartz 2006). Given that the only constant physical source of (point) mutation is
ultraviolet radiation, and spontaneous mutation rates are incredibly low (10−8 to 10−9),
one must seek a mechanism that could increase the effective mutation rate (Maresca and
Schwartz 2006).

<-----Page 74----->62

Jeffrey H. Schwartz

First, let us use the term “mutation” in the broadest sense, to refer not only to changes
in DNA sequence, chromosomal arrangement, or gene duplication, but also to changes in,
for example, protein folding, input–output “switches,” “plug-ins,” intron splicing, diffusion of morphogenetic gradients, and timing and location of expression of developmentally
regulated genes. In this context, emphasis shifts from DNA alone to elements that affect
the regulation of development. However, with myriad molecular safeguards, primarily
heat-shock or stress proteins, in the cell to prevent derailment of a particular signaling
pathway and thus of a particular course of development, one way in which the potential
for organismal change can be introduced is to overtax the ability of molecular “housekeepers” to maintain homeostasis (Maresca and Schwartz 2006). Because all organisms
with a heat-shock response can adjust their response “window” to adapt to changes in the
intensity of stressors as long as the stress is not too sudden and intense, a possible provocateur of change would be a stress spike that exceeds the cell’s capacity to produce sufﬁcient heat-shock proteins to perform all the housekeeping duties that would prevent or
weed out the potential for change (Maresca and Schwartz 2006).
Given that different tissues have different heat-shock responses, the potential effects
of a stress spike will be different throughout an individual, as it also will be between
individuals, who would thus not respond molecularly in the same way. Further, whatever
potential for novel regulatory networks a stressor may introduce, the only cells in which
this has potential evolutionary signiﬁcance are the sex cells (Maresca and Schwartz 2006;
Schwartz 1999). Effects on somatic cells die with their bearers. But if each individual can
have a slightly different response to overstress, how do many individuals end up with the
potential for and, if not lethal, the expression of, organismal novelty?
As Bateson (1913) recognized decades ago, most nonlethal mutations must arise in
the recessive (inactive, unexpressed) state because most mutations in the dominant state
are lethal. In the inactive state, a “mutation” can spread silently throughout a population
(Fisher 1930; Haldane 1932; Wright 1932). If the population is small and/or there is a
certain amount of inbreeding, a “mutation” will spread more quickly (Haldane 1932;
Wright 1932). At some point, many individuals will have inherited the “mutation” in its
inactive state, that is, will be heterozygous for it. Perhaps, during this period, the population is again overstressed and other potentials for change in the regulation of development
are introduced. With heterozygote saturation, the likelihood of homozygotes for the “mutation” emerging increases (Schwartz 1999). If the reconﬁgured signaling pathway does not
interfere with the viability of the zygote, embryo, or larva, or a later developmental stage,
multiple individuals with the resultant novelty will emerge. In turn, perhaps abetted by
some form of species mate recognition, the bearers of the novelty will interbreed and
produce more of their kind. Eventually, as we know must occur, the recessive becomes
dominant (active, expressed), and heterozygosity emerges.
An interesting consequence of this model of organismal change is that while the “environment,” in the form of a stressor, is the provocateur of potential change, the impetus for

<-----Page 75----->Organismal Innovation

63

the novelty and thus the novelty itself are divorced from the circumstances in which its
bearers ﬁnd themselves. In other words, the persistence of a novelty is more a function of
its not interfering with the survivability of organisms than it is of the feature’s being
necessary for the survival of the individuals that possess it (Schwartz 1999).
Once a “signiﬁcant” (signiﬁcant being, of course, often mostly in the eye of the
beholder) evolutionary novelty such as the arthropod body plan or the vertebrate toothbearing jaw has been established, modiﬁcation of the signaling pathway underlying it is
commonplace, giving rise to different versions of that particular Bauplan (Hulsey et al.
2006; Ronshaugen et al. 2002). I do not use the term “variation” to mean intraspeciﬁc
or individual variation but rather, as Bateson (1894) used the term, to refer to taxically
relevant difference. That is, whereas the former reﬂects differences in degree of expression or manifestation of a particular morphology, such as larger or smaller appendages
of the same conﬁguration, the latter reﬂects taxonomically distinctive conﬁgurations, or
kinds, of morphologies such as differently conﬁgured or different numbers of appendages
(Schwartz 2006b). Developmentally, there is a hierarchy of instructional information that
spans from gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) that underlie basic body plans to gene
batteries (DGBs) involved in the terminal differentiation of tissues and structures (Davidson and Erwin 2006). In the context of the discussion here, different levels of diversiﬁcation of GRNs would underlie taxic diversity, from the establishment of major clades to
the subclades and species that form them, which would require various alterations of
signaling pathways. The ﬁnal DGBs would provide the between-individual variability
that typiﬁes any species and would result from differential expression of extant signaling
pathways.
Organismal Innovation and Phylogenetic Reconstruction
In terms of phylogenetic reconstruction, the loss of features is cladistically equivalent to
the origination of these features because both phenomena reﬂect deviation from an ancestral or theoretically more primitive condition. For example, the development of ﬁsh with
tooth-bearing jaws is derived relative to the jawless agnathan conﬁguration, but the subsequent loss of pharyngeal teeth in some teleosts would be considered another level of
derivedness because this would be a relatively rare condition among the diversity of
pharyngeally toothed taxa.
However, whereas determination of the phylogenetic valence of derivedness may be
based on relative uniqueness, the developmental context of the emergence of morphological innovation is not equivalent to its subsequent alteration, especially in reduction in or
loss altogether of structure. For example, the origination of limbs with terminal digits
required a tightly constrained Hox gene-regulated signaling pathway (Tarchini et al. 2006),
whereas synpolydactyly can result from mutations in the Hox-D13 gene alone (Muragaki

<-----Page 76----->64

Jeffrey H. Schwartz

et al. 1996). Although in ﬁsh the details of the signaling pathways underlying the formation of pelvic ﬁns, eyes, pigmentation, armor, and teeth are still incompletely known, the
speciﬁc gene or transcription factor whose inactivation or change in expression can cause
the loss of each of these structures has been identiﬁed (Streelman et al. 2007). Consequently, one might be justiﬁed theoretically and for purposes of phylogenetic reconstruction in referring to structural “gain” and “loss” as cladistic equivalents, but developmentally
they are not. Indeed, “gain” clearly lies in the domain of GRNs, whereas “loss” is disruption in an element of a GRN.
Conclusion
From the foregoing it is evident that neither a conception of cultural invention nor one
of cultural innovation can be synonymized with organismal innovation (see chapter 2,
this volume). From a biological perspective, the processes that precede the emergence of
organismal novelty, while initially stochastic and affected by physical properties, must
be integrated or the organism will not survive. Further, if the model of stress as a provocateur of regulatory and thus developmental change is in any way correct, there is no
correlation between the emergent novel feature or structure and the environmental circumstances in which its bearers ﬁnd themselves. In other words, while cultural inventions
often result from necessity, structures do not emerge in order to serve a purpose or function or to solve some evolutionary problem. Simply put, if a novelty does not kill its
bearer, it has it.

Innovation, Replicative Behavior, and Evolvability: Contributions
from Neuroscience and Human Decision-Making Theory
Daniel O. Larson

When faced with having to explain how and why innovations spread, we could adopt any
number of explanatory stances. We could, for example, argue that the choice of adopting
an innovation is tied to an individual’s perception of how that innovation will become
proﬁtable under particular natural and social environmental circumstances. Conversely,
we could argue that consideration of cost and proﬁt is irrelevant and that humans are
predisposed as psychological conformists to copy, imitate, or mimic the behavior of others.
Motivational factors that may inﬂuence replicative behavior include direct rewards such
as increased mating opportunities and the favor of elites (see chapter 7, this volume). I
suggest that cultural rewards coevolved with neurological rewards that stem from the
midbrain, which contains reward-related neural circuitry. In other words, there are both
cultural incentives and neurobiological propensities for individuals to be creative and to
adopt innovations.
I argue that human cognitive processes and brain functions have evolved from a shared
common history of natural selection under varying social and natural pressures. The human
brain is a unique organ that is a by-product of dual-inheritance processes—the interplay
of culture and genes. I suggest that although neuroscience is a relatively new ﬁeld, its
potential to contribute to our understanding of human behavior and evolution is immense.
It is a research domain that is inherently interdisciplinary and is grounded in the pursuit
of empirical data using cutting-edge technologies. Ultimately, I want to understand the
cultural and neurological processes that guide humans to accept or reject innovations. Do
we, in fact, have propensities for conformist and replicative behaviors such as copying,
mimicry, and imitation?
Invention and Innovation
Research associated with novelty, innovation, and acceptance or rejection of alternatives
should involve the study of human decision-making heuristics, but the topic of how
humans make cognitive decisions and take particular actions is a matter of debate (Bowles

<-----Page 82----->70

Daniel O. Larson

2004; Gintis 2000). The prevailing belief is that much of human behavior is the product
of calculated alternatives that optimize one’s economic and biological success. It is presumed that humans are rational in their decision making and that, given a set of alternatives, the one that beneﬁts the individual most will prevail.
Several researchers have challenged this traditional notion from an array of ﬁelds
including economics, psychology, political science, and philosophy (Gintis et al. 2005).
Herbert Simon, a pioneer in the challenge, posed an alternative perspective grounded in
a conceptual framework he called bounded rationality (Simon 1982, 1990, 1996). He
realized that human decision making is always restricted by human cognitive abilities,
incomplete access to information, and environmental constraints, and, as such, rational or
optimal decision making is a false premise. He argued that decision making and problem
solving are not optimal but rather are near-optimal or adequate under the rubric of satisﬁcing. Satisﬁcing models dispense
with the ﬁction of optimization, which in many real-world situations demands unrealistic assumptions about the knowledge, time, attention, and other resources available to humans. Note that dispensing with optimization (as a model cognitive process) does not imply that the outcome of a
nonoptimizing strategy is bad. For instance, optimization is often based upon uncertain assumptions,
which are themselves guesswork, and as a consequence, there may be about as many different
outcomes of optimizing strategies as there are sets of assumptions. In these real-world cases, it is
possible that simple and robust heuristics can match or even outperform a speciﬁc optimizing strategy. (Gigerenzer and Selten 2002: 4)

Models of bounded rationality are still in their developmental phase, although a number
of researchers have enumerated the principles that guide this contemporary view (Callebaut
and Laubichler 2007; Gigerenzer 2000; Gigerenzer and Selten 2002). Perhaps most pertinent
to discussions of innovation are alternative heuristics used in decision making related to
change in technologies and engineering design. Recently, Goldstein et al. (2001) identiﬁed
several heuristics that humans employ in their deliberation of choice, including imitation,
equal weighting, take the best, take the ﬁrst, and small-sample inference. Under each heuristic, individuals are replicating the behavioral characteristics observed within the context
of their speciﬁc social environments.
Clearly, each category is pertinent to the study of human behavior, but for the
spread of innovation, I believe that imitation should ﬁgure most importantly. Imitation
is beneﬁcial because “it is a fast and frugal strategy that saves an organism from
having to extract information from the environment anew, or from calculating from
scratch” (Goldstein et al. 2001: 174). It also maximizes historic efﬁciency and success
of prosperous individuals or groups (Brass and Heyes 2005; Schlag 1998). However,
although imitation is typically a successful strategy, it is not without its limitations.
For example, if physical or social conditions are highly variable, the previously beneﬁcial strategy may become a liability, even deadly, under new conditions (Goldstein
et al. 2001).

Conformist Behavior
Boyd and Richerson (2005; Richerson and Boyd 2005) suggest that through the coevolution of genes and culture we have evolved a predisposition for conformist behaviors. Thus,
evolution preadapted us to living in larger groups and replicative behaviors were reinforced, which led to greater complexity in human relationships and political organization
(Richerson and Boyd 2008). Mimicry, imitation, and copying have strong selective advantages (Henrich and Gil-White 2001), and according to Henrich and McElreath (2003: 126),
“when information is costly, natural selection will favor cognitive mechanisms that allow
individuals to extract adaptive information, strategies, practices, heuristics and beliefs
from other members of their social group at a lower cost than through alternative individual
mechanisms.”
Richerson and Boyd (2005) discuss a list of cultural evolutionary forces that they posit
have had a strong inﬂuence on the spread of innovations throughout prehistory and history.
Random forces include cultural mutation and cultural drift, and decision-making forces
(nonrandom forces) include guided variation, direct- and indirect-bias transmission, and
frequency-dependent transmission. Guided variation involves individual trial-and-error
learning and the selective retention of behaviors found to be successful. Direct-bias transmission is the copying, imitation, or mimicry of preexisting behaviors considered successful. Indirect-bias transmission refers to the selective copying, imitation, and mimicry of
behaviors of individuals considered to have prestige or other characteristics that an individual emulates regardless of that behavior’s cost and success. Frequency-dependent
transmission refers to replicative behaviors that are chosen because of their commonness
or rarity without consideration of cost or success.
Boyd and Richerson (1985, 2005) and colleagues (e.g., McElreath and Boyd 2007) have
developed mathematical models of how such behavior would become ﬁxed in the human
evolutionary trajectory. As they and others (e.g., Henrich et al. 2004, 2006; chapter 7, this
volume) have shown, the theory and mathematical modeling of conformist and replicative
behaviors have a strong ethnographic empirical referent. My objective below is to present
a research framework that incorporates evolutionary theory and techniques grounded
in the neurosciences that will hopefully complement previous work on replicative
behavior.
Theoretical Framework
Principles derived from bounded rationality and dual-inheritance theory predict that replicative behavior of technologies, labor structures, and communication strategies will
explain the spread of many innovations evidenced by the archaeological record in multiple
regions throughout the world (O’Brien 2008; various chapters in this volume). Indeed,
scholars argue that our evolution as a species involved cognitive mechanisms that enhance

<-----Page 84----->72

Daniel O. Larson

our ability to learn and copy conspeciﬁcs. Language was the ultimate tool used for copying
(Nowak 2006). The ability to mimic parents begins at the earliest developmental stages,
and this infantile propensity is evidence for our evolved cognitive structures and associated
phenotypic plasticity (Cacioppo et al. 2006; Falck-Ytter et al. 2006; Gergely and Csibra
2005; Gergely et al. 2002).
What rules govern the cognitive selection process under conditions of multiple goals?
I presume that human decision-making processes are grounded in the idea that “human
rational behavior . . . is shaped by a scissors whose two blades are the structure of task
environments and the computational capabilities of the actor” (Simon 1990: 7). Simon,
among others, stresses that human decision making can be understood only from an interdisciplinary perspective and that human decision making is linked in multifaceted ways
to evolutionary developments in human neural cognition, biochemical process, and evolutionary history. I argue here that decision-making heuristics—including imitation,
copying, and mimicry—are all evolved forms of conformist and replicative behaviors that
have, on average, outperformed other cognitive and behavioral strategies.
Recent mathematical models of Hauert et al. (2007) support the argument that humans
have a propensity for conformist and replicative behaviors as a result of natural selection
and complex evolutional processes at the group level. An opportunity now exists to couple
bounded rationality, dual-inheritance theory, and human decision-making theory with the
theoretical perspectives and advanced methods of neuroscience—a relatively young ﬁeld
that examines brain anatomy, biochemistry, molecular neurology, neurogenetics, and
human behavior, including cognitive functions and emotions (Kandel and Squire 2000;
Kandel et al. 2000). An important unifying principle of neuroscience is acknowledgment
that the human brain is an evolved organ that has been subject to both natural and cultural
selective pressures.
Recent advances in the neurosciences are attributable in part to the development of new
technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging. Real-time neurological processes can be visualized and measured with great accuracy, providing a basis for decoding
how the brain functions, formulates memory, and experiences emotion (e.g., Cabeza and
Kingstone 2001; Kandel et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2006, 2007). Rather than presupposing how
the brain, mind, and cognition work, neuroscience produces observable, measurable evidence. For example, Fedulov and colleagues (e.g., Fedulov et al. 2007; Lin et al. 2007)
focused on neurological processes associated with how we learn and store memories. This
work has signiﬁcant implications for evolutionary anthropology in that it sheds light on
the neurological manner in which we learn our culture, create novelty, decide to accept
or reject innovations, and store information for future recall. It turns out that, neurologically, there are bits of information that are stored by synapses in the brain by neuron-toneuron connectivity, referred to as long-term potentiation. Clear instrumentally derived
evidence shows both a synaptic growth and a reshaping associated with learning and
memory acquisition (see also Costa-Mattioli et al. 2005).

<-----Page 85----->Innovation, Replicative Behavior, and Evolvability

73

One question raised by some of this work is whether we have identiﬁed memes or meme
complexes (Aunger 2000; Dawkins 1999). Molecular studies of the constituents of the
growth material will be important for future research. It is too early to conﬁrm or reject
the possibility of the presence of meme structure or some other, as-yet-to-be-named,
memory property (more likely), but it is evident that mapping coded neurological properties or systems–networks–modules may be on the horizon (Kandel et al. 2000).
Indeed, neurological experiments demonstrate that the potential now exists to allow the
generation of binary memory-coded structures of speciﬁc kinds of experiences. Experiments by Lin et al. (2007) have yielded 99 percent accuracy in predicting three types of
trauma experienced by mice under prior laboratory conditions. The limited scope of this
chapter precludes a detailed description of this research, but several important conclusions
are pertinent to our consideration of human propensity for innovation, novelty, and probability reasoning:
1. The idea that the mammalian brain forms neural networks or modules seems to have
empirical support, including abstract, general information and speciﬁc experience structures dubbed neural cliques. It would appear that the brain reﬂects a hierarchical structure
that maximizes use of information and possible variability of alternative behaviors.
2. Information “is coded in a manner similar to the way that the four letters or nucleotides
that make up DNA molecules can be combined in a virtually unlimited number of patterns
to produce the seemingly inﬁnite variety of organisms on earth” (Tsien 2007: 58; see also
Gilbert 1996).
3. These structures provide the basis for perception, knowledge, and subsequent
behavior.
4. Experiments are supported by laboratory instruments that deliver reliable measurements, produce mathematically described neurological data, and allow directly visualized
neurological processes.
5. Perhaps most important to anthropologists, neural cliques, or brain codes, are not inheritable but are acquired only through experiences, unlike genetically inherited codes for
breathing, heartbeat, control of thermal physiology, and other reﬂexes. Lin et al. (2006: 55)
put it this way: “genetic codes act as predetermined scaffolds for behavior, providing blueprints for the development and basic functionality of the organism; brain codes are dynamic
and self-organizing, arising out of internal structures and connectivity of neural networks
upon behavioral experiences.” This leads me to conclude that humans are structurally
designed by natural selection for culture, including related propensities to replicate behaviors of conspeciﬁcs. These inferences, coupled with epigenetic studies (e.g., Müller and
Newman 2003), hold promise for explaining human cognitive evolution and function.
Neurological research associated with education and learning has increased dramatically
over the last decade and is intellectually rich concerning cognitive factors that generate

<-----Page 86----->74

novelty and control human decision making (Kandel et al. 2000; chapter 11, this volume).
I include here studies of patients with damaged brains who experience a ﬂuorescence of
creativity and extraordinary memory capabilities; patients who lose all capability for creativity and remembering; people with extremely high scores on intelligence tests who
exhibit only limited creative ability; and savants who excel in creative abilities and
memory demonstrations (Dowling 2004; Ramachandran 2004).
Neuroscientiﬁc Evidence of Conformist and Replicative Behaviors
Combining neurosciences with well-designed psychological experiments has recently generated extraordinary results. In fact, scientists have detected neuroanatomical, neurobiological, and behavioral mechanisms that drive attitudes of conformity and replicative
behavioral tendencies. Experiments in neuroeconomics and neuroimaging research have
revealed speciﬁc mechanisms that control cognitive processes associated with how people
construct and transmit cultural information regarding replicative and normative behavior.
The lesson learned from this research is that any study of human decision making must
take into account both cultural and neurological factors and propensities.
Copying, imitation, mimicry, and related neurological processes of cooperation may
well relate to evolutionary events embedded in our primate lineage. Recent work with
mirror neurons in monkeys suggests there is a neurological basis for recognizing what
actions might be taken by another individual—the concept of mind reading (Dehaene
et al. 2005; Johnson-Frey et al. 2005; Stamenov and Gallese 2002; Umiltà et al. 2001).
Furthermore, human infants show strong propensities for mimicking behavior of a parent
or siblings at a very early age (6 to 10 months). Cognitive–psychological and neurological
research demonstrates that children in their very early developmental stages process information and store memory for appropriate and inappropriate behaviors—what anthropologists term “cultural norms.” Toddlers are willing to accept rules and guidelines as a part
of their growing value structure. In effect, displays of normative and replicative behaviors
reﬂect past actions that were copied, mimicked, or imitated and subsequently rewarded.
Interestingly, there is also a strong propensity in children to punish norm violators.
The neurosciences have produced evidence that human propensities for conformist and
replicative behaviors are reinforced by both cultural and neurological–biochemical reward
systems. Speciﬁcally, Fehr and colleagues (Fehr et al. 2005; Kosfeld et al. 2005) demonstrated that neurological structures, biological chemistry, economic decision making, and
human behavior are strongly linked. They argue that humans establish social norms and
that violators of such norms risk the revenge of a community of reciprocators. This connectivity is evident in situations of experimental games involving prosocial and antisocial
behaviors (Singer and Fehr 2005), which provide a basis for understanding replicative
behavior and related brain activities and neurochemical processes. Speciﬁcally, players

<-----Page 87----->Innovation, Replicative Behavior, and Evolvability

75

who detect replicative fair behaviors from other game participants experience both neurological (activation in the dorsal striatum) and neurochemical rewards (Delgado et al.
2003; Kosfeld et al. 2005). Particularly interesting is the evidence of a positive relationship
between the neuropeptide oxytocin and human trusting and trustworthy behavior. I posit
that oxytocin is the hormone that induces both cooperative and replicative behaviors (see
Zak 2008).
De Quervain et al. (2004) found that under conditions of experimental games, humans
have a strong predisposition to seek revenge when a social cheater has victimized them.
The emotional dynamic (schadenfreude) expressed by their human subjects was captured
using neuroimaging equipment at a point in the game when a player’s opponent would
elect to not reciprocate and/or to defect. De Quervain and colleagues found that the striatum increased its consumption of oxygen, which evidences the activation of neural networks (see also de Quervain and Papassotiropoulos 2006; Singer et al. 2006). The striatum
becomes charged under pleasurable conditions, and thus there is a neurological reward to
individuals when they personally punish norm violators (Sanfey et al. 2003). Rules for
“fair play,” or norms, clearly incorporate expectations that each player will reciprocate or
replicate behaviors of other fair players. Natural selection must have favored both cultural
and neurobiological mechanisms which reinforced and rewarded individuals who replicated the behaviors of conspeciﬁcs. I argue that replicative behaviors, in effect, contributed
to the avoidance of norm violations with family and extended family members. Furthermore, I believe this neurological propensity is rooted in our cognitive structures associated
with adaptive child and parent relationships.
Importantly, neuroeconomics has successfully demonstrated that preferences in economic decisions are not self-regarding, which supports alternative arguments presented by
proponents of bounded rationality and gene-culture coevolution over mainstream economic theory (Fehr et al. 2005; Sanfey et al. 2003). Fehr et al. (2005) provide evidence
that humans care about fairness, equity, and reciprocity as well as their own self-interest.
This is an evolved component and an important part of our phenotypic plasticity.
Finally, I argue that the above-referenced studies offer indisputable neurological and
biochemical evidence to support the arguments of Hauert et al. (2007) regarding the evolutionary beneﬁts of conformist and replicative behaviors. Evolution would favor those
societies that cooperated in a manner that beneﬁted the group as a whole. If a group
accepted the practice of punishing norm violators, and if individuals voluntarily commit
to following group-sanctioned rules, then cooperative behavior emerges and cheaters are
eliminated or greatly reduced. Group membership is in part deﬁned by characteristics that
are shared by a majority of the members who copy, mimic, and imitate normative behavior.
Hauert et al. (2007: 1907) advance the following proposition: “Once established, group
selection, conformism, and reputation effects may maintain prosocial norms and promote
their spreading. Eventually, institutions for punishing free-riders may arise, or genetic
predispositions to punish dissidents.”

The theoretical arguments and mathematical modeling discussed in this section support
Nowak’s (2006) claim that numbers and behavioral experiments can generate clarity and
beauty of scientiﬁc thought. Neurological evidence for “hardwired” propensities of conformists and replicative behavior is, in my mind, compelling, but I would also opine that
an individual’s expressed behavior is mediated by both epigenetic and cultural factors that
are historical (life experiences and culture histories) and individualistic.
Conclusions
Neuroscience research related to human propensities for replicating behaviors of conspeciﬁcs, coupled with theoretical and mathematical arguments, will go a long way toward
explaining the spread of innovations in technology, labor organization, language, and a
host of other behavioral characteristics evidenced archaeologically and ethnographically.
An evolutionary process such as the one I have argued for here and elsewhere (Larson
2005) is compatible with complex evolutionary dynamics (Nowak 2006), cognitive evolutionary theory (Heyes and Huber 2000), and processes associated with phenotypic
plasticity and the evolution of human behavior (Müller and Newman 2003).
I would be the ﬁrst to concede that progress in the scientiﬁc explanation of human
evolution and cultural change remains rudimentary. I would assert, however, that archaeologists and anthropologists, especially those new to the ﬁeld, should be skeptical of those
who claim evolutionary theory is useful only as a “metaphor” or “just so story” in the
social sciences (e.g., Bamforth 2002; see chapter 2, this volume).
Progress in the neurosciences and advances in numerous kinds of biochemical and
neuroimaging instrumentation offer unprecedented opportunities to observe human subjects at various levels of investigation (e.g., neurologically, biochemically, behaviorally)
when subjected to laboratory and ﬁeld experiments such as fairness games. If we as
anthropologists and archaeologists elect to employ the powers of modern science in the
study of human behavior, we need to restructure and reinvent our research approach to
incorporate theoretical and methodological advances in evolutionary theory, experimental
psychology, and the neurosciences. Using the methods of neuroimaging in archaeological
research associated with technology is not new, but the theoretical and methodological
approaches that I advocate here may be somewhat novel.
How can we further demonstrate scientiﬁcally that humans have a neurological propensity for replicative behavior, including copying, imitating, and mimicry? An appropriate
strategy may be similar to that of neuroscientiﬁc research conducted to detect normative
behavior and propensity for conformism. Under well-designed experimental conditions,
we could give individuals and select groups opportunities to accept or reject innovations
in technology, new ways of organizing labor, linguistic expression, or a host of other
behaviors. This would entail the creation of various experiments, including psychological

<-----Page 89----->Innovation, Replicative Behavior, and Evolvability

tests not unlike the work of Mesoudi (2007a, 2007b, 2008; chapter 11, this volume),
Mesoudi and O’Brien (2008a, 2008b, 2008c), and Henrich et al. (2006).
During the process of interviews or laboratory experiments associated with acts of
copying, mimicry, and imitation, brain scans and other types of neurological imaging
(when possible) could be conducted to locate the cerebral regions that are activated under
such experimental conditions. I predict that areas associated with both emotions and probability reasoning (the midbrain, striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and prefrontal cortex) will
signal strong neurological activity associated with human decisions to either accept or
reject innovations. When individuals are experimentally placed in competing cooperative
groups, replicating behavioral experiments should reveal strong evidence for copying
conspeciﬁcs rather than members in other groups. These behavioral and emotional tendencies and related cognitive processes should be detectable using both experimental neurological imaging and biochemical testing (e.g., for oxytocin levels).
In the future, I believe psychological experiments and advances in the neurosciences
will be invaluable to research associated with innovation and human decision-making
processes. I expect that future scholars will generate indisputable evidence for both the
ultimate and proximate causes behind the spread of technologies and other cultural characteristics. Should this proposal be accused of the scientiﬁcation of human culture, then
so be it.

Innovation from EvoDevo to Human Culture
Werner Callebaut

Most chapters in this volume deal with innovation as an empirical or theoretical topic in
evolutionary anthropology or in studies of cultural inheritance in general. However, innovation also features prominently in other social sciences, in particular economics and
science and technology (policy) studies—so much so that some researchers have recently
tried to ﬁnd out “to what extent [there] now exists a uniﬁed community of innovation
scholars [who] identify themselves with innovation studies as a ﬁeld rather than particular
sub-ﬁelds within other, more traditional disciplines” (Fagerberg and Verspagen 2006: 1).
Moreover, the origin of evolutionary innovations, a problem in comparative evolutionary
embryology (Love 2003), is a hot area in evolutionary developmental biology (EvoDevo),
which contributes to our understanding of evolution by focusing on the contributions of
development to the origin of phenotypic novelties (Müller 2007; Müller and Newman
2005).
The three scientiﬁc communities loosely referred to here1—anthropologists, economists,
and biologists with an interest in innovation—have barely interacted hitherto, but awareness that their closer interaction could beneﬁt all parties involved is growing (Erwin and
Krakauer 2004). This chapter aims to modestly contribute to the long-term project of a
general theory of innovation in a rather indirect way, through a comparative analysis of
the reasons for the neglect throughout much of the twentieth century of innovation and
novelty in diverse ﬁelds and through a reﬂection on the various ways in which this bias
is being overcome. I do not consider innovation in anthropology per se, which is covered
elsewhere in this volume, but will focus on three cases that, at least prima facie, are completely disparate: the synthetic theory in evolutionary biology, neoclassical economics,
and logical-empiricist philosophy of science. My view is that an adequate understanding
of cultural evolution, human or animal, requires us to seriously take into account ontogeny
and that, more generally, EvoDevo offers some resources that may help us correct the
selectionist and adaptationist biases that characterize not only much of evolutionary psychology (Richardson 2007) but also much, if not most, work in animal-behavior studies
(Callebaut 2007; see also Grifﬁths 2007; Wimsatt 2006; Wimsatt and Griesemer 2007).

Werner Callebaut

Toward a General Theory of Innovation?
Reporting on a workshop on Innovation in Natural, Experimental and Applied Evolution held at the Santa Fe Institute in 2004, Erwin and Krakauer (2004: 1119) suggested
going beyond occasional reciprocal exchanges of “principles” between researchers
working on biological and technological innovation and called for “a general theory of
innovation within which to organize existing case studies and models.” They went on
to suggest that a theory uniting biology with technology would require “some new
combination of the dynamics of development (or construction more generally) and
selection” and probably also “nontraditional models of computation coupled to a better
understanding of the complex feedback present between individuals and their environments” (p. 1119).
Regarding dynamics, evolution can be regarded as the exploration of morphospace by
populations (Mitteröcker and Huttegger 2009). State space typically is represented as a
conﬁguration space with concepts of neighborhood and distance deﬁned by variable operators such as mutation and/or recombination. However, not all variation-generating processes induce well-deﬁned topological structures. Shpak and Wagner (2000: 41) suspect
that “notions of proximity and distance are not deﬁned for a process of unequal crossover,”
an example of innovation in which the number of elements can change as a result of the
action of an operator, thus leading to more or fewer copies of the gene. Unequal crossover
“deﬁnes a directionality to evolution which is independent of selection.” Other innovation
processes may likewise lead to unconventional topologies.2
Regarding the feedback between individual and environment, two obvious avenues to
explore are biological niche construction (Odling-Smee et al. 2003) and its economic and
cultural equivalents (e.g., Anderson 1991) and the hierarchical organization of life, which
implies the breakdown of the traditional equation of selection as a causal process and
sorting, the differential birth and death among varying organisms within a population.
Sorting can arise from selection at the focal level itself and as a consequence either of
downward causation from processes acting on individuals at higher levels or upward
causation from lower levels (Vrba and Gould 1986).
The call for the Altenberg Workshop on Innovation in Cultural Systems: Contributions
from Evolutionary Anthropology (2007), which produced the present volume, echoed
Erwin and Krakauer’s reference to economist Joseph Schumpeter’s (1934) celebrated
distinction between invention—the creation and establishment of something new—and
innovation—an invention that becomes economically successful and earns proﬁts. This
distinction, in turn, resonates with the one commonly made in evolutionary biology
between the sources of genetic and phenotypic variability among organisms and the factors
leading to the ﬁxation of a favored variant within a population (e.g., Müller and Newman
2005). Both distinctions highlight “the elusive nature of innovation with its connotation
of inﬂuence and success” (Erwin and Krakauer 2004: 1117). A positive bias (Kimberly
1981) thus pervades the study of human-made innovations, including scientiﬁc

<-----Page 95----->Innovation from EvoDevo to Human Culture

83

discoveries. Innovation is typically viewed as a “good thing” because the new idea must
be useful—proﬁtable, constructive, solving a problem that is perceived as such. (A new
idea that is not perceived as useful is usually called a “mistake.”) Likewise, in-depth
appraisals of the role of the entrepreneur are rare, and gloriﬁcation is usual (Evans 1949).
Is a general theory of innovation as called for by Erwin and Krakauer (2004) desirable,
and if so, is it in the cards? We will ﬁnd out only by trying to develop it! My strategy in
this chapter is to probe the solidity of various attempts to “evolutionize” the social sciences
in the last three decades or so and to compare them with some of the recent developments
in developmental and evolutionary biology that culminated in the advent of EvoDevo. I
include the philosophy of science in this enterprise because I am convinced that a consistently “naturalized” philosophy (Callebaut 1993; Giere 1988), of which evolutionary
epistemology is an integral part (Callebaut and Pinxten 1987; Callebaut and Stotz 1998;
Hull 1988), must crucially include economic, psychological, sociological, and other socialscientiﬁc considerations in addition to being thoroughly informed by the history of science
and other human cognitive enterprises. For our purposes here, “naturalism” can be deﬁned
as the view that “theories come to be accepted (or not) through a natural process involving
both individual judgment and social interaction,” without any appeal to supposed rational
principles of theory choice (“rationalism”; Giere 1988: 7). Evolutionary epistemology thus
becomes a chapter in the study of cultural evolution (Hull 1988). Innovation as understood
in these various ﬁelds will be the test case for my probing.
A Comparative Case Study
A comparison of innovation as understood in biology, economics, and philosophy may
seem far-fetched, but it seems to me to make perfect sense if we take into account the
rather advanced state of the art in evolutionary modeling and theorizing in various ﬁelds
and the impressive cross-fertilization between ﬁelds that is currently taking place (Boschma
and Frenken 2005; Carrier 2005; Frey and Stutzer 2007; Martens 2004). Speciﬁcally,
Mesoudi et al.’s (2006) attempt to create a uniﬁed science of cultural evolution by “outlining the methods and approaches employed by the principal subdisciplines of evolutionary
biology and assessing whether there is an existing or potential corresponding approach to
the study of cultural evolution” (p. 329) can be a methodological anchoring point for my
endeavor. As they point out,
Existing approaches within anthropology and archaeology demonstrate a good match with the
macroevolutionary methods of systematics, paleobiology, and biogeography, whereas mathematical models derived from population genetics have been successfully developed to study cultural
microevolution. Much potential exists for experimental simulations and ﬁeld studies of cultural
microevolution, where there are opportunities to borrow further methods and hypotheses from
biology. Potential also exists for the cultural equivalent of molecular genetics in “social cognitive neuroscience,” although many fundamental issues have yet to be resolved. (Mesoudi et al.
2006: 329)

<-----Page 96----->84

Werner Callebaut

The organismic systems approach proposed by Callebaut et al. (2007) as a framework
for extending Modern Synthesis evolutionary theory (see also Müller 2007) differs from
Mesoudi et al.’s proposal mainly in that it puts more emphasis on epigenetic issues—a
need that Mesoudi and O’Brien (2008: 63) recognize when they describe several parallels
between the hierarchically structured, “recipe-like organization of behavioral knowledge”
and the manner in which biological organisms develop. As a philosophical naturalist, I
also want to be more critical when it comes to embracing game-theoretical modeling tools,
which may smack of aprioristic rationalism (Callebaut 2007). I am also more impressed
than Mesoudi et al. (2006) seem to be by arguments to the effect that there is a profound
functional discontinuity between human and nonhuman minds and cultures that results
from our unique capability to symbolize (Penn et al. 2007) and from different mechanisms
of cultural propagation (Sperber and Claidière 2006). However, these differences need not
further concern us here.
Evolutionary Biology
In biology, where, contrary to the social sciences, it has long been accepted that “nothing
makes sense except in the light of evolution” (Dobzhansky 1970: 5–6), there is a growing
consensus that origination, in the sense of the ﬁrst formation of biological structures
(Newman and Müller 2005), and innovation, the evolutionary modes and mechanisms
underlying novelty generation (Müller 2002, 2003), are underrepresented in the standard
theory with its focus on variation and adaptation (Müller and Newman 2005). This neglect
is a consequence of the “black-boxing” of development in the Modern Synthesis. Whereas
the initiating causes of innovation, acting at the population level, are held to be unspeciﬁc,
the conditions for the physical realization of speciﬁc novelties must be sought in development. EvoDevo points the way to a balanced integration of the “innovation triad” of origination, innovation, and novelty (Müller and Newman 2005), as well as related topics such
as homology, phenotypic plasticity, and modularity, into an extended synthesis (Callebaut
et al. 2007).
Neoclassical Economics
In economics, Schumpeter’s (1934) innovating entrepreneur has long been recognized as
“the apex of the hierarchy that determines the behavior of the ﬁrm and thereby bears a
heavy responsibility for the vitality of the free enterprise society” (Baumol 1968: 64). And
yet neoclassical economics, which continues to dominate the ﬁeld despite increasing
discontent, has failed for more than a century to develop an adequate formal analysis
of entrepreneurship and innovation and of technical and institutional change (Freeman
1988, 1991). In recent decades, evolutionary economics (e.g., Dopfer 2005; Hodgson
1993a; Nelson and Winter 1982; Witt 2003) and the new institutional economics
(e.g., Brette 2006) have set out to correct this bias by viewing economic change (as the

<-----Page 97----->Innovation from EvoDevo to Human Culture

85

classical “political economists” did) as just one aspect of the general question of evolution
and understanding economies in evolutionary terms rather than those of traditional equilibrium assumptions.
Philosophy of Science
In line with the older antipsychologism of Frege and Wittgenstein, which remains inﬂuential to this day (Kitcher 1992), philosophers of science in the 1930s aligned to exclude
the context of discovery from philosophical scrutiny. Their “logic of science” now focused
exclusively on the so-called rational reconstruction of the context of justiﬁcation—a move
that made Popper (1959) deny the very existence of the subject matter that the title of his
publication The Logic of Scientiﬁc Discovery announced (Simon 1977). As a result, with
few exceptions, discovery and invention were relegated to investigation by cognitive
psychologists, artiﬁcial intelligencers, and historians and sociologists of science and technology (e.g., Brannigan 1981; Cozzens 1989; Gorman et al. 2005; Merton 1973; Mulkay
1972)—so much so that when Thomas Nickles, the editor of a double volume on scientiﬁc
discovery, proudly announced in his introductory essay that his collection “open[ed] up a
new period in philosophy of science, one in which discovery, innovation, and problem
solving will take their places as a legitimate area of study” (Nickles 1980: 2), he had to
admit that “philosophers of science themselves are just now ﬁnding their sea legs in the
hitherto unnavigable waters of scientiﬁc discovery” (p. 1).
The Long-Term Neglect of Innovation: Three Different Etiologies
We can now examine three areas in which long-term neglect of innovation has been the
rule rather than the exception. The contextual speciﬁcs of the neglect differ, but the intellectual parallels are informative.
Evolutionary Biology and the Hardening of the Modern Synthesis
Complaints about the long-term neglect of the emergence of evolutionary novelties have
frequently been voiced in evolutionary biology, beginning with Mayr, whose authority is
invoked by EvoDevo proponents (e.g., Love 2003) as well as by behavioral biologists.
Reader (2003) and Reader and Laland (2003; see also Ramsey et al. 2007) deal with the
sources of new learned variations, the mechanisms underlying their generation, and the
evolutionary effects newly generated variations may have on animal behavioral development and evolution. They regret that although as a component of behavioral ﬂexibility
animal innovation is important to the survival of many animals, animal innovation has
been neglected by behavioral biologists, psychologists, social learning researchers, and
conservation-minded biologists. Müller (2002), noting that the issue of innovation gains
importance as the incongruences between molecular evolution and higher levels of

<-----Page 98----->86

Werner Callebaut

organismal organization become more evident, suggests that innovation may have been
given less attention than variation because the latter is much more frequent. Yet “innovations and novelties are found at all levels of organization and are fundamental for the
process of phenotypic evolution” (Müller 2002: 829).
The root of this disregard is, in Gould’s (1983) apt expression, the “hardening” of the
Modern Synthesis, which did not lead to a literal “expulsion” of development (as well as
of anthropology, ecology, and other ﬁelds) but rather to their “black-boxing,” concomitant
with an increasing fascination with population genetics (Smocovitis 1996). Population
genetics still rules today. And yet,
It is not within the problematic of population geneticists to discover the basic biological phenomena
that govern evolutionary change, as it was for nuclear physics to discover universal forces between
nuclear particles. The basic phenomena are already provided to population genetics by biological
discoveries in classical and molecular genetics, cell biology, developmental biology, and ecology.
Nor is it within the problematic of observational population genetics to discover the ways in which
the operation of these causal phenomena can interact to produce effects. The elucidation of the
structure of the network of causal pathways, and of the relation between the magnitudes of these
elementary forces and their effects on evolution, is an entirely analytic problem. (Lewontin 2000:
193–194)

Such was the power of the genecentric perspective of the Modern Synthesis that it
allowed one to gloss over the innovation problem by tacitly assuming that genes, acting
in linear fashion, were the sole variable determinants of structure: “It was sufﬁcient to
focus on the dynamics of alleles in populations, assuming the prior existence of the phenotypic entities to which they correspond. No feedback between genes, gene products, the
material properties of developmental systems and their environments was taken into
account” (Müller 2008: 18). And yet, the capacities for the emergence of evolutionary
novelty lie precisely in these interactions (Müller 2007; Müller and Newman 2005).
The late 1970s and early 1980s witnessed an increasing awareness of explanatory deﬁcits in the prevailing paradigm. If neo-Darwinism seemed to work well for the populationgenetic phenomena on which it concentrated, concern accumulated about its difﬁculty in
accounting for characteristics of phenotypic evolution such as biased variation, rapid
changes of form, the occurrence of nonadaptive traits, and the origination of higher level
phenotypic organization such as homology and body plans (see Love [2003] and Müller
[2008] and references therein). Most of the criticisms attributed the explanatory deﬁcits
of neo-Darwinism to its neglect of the generative processes that relate genotype to phenotype and to the exclusion of developmental theory from the evolutionary synthesis (Callebaut et al. 2007; Müller 2008).
Today, progress toward a general theory of invention and innovation is hindered
by semantic inﬂation (“‘innovation’ and ‘novelty’ are two of the most overused and
misunderstood words in evolutionary biology” [Erwin and Krakauer 2004: 1117]),

<-----Page 99----->Innovation from EvoDevo to Human Culture

problems of scale (e.g., mutations in homeobox genes and associated morphological
changes that excite the epigeneticist may be dismissed as unimportant by, say, paleobiologists interested in larger-scale change), and the conﬂation of “invention as origin and ﬁxation and innovation as consequence and success” (Erwin and Krakauer 2004: 1118).
Neoclassical Economics: “It’s Exogenous, Stupid!”
Whereas classical political economists such as Smith, Ricardo, Mill, and Marx considered
technological and institutional change (as well as demographical and other factors) as an
integral part of their general theories of economic growth, they were expunged by the
so-called fathers of the Marginalist Revolution of 1870–1874 (Walras in Switzerland,
Jevons in Great Britain, and Menger in Austria). The Marginalist Revolution is often cited
as a classic example of the phenomenon of multiple discovery (Lamb and Easton 1984;
but see Ekelund and Hébert 2002).
The work of Schumpeter, the so-called father of innovation studies, must be placed and
appreciated against the background of this tradition and, to a lesser extent, the classical
tradition (Seligman 1971). For Schumpeter (1934), the root problem of any economic
system is the attainment and maintenance of equilibrium. In his original model, economic
activity was simply repetitive, so that the theory described a kind of circular ﬂow. Into this
model was injected a new production function—a new relation between input and output.
This was generally realized by an innovator who was searching for greater proﬁt than was
available through normal channels. Schumpeter’s deﬁnition of innovation included the
introduction of a new good—one with which consumers are not yet familiar—or a new
quality of a good and of a new method of production, which needs by no means be founded
upon a “scientiﬁcally” new discovery but can also exist in a new way of handling a commodity commercially. His deﬁnition also comprised the opening up of a new market into
which the particular branch of manufacture of the country in question has not previously
entered, whether or not this market has existed before (niche construction); the conquest
of a new source of supply of raw materials or half-manufactured goods, again irrespective
of whether this source already existed or has to be created ﬁrst; and carrying out the new
organization of any industry, such as creating a monopoly position.
Schumpeter’s linking of organizational, managerial, and social innovations with technical innovations has been rightly called revolutionary. However, for a contemporary understanding of (economic) innovation, “Schumpeter is not enough” (Freeman 1988; see also
Fagerberg 2004): He paid little attention to the periphery of the world economy (what we
have come to refer to as the “Third World”); he did not extend his analysis to international
trade and the international diffusion of technology; he never formalized his models; and
he compromised, we might say with hindsight, in that he had to reconcile his view of
innovation, economic dynamism, and partial monopolistic appropriation of technological
advances with his other view that equilibrium should still be deﬁned in Walrasian terms.

<-----Page 100----->88

Ubiquitous references to Schumpeter notwithstanding, a gulf has long separated his
work from the neoclassical view. Freeman (1988) recalled that when Jewkes et al. (1958)
wrote The Sources of Invention, they suggested three reasons for the general neglect of
technical change by the economics profession: Economists were generally ignorant of
science and technology and felt unprepared to venture into this unknown territory, they
had few statistics at their disposal to guide them, and ever since the Great Depression of
the 1930s they had been preoccupied mainly with cyclical ﬂuctuations in the economy
and the unemployment associated with them. The third explanation is particularly revealing: For Schumpeter, as for us, technical innovation is not a separate phenomenon but
rather a crucial factor in the explanation of business cycles and the dynamics of economic
growth generally.
While nominally accepting the importance of technical and institutional change, mainstream theory and most modeling have in practice divorced economics from these crucially
important processes of change,
relegating them to the status of “residual factors” or “exogenous shocks.” . . . The various “growth
accounting” exercises, even after allowing for an entire Kamasutra of variables, generally remain
with a big unexplained “residual” . . . and fail to deal with the complementarities and interactions
of these variables. . . . In general they are only a pale shadow of the growth theories of classical
economics. (Freeman 1988: 2)

Concomitant with the neglect of technological change, neoclassical economic theory has
failed to develop an illuminating formal analysis of entrepreneurship in the sense of the
Schumpeterian innovator:
The entrepreneur is at the same time one of the most intriguing and one of the most elusive characters
in the cast that constitutes the subject of economic analysis. He has long been recognized as the
apex of the hierarchy that determines the behavior of the ﬁrm and thereby bears a heavy responsibility for the vitality of the free enterprise society. In the writings of the classical economist his appearance was frequent, though he remained a shadowy entity without clearly deﬁned form and function.
Only Schumpeter and, to some degree, Professor [Frank H.] Knight succeeded in infusing him with
life and in assigning to him a speciﬁc area of activity to any extent commensurate with his acknowledged importance. (Baumol 1968: 64)

Baumol (1968: 66) famously concluded that “the theoretical ﬁrm is entrepreneurless—
the Prince of Denmark has been expunged from the discussion of Hamlet.” In both simple
and more sophisticated models of ﬁrm behavior, the ﬁrm must choose among alternative
values for some well-deﬁned variables such as price, output, and advertising outlay. Management is taken to consider the costs and revenues associated with each candidate set of
values and to perform a calculation that yields maximum proﬁt. “There matters rest,
forever or until exogenous forces lead to an autonomous change in the environment”
(Baumol 1968: 67). As an instrument of optimality analysis of well-deﬁned problems, the
extant theory of the ﬁrm is a theory of management—overseeing the ongoing efﬁciency

<-----Page 101----->Innovation from EvoDevo to Human Culture

89

of continuing processes—not entrepreneurship—locating new ideas and putting them in
effect.
At the most fundamental level, neoclassical economics cannot come to grips with innovation and entrepreneurship because of the way it deals with information. The apex of
neoclassical theorizing, the Arrow–Debreu formalization of competitive general equilibrium, is based on the hypothesis of perfect information—complete, perfect, and freely
available knowledge of all prices and other characteristics of all goods and services traded
on markets, now and in the future (Callebaut [2007] reviews Simon’s “bounded rationality” alternative). This state of affairs explains why some economists have found it necessary to proclaim what for noneconomists is a truism—that agents cannot act on information
they do not have. Simon has spent the best part of his polymath career pointing to “the
discrepancy between the perfect human rationality that is assumed in classical and neoclassical economic theory and the reality of human life” and arguing that neither people’s
“knowledge nor their power of calculation allow them to achieve the high level of optimal
adaptation of means to end that is posited in economics” (Simon 1992: 3). As Martens
(2004: 19) points out, the perfect-information hypothesis “clashes with the very concept
of innovation. Innovation implies that future knowledge is not presently available (otherwise it cannot be ‘invented’ or ‘discovered’) and presently available information is not
generally and freely dispersed in the economy—in which case it would cease to be a unique
piece of knowledge.”
Logical Empiricism and the Abandonment of the Discovery Program
Discovery was an important methodological topic during the Scientiﬁc Revolution and
after because employing the proper method of discovery was seen as an important mode
of justiﬁcation (Laudan 1980)—an idea that can actually be traced back to Aristotle
(Hanson 1958a). By the mid-nineteenth century, two developments, which reinforced one
another, tended to separate discovery from justiﬁcation (Laudan 1980): a fallibilistic conception of theories (“the end of certainty”) and acceptance of the view that “theories be
evaluated wholly in terms of their consistency and their testable consequences and hence
independently of the vagaries of their antecedent history” (Nickles 1980: 4).
The rise of the hypothetico-deductive method and concomitant abandonment of discovery methods per se—in particular, Peirce’s “abduction” or “retroduction” (Paavola 2004;
Simon 1977)—was consecrated in the dichotomy “context of discovery” versus “context
of justiﬁcation” dear to the logical empiricists (see chapter 2, this volume). It is often
ascribed to Reichenbach, who introduced the distinction in the context of his explication
of the logical empiricist’s method of logical or rational reconstruction:
We might say that [a logical reconstruction] corresponds to the form in which thinking processes
are communicated to other persons instead of the form in which they are subjectively performed. . . . I
shall introduce the terms context of discovery and context of justiﬁcation to make this distinction.

<-----Page 102----->90

Werner Callebaut

Then we have to say that epistemology is only occupied in constructing the context of justiﬁcation.
But even the way of presenting scientiﬁc theories is only an approximation to what we mean by the
context of justiﬁcation. Even in the written form scientiﬁc expositions do not always correspond to
the exigencies of logic or suppress the traces of subjective motivation from which they started.
(Reichenbach 1938: 6–7)

The further distinctions that are usually made in this respect—that the “psychological”
(“sociological,” “historical”) is qualitatively different from the “logical,” that discovery
precedes justiﬁcation, and so forth—cannot fairly be ascribed to Reichenbach (Glymour
and Eberhardt 2008; Nickles 1980).
Popper (1959: 31) famously put the matter as follows in The Logic of Scientiﬁc Discovery, originally published in German in 1934: “My view of the matter, for what it is
worth, is that there is no such thing as a logical method of having new ideas, or a logical
reconstruction of this process.” With few exceptions, this view remained the dominant one
in the philosophy of science until Hanson (1958a, 1958b, 1960) questioned it and revindicated a place for a genuine “logic” of discovery.
The debate between the proponents of discovery and their foes, most notably Laudan,
was documented by Nickles (1985), who insisted that “there is no special logic of discovery distinct from logic of justiﬁcation” (Nickles 1985: 180)—the same logic can be used
for both purposes. He also proposed the revival of a “generative conception of justiﬁcation
which goes beyond consequentialism to forge a strong linkage of generation (or rather,
generalizability) with justiﬁcation” (Nickles 1985: 177). Nickles (1985: 179) hinted at a
naturalistic turn when asking whether “philosophers really have contributed much to
practical theory of testing/justiﬁcation.”
Whereas Hanson unsuccessfully tried to resuscitate the old dream of a generative
“logic,” the Kuhnian challenge to the two-contexts distinction implied that nonrational
elements persist even in the justiﬁcation/testing of theories (Castle 2001). Whatever attention the discovery project still attracts seems to have more to do with the practical successes of automated “discovery” using classical artiﬁcial intelligence (Langley et al. 1987;
Shrager and Langley 1990; Simon 1977) or connectionist approaches (Pennock 2000) than
with sophisticated philosophical “arguments” (chapter 2, this volume). The philosophical
naturalist will have to turn his or her attention to the social-scientiﬁc explanations of
(multiple) scientiﬁc discovery that have been offered and try to make the best of them in
the emerging, evolutionary framework.
It turns out, then, that Popper’s romantic view of discovery belongs to the individualist
genius account that has long been abandoned by students of cultural evolution, whereas
anthropological and sociological thinkers from Kroeber (1917) on have articulated a zeitgeist account that could be quite easily recast in contemporary evolutionary terms, minus
the original connotations of cultural determinism. Simonton’s (1986) chance account,
based on Monte Carlo simulations, could be made to conform to our current understanding
of drift (as already conceived by Lamb and Easton 1984).

Conclusion: A Common Evolutionary Core
Biologists, economists, and philosophers of science have groped in multiple ways for
novelty as “something that has not been there before.” Such a quest presupposes criteria
for sameness on the basis of which something can be established to be nontrivially different from things already in existence (Fontana 2001). Specifying these criteria has proven
difﬁcult in all three ﬁelds, but EvoDevo biology today seems to be on the most promising
track.
In living systems, sameness results from common ancestry or independent convergent
evolution. On one account, an organismal feature is novel if it is not homologous to any
feature in the ancestral species (Müller and Wagner 1991). On this view, innovation represents a distinct kind of phenotypic change, differing from adaptive modiﬁcation. The
origin of novelty may be a result of different mechanisms than the mutations underlying
variation and adaptations, and certain phenotypic changes may have more important and
long-lasting consequences for evolutionary dynamics than mutational change. Whereas
a central aim of the Modern Synthesis was the explanation of adaptive change as a
population-dynamic event (viz., the correlation of phenotypic character variation with
statistical gene frequencies in populations), EvoDevo seeks to explain phenotypic change
through the alterations in the physical interactions among genes, cells, and tissues, whether
they are adaptive or not (Müller 2007). EvoDevo thus represents a causal-mechanistic
approach to understanding phenotypic change in evolution (Callebaut et al. 2007) that
addresses many of the constituent features of phenotypic change, such as the generation
of new structural elements (novelty), the establishment of standardized building units
(modularity, homology), the arrangement of such units in lineage-speciﬁc combinations
(body plans), and the repeated generation of similar forms in independent taxa (homoplasy). In addition, EvoDevo aims at explaining how development itself evolves and how
the control of developmental processes is brought about by the interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. “With these goals, evo–devo moves the focus of
attention to the qualitative phenomena of phenotypic organization and their mechanistic
causes” (Müller 2007: 946).
Beginning with Veblen and Marshall, economists have been slow in moving beyond
“the equilibrating and static theoretical system” to adopt an evolutionary approach
(Hodgson 1993b: 406). They continue to be wary of “too literal” interpretations of the
biological “analogy” (Nelson and Winter 1982; Witt 2003). In philosophy, most of the
arguments deployed against evolutionary epistemology concerned “asymmetries” between
biological and cultural evolution that have to do with the presumed uniqueness of human
action and culture (Hull 1988).
The optimistic bet in the background of my comparison of biology, economics, and the
philosophy of science is that the toolkit that EvoDevo offers today contains many more,
and richer, resources than most advocates of evolutionary economics and evolutionary

<-----Page 104----->92

epistemology realize. For instance, the conﬂict between lawfulness and contingency (historicity) that Kroeber (1917), for one, identiﬁed correctly but could not resolve at the time
is dealt with reasonably adequately in current evolutionary accounts under the labels of
“path dependency,” “inherency,” and “generative entrenchment” (Callebaut et al. 2007).
Or, economists’ intuition that ideas, in order to be innovative, must be embodied by living
people—which was explicated in a somewhat different context by Campbell (1979) in his
account of “vehicles carrying knowledge”—could in principle be given a literal rendering
in terms of hierarchical selection theory and EvoDevo. There is more to evolution than
Dawkins.3
Notes
1. In fact, each of these communities can be decomposed into several clusters. The Web survey of innovation
research carried out by Fagerberg and Verspagen (2006) among economists in 2004 and 2005 identiﬁed a large
number of relatively small groups characterized by dense internal relationships deﬁned along geographical and
disciplinary lines. These smaller groups, however, are embedded in larger transnational clusters that are kept
together by weak ties. I suspect that a rather similar picture would obtain for the anthropological and biological
communities with an interest in innovation.
2. In the same vein, Stadler et al. (2001) have proposed to extend the explanatory level for phenotypic evolution
from ﬁtness considerations alone to include the topological structure of phenotype space as induced by the
genotype–phenotype map.
3. I provide positive elements for the rapprochement envisaged here in Callebaut (n.d.).

The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions
Joseph Henrich

This chapter applies an integrated approach to decision making and cultural evolution to
examine the development of population-level differences in innovativeness. In referring
to a group’s innovativeness, I aim to highlight some of the factors or processes that favor
both the generation of more inventions (meaning useful or adaptive novelties) and the
spread those inventions through the population, making them, in this terminology, innovations (see chapter 1, this volume). My discussion has several parts. To lay a foundation
for subsequent arguments, I begin by summarizing research showing how evolutionary
theory can direct and inform our understanding of decision making, social learning, and
cultural evolution. Building on this, I then examine how a population’s size and its degree
of cultural interconnectedness can inﬂuence rates of both innovation and invention.
After using a simple model to illustrate the relative importance of cultural interconnectedness compared to individual invention for the spread of innovations, I discuss a
combination of ethnographic, historical, and archaeological cases to explore the relative
importance of “mother necessity” and “heroic genius” versus recombination, lucky mistakes, and the accretion of small changes in driving invention (see chapter 15, this volume).
This discussion suggests that, at best, “necessity” is neither necessary nor sufﬁcient to
explain invention and that invention processes are dominated by incremental additions,
recombinations, and lucky errors, but not usually by revolutionary insights. This means
that inventiveness is, at least in part, a product of large populations (which generate more
lucky errors) and greater cultural interconnectedness.
Finally, I examine how greater interconnectedness in a population gives rise to a largescale cooperative dilemma. Although some partial solutions to this dilemma have emerged
across our species, only some societies have evolved the informal (and later formal) institutions—that is, cultural systems of reputation, signaling, and punishment—that favor the
wide sharing of information, ideas, and insights. Theoretical work has revealed three
avenues to solving such n-person cooperative dilemmas, but all three generate multiple
stable equilibria, meaning that while they can stabilize cooperative information sharing,
they can also stabilize “information hiding and free riding” as well as other non-groupbeneﬁcial behaviors. In such circumstances, processes of cultural group selection, which

<-----Page 112----->100

Joseph Henrich

operate through various forms of competition among groups, can favor the evolution of
those institutional forms that best promote the open dissemination so crucial to innovation.
This line of thinking proposes that cultural evolution has favored the emergence of institutions that increase cultural interconnectedness and thereby stimulate both greater inventiveness and more innovation.
Theoretical Framework
With the physical endowments of a tropical ape, humans have successfully spread to nearly
every corner of the globe in a relatively short period, from the dry savannas and tropical
forests of equatorial Africa to the frozen tundra of the Arctic and the humid swamps of
New Guinea. Humans are unique in their range of environments and the nature and diversity of their behavioral adaptations. Many local genetic adaptations exist in our species,
but it seems certain that the same basic genetic endowment produces arctic foraging,
tropical horticulture, and desert pastoralism—a constellation of adaptive patterns that
represents a greater range of subsistence behavior than what is shown by the rest of the
primate order combined.
The behavioral repertoires that permit such diverse adaptations to this range of environments are principally socially learned and represent cumulative cultural products that have
been assembled and honed over generations (Henrich 2008). The tools, skills, and bodies
of folk-biological knowledge on which foragers from the Arctic to the Kalahari rely are
acquired developmentally, principally by observing and listening to older members of their
social group. The same goes for food-preparation skills, many food preferences, and
medical know-how (Billing and Sherman 1998; Lancy 1996). Numerous accounts of
travelers, often experienced European explorers, stranded in places such as Australia,
Amazonia, or the Arctic illustrate just how ineffective our rationality, evolved modules,
and ﬁtness-maximizing mechanisms are when they lack the relevant culturally transmitted
input. In these cases, individuals freeze, starve, dehydrate, or mistakenly poison themselves while seeking to escape seemingly harsh environments in which any local adolescent equipped with a culturally inherited body of know-how could have easily survived
(Henrich and McElreath 2003; Richerson and Boyd 2005). Even something as ancient and
basic to human survival as making ﬁre cannot readily be acquired without observing
someone with expertise, a point emphasized by the fact that some isolated human foraging
societies have lost this knowledge (Gott 2002; Holmberg 1950; Radcliffe-Brown 1964).
There seems little doubt that this emphasis and reliance on cultural learning extends to
human social behavior. In both the laboratory and controlled ﬁeld experiments, children
and adults will readily acquire a wide range of social behaviors by means of imitation even
when it is costly. In human societies, especially small-scale groups, complex kinship and
political relationships, overlapping status differences and honor systems, marriage rules

and preferences, and subtle notions of proper etiquette create culturally constructed obstacle courses that can be successfully navigated only by those with extensive cultural knowledge. As any ethnographer will attest, before a would-be Machiavellian can manipulate
others to his or her own selﬁsh ends, this individual has to master the local cultural systems,
values, and expectations. Only then can he or she effectively “work” the system. One must
be an excellent cultural learner before one can be an intelligent Machiavellian.
Building on the above insights, three decades of theoretical work applying the logic of
natural selection to understanding our capacities for learning and decision making, and in
particular to our capacities for social learning, has effectively shifted culture and cultural
evolution into a larger, Darwinian framework for studying psychology and history (Boyd
and Richerson 1985; Cavalli-Sforza 1971; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981; Henrich and
Henrich 2007; Richerson and Boyd 1978, 2005; Shennan 2002). For our purposes, this
approach provides a framework for ﬁrst generating hypotheses about some of the microlevel psychological details of cultural learning and then constructing formal models of
population processes that aggregate up from theoretically and empirically grounded microlevel decision mechanisms to population-level patterns. Below I apply this framework to
understanding innovation.
Microlevel Processes of Decision Making Generate Culture
The general potency of human cultural learning, as well as several of the speciﬁc predictions arising from the above-mentioned approach, are substantiated by large bodies of
experimental work in both social and developmental psychology, as well as by recent work
in experimental economics. I point to only some of the highlights, to give a sense of the
empirical underpinnings.
After more than two decades of research on cultural learning (“observational learning”
or “modeling”), psychologist Bandura (1977) summarizes the spontaneous potency of
cultural learning and its broad impacts on thinking and behavior:
Modeling has been shown to be a highly effective means of establishing abstract or rule-governed
behavior. On the basis of observationally derived rules, people learn, among other things, judgmental
orientations, linguistic styles, conceptual schemes, information-processing strategies, cognitive
operations, and standards of conduct. . . . Evidence that generalizable rules of thought and conduct
can be induced through abstract modeling reveals the broad scope of observational learning. (p. 42)
Observers display the same amount of observational learning regardless of whether they are informed
in advance that correct imitations will be rewarded or are given no prior incentives to learn the
modeled performances. (p. 38)

More speciﬁcally, the application of evolutionary theory to the questions of from whom
individuals should learn, how they should integrate information gleaned from different
individuals, and when they should rely on social learning versus individual experience (or
rational calculation) has generated a series of hypotheses that ﬁnd support from a wide

<-----Page 114----->102

Joseph Henrich

range of experiments and ﬁeld data. The approach suggests that learners—in order to most
efﬁciently acquire adaptive behavior in noisy or stochastic environments—ought to be
selective in terms of to whom they pay attention for the purposes of cultural learning.
They should prefer those with greater skill, success, knowledge, health, and prestige,1
while also using cues of self-similarity such as gender, size, and ethnicity to help ensure
that what they learn is ﬁt for their personal attributes and current or future social roles
(see Henrich and Gil-White [2001] and Henrich and Henrich [2007] for reviews of the
evidence).
The approach suggests that learners should aggregate information using conformist, or
blending, algorithms (Boyd and Richerson 1985; Henrich and Boyd 1998, 2002), which
reduce errors in learning (by averaging them out) and facilitate the extraction of useful
information. Evidence from psychology (Asch 1951; Coultas 2004; Henrich and Gil-White
2001; Insko et al. 1985), archaeology (Mesoudi and O’Brien 2008a, 2008b), and economics (Apesteguia et al. 2007; Kroll and Levy 1992; Pingle 1995; Pingle and Day 1996)
supports these predictions.
In addition to specifying to whom learners should pay attention and how they should
integrate information gleaned from different models, this approach predicts how environmental uncertainty or problem ambiguity (problem difﬁculty) should impact the use of,
or reliance on, social learning versus individual learning or cost–beneﬁt evaluation. Consistent with these models, ﬁndings from psychology, anthropology, and economics indicate that as uncertainty rises, or as the difﬁculty/ambiguity of the problem increases,
individuals’ reliance on social learning increases (Davis 1984; McElreath et al. 2005;
chapter 3, this volume). The same experiments indicate that this increased reliance on
social learning is even more pronounced when incentives are increased. That is, perhaps
nonintuitively, adding incentives magniﬁes the inﬂuence and importance of social learning
(Baron et al. 1996).
Such laboratory experiments illustrate another key point from the theoretical work
(Boyd and Richerson 1995): Adding or improving imitative opportunities for individual
learners increases the total payoffs of the group. When individuals make decisions based
only on their private information and evaluations, the group average is usually far from
the optimum behavior. However, when imitation is permitted, the group’s mean moves
closer to and often approximates the optimum proﬁt-making behavior (see chapter 11, this
volume). This suggests that individuals are most likely to use imitation when they perceive
(more or less accurately) their own skills or information to be worse than those they
can copy.
These laboratory ﬁndings include numerous experiments involving monetary stakes, but
we must also assess whether these theoretically derived insights are consistent with ﬁndings
from the spread of novel technologies and practices in the real world. The vast diffusionof-innovations literature has for six decades focused on understanding why novel techniques, technologies, and practices sometimes spread and other times do not (see chapter 1,

<-----Page 115----->The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions

103

this volume). Underpinning many of these investigations is the question of why some populations sometimes appear highly resistant to adopting what appears to be, in terms of economics or health, a beneﬁcial novelty. Summarizing some of the principal ﬁndings from this
extensive literature, Rogers (1995: 18) writes as follows:
Diffusion investigations show that most individuals do not evaluate an innovation on the basis of
scientiﬁc studies of its consequences, although such objective evaluations are not entirely irrelevant. . . . Instead, most people depend mainly upon a subjective evaluation of an innovation that is
conveyed to them from other individuals like themselves who have previously adopted the innovation. This dependence on the experience of near peers suggests that the heart of the diffusion process
consists of the modeling and imitation by potential adopters of their network partners who have
adopted previously.

None of this is meant to suggest that costs and beneﬁts, or individual evaluations of
costs and beneﬁts, are irrelevant or even unimportant. One individual in a community
might, for a variety of potential reasons involving luck or individual initiative, obtain
particularly high-quality information about the effectiveness of a new technology and
adopt it. The adoption might result, for a farmer, in greater success in the form of higher
crop yields. Our farmer’s neighbors, impressed by the high yield, might imitate several of
his techniques, including the new technology. As a consequence, the new technology may
diffuse through the social networks of the community until all have adopted it. In this
stylized example, all of the individuals in the community save one acquired the invention
by imitating high-payoff individuals, and thus imitation is the heart of the process, but
these learners exploited the superior cost–beneﬁt information of one person.
Here is the take-home message: Because humans often rely heavily on learning from
others, especially in incentivized situations involving ambiguous costs and beneﬁts, a
general approach to understanding innovation should take seriously the cultural nature of
our species. Given that the invention or adoption of a novel practice or technology necessarily involves uncertain or ambiguous costs and beneﬁts, owning to the lack of any direct
experience from which to acquire such information, it seems plausible that social learning
may be even more important for a theory of innovation than it is for other aspects of human
decision making.
Innovation Is Fundamentally a Cultural and Social Process
Here I examine innovation and invention as cultural and social processes (recall that I
partitioned invention and innovation at the outset). I ﬁrst present a simple formal model
that allows us to explore the relative contributions of independent invention, cultural learning, and the diversity of learners’ associations to the spread of a novelty through a population. The ﬁndings, which are consistent with other more extensive explorations elsewhere,
illustrate that “cultural interconnectedness” is crucial for innovation. I then examine

<-----Page 116----->104

Joseph Henrich

inventions as incremental accumulations that depend crucially on recombination, happenstance, and luck and not so much on either individual heroic genius or mother necessity.
Building from this discussion, I suggest that, given the importance of both recombination
and luck in the invention process, both cultural interconnectedness and population size will
be important for understanding both invention rates and innovation rates.
Cultural Interconnectedness
We can construct a simple model that connects individual decisions to create or adopt a
novelty with the frequency of adoption of the novelty in the overall population. By partitioning individual invention and social learning, the model allows us to examine what
kinds of characteristics make a population more innovative. Here, as above, inventions
are useful, effective, and adaptive novelties that individuals create, whereas innovations
are novelties that have successfully diffused through the population.
Consider a large population of identical individuals in which each develops a novelty
with probability ε. If individuals do not invent the novelty themselves, they can observe
k other individuals and can acquire it culturally from each, with probability λ, which
captures a combination of individuals’ cultural-learning abilities (vis-à-vis the thing being
learned), the details of the novelty that make it more or less likely to spread, the effects
of the novelty on individuals that might make them more likely to be paid attention to or
learned from, and the willingness or ability of the other individual to transmit the novelty.
Using this, we can compute the overall probability that each of our individuals acquires
the novelty (see van Schaik and Pradhan 2003):

(

p = ε + (1− ε ) 1 − (1 − λ p )

k

)

Given that our individuals are identical, p also represents the expected frequency of
individuals in the population who adopt the useful novelty after all learning is completed.
If p is close to one, we can say the invention has spread widely and the group has innovated. Figure 7.1 is a plot of the numerical solutions to this equation for a range of values
of k (along the horizontal axis) for three different values of ε. Note ﬁrst that higher values
of k (more associates to learn from) create a dramatic and highly nonlinear increase in the
probability of acquiring the novelty, that is, of generating an innovation. For low values
of k, the probability that any one person will adopt the trait is small, which implies that
the ﬁnal percentage of trait adopters in the population will be small. For example, when
ε is 0.10 (a 10 percent chance of individual invention) and k = 2, the probability that an
individual will acquire the novel trait is 12 percent. This means that, on average, only 12
percent of the population will eventually acquire the novelty.
However, for values of k greater than about 12, over 90 percent of the population will
adopt the novelty. The shape of these curves shows what would empirically appear as
threshold effects, especially when the trait is difﬁcult to invent by experimentation or
experience (low ε). Consider the curves for ε = 0.01 and 0.001. For values of k less than

about 5, few people adopt the novel trait. However, by the time k has reached 10, nearly
85 percent of the population is adopting it. Between k = 5 and k = 7, p spikes from about
0.05 to 0.58. This indicates that small differences in the number of people from which one
can learn something can make a huge difference in the equilibrium percentage of the
population adopting the novelty.
Figure 7.1 also shows that for high values of k there is relatively little difference in the
curves despite the large difference (two orders of magnitude) in ε. A situation in which
ε = 0.10 means that an individual has a 100 times greater chance of acquiring the trait by
himself or herself, by means of, say, experimentation, than when ε = 0.001. Interestingly,
however, as k gets larger, ε makes less and less difference on the value of p. By the time
k reaches 12, this 100-fold difference in ε is almost entirely wiped out by the power of
cultural learning stretching out and interconnecting minds. This suggests that in a large,
well-interconnected population, people could get less inventive without much appreciable
change in the population’s innovativeness.
To understand the importance of this, imagine two different populations that, for reasons
of geography, cultural beliefs, or cooperative institutions, have different values of k but
are otherwise in identical situations (same λ and ε), captured by the ε = 0.001 curve in
ﬁgure 7.1. Suppose the two populations have k = 4 and k = 12, respectively. On the ground,
an observer of these groups would see that essentially no one (0.4 percent) in the ﬁrst

population has adopted the novelty, whereas over 90 percent of individuals in the second
population have adopted the innovation. If the analyst happens to think that the novelty
is “smart” or “rational,” then population 2 may seem “more inventive,” “smarter,” or
“more rational” than population 1, which of course it is not, given that we speciﬁed that
ε is the same in both populations. Population 2 is just more social in some sense.
Increases in λ, our parameter measuring the effectiveness of cultural transmission
between individuals, also have a larger impact than similar increases in ε. Figure 7.2 is a
plot of the relationship between k and p for three values of λ. While it makes little difference whether k is small or large, λ shows substantial effects for intermediate values of k.
For example, when k = 6, p goes from 20 percent for λ = 0.1 to 56 percent for λ = 0.2
and to 84 percent for λ = 0.3. Comparing ﬁgures 7.1 and 7.2 for the relative effects of ε
versus λ illustrates the importance of open channels of cultural transmission in favoring
innovation.
The take-home message from this analysis, which is supported by more extensively
studied evolutionary models (Henrich 2004b; Shennan 2001; van Schaik and Pradhan
2003), is that a group’s innovativeness is determined more strongly by its cultural interconnectedness (including the effects of both k and λ) than by the individual inventiveness
of its members (ε). Assuming that the probability of invention is not too small relative to

<-----Page 119----->The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions

107

the total population of potential inventors, groups that invest in cultural interconnectedness
(sharing of ideas) will be substantially more innovative than groups that invest in raising
the inventiveness of members.
These insights have numerous potential applications. At a continental level, larger land
masses oriented on an east–west axis may favor the ﬂow of cultural information, and
farming know-how in particular, among distant populations (Diamond 1997; McNeil
1991). They may also explain the dearth of technological complexity in Australia vis-à-vis
Eurasia, as well as differences between Africa and the Americas on the one hand and
Eurasia on the other. At regional levels, they may help explain the differences between
populations isolated on islands versus continental populations and may even explain the
loss of technological know-how in Tasmania over the last 10,000 years (Henrich 2004b,
2006b; Rivers 1926; chapter 9, this volume). The approach may also provide a cultural
evolutionary explanation for the ﬂorescence of material culture during the so-called
“Human Revolution,” suggesting that observed cultural efﬂorescence may have resulted
from rising population sizes, densities, and/or greater interconnectedness and not from
genetic changes. This further hints that anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals,
who had similarly sized brains, may have varied only in their sociality (k), not in their
inventiveness (ε).
On the Origins of Inventions: Mother Necessity, Mistakes, and Recombination
The above suggests that individual inventiveness likely plays a smaller role in innovation
than cultural interconnectedness, but I want to further argue, mostly by reiterating arguments made by many others, that invention is not quite what many tend to think. I have
four interrelated points on this front: (1) necessity is not the mother of invention, (2) most
inventors are not singular heroic geniuses but make only small additions to existing
accumulations, (3) these minor additions are rarely entirely new but instead usually represent only novel recombinations or cross-domain extensions of existing ideas, and (4)
many of these useful additions or modiﬁcations result from lucky errors or chance
interactions.
The idea that necessity is the mother of invention is an important assumption in much
processual archaeological (chapter 1, this volume) and anthropological theory (Johnson
and Earle 1987), as well as in economics. In anthropology, the idea seems to be that when
environmental circumstances shift, population increases, or external threats arise (warring
groups), the innovation engine in a society and/or its members (depending on the speciﬁc
paradigm) kicks into gear and soon the appropriate novel technologies, practices, or forms
of social organization emerge. Often implicit in this is the notion that the individual’s own
welfare is threatened or declining, causing the individual to shift and invest more in invention by taking more risks that will, on average, result in more inventions (Fitzhugh and
Trusler 2009).

<-----Page 120----->108

Joseph Henrich

This economic logic supposes that as the incentives shift sufﬁciently to favor alternative
practices or technologies, individuals switch and invest in the alternatives. My goal in this
section is not to argue that “necessity” is never a factor in innovation or that incentives
are irrelevant but instead to suggest that, at best, necessity is only one of several progenitors of innovation and not a necessary one at that. I discuss how many great inventions
were initially rejected, suggesting that problems don’t always ﬁnd inventions but that
inventions often ﬁnd previously unrecognized problems (see chapter 14, this volume).
To begin, there may be a ﬂaw with the economic logic of mother necessity. Incentives,
from the perspective of an omniscient observer, may favor an alterative technology (or
practice) or a more complex version of a particular technology, but for the adaptive learner,
that novel technology does not yet exist, so the learner has no way to assess its relative
costs and beneﬁts (see chapter 2, this volume). Not only does the learner lack any experience with which to assess the incentive differences, he or she has not even thought of it
yet and can’t have any idea of the cost associated with ﬁguring it out (Henrich 2006b).
Learners know a lot about the costs and beneﬁts of what they are currently doing but little
or nothing about those of novel alternatives that they might consider switching to, let alone
the costs of ﬁguring out those alternatives (Henrich 2002). Although this is a bad situation
for a cost–beneﬁt analyst, it is the typical situation that cultural learning was “designed”
by natural selection to handle.
Another theoretical concern is that if environmental shifts or population pressure have,
for example, made current subsistence techniques less fruitful, an individual may have less,
not more, time or energy to invest in invention. Invention investment may, in fact, decline
in such circumstances. In modern economies, for example, ﬁrms invest in both their current
product lines and research and development in boom times, but they halt R & D in tough
times—not the other way around as the above logic would suggest (Hargadon 2003).
Risk-sensitive models of decision making show that if an individual’s chances of survival fall below a threshold, such that, on average, he or she dies, that individual should
adopt a risk-prone strategy; however, it’s far from clear in a world with cultural learning
whether such a strategy involves investing by means of individual learning in invention.
Rather than “turning down” individual risk aversion in a utility or ﬁtness calculation,
natural selection could alternatively favor recalibrating cultural-learning strategies by
shifting from conformist biases in transmission toward anticonformist biases (Henrich and
Boyd 1998) or by reducing within-group ethnic learning biases (McElreath et al. 2003).
Such shifts in cultural learning help reduce the likelihood of sticking to locally failing
strategies, make learners more sensitive to even smaller differences in perceived payoffs
between themselves and others, and open up the learner to acquiring useful novelties from
other groups.
My own reading of the empirical record on these issues suggests that when faced with
population pressure, environmental shifts, or external threats, people do sometimes inno-

<-----Page 121----->The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions

vate; however, more often they emigrate, suffer, and/or die. Diamond (2005) chronicles
the innovation failures and the resulting collapse of the Maya, Greenland Norse, and Easter
Islanders. The Greenland case is particularly instructive because we know that whereas
the Norse gradually starved to death and vanished in response to climate change, local
Inuit populations who were in contact with the Norse possessed adaptive technologies that
allowed them to not only survive but expand. This means that the Norse could have
adapted but did not. Below are six other provocative cases that seem to challenge the idea
that necessity is the driver of invention:
1. Foragers living in Australia for 60,000 years (Testart 1988) failed to develop (or
perhaps lost) any technologies involving elastically stored energy (e.g., the bow and arrow,
musical bow, bow trap, or spring snare), kinetic energy (e.g., lasso and bola), or compressed air (e.g., blowpipe and dart, musical instruments).
2. New Guineans, although they used bows and arrows, never adopted ﬂetching of any
kind for their arrows.
3. The wheel appears to have been invented only in Eurasia (Basalla 1988). One could
argue that other places lacked large domesticated animals that made wheels particularly
useful, but wheelbarrows and pulleys are still pretty useful, and “llama carting” is a recreation today. Dogs, which were and are ubiquitous, can pull carts as well. In the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, dogs were used to pull people and milk carts in northern
Europe.
4. The Inca managed a vast empire, stretching from Columbia to Chile, without writing.
It’s difﬁcult to imagine there was not a “need” for writing.
5. Some human languages lack systems for counting above three, basic color terms, words
for “right” and “left,” and grammatical operators to create conjunctive clauses (Everett
2005; Levinson 2003).
6. Zero appears to have been invented only twice in human history, once in India and
once by the Maya. Most societies adopted zero soon after encountering it, although
Europeans resisted zero for centuries (Seife 2000).
Beyond such macroscale cases, the same argument can be made for individuals’ failures to innovate when faced with dire circumstances as noted above. For example,
elsewhere (Henrich and McElreath 2003) I have laid out an account of Burke and Wills’s
ill-fated expedition into the Australian outback. This historical narrative illustrates both
the futility of ﬁtness-maximizing calculations in the absence of culturally inherited
information and the tendency for humans, even arrogant Europeans, to rely on social
learning over individual learning and experimentation for survival when the pressure is
really on.

The available laboratory experimental ﬁndings, however limited, also converge to
restrict the applicability of the “mother necessity view.” As discussed above, when problems get tough or the world gets uncertain, student subjects faced with problems or puzzles
with monetary incentives in the laboratory shift their reliance away from their own private
evaluations and information and toward social-learning strategies. That is, they invent less
and copy more when the world gets uncertain or problems get tough.
Besides the ambiguous role of necessity in yielding invention, a close look at the emergence of some well-known inventions illustrates (1) the importance of small additions by
many contributors, often over long time periods, with a relatively small role for singular
heroic geniuses; (2) the degree to which seeming novelties really represent only new
recombinations or cross-domain extensions of existing ideas or technologies; and (3) the
centrality of lucky errors or chance interactions in inventions, and not sui generis independent insights. I leave a complete defense of these views to the existing historical works
(Basalla 1988; Diamond 1997; Hager 2007; Hargadon 2003; Meyers 2007; Sneader 2005;
Williams 1987) and rely on six illustrative examples:
1. Eli Whitney’s “revolutionary” cotton gin merely modiﬁed existing long-staple cotton
gins, which were already widely available in the southern United States to extend their
processing ability to short staple cotton. These gins go back hundreds of years to Indian
gins called charka, which used the same principles as Whitney’s gin (and actually looked
similar). Similar gins are seen in twelfth-century Italy and fourteenth-century China.
2. Establishing the germ theory of disease required obtaining pure cultures of bacteria.
In the nineteenth century, dozens of researchers were trying to ﬁgure out how to do this,
without success. After years of work, Robert Koch solved the problem when, while cleaning up his laboratory, he ran across half of a boiled potato that had been carelessly left
for a few days. Koch noticed the growth of discrete reddish dots at different places
on the white potato and realized that he needed to use a solid, not liquid, medium to
culture the bacteria. He went on to link speciﬁc pathogens with speciﬁc diseases (Hager
2007). The discovery of this process could not have occurred without a carelessly left
boiled potato.
3. Thomas Edison’s “invention” of the incandescent light bulb only improved on many
other such bulbs patented between 1841 and 1878 by a wide variety of inventors. Of
course, if you are from Britain, Sir Joseph W. Swan is the inventor of the incandescent
light bulb, whereas if you are from Russia, it is A. N. Lodygin (Conot 1979; Diamond
1997). Moreover, Edison’s bulb emerged from his Menlo Park laboratory, meaning it was
actually the product of a team effort (Hargadon 2003).
4. The Wright brothers’ invention of the airplane recombined existing manned gliders
with unmanned powered airplanes (Diamond 1997). The trail of the evolution of ﬂight
goes back at least to Chinese kites in 400 b.c.

5. James Watt’s “invention” of the steam engine occurred in 1769 after he repaired a
Newcomen steam engine constructed 57 years earlier. This engine was modiﬁed from
Thomas Savery’s design of 1698, the components of which trace to seventeenth-century
Europe and thirteenth-century China. After dissecting the steam engine, famed historian
Joseph Needham concluded that “no single man was the father of the steam engine; no
single civilization either” (Basalla 1988).
6. The discovery of penicillin and the dawn of the age of antibiotics began when
Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to ﬁnd that his Petri dishes had been contaminated with mold. Seeking to clean up his chronically messy laboratory, he dumped the
whole batch of dishes into a sink, where they sat until he retrieved an unsubmerged disk
to show a visitor. He happened to notice that whereas the mold was growing ﬁne, the staph
was retreating. Penicillin was discovered due to luck, energized by messiness. Fleming’s
published inquiry was then promptly ignored for a decade.
Invention and innovation are fundamentally evolutionary processes. Given that nearly
all inventions build on existing ideas and often involve the recombination of existing
concepts, methods, or materials, often fortiﬁed or integrated with a dose of lucky mistakes
or happenstance, the overall inventiveness of a social group or population depends on the
number of individual minds available to create recombinations, generate insights, and get
lucky, as well as on their cultural interconnectedness (see chapter 8, this volume). This
implies that the more minds in one generation, the more novel recombinations, insights,
and lucky mistakes will exist for the next generation to recombine, reﬁne, and extend
across domains. The more innovations in existence, the greater the opportunities for
recombinations and the more inventions are possible. Because the elements of any recombinant are acquired by learning from others, the more individuals one can potentially learn
from, the greater the opportunities for creating novel recombinant inventions.
Consistent with this idea, business scholars now argue that companies should design
themselves speciﬁcally to bridge multiple technological domains, especially to stimulate
innovation by means of recombination (Hargadon 2003). Similarly, psychologists argue
that living and adapting to foreign cultures increases creativity (Maddux and Galinksy
2006).
If both a population’s size and its degree of cultural interconnectedness increase innovation rates, then we should expect certain kinds of practices and technologies to have an
especially large impact on innovations, particularly those that permit or increase the ﬂow
of information within or across groups. Anything that permits faster or easier communication should, all things being equal, have an impact on innovation rates, such as transportation (horses, ships, roads, trains, and planes), communication (shared language,
writing, mail, books, journals, literacy, telegraph, telephone, and Internet), and peaceful
social relationships—although in wartime, espionage seems to energize innovation
(McNeil 1982).

Solving the Public-Goods Problem Energizes Innovation
The technologies, practices, and relationships mentioned above can potentially increase
both the effective population size and/or the degree of cultural interconnectedness;
however, there remains a core motivational dilemma in creating innovations. Implicit in
being “interconnected” lies a willingness to share what one has ﬁgured out (or stumbled
upon) with others, or at least a willingness not to actively seek to prevent others from
observing or learning what one knows. The overall group or population is often best
served, in terms of either ﬁtness or innovation rate, if everyone shares his or her ideas and
inventions as openly as possible, thereby maximizing the ﬂow of inventions, accumulations, and recombinations. However, individuals or groups (in a population of other
groups) have incentives to learn as much as they can from others while keeping their own
ideas and insights to themselves. These incentives turn the problem of innovation (creating
and spreading inventions) into a classic cooperative (public-goods) dilemma with a big
free-rider problem.
Prestige Deference Is a Dyadic Solution to This Dilemma
Elsewhere Gil-White and I (Henrich and Gil-White 2001) have examined how natural
selection, acting to reﬁne our capacities for cultural learning, has partially addressed this
cooperative dilemma. We propose that learners essentially pay those from whom they want
to learn (e.g., highly successful and skilled models) with prestige deference. This deference
comes in many forms and includes small gifts, willingness to help, coalitional support,
and public praise for the chosen model (resulting in more deference from others). In
exchange for this deference, the chosen model permits the learner to hang around and
observe what he or she does close up. Such models may give tips or even perform certain
actions in a manner that facilitates observational learning. We call this the “informationgoods theory of prestige” because information, in the form of learning opportunities, is
exchanged in dyadic relationships for prestige deference. We argue that this approach
explains much status-related behavior and is the only approach that makes the necessary
connection between the empirically observed patterns of behavior—deference, status,
ethology, and imitation. Supplementing the evidence we presented in our paper, more
recent support has emerged in studies of human emotions, including pride, awe, respect,
and elevation (Algoe et al. 2006; Keltner and Haidt 2003; Tracy 2007).
Institutions of Apprenticeship Are Built on This Psychology
This aspect of our evolved-status psychology likely forms the foundation for the widespread institutions of apprenticeship that have emerged independently in many human
societies. Apprentices seek to learn particular skills (e.g., metal working, weaving, or
pottery) while working under the strict, often slavish, direction of a master. In addition to
the apprentice’s labor, which may be required for years, the master may also require direct

<-----Page 125----->The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions

113

payment in money or goods and may have other stipulations, such as requiring the apprentice to swear not to set up a shop in the master’s own town or not to reveal the master’s
secrets. Agreements among masters, and formal laws in some places, limit the number of
apprentices that any one master may accept. The apprentice’s learning is usually strictly
imitative, with the explicit goal being to copy the master exactly (Coy 1989).
The institution of apprenticeship, while permitting the cultural transmission of complex
skills, does not maximize the ﬂow of adaptive information among individuals in the population in a manner that will maximize the population’s innovation rates. Given that in
addressing the underlying dilemma apprentices are usually limited in number and can
serve only one master, there is little chance for the diffuse interconnectedness, accumulation, and recombination that energize invention and drive higher rates of innovation. The
society, though not the masters, would be more innovative if masters freely distributed
their knowledge, were permitted as many apprentices as could be handled, and did not
require a longer period of servitude than necessary to acquire the requisite skills. Students
could move among masters as they wished, comparing and recombining elements from
different masters.
Solutions to the Larger-Scale Cooperative Dilemma Required
The kind of culturally interconnected population that I have argued above will best
promote both innovation and invention requires solving a larger scale, n-person cooperative dilemma. Rather than dyadic cooperation of the prestige and apprentice systems,
cultural systems that can create higher degrees of stable n-person cooperation, and in
which individuals share widely what they know and invent, will energize population rates
of both invention and innovation (see chapter 8, this volume). Cultural evolutionary
models targeting these larger-scale problems of cooperation have so far provided three
classes of potential solutions, one based on an interlocking reputational system that ties
n-person cooperation together with other dyadic social interactions (e.g., Panchanathan
and Boyd 2004), a second based on costly punishment of noncooperation and on the
punishment of nonpunishers (e.g., Henrich and Boyd 2001), and a third that exploits
cooperation as a form of signaling that distinguishes higher-quality partners from lowerquality partners (Gintis et al. 2001).
The ﬁrst approach depends on a reputational system in which failure to cooperate results
in acquiring a bad reputation such that others can withdraw their help (or increase their
hurting) during dyadic interactions that occur apart from the cooperative interaction. The
second approach relies on and combines the coexistence of culturally transmitted inﬂuences on cooperation and punishment (of noncooperators and nonpunishers), the reliance
of learners on conformist transmission as the payoff differences between alternative strategies approaches get smaller, and the geometrical decline in payoff differences between
prosocial strategies (involving cooperation and punishment) and selﬁsh strategies (defection and nonpunishment) as one ascends to high orders of punishment.2 The third approach

<-----Page 126----->114

Joseph Henrich

assumes that individuals vary in a nonobservable quality desired by potential partners and
can use cooperative or punishing behaviors to differentiate themselves.
All three solutions can solve, to varying degrees, the cooperative dilemma of information sharing laid out above. However, analyses of all three approaches demonstrate that
the mechanisms always stabilize a wide range of individually costly, non-group-beneﬁcial
behaviors and have an equilibrium at full defection. All three could stabilize, for example,
practices such as female inﬁbulations, footbinding, and taboos on nutritiously valuable
foods, as well as cooperative house building and widespread information sharing. This
means that all three require a mechanism of equilibrium selection (Henrich 2006a) beyond
what is presented in the basic models. That is, to be a complete solution, they require some
process that can pick out the group-beneﬁcial equilibrium from the myriad of noncooperative alternatives (see chapter 11, this volume).
Cultural Group Selection Solves the Equilibrium-Selection Dilemma
One important mechanism involved in equilibrium selection is cultural group selection
(Boyd and Richerson 2002; Henrich 2004a)—a label for a class of processes that arise
from the interaction of, and competition among, social groups. The idea is that different
groups will culturally evolve to different stable states involving the above mechanisms as
well as potentially many other mechanisms or combinations that theorists have not yet
dreamed up. Although internally stable, these different equilibrium, or institutional, forms
will vary in their facilitation and promotion of information sharing and cultural interconnectedness. Social groups with institutions that favor innovation, as a result of greater
interconnectedness or larger populations, will outcompete, as a result of cumulative cultural adaptation and technological evolution, those groups lacking such institutions (those
at other equilibria).3
Societies Lacking Institutions for Diffuse Information Sharing
One line of evidence for this approach comes from ethnographic studies of the small-scale
subsistence farmers whose seeming “conservatism” in adopting potentially beneﬁcial
novel technologies and practices has long puzzled policy makers and development economists (Hoffman 1996). My research among the Mapuche of southern Chile shows that
farmers know little of their neighbors’ successes or the details of their practices. Mapuche
farmers’ lack of knowledge regarding others’ success suppresses the effect of our adaptive
cultural learning mechanisms, which target the transmission of success-enhancing practices, techniques, or technologies. Even if success differences were noticed (as in crop
yields), any transmission will be error ridden and therefore less effective.
This lack of knowledge no doubt results from several factors, although both interviews
and observational data indicate that chief among these is that farmers actively hide information (new techniques) because they believe that if others know of their successes or
innovations they (the successful innovator) will be envied. Such envy could result in

<-----Page 127----->The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions

115

physical harm to them and their families, in the form of illness, injuries, crop failures, and
other forms of bad luck. Similarly, individuals who appear “too interested” in the business
of other households face reputational damage, as they may be perceived as motivated to
spread gossip that will result in envy and harm to the family. Although my Mapuche ﬁndings are more quantitative than most ethnographic work, the general image of how the
belief–reputation system works and how it might suppress innovation and diffusion is
quite consistent with economically similar populations in diverse geographic locations
(Banﬁeld 1958; Foster 1967; Redﬁeld 1953).
The cultural beliefs connecting envy and harm, which are amazingly widespread, have
also long been associated with perceptions of the world as a zero-sum game, meaning that
if you are doing better, then I and everyone else have to do a bit worse (Foster 1965,
1974). This perception (and sometimes this reality) is accompanied by a cultural system
of reputation that gives deviant innovators a bad reputation, which could subsequently
result in possible losses in dyadic exchanges and social ostracism. Such innovators are
seen as seeking to obtain more than their fair share from a ﬁxed pool of possible beneﬁts.
If they get more, everyone else gets less. Such combinations of beliefs can form a selfstabilizing cultural system because deviants, even if they reject the cultural beliefs themselves, are still motivated to avoid standing out, innovating, or appearing to be successful.
These kinds of cultural beliefs may dramatically suppress innovation and the rates of
cumulative cultural evolution.
This suggests that societies with cultural systems that connect envy and harm to witchcraft, suppress success displays, imbue curiosity with malevolent intentions, and perceive
the world as a zero sum will be outcompeted and assimilated by societies with cultural
beliefs and reputational systems that favor information sharing and open the pathways of
cultural transmission. Although research is just beginning on this question, I suspect that
such envy–witchcraft cultural systems are “easy to think,” in some sense, as they take
advantage of several aspects of our evolved cognition (Boyer 2001). They readily evolve
in certain ecological and economic circumstances (e.g., sedentary farming) and, once in
place, are quite stable.
Broadening the Spectrum: Culture–Gene Coevolution
We can take this line of reasoning back one more step: Cultural evolution, driven by
cultural-group selection, may help explain the evolution of our sophisticated cognitive
capacities for social learning and the emergence of cumulative cultural evolution. Many
species have some form of social learning, and some even show limited forms of imitation
(see chapter 3, this volume). However, no other species, with the possible exception of
birds and cetaceans relative to song transmission, has nontrivial amounts of cumulative
cultural evolution (Rendell and Whitehead 2001). Formal evolutionary models have suggested that there exists a “ﬁtness valley” between capacities for relatively simple lowﬁdelity social learning and the sophisticated cultural learning strategies found in humans

<-----Page 128----->116

Joseph Henrich

(Boyd and Richerson 1996). The evolutionary problem is that sophisticated cognitive
processes dedicated to cultural learning cannot pay for themselves in a ﬁtness sense until
there are lots of adaptive cultural behaviors in the world that could be acquired with high
ﬁdelity. This problem is exacerbated by the cooperative dilemma described above if only
one’s close kin (e.g., mom) are willing to share their behavioral repertoire (Henrich 2004b;
van Schaik and Pradhan 2003). This limits rather tightly the range of behavior one can
possibly acquire with the expensive cognitive machinery of cultural learning.
Chimpanzees, for example, show cultural traditions in the wild (Whiten et al. 1999) and
do reveal some weak imitation abilities (Whiten et al. 2003, 2005), yet chimpanzees do
not seem to accumulate nontrivial bodies of culturally acquired know-how (see chapter 3,
this volume). Most chimpanzee cultural transmission is limited to mothers and their offspring. As noted above, formal evolutionary models indicate that this lack of cultural
interconnectedness will inhibit cumulative cultural evolution, especially when transmission is of low ﬁdelity.
Thus, the question is, how might natural selection have bridged this ﬁtness valley to
create both sophisticated cultural learning and its consequent cumulative cultural evolution? I propose that if we begin with a human ancestor that is a “weak imitator” (like any
of the great apes) and possesses the cognitive abilities to acquire, however incompletely,
some social behavior by means of imitation and that lives in sufﬁciently large groups, then
cultural evolution could favor stable information sharing within the local group by any of
the three mechanisms described above. These mechanisms do not require any cumulative
cultural evolution, only a willingness to let all members of one’s group observe one another
performing practices or skills that they might want to learn.
Once such a local behavioral norm arises culturally, formal models show that the conditions favoring cumulative evolution are relaxed (Henrich 2004b) and the same weak imitative abilities that failed to produced cumulative cultural evolution before may now begin
to generate cumulative products. Once cumulative cultural products begin to emerge, two
things can ensue: (1) The ﬁtness valley is crossed, allowing natural selection to improve
cultural-learning capacities in order to take advantage of the emerging cumulative cultural
products in the group and the generally increased availability of things to learn, and
(2) the cumulative cultural products produced by the group will allow it to compete with
other social groups, thus spreading both the cultural norms of information sharing and the
genes for more sophisticated cultural learning.
Conclusion
My main points can be summarized as follows:
1. Innovation is fundamentally a social and cultural process. A population’s degree of
innovativeness need not be connected to the inventiveness of its members, given that a

<-----Page 129----->The Evolution of Innovation-Enhancing Institutions

117

highly interconnected population can have high innovativeness even when it has relatively
low inventiveness.
2. Given that invention is strongly inﬂuenced by recombination and luck, both larger
population size and greater interconnectedness will, all things being equal, increase inventiveness and innovation.
3. There is an inherent large-scale cooperative dilemma in generating high degrees of
cultural interconnectedness, and thus achieving high rates of innovation, that can be
solved only by the evolution of cooperative institutions. Without such institutions,
populations are limited in their ability to create interconnectedness and generate
innovations.
4. The rate of innovation we observe in the modern world is a product of long-term cultural evolutionary processes driven by competition among groups. Many human groups,
now and historically, did not readily share cultural information the way we routinely and
unconsciously do.
5. The cultural evolution of behavioral norms that increased groups’ cultural interconnectedness may have ignited an autocatalytic culture–gene coevolutionary interaction in
which accumulating cultural information continually ratcheted up the strength of natural
selection on genes to build brains for acquiring and storing culturally transmitted
information.
Notes
1. Prestige in this sense represents the aggregate of group members’ evaluations of who is skilled, successful,
and knowledgeable, that is, worthy of imitation. In a world of imperfect information, other people’s evaluations
are an important source of information for reﬁning one’s own evaluations of from whom to learn.
2. Such models are structured such that strategies of cooperation and defection apply to “order 1,” nonpunishment and punishment of defector to “order 2,” nonpunishment and punishment of nonpunisher at “order 2” to
“order 3,” and so on. Thus, the famed “second-order free-rider problem” focuses attention on sustaining the
punishment of defectors.
3. Given that the situation we are discussing here involves competition among stable equilibria, the concerns
often expressed about the plausibility of the genetic group selection of altruism do not apply (Henrich and
Henrich 2007).

Fashion versus Reason in the Creative Industries
R. Alexander Bentley

Almost by deﬁnition, creative expression involves the transmission of information between
individuals, with the continual production of new ideas, a minority of which rise to prominent genres or paradigms. In the creative industries, which rely on public dissemination,
the process can paradoxically be seen as a competition to “cooperate,” in the sense of a
race to be credited for sharing the most information. In academia, publishing pressures
drive researchers to compete for citations and other forms of wide-reaching, academically
sanctioned publicity (Hull 2001), particularly in the era of the Research Assessment Exercise (in Britain) and comprehensive citation databases such as ISI Web of Knowledge that
can summarize an academic’s career at a single command. As a result, academic competition for citations increasingly resembles other modern creative industries predicated on
the volume of “hits” (Bentley 2007a)—how many comments a blog received, how many
tickets were sold, how many copies of a song or video were downloaded, or how many
friends have linked to a MySpace page.
In many instances, competition for popularity or prominence drives diversiﬁcation and
the construction of new niches. In academia, the intense pressure to publish and to be cited
has led to the proliferation of new journals on almost every conceivable topic (e.g., Svetlov
2004). Similarly, in cyberspace there are more and more new Web-based venues for
uploading videos, blogs, pictures, and social-network home pages. Our modern opportunity to disseminate our own creative endeavors may be unprecedented on such a mass
scale, but on the personal or village scale, individual creative expression through craft
design extends deep into prehistory. This motivates the study of creative “industries” in
both prehistoric and modern contexts, as covered in this volume.
Innovation and Networks
Creative industries are practiced by people in social contexts (e.g., Bentley 2006; Earls
2007; Guimerà et al. 2005; O’Brien et al. 2005). In the Internet age, these contexts are
increasingly envisaged as networks, with each creative output (Web pages, media,

<-----Page 134----->122

R. Alexander Bentley

academic publications) seen as a “node,” its inﬂuences (cited references, related Web
pages) as “outgoing links,” and the works inﬂuenced by it (or referring back to it) as
“incoming links.” Since the late 1990s researchers, particularly in physics, have applied
generalized network analysis to a range of creative industries (Newman et al. 2006).
A challenge for network analysis, however, has been how to deal with change, given
that formulation of a network usually presupposes a structure to interactions. Once a
network is in place, the connections of today determine (often strongly) what will happen
tomorrow, such that change must be implemented as a modiﬁcation to the preexisting
network. However, in creative fashion and knowledge production, yesterday is often much
less important than tomorrow, and interactions are usually quite different from one day to
the next.
Change is not just a modiﬁcation but the very essence of the creative process (e.g.,
Bentley 2006; O’Brien 2008; Ormerod 2006; Shennan 2002). Change, in fact, is also
central to evolutionary theory. As Dennett (1996) argued in Darwin’s Dangerous Idea,
the tools and insights from over a century of evolutionary research can be applied to almost
any process of change that involves entities transmitting their attributes to other entities
through time.
In the creative industries, this transmission process is essentially one of copying what
others do, in which creativity contributes new behaviors that eventually replace the old
ones through being copied. Imitation is one of the hallmarks of the human species, and
while our propensity to “copy strips of words” famously irritated Orwell (1946), our
remarkable ability to imitate is, for better or worse, a prerequisite for culture itself. Even
academic scientists who do their research within complex collaboration networks (Guimerà
et al. 2005) are prone to copying ideas from one another (Bentley 2006; O’Brien et al.
2005; Simkin and Roychowdhury 2003, 2007). Counterintuitively, when things become
increasingly free and subject to fashion, the simple tendency to “do as the Romans do”
can nonetheless lead to homogeneity in collective behavior, conveying the illusion of
conscious conformity or imposed control.
With mechanisms of variation, transmission, and selection, knowledge creation is
entirely suitable for evolutionary analysis, particularly in evaluating the degree to which
ideas are selected versus randomly copied. It is useful to model a highly simpliﬁed spectrum ranging from ideas that are copied randomly among people as fashions to ideas that
are selected for inherent qualities (Bentley 2007b). Characterizing innovation along this
fashion–selection spectrum yields crucial insight into the dynamics of how certain behaviors increase or decline. As the spectrum becomes broadly deﬁned, the approach can be
made incrementally more complex through incorporating additional model parameters
tested against their real-world equivalents in the empirical data (Bentley et al. 2008).
Identifying selection is fundamental to understanding the nature of production of
knowledge, particularly what proceeds in predictable directions as opposed to drifting
upon the tides of fashion. If elements are randomly drifting, for example, it may make

<-----Page 135----->Fashion vs. Reason in the Creative Industries

123

little sense to invest much effort in trying to predict where things will lead, as a recent
experiment concerning popular music downloads demonstrated (Salganik et al. 2006).
Conversely, we may seek to impose a selective process where it is unexpectedly found
absent, as in scientiﬁc publishing, where we would hope that there is selection for quality
and validity.
We can examine databases to test differences between genres over the short, modern,
and long prehistoric timescales and within several different niches of knowledge production. It can be quite effective to propose only two simple hypotheses, which can be quantiﬁably tested for a given case study:
1. Ideas are randomly copied from one agent to another, with continual innovation.
2. Ideas are selected based on inherent meaningful value.
Given the hypothesized dichotomy, the major question in each case study is where
certain behaviors lie on the spectrum between random copying and selection. If we use
random copying as the null hypothesis, then we can identify selection against the null
before characterizing it speciﬁcally. Practically speaking, the random-copying model does
not require that people make choices without any reasons at all but instead only predicts
that the statistics of all their idiosyncratic choices, at the population level, are comparable
to random copying.
A century ago, economists made an extreme, but convenient, assumption about human
decision making: It is rational, omniscient, and utility maximizing. Symmetrically, random
copying is an opposite extreme: The random-copying model allows us to ask what would
we expect if everyone simply copied each other, with occasional innovation? It does not
mean that the forms of creative expression are themselves random, as they must obviously
be intelligible, but that they exist within a large set of possible forms, none of which is
inherently more useful than any other. In analogy to population genetics, these choices
can be considered “neutral” traits, in that what is chosen has no inherent value relative to
other options (Gillespie 2004; Hahn and Bentley 2003). For example, whether a mother
names her girl “Mandy” or “Marla” would depend only on who and how many already
have the name rather than on any qualities of the name itself.
Remarkably often, random multiplicative processes can be invoked to explain broad
patterns of fashion change. Prehistoric designs, trendy academic jargon, and mass-media
trends demonstrate the continual ﬂux and empirical patterns of random copying (Bentley
et al. 2004, 2007; O’Brien 1996; Salganik et al. 2006). When we look at closer scales
within this ﬂux, however, diverse opinions will exist as to what constitutes fashions versus
more substantial material, with little means of objective evaluation.
Once this null model of random copying is established, it is possible to identify selection speciﬁcally in favor of novelty, validity, or conformity, for example (see chapter 7,
this volume). For the “selection” end of the spectrum, we have a wealth of models of

independent decision makers who weigh the costs and beneﬁts of their options while
subject to various biases of inﬂuence (e.g., Gintis 2007). This applies well to behaviors
that serve some adaptive purpose, that is, that matter to human values or to the spread of
a useful idea (e.g., Henrich 2001; Rogers 1962; chapters 7 and 12, this volume). Even a
display of fashion, if it carries some meaningful signal (e.g., mating potential), can be seen
as subject to cost–beneﬁt decisions (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005). Generally speaking,
with independent rational selection, creative culture should converge on the collective
priorities of individuals rather than drift constantly (Surowiecki 2004).
Against this background, some interesting phenomena become visible. In one study, my
colleagues and I (Herzog et al. 2004) used the expectations under random copying as the
background on which to ﬁt data on dog-breed popularity in the twentieth century. The
rapid rise and fall of Dalmatians was clearly visible just after 1984 (see ﬁgure 8.1). The
reason for the spike in Dalmatian popularity was surely the rerelease of the Disney movie
101 Dalmatians. However, not all movies have this “celebrity effect,” and the point is that
we were able to identify the Dalmatians as a special case only because we had the null
model of random copying (drift) to test against.
Ultimately, we might seek to explore how much we can explain through random processes, at each scale, before resorting to post hoc “reasons” such as individual selection
for one thing or another. The scale of analysis is thus a key variable. For example, although
choices of baby names at the scale of the entire United States is indistinguishable from
random copying (Hahn and Bentley 2003), it is also evident that different ethnic groups
select from different pools of names (Fryer and Levitt 2004). Therefore, with selection
evident between groups, it could well be (and remains to be studied) that within each
group, random drift could predominate again at that even ﬁner scale. In this sense, the

<-----Page 137----->Fashion vs. Reason in the Creative Industries

125

random-copying model helps us identify the scale at which selection is exerted, which
may help to deﬁne the groups themselves.
A Case Study: Fashion versus Selection in Academic Publishing
Ideally, science is the systematic process of testing multiple hypotheses, but as practiced
by real people, it is also distinctly social. Academics do their research within complex
collaboration networks (e.g., Guimerà et al. 2005) and are prone to copying ideas from
one another. Diverse opinions exist as to what constitutes trendy ideas versus more meaningful research paradigms; however, there is yet little means of evaluating this
objectively.
Evolutionary theory offers a means of modeling these aspects of scientiﬁc process (Hull
2001). By applying basic population-genetic analogy to citations-database research, we
can characterize the use of modern scientiﬁc keywords in terms of a continuum between
the copying of fashionable ideas at one extreme (akin to the neutral model of random
genetic drift) and the independent selective testing of hypotheses at the other (akin to
selection, falsifying the neutral model). Among our several cases, we test differences
between subﬁelds older versus younger and within the physical sciences versus the social
sciences. In doing so, we ﬁnd some remarkable regularities, suggesting that the physical
and social sciences are equally “trendy” when it comes to the comings and goings of
popular keywords.
Following the discussion above, two simple hypotheses for the evolution of academic
vocabulary are that vocabulary is randomly copied from one paper to another, with continual innovation, or vocabulary is selected based on the inherent meaningful value of the
words. The question is one of degree, with variation expected along this basic continuum.
Using random copying as the null hypothesis, we seek to identify selection against the
null without characterizing it speciﬁcally, although the most obvious form would be
selected for validity of the words that usefully describe something real and relevant to the
topic. Selection versus random copying becomes the primary axis on which to characterize
the process, and predictable patterns in the data can characterize their degrees of importance for a given academic ﬁeld of study. If this can be achieved, it would then be possible
to identify secondary effects, such as a bias in favor of novelty and against conformity.
Again, by using “random copying” as the null model, I do not mean that the words
themselves are random, as they obviously will be intelligible, but that they would exist
within a large set of possible keywords, none of which is inherently more useful than any
other. Analogous to the neutral model of population genetics (Gillespie 2004), randomly
copied keywords would be value neutral.
The random-copying model can be modeled as follows. We start with a set of N individuals, which are replaced by N new individuals in each generation. Over successive

<-----Page 138----->126

R. Alexander Bentley

generations, each of the N new individuals copies its variant from a randomly selected
individual in the previous generation, with the exception of a small fraction, m (less than
5 percent) of the N new individuals, who invent a new variant in the current generation.
In applying this to keyword use, we consider N to represent the number of keywords in a
given time period rather than the number of articles, which vary in their number of keywords. This ensures that each “individual” corresponds with exactly one variant.
This model is simple to simulate (Hahn and Bentley 2003; Neiman 1995) yet provides
richly complex results that produce at least three useful predictions relevant to cultural
drift:
1. Individual frequencies through time: If we track individual variants through the generations, their frequencies (relative popularities) will change in a stochastic manner as opposed
to either a directed or completely random manner. More speciﬁcally, the haploid neutral
model predicts that the only source of change in variant frequencies over time is random
sampling, such that (Gillespie 2004)
V=

v(1 − v )
,
N

(8.1)

where V is the variance in frequencies from one time step to the next and ␯ ≤ 1 is the relative frequency of the variant as a fraction of N, the maximum possible number of variant
copies per generation. For small ␯, ␯(1 − ␯) ~ ␯, which after rearranging equation 1 indicates that NV/␯ ~ 1. This means that departures from the neutral model may be identiﬁed
by values of NV/␯ substantially different than one. If the values were much less than one,
there might be some stabilizing selective phenomenon reducing variability, whereas values
much greater than one could occur for different reasons, such as a variant steadily rising
or decreasing in frequency as a result of selection. The point is that the NV/␯ value provides
a means of identifying selection so that when we apply “reasons” for change, we can be
conﬁdent the change is not simply a result of random drift.
2. Frequency distributions: Like many “rich-get-richer” processes (under random copying,
the chance of being copied is proportional to current frequency), the variant frequencies
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, which for small values of m can follow a power-law
form (Bentley et al. 2004; Hahn and Bentley 2003; Kimura and Crow 1964). This is one
of the less diagnostic predictions, as a variety of mechanisms can generate power-law
and related distributions (Newman 2005). With selective bias for novelty, for example,
we would expect newly invented variants to rise quickly from obscurity and fall precipitously after reaching some threshold of popularity, as well as a truncation of the tail of
the variant frequency distribution such that very high frequencies are absent. Alternatively, there might be a conformist bias, resulting in a “winner-take-all” distribution,
whereby one word has a higher frequency than predicted by the power law for the rest
of the words.

<-----Page 139----->Fashion vs. Reason in the Creative Industries

127

3. Turnover: There is continual turnover in the variant pool. If the variants are ranked in
order of decreasing frequency, the turnover, z, in that list over successive generations
(time) depends much more strongly on m than on N, such that
z ≈ μ,

(8.2)

where z is measured as the fraction of turnover in the list (Bentley et al. 2007). In contrast
to random copying, under selection the population size, N, should correlate positively with
the turnover rate in the ranked list of most-popular variants.
Using these predictions as the null model, we can identify selection as departures from
these patterns, depending on the kind of selection operating.
Data
In order to perform our analysis, we need a working deﬁnition of a subﬁeld of academic
publishing. If belabored, this could be quite a difﬁcult task—many deﬁnitions would be
too subjective, variable, or broad (e.g., certain papers in “evolutionary anthropology”
might often have more in common with “developmental biology” than with other subﬁelds
of anthropology). A more promising deﬁnition is the scientiﬁc “paradigm” (Kuhn 1962),
which encompasses all the scientiﬁc papers that were in some way inspired by a certain
highly inﬂuential paper. The citing papers may occur in a range of different journals, but
they will all share the deﬁning characteristic of citing the highly inﬂuential work. I recognize the ambiguities (e.g., differences in importance of the seminal work among all
papers citing it), but at least this deﬁnition applies consistently across our examples,
without the subjectivity that many other deﬁnitions would require.
I chose four highly cited seminal works, two from the natural sciences and two from
the social sciences. To determine the effect of time, from the pair in each category I include
one work about 30 years old and another about 10 years old. This provides two comparisons: older versus younger ﬁelds of study and social sciences versus physical sciences.
From the physical sciences, we have a paper by Barabási and Albert (1999) that introduced
a quantitative model of “scale-free networks” and had been cited over 2,000 times (as
listed on the ISI database) and a paper by Witten and Sander (1981) that introduced the
physics model of “diffusion limited aggregation” and had been cited over 1,300 times.
From the social sciences, I selected a paper by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) that reviewed
the inﬂuential concept of “social capital” and had been cited over 460 times and a book
by Bordieu (1977), cited over 2,700 times, that introduced concepts of agency and structuration into the social sciences. These publications are abbreviated below as PS99, PS81,
SS98, and SS77 (where PS stands for “physical sciences” and SS for “social sciences”).
For each deﬁned data set, I sorted the keywords data from the ISI database by publication year.1 Keywords were taken only from the article title and the keywords chosen by
the authors (not the ISI “Keywords plus,” which is an automated condensation of the cited

<-----Page 140----->128

references). Before exploring patterns, I removed the following common words from the
data: “a,” “an,” “and,” “as,” “by,” “for,” “from,” “in,” “its,” “of,” “on,” “the,” “to,”
“using,” and “with.” Aside from these, no other common words were present in high
enough frequencies to signiﬁcantly affect the top ﬁve most popular or the frequency
distributions.
Results
Figure 8.2 shows the number of keywords, N, for each case study per year as well as the
number of new keywords per year, Nm. Table 8.1 shows the mean values for the period
2002 through 2006, which I chose because it is shared by all four case studies and is long
enough after the start of the younger paradigms to create sufﬁcient sample size. In all
cases, the quantities N and Nm parallel each other (see ﬁgure 8.2), indicating a relatively
consistent invention rate, m, in all cases. A “new” keyword is deﬁned as one that had not
yet appeared in the record. I began recording at 1994 for the older works and on the date
of publication (1998, 1999) for the younger works. As the corpus of previously used words
grows with time, the invention rate declines (see table 8.1). The invention rate for all cases
was between 14 percent and 18 percent by the end of the sampling period (see table 8.1).
In terms of cumulative turnover among keywords (see ﬁgure 8.3), we can see a gradation from the continual turnover expected under random copying with innovation to the
cessation of turnover expected under selection. Among the papers citing the younger,
physical science paper (PS99), the turnover in the top ﬁve keywords begins steadily in the

physical sciences; open symbols and dashed lines show social sciences. In (a), words reentering the top ﬁve are

For the older paradigms (Bordieu 1977; Witten and Sander 1981), the count is begun at zero in 1994; for the
newer articles (Barabási and Albert 1999; Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998), the count begins the year after
publication.

early years but then levels off to virtually no turnover in the past several years. At the
other end of the spectrum, keywords in the older, social science case (SS77) show a high
and steady turnover throughout the sampling period, long after its publication and many
years beyond which the other case had leveled off. In the older natural science case (PS81),
turnover is continual when words reentering the top ﬁve are counted (ﬁgure 8.3a), but the
turnover ceases when repeats are not allowed (ﬁgure 8.3b). This pattern appears to reﬂect
recurrent ups and downs of the most frequent words, in and out of the top ﬁve, such that
they register as turnover only if repeat entrants are counted. It could reﬂect selection if,
for example, a set of words had been selected as more useful than any others, but within
that set of top words there was drift.
Figure 8.4, showing the changes in frequencies of the top ﬁve keywords of 2006, helps
explain the turnover patterns. The lack of turnover in PS99 is demonstrated by the striking
ordering of the individual word frequencies through time (see ﬁgure 8.4a). In fact, sorting

top ﬁve. This degree of sorting is not present in the other cases, except for the clear
supremacy of the number-one keyword (social) in the case of SS77. As suggested from
the turnover pattern, PS81 does appear to exhibit a group of three keywords (fractal,
growth, aggregation) that are consistently on top as a group, but there is drift within that
group (see ﬁgure 8.4c). Given the patterns seen so far, it would appear that PS99 shows
the most selection, followed by PS81, SS77, and SS98.
As mentioned above, however, we must factor out the effect of the number of keywords
N in each case. This is achieved with the ratio NV/␯, which should approximate unity
under the neutral model, so we can use it as a comparable measure of variability. Table
8.2 shows the value of NV/␯ for the top ﬁve keywords of 2006 that were also tracked in
ﬁgure 8.4. Averaged over these ﬁve variants, NV/␯ differs more by age of the paradigm
than by subject matter—higher for the younger (~2.3) than for the older (1.3–1.4) paradigms. Among the older paradigms, drift seems to be the primary operation—even for
PS81, if the top three words have been selected, they are now drifting within that selected
group.
Among the younger works, however, the high variability scores may come for different
reasons. Table 8.2 also demonstrates noticeable variation in the scores for each word. In
the PS99 case, the word “complex” (word 3, score = 5.8) appears to have been selected
for, as it doubled in frequency from 2002 to 2006, beyond what would be expected from
random drift. Also in the PS99 case, “networks” (word 1) declined steadily as “network”
(word 2) increased, such that their variability scores are near 2. By contrast, words in the
SS98 case do not show such directionality in their change, and the high variability scores
for four of the ﬁve words (see table 8.2) is a result of their ﬂuctuating frequencies over
the time interval (see ﬁgure 8.4b).
Table 8.2 reveals other interesting details. In the SS77 case, words generally get more
variable moving down the rankings, which suggests a possible conformist bias in that the
more frequent words have been preferentially selected. In the PS81 case, the word “aggregation” (word 2, score = 0.3) is considerably less variable than “diffusion” (word 5, score
= 2.7), even though the seminal paper was about diffusion-limited aggregation.

Cumulative frequency distribution of all keywords, for two time intervals, 2001 (open circles, dashed line) and

(c) Witten and Sander (1981), and (d) Bordieu (1977). Double logarithmic axes, with lines showing best ﬁt
power-law slopes in 2001 and 2005, respectively, are as follows: (a) 1.67, 1.25; r2 > 0.99; (b) 1.70, 1.75;
r2 > 0.98; (c) 1.58, 1.41; r2 > 0.881; (d) 2.23, 2.05; r2 > 0.984.

Finally, we look at the frequency distributions of keywords for two different time
slices—years 2001 and 2005 (see ﬁgure 8.5). All show essentially a power-law form. For
each age pair, the power-law slope of the social science case is steeper than for natural
sciences (ﬁgure 8.5). Simulations of the neutral model (Bentley et al. 2004) indicate that
the power-law slope increases with the number of inventions, Nm, per generation. Whereas
mean number of inventions is higher for SS77 than for PS81, the invention rate for PS99
is actually higher than for SS98 (see table 8.1). In fact, PS99 is again exceptional compared
with the other three cases, as it is the only case for which the power-law slope changes
substantially from 2001 to 2005 (see ﬁgure 8.5). These patterns support the case for selection in consideration of the rapid growth in references to PS99 and consequent increase
in N and Nm over the time period (see ﬁgure 8.2). Even as more keywords were added to

<-----Page 145----->Fashion vs. Reason in the Creative Industries

133

the PS99 pool, the distribution became more unequal (see ﬁgure 8.5a). A likely explanation is that the core ideas expressed in PS99 (e.g., complex networks) were being selected
for in other ﬁelds of study.
Departures from the power law support the case for selection of groups of several
words. In two cases, SS98 and PS81 (ﬁgure 8.5b and 8.5c), there appears to be selection for the top three or four words (and they are the same words in 2001 and 2005
for both cases), such that their frequencies are almost the same rather than following
the power law.
Discussion
Some basic evolutionary analyses, with parallels in population genetics, can be used to
characterize different forms of innovation and transmission of discrete cultural elements
(Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981). In the case of academic-language use, it shows that
some academic ﬁelds are clearly characterized by a high degree of drift resulting in continual and unpredictable change in vocabulary, whereas in others it is quite different, with
words under selection, such that the predominant vocabulary becomes increasingly crystallized and unchanging over time.
In my application to four examples of academic paradigms in the journal literature, I
found that one could characterize relative differences in the degree of selection versus drift
in keyword use. Over a several-year interval, the natural sciences paradigms (PS81 and
PS99) reﬂected a greater degree of selection in cessation in the turnover of their top ﬁve
keywords, with the younger case (PS99) showing clear sorting of those keywords by
frequency, and the older case (PS81) suggesting the selection of a top group of several
words that created a departure in the tail of the power-law distribution of keyword frequencies. Selection appears strongest in the younger natural science example because its
keyword frequency distribution became more unequal (smaller power-law exponent) over
time, with top words growing in popularity despite an increasing number of new keywords
added to the pool of choices.
In contrast, the social science examples showed more indications of drift, consistent
with the neutral model. These indications included continual turnover in the top ﬁve keywords, steeper power-law distributions (higher exponent) than their natural science counterparts of similar age, and high variability in the frequencies of individual keywords.
Unlike the younger natural science paradigm (PS99), keyword frequencies in the younger
social science example (SS98) varied stochastically rather than directionally.
The use of evolutionary analysis also made it possible to identify different dynamics
among individual keywords, suggesting some individual words were subject to stronger
selection than others. These effects could be identiﬁed and compared only once the effects
of population size and relative frequencies were factored out, because frequency variance

<-----Page 146----->134

over time decreases with population size and increases with frequency for small frequencies. Hence, without having some idea of these variables, it is difﬁcult to distinguish
purposeful selection from random drift.
Conclusions
As humans behaving within heterogeneous networks of information, we may often have
the impression that a certain genre of culture is trendy, conformist, or rigidly unchanging,
and yet rarely do we employ an objective means for supporting such intuitions, much less
understand how they came about. As much of this volume should demonstrate, basic
evolutionary theory, long invoked to explain change through time in biology, provides
objectivity for characterizing culture change.
An alternative, objective approach is the revitalized efforts at social modeling within
the physical sciences, particularly in network science. However, if we view culture change
as a historical science rather than a law-like one such as classical physics, then evolution
may be the only theory to explain cultural variation and transmission in a causal way (e.g.,
Mesoudi et al. 2006; O’Brien 2008; Shennan 2002). The direct analogy between people
and particles (or network nodes) in “social-atom” models (Buchanan 2007) depends on
the assumed rules of interaction, which often stray too far from reality (Riede and Bentley
2008). Whereas variation in physics is often treated as “noise,” it is the essence of an
evolutionary approach. Current evolutionary theory inherits the insights of over a century
of studying what amounts to change among entities that pass on their similarities to others
through time. Our two conference organizers have been among the leaders in applying
this to studies of culture change, particularly in archaeology (e.g., O’Brien 1996, 2008;
Shennan 2002).
The selection–fashion dichotomy that I have advocated is perhaps more palatable in
today’s world than it was in previous decades, when labor unions were strong, the Internet
was a novelty of U.S. government agencies, and academic publication was still done on
real paper. Now, however, after the rapid rise and fall of dot-com equities, YouTube
videos, MySpace personalities, and countless throwaway books, ideas of random copying
and drift are much easier for people to digest. In fact, the evolutionary approach is spreading. Since the mid-1990s, growing numbers of physicists have started explicitly applying
analyses of dynamic, historical processes of change—such as network evolution, complex
adaptive systems, information cascades, sudden state changes, and extreme events—
toward models of social change (e.g., Bentley 2007c; Bentley and Maschner 2008;
Buchanan 2007). Similarly, some economists are beginning to focus on the ﬂux of variation in open systems rather than the maintenance of equilibrium in closed systems
(Ormerod 1998, 2006). I can only imagine what the future of innovation studies will
look like.

Demography and Variation in the Accumulation of Culturally
Inherited Skills
Adam Powell, Stephen J. Shennan, and Mark G. Thomas

In this chapter we introduce a simulation-based extension to an analytical model of cultural
skill transmission presented by Henrich and Boyd (2002; Henrich 2004). Their original
model derived the conditions necessary for a culturally inherited innovation, or cultural
skill, to accumulate in a single population under a learning process that is both incomplete
and inaccurate. Our simulation model extends these results by placing a modiﬁed version
of their learning mechanism into a semirealistic human demographic setting with the aim
of applying it in the context of the Upper Paleolithic transition. This was a pivotal period
in human prehistory—the ﬁrst sustained appearance of behavioral modernity—in which
dramatic geographic and temporal variation in cultural innovation is evident. Although
the invention of novel cultural skills or behaviors typical of the Upper Paleolithic is likely
to have been stimulated by demographic pressures, cognitive advances, and environmental
challenges, our simulation model is concerned solely with the long-term accumulation, or
loss, of such cultural inventions. We propose that it is the maintenance, and not the invention, of novel traits that is of real interest and that this maintenance is limited by demographic factors. Our model is able to determine the demographic conditions necessary for
a cultural skill to be maintained (or accumulate) over a period of many generations, and
we argue that Late Pleistocene demography would have been an important factor in the
appearance of the cumulative and complex cultural innovations characteristic of behavioral
modernity.
The Upper Paleolithic transition, which occurred in Europe and western Asia ~45 thousand years ago (kya; Mellars 2005) and later in southern and eastern Asia (James and
Petraglia 2005), Australia (Brumm and Moore 2005), and Africa (referred to as the Late
Stone Age [Ambrose 1998a]), is seen by many as marking the origin of modern human
behavior. This transition is characterized by a signiﬁcant increase in both technological
and cultural complexity, including the ﬁrst consistent appearance of symbolic representation, and is often interpreted as evidence of the ﬁrst “fully” modern human populations.
Bar-Yosef (2002) summarizes the main features characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic
as follows:

<-----Page 150----->138

• Rapid shifts in core-reduction techniques, leading to a proliferation of different microlithic stone tools, with blades largely replacing ﬂakes.
• The use of bone, antler, and ivory in production of both functional tools and ritual
artifacts.
• The systematic use of grinding/pounding stone tools to process plant food.
• Regular use of various body decorations from a wide variety of materials (including
shells, teeth, ivory, and ostrich-egg shells), possibly signaling increasingly complex and/
or frequent social interactions.
• The invention of improved hunting technology, such as spear throwers, bows, and boomerangs, potentially bringing much higher rates of hunting success.
• The appearance of art, both abstract and realistic, in the form of painting, engraving,
and carved ﬁgurines.
• Unequivocal ritual burial, although there is also evidence of sporadic use of grave goods
in Middle Paleolithic burials such as at Skhul V.
• A signiﬁcant increase in the transfer distance of lithic and valuable raw materials.
In Europe and western Asia, this relatively rapid transition is widely thought to coincide
with the expansion of Homo sapiens into a region previously occupied by Neanderthals
(Bar-Yosef 2002; Zilhão 2007), leading to a period of coexistence of the two human
lineages before the eventual extinction of the latter ~30 kya (Stiner and Kuhn 2006). For
Africa, however, the idea of a short “seminal” transition has been contested by many
authors, as there is evidence of many of these “markers of modernity” appearing at multiple sites across Africa well before 45 kya, possibly as early as 75–80 kya (Bar-Yosef 2002;
Henshilwood et al. 2004; McBrearty and Brooks 2000), and most recently claimed for
more than 160 kya in southern Africa (Marean et al. 2007). Yet these are sporadically
maintained and are, in all cases, lost until the Late Stone Age, starting ~40 kya, when they
again appear and become prevalent.
Archaeological evidence from South Asia and Australia appears more similar to the
African case, with only sparse evidence of modernity—ornamentation, use of ochre, and
possible rock art—occurring soon after the initial human expansions into the regions and
becoming widespread only much later—~20 kya (Brumm and Moore 2005) in Australia
and ~30 kya (James and Petraglia 2005) in southern Asia. Conversely, it has been argued
that some late Neanderthal populations show features of behavioral modernity independent
of any contact with modern humans (Conard 2005; Zilhão 2007).
Notwithstanding the oversimpliﬁcations made in the above outline, one important largescale question remains: If, as is now widely accepted, anatomically modern humans
(H. sapiens) originated in Africa between 150 kya and 200 kya (Lahr and Foley 1998;
McBrearty and Brooks 2000; White et al. 2003), why was there such a long delay before

<-----Page 151----->The Accumulation of Culturally Inherited Skills

139

the ﬁrst consistent archaeological evidence for modern human behavior? One approach
(Klein 2000) is to argue that the transition, or “human revolution,” was a result of some
kind of biological–neural mutation ~50 kya, which led to an increase in cognitive capacity,
thus allowing an explosion of cultural and technological innovation.
Critics of this theory point to the low likelihood of this putative mutation having
occurred independently in the many geographically separated human populations that
would have existed at this time, given that there is no evidence for a second wave of Old
World colonization by a group with such a mutation. Other authors (e.g., Lahr and Foley
1998; McBrearty and Brooks 2000) argue that the unambiguous evidence of modernity
displayed in the African Middle Stone Age suggests that H. sapiens had the requisite
cognitive capacity to be considered “fully modern” almost from the time of origin.
Some of the most notable examples of this African evidence associated with early
modern humans are the (probably) hafted hunting weapons made of geometric blades of
the Howiesons Poort industry in southern Africa (~55–70 kya; Lombard 2008), the series
of barbed bone harpoon points at Katanda, Democratic Republic of the Congo (~90 kya;
McBrearty and Brooks 2000), and the bone awls, pieces of ochre with abstract designs,
and marine-shell personal ornaments at Blombos, South Africa (~74 kya; Zilhão 2007).
The arrival of anatomically modern humans in Australia (then part of the extended
continent Sahul) dates to ~40–50 kya (Hudjashov et al. 2007; O’Connell and Allen 2004).
Given that mastery of seaworthy technology would have been necessary to make the
clearly intentional crossings of the Wallacean archipelago, a major ecological boundary,
we can suggest that by that time H. sapiens had attained a modern level of cognition.
Numerous authors (Brumm and Moore 2005; James and Petraglia 2005; Lahr and Foley
1998; McBrearty and Brooks 2000; Shennan 2000, 2001; Zilhão 2007) view the emergence and consistent maintenance of modern cultural artifacts as a product of underlying
demographic and associated sociological processes, although there are differences in the
speciﬁc mechanisms invoked by different authors (see below). The basis of this view is
the temporal correlation between the expansion and maintenance of modern human culture
and the indication of major demographic expansion.
Our knowledge of late-Pleistocene demography remains extremely poor even in the best
known regions of the world, but there is much evidence that populations were small in
Africa and Eurasia until c. 50 kya, after which they are likely to have expanded rapidly.
Stiner and Kuhn (2006) point to the narrow diet breadth and lack of impact on demographically sensitive small-game resources during the Middle Paleolithic in the circumMediterranean area as an indicator that population levels remained low. This is corroborated
for some regions by site numbers (Lahr and Foley 2003; van Andel et al. 2003). Stiner
and Kuhn (2006) propose that during the Middle Paleolithic, human populations responded
to resource ﬂuctuations by localized depopulation, and they suggest that human-population
patterns corresponded to what we know about the population dynamics and low levels of
large nonhuman predators.

<-----Page 152----->140

A. Powell, S. J. Shennan, and M. G. Thomas

Genetic evidence also points to marked increases in human populations in the late
Pleistocene (Harpending et al. 1993; Rogers 1995; Sherry et al. 1994), and it has been
argued that in Africa this expansion is associated with the improvement in climatic conditions associated with the end of Oxygen Isotope Stage 4 (Ambrose 1998b). The idea that
there is a connection between demographic and cultural patterns and that both are affected
by climate has been strengthened by recent work in Australia (Brumm and Moore 2005;
O’Connell and Allen 2007), which seems to show a pattern similar to that seen in Africa
but at a much later date. Thus, although Australia was colonized by modern humans
~40–45 kya, it shows only sporadic evidence of such phenomena as ornaments and burials
for at least the next 20 millennia. It is only after 20 kya that they start to become more
frequent and only in the early Holocene that they really become established, a pattern that
seems to correlate with an order of magnitude increase in population size (Haberle and
David 2004; O’Connell and Allen 2007). In this case, the improved climatic conditions
of Holocene Australia are considered to be the most plausible causal factor (O’Connell
and Allen 2007).
Models of the Relationship between Culture and Demography
Although many authors have postulated a link between the size of human populations
and variation in the extent of cultural elaboration, the precise mechanism involved is
unspeciﬁed in many, if not most, cases. However, three speciﬁc proposals have been
made, none of them necessarily mutually exclusive. Several authors (O’Connell and
Allen 2007; Stiner and Kuhn 2006; Vanhaeren 2005) propose that as populations
increased, there would have been selective pressure for increasing use of various kinds
of cultural-signaling mechanisms to strengthen social networks or to mark various kinds
of identity, for example. In contrast, the two other models focus on processes of cultural
transmission.
Some authors (e.g., Boyd and Richerson 1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981;
Lumsden and Wilson 1981) have argued that human culture can be considered as an
inheritance system, in some ways analogous to genetic inheritance, which is subject to
evolutionary processes. They show that we can view human culture as a set of traits or
behaviors that can be transmitted between individuals through a process of social learning,
where “naive” copiers make inferences about the underlying behavior or trait based on its
outward expression by a cultural model.
Of course, the mode of cultural transmission is different from that of genetic inheritance,
as cultural traits can be transmitted not only from genetic parent to child (vertical transmission) but also from nonparental members of a group (oblique transmission) and between
peers (horizontal transmission). Variation in these cultural traits is generated either at the
learning stage, through mistakes in the inferential process (random copying error), by

<-----Page 153----->The Accumulation of Culturally Inherited Skills

deliberate innovation, or by combining the traits of multiple cultural models, when the
trait is expressed by the copier (a cognitive process).
An important component required of any evolutionary system is that of the differential
success of variants in a population; in the case of cultural evolution this is driven by a
number of mechanisms. These “forces of cultural evolution” (Boyd and Richerson 1985)
include “cultural drift,” which causes ﬂuctuations in cultural-variant frequencies over time
due to sampling error in populations of ﬁnite size; “guided variation,” in which individuals
modify their socially learned cultural variants through their own process of trial and error;
and “biased transmission,” where learners adopt a cultural variant preferentially (nonrandomly) as a result of (1) some intrinsic quality of the trait, (2) behavior itself (“directly
biased transmission”), (3) a perceived quality of the cultural model that possesses it (“indirectly biased transmission”), or (4) the relative frequency of the variant in the population
(“frequency-dependent biased transmission”). Thus, change over time in the frequencies
of different cultural variants and their subsequent material expression in the archaeological
record can be viewed as a result of these various processes of cultural evolution acting on
socially learned traits, skills, or behaviors.
A review of the ethnographic literature (Shennan and Steele 1999) on the learning of
craft skills shows that transmission in hunter–gatherer populations is almost exclusively
vertical/oblique and is in many cases between parent and offspring of the same gender.
This ﬁnding is consistent with the results of a model-based treatment of African cultural
variation (Guglielmino et al. 1995), which found that the more conservative modes of
cultural transmission (vertical/oblique) best explain the distribution of variation observed.
It seems reasonable to assume that the mode of transmission of cultural skills within Late
Pleistocene human populations would have been comparable to these contemporary
hunter–gatherer groups.
In Shennan’s (2001) simulation model based on Peck (1996; Peck et al. 1997), the
mechanism that linked population size and variation in (beneﬁcial) cultural accumulation
was drift. It was shown that when cultural-innovation processes take place and the results
are passed on by a combination of vertical and oblique transmission, larger populations
have a major advantage over smaller ones. Members of larger populations are, on average,
both biologically more ﬁt and more attractive as models for imitation by virtue of the fact
that the deleterious sampling effects present in small populations decline as population
sizes increase. When populations are small, innovations that are less beneﬁcial reproductively and less attractive to imitate are more likely to be maintained within them, that is,
they have a greater “drift load.”
A different transmission model, one based on the varying difﬁculty of learning different skills and the associated probability of achieving an improvement, was proposed
by Henrich and Boyd (2002) and applied to explain the well-known pattern of cultural
loss in Holocene Tasmania (Henrich 2004). This analytical model showed that under
certain conditions, dependent on the population size (discussed below), the “cumulative

<-----Page 154----->142

adaptive evolution” of a cultural skill can occur, whereas in other circumstances a
process of devolution and cultural loss will follow. Here we extend this model by using
semirealistic stochastic simulations that reﬂect plausible human demographic conditions
during the Pleistocene and take into account some of the drift issues highlighted in
Shennan (2001).
The Henrich and Boyd Model
The model assumes a population of N adults, that is, “encultured” individuals, i = 1,
2, . . . N, each of which has a z value, zi, a measure of its ability at some cultural skill,
such as making arrowheads. Every adult individual is also characterized by a variable, f,
that speciﬁes the relative likelihood of being chosen as a cultural model by members of a
subsequent generation. The authors (see Henrich [2004] for full details) make use of the
Price equation, a means of delineating the processes at work within any evolutionary
system (Frank 1995; Price 1970), to measure Δz̄, the change in the average z value in the
population over time:
Δ z = Cov ( fi, zi ) + E ( fi Δzi )

(9.1)

The two terms on the right-hand side can be thought of, respectively, as the change in
the average z value resulting from cultural selection, that is, the propensity to copy successful or skilled people, and the change resulting from the inaccurate transmission
process. Where Δz̄ is positive, “cumulative adaptive evolution” is occurring, with the
average ability at the cultural skill increasing over time within the modeled population. In
order to replicate the “incomplete and inaccurate” processes of inference, copiers in subsequent generations never exactly replicate the z value of their models. An individual
attempting to copy a model with z value zi gains a value drawn from a Gumbel distribution
(Henrich [2004] notes that the speciﬁc form of distribution does not qualitatively affect
any derived results) with mode (zi − α) and dispersion parameter β, meaning that the
transmission process is, ﬁrst, systematically biased, as, on average, a copier will end up
with a z value less than that of his or her model by an amount α, and, second, “noisy,” so
that there is a small probability (the area under the distribution greater than the model’s
z value), monotonically related to β and inversely related to α, that copiers will gain a
z value greater than that of their model.
The model stipulates that all social learners choose the most-skilled member of the
previous generation as their oblique model, and the following equation is derived:
Δ z = −α + β (ε + ln ( N ))

(9.2)

The ﬁrst term on the right represents the deleterious effect of systematic bias, and the
second describes the opposing, favorable effect of random noise (ε being the Euler-gamma
constant ≈ 0.577) and is a proxy measure of the area of the distribution greater than the

will result in adaptive accumulation, the authors set Δz̄ > 0 and rearrange (9.2) to get

(9.3)

where N* is the critical number of social learners necessary for a speciﬁc process of imitation deﬁned by (α, β). (See ﬁgure 9.2.)
The main conclusion of interest here is that the cumulative adaptive evolution of a
culturally inherited skill is dependent on the size of the pool of social learners N, so a
larger population (subject to the same level of noise in the imitation process) would be
able to accumulate and maintain a more “complex” skill. As the critical conditions for
adaptive evolution depend solely on the ratio α/β, and if we assume that all modern human
populations, on average, would have been subject to similar levels of random noise during
the inheritance of cultural skills, we can effectively combine the two parameters α and β
by setting β = 1 and then simply adjusting the parameter α to simulate cultural skills of
varying “complexity.”
One assumption inherent in the model is the unfailing ability of naive individuals to
accurately identify the most skilled member of the preceding generation as an oblique
model—an assumption that rapidly becomes unrealistic as the size of the adult population
increases beyond the size of a sustainable social network. By imbedding an extended
version of the transmission process previously described (to include both vertical and
oblique transmission) into a semirealistic simulation that estimates conditions during the
Late Pleistocene—that is, a number of geographically separate subpopulations connected

by migratory activity—we can relax this assumption and further investigate the effects of
early human demography on the accumulation of cultural skills. In the following sections
we introduce and detail the simulation model, present the main theoretical results, and
discuss their possible implications in future debate on the nature and causes of the appearance and accumulation of modern human culture.
Model 1: Extending the Analytical Model
Our underlying simulation model consists of a number of subpopulations, G, placed at
random in a two-dimensional simulated world. Each subpopulation contains N adult individuals, and all subpopulations are connected by migratory activity. In every generation
of the simulation, the model goes through the following steps:
1. Within each subpopulation a generation of offspring, also of size N, is created.
2. Genetic parents are chosen for each offspring by randomly sampling the adult generation with replacement.
3. Naive offspring then undergo a process of “vertical transmission,” where they receive
a z value by learning from their genetic parents according to the transmission process
described by Henrich and Boyd (2002) and detailed above.
4. A proportion, Pob, of these offspring then undergoes a process of “oblique transmission,” where they replace their z value with one learned from the maximally skilled
member of the adult generation in the subpopulation (the oblique model).

<-----Page 157----->The Accumulation of Culturally Inherited Skills

145

5. The now-“encultured” offspring generation then fully replaces the adult generation
within each subpopulation.
6. A proportion, Pmig, of these new adults then migrates, with each migrant being placed
in a new subpopulation by a Gaussian random-walk-like process.
Each simulation is initialized by giving all individuals in all subpopulations a z value
of 10.0, then running forward for 50 generations, and after the ﬁnal generation, calculating
the world mean z value. This value is compared to the starting world mean (10.0) to
determine whether this simulation results in “adaptive cumulative evolution,” i.e., Δz̄ > 0.
To account for stochastic variation in simulation outcomes, we perform multiple iterations,
making this calculation at the end of each iteration. We then calculate the mean z value
across iterations and deem the parameter set to be “cumulatively adaptive” if it is greater
than the mean starting z value, i.e., >10.0.
We recognize that the time spans we are considering are 10,000–20,000 years (around
400–800 generations), but preliminary tests showed that 50 generations was in most cases
sufﬁcient to determine whether the parameter set would result in cumulative adaptive
evolution or maladaptive loss—with mean z values either increasing monotonically without
bound, decreasing monotonically to zero (at which point the cultural skill is irretrievably
lost), or reaching a relatively stable equilibrium value. The model is also relatively conservative, in that it currently disregards the likely autocatalytic/positive feedback loop,
where increasing ability in some cultural skills would lead to improved demographic
conditions (by means of improved reproductive success/resource utility), which would, in
turn, further increase skill accumulation.
The parameters of interest in this model are the number of subpopulations, G; the size
of each subpopulation, N; the proportion of offspring to undergo oblique transmission,
Pob; the proportion of each subpopulation available to migrate, Pmig; and the “complexity”
of the skill, α. Because of the difﬁculty in accurately estimating demographic parameters
during the Pleistocene, we turn to a review of contemporary Australian aboriginal hunter–
gatherer populations (Birdsell 1973) to draw some estimates for N. Two regularly occurring distinct social structures of differing size are identiﬁed. The ﬁrst is the “band,” an
independent and autonomous patrilineal unit commonly comprising 25–50 individuals
(usually an extended familial group), and the second, the “tribe,” comprising around 500
or so individuals related by linguistic or dialectal similarity and forming a generally
endogamous unit.
To complement these two contemporary ethnographic estimates, there are also analyses
emerging from biological anthropology (Dunbar 1992, 1993) that may shed light on the
question of early human subpopulation sizes. Dunbar argues that social-group size in
primates is likely to reﬂect the cognitive capacities of the individuals comprising it, as
there is thought to be a cognitive upper limit on the number of social interactions that can
be maintained and thus a limit on group size. Extrapolating a relationship between

<-----Page 158----->146

A. Powell, S. J. Shennan, and M. G. Thomas

neocortex ratio and social-group size in nonhuman primates to humans gives a prediction
for ancestral group size in the region of ~150.
We need to bear in mind that the value of N in our simulation refers to the total number
of social learners in the offspring generation and that, as we are assuming that 50 percent
of each group is subadult and that a cultural skill is inherited by same-sex offspring, this
represents roughly a quarter of each actual subpopulation size. Based on the previous
estimates, we have simulated over values of N between 5 and 100, corresponding to total
group sizes of ~20–400, recognizing that actual Pleistocene group sizes are likely to have
been weighted toward the lower end of this range.
In estimating the migration rate, Pmig, we make use of an earlier Birdsell (1968) study
giving an aboriginal intertribal marriage rate of ~15.7 percent, which corresponds to a
migration rate of around 0.074. This is consistent with another Australian aboriginal study
that yielded estimates of between 0.07 and 0.21 (Tindale 1953; see Eller et al. 2004). Even
if Pleistocene subpopulations were comparable in size to contemporary hunter–gatherer
groups, it is likely that subpopulation densities and intergroup interactions prior to the
emergence of Late Stone Age/Upper Paleolithic technology were signiﬁcantly lower than
the contemporary estimates for migration rates. We therefore simulated over a range of
migration rates, Pmig, between 0.001 and 0.15.
Although oblique transmission, and prestige-biased transmission in particular (Henrich
and Gil-White 2001), is undoubtedly important in the transmission of cultural skills
(Guglielmino et al. 1995; Shennan and Steele 1999), it is difﬁcult to make realistic estimates of the extent to which it occurred. For this reason, we have simulated Pob over the
entire range of 0.1 to 1.0 (in increments of 0.1). The number of subpopulations, G, likely
was subject to signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations during the Pleistocene, for reasons outlined above,
so we simulated for a wide range of G, from 1 up to 500.
Preliminary simulation results indicate that as G increases beyond ~100, there is only
a small increase in mean z value, suggesting that a “saturation point” is reached with regard
to skill accumulation. Given this, and making the reasonable assumption that the number
of interconnected human subpopulations during the Middle Stone Age was likely to have
been at least this large, we ﬁx G = 100 in future simulations. These simulations also
showed that adjusting the value of N has no qualitative effect on the results, so ﬁxing
N = 25 from here on entails no loss of generality.
Simulation results are presented in ﬁgures 9.3 and 9.4 and show that the degree of skill
accumulation increases with increasing oblique transmission probability (see ﬁgure 9.3),
increasing migration rate (see ﬁgure 9.4), and decreasing complexity (as measured by the
α value). The shaded regions give the parameter sets that result in cumulative adaptive
evolution, i.e., mean ﬁnal z value > 10.0.
This model deﬁnes the migration rate at the global level (Pmig), operating for all subpopulations irrespective of the local subpopulation density. As a result, it is impossible to
ascertain the effects of having different subpopulation densities in different regions of the

same simulation world. A far more realistic model would explicitly link local migration
rates to local subpopulation density. To this end, we have added an extra level of complexity to our simulation model as detailed below.
Model 2: Subpopulation Density–Dependent Migration
The migration process in this model is now explicitly dependent on subpopulation density.
We deﬁne the global density of subpopulations, D, and adjust the dimensions of the simulation world so that we get ~100 subpopulations, a value for G we showed above to be
reasonable. The model then creates a simulation world by placing, again at random, the
subpopulations. At the migration step in the simulation, all adult individuals now undergo
a Gaussian random-walk process, with the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution
deﬁned by a new parameter, Msd. The adult individuals that “hit” any other subgroup during
this process are deemed to move to that group; otherwise, they are deemed not to migrate
and to remain in their original subpopulation.
The parameter Msd, which can be thought of as the “migratory range” of an individual,
is deﬁned as a proportion of the average nearest neighbor distance, r̄E, between subgroups
within the simulation world. A derivation presented by Clark and Evans (1954) gives this
average nearest neighbor distance between randomly distributed subpopulations in terms
of density as
rE =

1
2 D

,

which is shown in ﬁgure 9.5.
If we note that around 99.7 percent of the probability density of a Gaussian distribution
lies within ±3 standard deviations, we would expect that when Msd ≤ 1/3 many subpopulations would be effectively isolated from all others as migrants would be unable to reach
them; therefore, their internal skill accumulation would be unaffected by the migration
process. Test simulations—where we calculated the mean global migration rate—
conﬁrmed this and showed that for Msd greater than ~0.3, the mean global migration rate
approximately equals the global subpopulation density, D (see ﬁgure 9.6).
For our current purposes, we set Msd well above this critical value at 1.0, that is, equal
to r̄E, so we can be sure that few subpopulations are completely isolated and that the mean
global migration rate, and thus the effect on the accumulation of cultural skills, will depend
solely on the underlying global subpopulation density. We simulate for 50 generations,
over a range of α values and again for the entire range for Pob (0.1–1.0).
Simulation results for this model show (in broad agreement with model 1 results) that
skill accumulation increases with increasing oblique-transmission probability (see ﬁgure
9.7), with increasing subpopulation density (see ﬁgure 9.8), and with decreasing complexity (as measured by the α value).

Model 2.1: Heterogeneous Subpopulation Density
A minor adjustment to the previous model allows us to investigate the effect of dividing
the simulation world into two regions of different subpopulation densities. We partition
the simulation world in half along the east–west axis and populate one half at a subpopulation density Dhigh and the other at a density an order of magnitude lower, Dlow. In the following simulations, we set Msd = 1.0 as a proportion of the average nearest neighbor
distance, r̄ E, in the lower density region, again to ensure that all subpopulations are connected by migration (including across the density divide). We set Dhigh = 0.02 and Dlow =
0.002 and the dimensions of the world at 100 × 100, giving us a total of 110 subgroups,
and simulate for a range of α values (2.0–4.0) and for values of Pob (0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and
1.0) over 100 generations, performing 100 iterations for each.
In these simulations (data not shown), we ﬁnd that skill accumulation is consistently
higher in the higher-density region. As an example, we can ﬁx α = 3.5 and Pob = 0.5 and
look at the average z values in each region over time. Figure 9.9 shows that this difference
is maintained over the entire (extended) duration of the simulation. The 95 percent conﬁdence intervals, as estimated by taking mean regional z values for 100 iterations, show

that the difference in accumulated z values between the different density regions becomes
signiﬁcant after less than 20 generations.
A visual illustration of this spatial structuring of skill accumulation can be seen in ﬁgure
9.10. In this example, a series of “snapshots” of a single iteration are taken at 25generation intervals, and the subpopulation z values are surface interpolated to show
“spatial skill accumulation.”
Model 2.2: Heterogeneous Migratory Range
A further modiﬁcation of the model allows us to divide the world into two regions of
identical population density but differing migratory range, Msd. This allows us to explore
the effect of reduced migratory range on the accumulation of cultural skills in geographic
space. We set Msd,high at 1.0 and Msd,low an order of magnitude lower, at 0.1. Figure 9.11

As with the heterogeneous density simulations, we can see that the regional mean z value
becomes signiﬁcantly higher in the high migratory-range region after less than 20 generations. A surface-interpolation plot illustrating this spatial structuring of skill accumulation
over time is presented in ﬁgure 9.12.
“Natural” Oblique-Transmission Methods
In all previous models, we parameterized the proportion of offspring undergoing oblique
transmission (Pob), which, as discussed above, is difﬁcult to estimate from the ethnographic
record. The identiﬁcation of the oblique model was also assumed to be perfectly accurate,
which ignores the likely difﬁculty of this process in the real world, even within the much
smaller subpopulations we have modeled. To avoid these difﬁculties and to reduce the
number of parameters in the model, we have developed a number of more “natural” processes for oblique transmission, which we surmise may more realistically reﬂect processes
by which oblique models are chosen within human populations. Under these new methods,
all offspring identify and select an oblique model with a degree of uncertainty and replace

their current z value, that is, the one gained vertically from a parent, only if the value they
gain from their chosen oblique model is greater.
In method 1, each offspring selects an oblique model from the adult generation, with
probability proportional to the squared adult z value. In method 2, each offspring selects
an oblique model from among only the adults with z values greater than what was already
gained from a biological parent, with probability proportional to the magnitude of the
difference. In method 3, each offspring selects an oblique model from the adult generation,
with probability proportional to the difference between each adult’s z value and the
minimum adult z value in the subpopulation.
All simulations were run in a homogeneous simulation world, that is, where Msd = 1.0
and with D kept constant both across the whole world and with each of the three alternative processes, so results can be compared, possibly allowing us to identify an efﬁcient

(or near-optimal), realistic cultural-learning strategy. We simulated for 50 generations,
performing 100 iterations, for a range of subpopulation densities, D, and skill complexities,
α, for each of the three “natural” oblique methods.
Results for the three methods again show the general result that increasing subpopulation density and decreasing skill complexity, α, leads to increased skill accumulation (see
ﬁgure 9.13). Method 2 consistently results in greater mean z values, thus leading to cumulative adaptive evolution (the shaded regions), even for more complex skills and at lower
subpopulation densities than either of the other two methods.
Discussion
Our results show that the level of cultural skill that can be maintained in subpopulations
is related to the density/migratory activity of those subpopulations. In cases where densities/migration rates are low, cumulative adaptive evolution will never occur. Even in cases
with higher densities and migration rates where it does occur, there is a signiﬁcant period
before accumulation begins, with potential consequences for population viability.
We also demonstrate that geographic heterogeneity in local subpopulation density/
migratory activity leads to stable spatial structuring of skill accumulation, so that areas
where skills accumulate can exist contiguously with areas of skill devolution over long
periods of time.
The last set of simulations presented compared different “natural” strategies of choosing
an oblique model within subpopulations, which recognize that individuals will not always
be in a position to identify the individual with the maximum skill level. Results show that
method 2—in which each offspring selects an oblique model from among only the adults
with z values greater than what the offspring has already gained from a biological parent,
with probability proportional to the magnitude of the difference—leads to cumulative
adaptive evolution for more complex skills (characterized by a higher α value) and at
lower densities than possible alternatives.
These results conﬁrm and extend Henrich’s (2004) initial results and show that the
action of demographic factors on the results of cultural-transmission processes using
plausible parameter values could indeed have had the effect on cumulative adaptive evolution that many others have postulated as central to the slow pace of cumulative cultural
evolution prior to c. 50 kya and its greatly increased speed thereafter.

My message is a plea to recognize some adaptive value in tradition-perpetuating mechanisms and

People living in modern societies tend to value innovation highly. Diamond (2001: 28)
has even called innovation “that most human of characteristics” and referred to the rapid
increase in innovation seen around 35,000 years ago as the “Great Leap Forward.” He
views the creation of innovations not only as what makes us human but as what makes us
distinct from other forms of life: “Had a visitor from outer space come to Earth before the
Great Leap Forward, humans would not have stood out as unique among the world’s
species” (Diamond 2001: 33). Harris (1989: 64) goes even further, claiming that the
increase in the rate of cultural innovation around 35,000 years ago was “a breakthrough
as fateful as the transition from energy to matter or from amino acids to living protein”
(see also chapter 9, this volume).
If so, then the Amish are a puzzle. This North American Anabaptist group, whose roots
can be traced back to sixteenth-century Switzerland, spurns many forms of technological
innovations. Instead of valuing innovation, the Amish place an extremely high premium
on preserving the patterns of behavior they have copied from their parents or other
ancestors—their cultural traditions. The high value the Amish place on preserving their
traditions and their willingness to reject even economically advantageous technology in
order to do so have earned them the name “People of Preservation” (Ruth 1991). This
moniker serves to distinguish them from the people surrounding them who, according to
Diamond and Harris, are representative of our species and deserve the name “People of
Innovation.”

If the Amish are unique with respect to the effort they put into reducing cultural change,
they would be the poorest of choices to use in exploring innovation in cultural systems. I
argue, however, that the Amish are actually more representative of our species with respect
to the effort they put into preserving their cultural traditions than are the “People of Innovation” that make up the “modern” world. I will make this point by describing similarities
between the Amish and traditional cultures in general, illustrated primarily by Australian
Aboriginal peoples.
If the Amish are representative of the human attitude toward innovation during recent
human evolution, our view of rapid cultural and technological innovation as the deﬁning
attribute of our species may need to be modiﬁed. This modiﬁcation will necessitate incorporating mechanisms that preserve cultural traditions into evolutionary explanations of
human cultural transmission. Current evolutionary explanations of culture tend to see
cultural change as an active process involving activities such as “the hard work of invention” (Schiffer 2005: 485), the operation of various cultural transmission biases (e.g.,
Henrich 2001; chapters 1, 7, 9, 11, and 12, this volume), and random copying errors (e.g.,
Lipo and Eerkins 2005; chapter 8, this volume). The modiﬁcation I am suggesting involves
viewing the absence of cultural change as also being the result of an active process instead
of merely a passive state that exists when the active processes of change are not taking
place.
With reference to the active processes of change, Henrich (2001: 992) observes that
“efforts to understand human behavioral change have produced a multiplicity of different
approaches.” The same cannot be said for efforts to understand the absence of behavioral
change when cultural patterns of behavior are preserved. Richerson and Boyd (2000: 22)
state that “among modern humans, the maintenance of complex traditions is not unproblematic,” but they are referring only to the difﬁculties in maintaining traditions when very
small populations become isolated. I suggest that the maintenance of traditions is always
problematic because the preservation of traditional behaviors always requires hard work.
If this is true, then a signiﬁcant part of explaining innovation is explaining when innovation does not happen.
The goal of this reconsideration of the role of innovation in human evolution is not to
replace current theories of technological innovation and culture change but to supplement
them by proposing testable answers to two questions about cultural preservation:
1. How can patterns of cultural behavior remain essentially unchanged over many generations? That is, what are the proximate mechanisms preserving cultural traditions?
2. What was the evolutionary advantage, or advantages, of preserving cultural traditions
over many generations?
My answer to the ﬁrst question involves what VanPool (chapter 15, this volume) refers
to as “metatraditions.” I use the term “tradition” to refer to cultural (socially learned or

<-----Page 175----->The Evolutionary Advantages of Noninnovation

163

“copied”) behaviors “transmitted from ancestor to descendant, generally parent to child,
[often] over many generations” (Coe 2003: 5), or simply “behaviors copied from ancestors.” I use the term “metatradition” in the sense that Campbell (1975: 1108) did—as
“tradition-perpetuating mechanisms.” That is, metatraditions are traditional behaviors that
enhance the faithful copying of other traditional behaviors from one generation to the next.
In exploring how patterns of cultural behavior remain unchanged, I look at similarities
between the metatraditions that produce a relatively high degree of cultural preservation
among the Amish and the Australian Aborigines. I then ask if metatraditions are, or at
least were, universal. Failure to ﬁnd metatraditions described in the ethnographic record,
especially in descriptions of societies that have been relatively unchanged by modern
technological societies, would indicate that metatraditions are not universal.
In answering the second question, I suggest that metatraditions present two distinct
evolutionary beneﬁts. First, they facilitate the replication of behaviors that were evolutionarily successful in past generations. This minimizes the occurrence of the inﬁnite
potential deviations from those traditional behaviors that are evolutionarily unsuccessful,
while promoting the preservation of traits necessary for the gradual accumulation of innovations in succeeding generations. That is, metatraditions contribute to cultural evolution
by helping to promote the “descent” part of the concept “descent with modiﬁcation.”
Second, the preservation of certain cultural behaviors is probably necessary for the
formation of the extended networks of cooperating kin, including those typically referred
to by anthropologists as “lineages” and “clans,” that were crucial to the recent evolutionary
success of our species. Preserving certain cultural behaviors, such as descent names or
clan markings, is necessary for the formation of lineages and clans by deﬁnition because
these are deﬁned as a set of people who recognize each other as kin because they have
inherited the same descent name (and/or emblem) from a common ancestor.
The essential role of tracing descent from a common ancestor in the identiﬁcation of
kin is emphasized by Evans-Pritchard (1940: 200), who observed kin are identiﬁed as
individuals linked by one or more birth links through a common ancestor who forms “the
apex of a triangle of descent.” Large networks of kin can come to be identiﬁed only when
something, such as a descent name or clan marker, is passed at birth from ancestor to
descendant over many generations. Fox (1967: 122) describes this process by saying that
when such multigenerational inheritance of cultural behaviors takes place, “large lineages
of clans . . . grow up over time as the descendants of the original ancestor/ancestress”
accumulate. Further, as Palmer and Steadman (1997: 44) point out, wherever descent
names occur in the world, they identify as kin not only everyone with the same descent
name but also anyone able to trace birth links to individuals with a given clan name. This
is what enables Keen (2004: 174) to state that in Aboriginal Australia, discussed below,
“kinship and society were co-extensive.”
The necessity of cultural traditions in order to identify large sets of kin descended from
distant common ancestors has implications for models of cultural transmission. Such

<-----Page 176----->164

Craig T. Palmer

models of possible correlations between forms of cultural transmission and the size of
social groups are making signiﬁcant advances in our understanding of recent human evolution (see chapter 9, this volume). Further reﬁnements of these models could be made by
incorporating the crucial role of tracing descent via cultural traditions in creating the
kinship relationships between individuals that typically form the basis of the social relationships that constitute traditional human “groups.” Failure to ﬁnd such large networks
of kin, and the mechanisms that I propose account for their creation, would negate my
proposal.
Amish Metatraditions: The Ordnung
Amish rejection of many forms of technological innovation is not the result of a general
passivity or lack of interest in technology. Nor do the Amish regard technology per se as
evil or even undesirable. Rather, they take deliberate and elaborate steps to decide whether
to adopt or reject any given technological innovation. These decisions are guided by a set
of rules, usually unwritten, known as the Ordnung.
The Amish themselves view the Ordnung as a metatradition because it is “meant to
convey the traditions of the community” (Wetmore 2007: 13). They see such a strong
connection between the preservation of traditions and the preservation of valuable social
relationships among kin that they say the primary goal of the Ordnung is to “pass down
traditions, and build strong ties with one another” (Wetmore 2007: 13). This extreme value
placed on social relationships and the traditional patterns of behavior that create and preserve them is the key reason behind the rejection of many technological innovations: “If
they fear that a particular technology might disrupt their religion, tradition, community or
families, they are likely to prohibit it” (Wetmore 2007: 14).
Although metatraditions do not have to involve religious behavior, religion often plays
a prominent role. One reason for this may be that religious behavior is often distinguished
by an individual’s accepting another’s inﬂuence by communicating acceptance of unveriﬁable supernatural claims (Steadman and Palmer 2008). Offspring who communicate acceptance of the supernatural claims made by their parents communicate to the parents a
willingness to accept parental inﬂuence. The acceptance of parental inﬂuence, in turn,
promotes the copying of traditions. The connection between tradition and religious behavior, that is, the communicated acceptance of supernatural claims, is so strong among the
Amish that “to the participant, religion and custom [i.e., tradition] are inseparable”
(Hostetler 1993: 11).
Myths and rituals among the Amish regularly include supernatural claims. Drawing on
Malinowski’s observations about the universal functions of myth, Hostetler (1993: 23)
writes that in Amish society, “Myth institutionalizes the behavior of a society by enforcing
traditions and norms.” Traditional Amish stories also take the form of songs that “are

<-----Page 177----->The Evolutionary Advantages of Noninnovation

165

based on the story of their martyrs, who the world hated” (p. 23) and tell how Amish
ancestors chose to die instead of deviating from their traditions. This illustrates how acts
of sacriﬁce not only serve as a means of communicating commitment to social relationships when they occur, as suggested by costly signaling theory, but also continue to
promote cooperative social relationships in subsequent generations when the tales of sacriﬁce become traditional (Palmer et al. 2006).
Amish behavior in general is highly ritualized. When the enduring ritual behavior patterns of parents are copied and repeated by offspring, the ritual behavior becomes traditional by deﬁnition. Referring to certain of these patterns of behavior as “sacred” also
plays a signiﬁcant role in the metatraditions of the Amish because “changes that threaten
sacred ritual are less acceptable than those unrelated to worship” (Kraybill 1989: 86). As
a result, “custom tends to become sacred” (Hostetler 1993: 9).
The concept of the “sacred” may be inherently conducive to the preservation of traditions because, as Durkheim (1912) pointed out, sacred things are often set apart and forbidden, and being set apart and forbidden is likely to reduce the chances of change.
Hostetler (1993: 90) concludes that Amish traditional culture “is strongly supported by
the myths and beliefs of the society. . . . [and] the beliefs perform a conservative function
in maintaining the social order.”
Respect for living elders is another important Amish metatradition. The traditional
encouragement of respect for Amish elders takes place within a network of kinship relationships. Within this kinship structure, respect given to elders is paramount: “Wisdom
accumulates with age, and with age comes respect. Old people retain the respect of children and grandchildren. Obedience to parents is one of the most common themes in Amish
preaching. . . . Since the wisdom of the aged carries more weight than the advice of
younger men, the conservation of the entire community is assured and the religious ideals
are protected from too much change” (Hostetler 1993: 14–15). To the Amish, “too much
change” is change that disrupts traditional patterns of behavior in a way that damages
social relationships among kin. Thus, the “Amish have made some adaptations to modernization, but . . . [have not allowed] technology and convenience to run away with their
family and community” (Hostetler 1993: 125–126).
The technological innovation that best illustrates the hard work involved in maintaining
the Ordnung is the telephone. Umble (1996) points out that the Amish have been engaged
in a debate about telephone use since the nineteenth century. The debate is puzzling to
outsiders who do not highly value traditions because the Amish “were not blind to the
practical applications of the telephone” that made it “an instrument of progress” that would
increase “both proﬁt and pleasure” (Umble 1996: 112).
Despite a clear understanding of the tremendous advantages of telephone use, telephones were resisted by many Amish because they were seen as especially threatening to
traditions and social relationships. Umble (1996) argues that this is because telephones
threatened the fundamental pattern of face-to-face social interaction that was structured

<-----Page 178----->166

by rituals of worship, silence, work, and visiting and was anchored in the home. This threat
to the very communicative mechanism most responsible for the copying of traditional
behaviors was a threat to all traditions.
As a result of the effectiveness of the Ordnung, youngsters do what the old people did
when they were young (Hostetler 1993). Hostetler states that among the Amish, “continuity of conformity and custom is assured” (p. 11), but this is clearly an exaggeration. Not
only is the perfect preservation of a traditional pattern of behavior impossible, even a high
degree of continuity can never be “assured.” Culture and social institutions may work to
inhibit changes, but innovations inevitably occur. There is also always the possibility
of metatraditions losing their effectiveness and the rate of innovation increasing
proportionately.
Umble (1996: 115) makes the insightful statement that instead of only reﬂecting the
unique aspects of a peculiar religious group, the conscious effort the Amish put into avoiding many forms of innovation provides “a window into the dynamics of cultural change.”
The view from this window opposes the common assumption that cultural continuity is
merely a consequence of the difﬁcult process of innovation failing to be successful. It
replaces that assumption with the view that cultural change may be a consequence of the
difﬁcult process of cultural preservation failing to be successful. This view is compatible
with Campbell’s (1975: 1105) observation that in cultural evolution, deviation from tradition “seems unproblematic” because “there has no doubt always been a sufﬁcient raw
dross of both haphazard and ‘intelligent’ variations on the social tradition to provide the
‘mutations’ or ‘trials’ the process requires, imperfect transmissions of tradition being only
one source,” whereas it is “retention and duplication” that is “more problematic.”
The Amish illustrate how cultural patterns of behavior can be preserved through metatraditions, but this sheds only limited light on evolutionary questions about culture and
technological innovations because Amish traditions have had only a relatively short existence. If the Amish really are no more than a peculiar exception, in the sense of being the
only culture with metatraditions designed to preserve their traditional way of life, the
argument I have put forth fails. The prediction of metatraditions once being a speciestypical trait among humans, and currently more intact and effective in those societies
referred to as traditional, is what makes my explanation a testable hypothesis instead of a
“just-so” story.
Metatraditions in Aboriginal Australia: Ancestral Law
The set of metatraditions of Aboriginal peoples of Australia analogous to the Ordnung of
the Amish is referred to as “Ancestral Law.” Even in a study emphasizing the diversity
of Aboriginal societies, Keen (2004: 244) states that “We shall see the people of several
of the regions, perhaps all of them, shared a concept that can be translated as ‘ancestral

<-----Page 179----->The Evolutionary Advantages of Noninnovation

167

law’ or the ‘proper way,’ having its origin in the intentions and actions of the totemic
creator ancestors.”
“Ancestral Law” is associated with the concept of “The Dreaming,” a time when the
original ancestors are claimed to have created the traditions that their descendants have
been encouraged to follow ever since. Like the Amish, Aboriginal people themselves often
emphasize the degree to which their culture is traditional. They see “Ancestral Law” as a
metatradition promoting traditional patterns of behavior. The difference is that unlike the
relatively recent existence of the Amish Ordnung, the metatraditions constituting the
“Ancestral Law” of Aboriginal peoples may have helped maintain traditions for a much
longer period of time. Although some change in behavior from generation to generation
is obviously inevitable, there is no question that the change in Australia during the ﬁrst
40,000 years of human occupation occurred at a much slower pace than what has been
occurring in most societies during the last several centuries.
As is the case among the Amish, kinship in Aboriginal Australia was of considerable
importance. Prior to colonization, kin-based relationships governed all aspects of social
life (Keen 2004; Kendon 1988). The network of social relationships among kin that constituted Aboriginal society was the result of offspring copying the totemic names of one
or both parents, generation after generation (Keen 2004).
Individuals with the same totemic descent name did not constitute local groups but
instead formed a geographically dispersed exogamous category of individuals known as
a clan by virtue of having the same totemic name that could be obtained only by descent
from an ancestor with that name. The cooperative forms of behavior among members of
these kinship networks was the direct result of Ancestral Law and its prescriptions for
behavior being copied from one generation to the next.
Ancestral Law, like the Amish Ordnung, is largely religious. It involves communicated
acceptance of various supernatural claims about ancestors. In describing the importance
of the religious aspect of Ancestral Law, even among contemporary Aboriginal peoples
who have experienced a long period of colonization, Berndt (1982: 1) stated that “although
aboriginal societies have not ‘come down into the present encapsulated, unchanged, in
their traditional mantle’ [that existed before colonization] change has been limited by
factors, foremost among these is ‘religion.’ ”
Traditional myths and other stories played a crucial role within the metatradition of
ancestral totemism as they continue to do among the Amish. Clarke (2003: 16) states,
“Whenever I have asked Aboriginal people to explain the Dreaming they have mostly
responded in the same manner; it is the story of their old ways, how the land was formed,
what they used to do and what they learned from their grandparents’ generation about their
Ancestors.” Strehlow (1947) describes the considerable effort taken to preserve the myth
in its traditional form through the centuries. Although there are many different types of
Aboriginal myths, many clearly constituted metatraditions because they were charters for
moral behavior, and moral behavior included the faithful copying of traditions (Hiatt 1975).

<-----Page 180----->168

Craig T. Palmer

The telling of traditional stories or myths about the totemic ancestors was often accompanied by ritual. Morphy (1991: 285) reports that the Yolunga claim that all art “is an
extension of the Ancestral Past into the present and one of the main ways in which ideas
or information about the Ancestral Past is transmitted from one human generation to the
next.” Before dismissing such claims as mere talk, it is important to note that Mulvaney
and Kamminga (1999) provide archaeological evidence for certain speciﬁc patterns of art,
such as the Rainbow Serpent design, persisting in Australia for at least 6,000 years.
Castro and Toro (2004) emphasize that inﬂuencing children to copy the behavior of
parents often requires hard work. This was clearly true among Aboriginal peoples, as
Morphy (1991) describes how learning certain painting techniques may have taken up to
ten years. Copying traditional stories and the associated rituals from one generation to the
next also required considerable time and effort.
The association between the speciﬁc religious concept of the “sacred” and the metatraditions of Australian aborigines is suggested by Stanner’s (1956: 51) observation that the
term Alcheringa, usually translated as “sacred,” can be literally translated as “men of old.”
If, as would seem likely, “men of old” refers to ancestors claimed to have lived in “The
Dreaming,” then we have another example of the close association between ancestors, the
source of all traditions, and the concept of “sacred.” From this perspective it is not surprising that Ranzijn and Bin-Sallik (2001: 170) claim that “Aboriginal elders previously
enjoyed high respect as the custodians of the culture and were loved and held in high
esteem by younger groups for their expertise and wisdom.”
Were Metatraditions Universal?
The traditionalness of “traditional” cultures, as illustrated by the Aborigines, was obvious
to many early anthropologists. Kroeber (1948: 256–257), for example, noted that “cultures
are . . . inclined to be persistent. . . . Even in times of the most radical change and innovation there are probably several times as many items of culture being transmitted from the
past as there are being newly devised.” Perhaps Boas (1927: 156) was wrong in assigning
an active role to culture as a cause of cultural persistence when he stated that culture acted
as a “restriction of inventiveness,” but the emphasis placed on the maintenance of sacred
traditions in so many cultures makes this role of culture a possibility worth considering.
It is Frazer’s (1922: 47) portrayal of life in traditional societies, however, that has had
the longest lasting effect on how cultural anthropologists view traditions:
No human being is so hidebound by custom and tradition as your democratic savage; in no state of
society consequently is progress so slow and difﬁcult. The old notion that the savage is the freest
of mankind is the reverse of the truth. He is a slave, not indeed to a visible master, but to the past,
to the spirits of his dead forefathers, who haunt his steps from birth to death, and rule him with a
rod of iron. What they did is the pattern of right, the unwritten law to which he yields a blind,
unquestioning obedience. . . . [In such a traditional society] the individual’s lot is cast from the
cradle to the grave in the iron mold of hereditary custom.

<-----Page 181----->The Evolutionary Advantages of Noninnovation

169

It is unfortunate that Frazer combined his description of the pervasiveness of traditional
behavior in some cultures with such a negative judgment of those cultures. Frazer’s disparaging view of traditional cultures has led to the perception that the word “traditional”
is always derogatory because it implies backward, primitive, and inferior. This stigma has
prevented an appreciation of the likely importance of metatraditions in human culture and
evolution.
One of the strongest forms of evidence for the universality of metatraditions is that
traditional religions universally promote the kinds of kinship cooperation that make
the transmission of traditions possible (Steadman and Palmer 2008). A reexamination
(Steadman et al. 1996) of ethnographic evidence for the supernatural claim that dead
ancestors may inﬂuence their descendants and be inﬂuenced by their descendants found
that this view might be universal. Shamans are also often claimed to communicate with
dead ancestors and base their instructions of proper behavior on what they were allegedly
told by the ancestors (Palmer and Steadman 2004). Coe (2003: 44) points out that “sacred
is often the word used to refer to anything associated with ancestors.”
Possible Evolutionary Beneﬁts of Metatraditions
The widespread evidence of metatraditions in the ethnographic literature raises the question of why metatraditions may have been part of every known culture until several
thousand years ago. I suggest there are two evolutionary beneﬁts to traditions and the
metatraditions that promote them, one beginning much earlier in human existence than
the other. The earlier may have originated as our ancestors evolved into anatomically
modern humans, somewhere in the period between 500,000 and 100,000 years ago. As
the name “anatomically modern” implies, our ancestors must have had brains very much
like our own, thus potentially capable of producing at least much of what Richerson and
Boyd (2000: 2) refer to as the “stunning diversity” of cultural behaviors produced by
people more recently.
Given that only a small fraction of the variety of the behavior patterns the brains of
anatomically modern humans could have potentially produced each generation would have
led to survival and reproduction, selection may have favored individuals who inﬂuenced
their offspring to copy their behavior, as well as offspring capable of such copying.
Richerson and Boyd (2000: 1) may be correct in asserting that the brain evolution leading
up to that time may have resulted in a brain “built for speed” in the sense of being capable
of large intergenerational changes in behavior. At some point, however, selection may
have favored individuals who managed to keep that change on track, that is, sufﬁciently
similar to what proved to be successful in the previous generation. A general lack of
intergenerational behavioral change characterizes most organisms, including earlier human
ancestors. However, a lack of intergenerational behavior change in an organism capable

<-----Page 182----->170

Craig T. Palmer

of vast intergenerational changes in behavior due to an ability to engage in an immense
amount of social learning required fundamentally different mechanisms. I suggest metatraditions may have been such a mechanism and thus contributed to the “descent” aspect
of the Darwinian principle of descent with modiﬁcation.
The second, and later, evolutionary beneﬁt of traditions may have involved the previously described relationship between traditions and the social environment. Until very
recently, the social environment of all humans consisted of webs of social relationships
between individuals identiﬁed as kin. These webs cannot be explained by kin selection
because they universally far exceeded the small set of closely related individuals, where
kin selection would play a major role. As previously mentioned, although a great deal has
been written by anthropologists about the nuances and variations of these large webs of
kinship (lineages, clans, moieties, and the like), only one mechanism for their creation
has been seriously put forth, and this mechanism requires traditional behavior.
Beginning at least several tens of thousands of years ago, the creation of the social
environments of our ancestors required two types of traditions. The identiﬁcation of large
numbers of kin requires giving offspring some symbol that they are your descendants,
such as a descent name, and inﬂuencing your offspring to copy your behavior (see Palmer
and Steadman 1997).
Although there are other mechanisms that can produce cooperation, inﬂuencing these
large numbers of identiﬁed descendants to cooperate with each other because of their
kinship relationship to each other required a second tradition also found in all known
traditional cultures. This second tradition consisted of parents inﬂuencing their offspring
to cooperate with individuals identiﬁed as kin and to copy that behavior (see ﬁgure 10.1).
The existence of such traditions is succinctly demonstrated by Middleton’s (1960: 27)
translation of a saying among the Lugbara of Africa: “the rules of social behaviour are
the ‘words of our ancestors.’ ”
The potential consequence of these two types of traditions’ being copied over a considerable number of generations is illustrated by Fortes’s (1969: 237) observation that the
axiom of kinship amity “applies to all of the Tiv” and Keesing’s (1975: 32–33) notation
that “the whole population of some 800,000 traces descent by traditional genealogical
links from a single founding ancestor.” The ability of descent names to identify individuals
as kin, and even to distinguish relative degrees of kinship distance between individuals by
identifying a series of common ancestors, can have life-or-death consequences. For
example, Fortes (1969: 237) describes how kinship distance identiﬁed through descent
names regulates, among other things, a traditionally prescribed “graduated scale of weaponry and violence that is permitted in ﬁghting. Close brother segments of a minimal lineage
may use only clubs and stones in a ﬁght; more distantly connected segments may use bows
and arrows but must avoid killing; very distantly connected lineages ﬁght with poison
arrows and Dane guns, and aim to kill.” Even much smaller extended networks of kin
would be profoundly beneﬁcial to survival and reproduction.

Figure 10.1
How traditional descent names identify large networks of codescendants and how traditions of moral codes
inﬂuence codescendants to cooperate.

The widespread existence of large categories of kin identiﬁed through descent names
is almost certainly the result of the transmission of traditions over a correspondingly large
number of generations. The alternative notion that such categories of cooperating individuals could be instantaneously created during a single lifetime is so preposterous that
it became the basis of Kurt Vonnegut’s 1976 ﬁctional novel Slapstick: Or Lonesome No
More! As Cronk (1999: 129) explains, the character “Dr. Swain” runs for president on
the promise to use “the computers of the federal government to recreate kinship networks
like those of our ancestors . . . [including] 190,000 cousins, all obligated to help fellow
clan members.” Given the absence of a more plausible alternative explanation of how
the kinship-based social environments of humans could have come into existence,
the role of traditions maintained by metatraditions should at least receive serious
consideration.
Conclusions
The goal of this chapter has been to expand the evolutionary view of culture so that it is
seen as not just a powerful force in human behavioral change but also as a powerful force
in the preservation of patterns of human behavior. Although this emphasis on cultural
preservation may appear to be incongruous with much of the current thinking about

<-----Page 184----->172

Craig T. Palmer

innovation and cultural evolution, it actually is compatible (if not synonymous) with
Darwin’s original views on natural selection. Importantly, Darwin viewed that term as a
substitute for what he actually envisioned as the cause of evolution—the principle of
preservation. The importance of “preservation” to Darwin’s theory about the mechanism
of evolution is, of course, evident from its use in the subtitle of his 1859 book.
The power of Darwin’s explanation of evolution has been greatly increased by advances
in knowledge about how traits are preserved from one generation to the next. It seems
reasonable to assume that advances in knowledge about how traditional cultural behaviors
are preserved from one generation to the next would make a similar contribution to the
study of cultural systems and the adoption of technological innovations. If the “principle
of preservation,” perhaps phrased for the sake of brevity as “natural preservation,” had
been the phrase that continued to be associated with Darwin’s theory, the study of evolution today might be largely the study of “natural preservation.”
If this were the case, a key concept in the study of cultural evolution might be “cultural
preservation.” Given that “tradition” is the word most commonly used to refer to patterns
of cultural behavior preserved from one generation to the next, the study of cultural evolution might focus more speciﬁcally on the study of “cultural traditions” than is currently
the case. In this ﬁctional scenario, the title of this volume might change from “Innovation
in Cultural Systems: Contributions from Evolutionary Anthropology” to “Innovation in
Cultural Systems: Contributions from the Anthropological Study of Traditions.” In such
a volume, the appropriateness of a chapter titled “Cultural Traditions and the Evolutionary
Advantages of Noninnovation” might be more readily apparent than is currently the case.
Such a title would be particularly appropriate for a volume emanating from a workshop
at the Konrad Lorenz Institute, because Lorenz (1975: 366) observed that “without cultural
tradition,” many structures of the human brain “would be as devoid of function as the
wings of an ostrich, only more so.”

The Experimental Study of Cultural Innovation
Alex Mesoudi

Cultural innovation, like cultural evolution in general, can be proﬁtably studied experimentally in the psychology laboratory. To illustrate this, I present two case studies in
which experimental simulations of cultural transmission have provided insights into the
processes of cultural innovation. First, Rose and Felton (1955) examined the effect of
migration on the spread of different interpretations of inkblots within small groups, ﬁnding
that invention was more frequent in closed societies, with stable group membership, than
in open societies, where participants migrated between groups.
Second, Mesoudi and O’Brien (2008a, 2008b) simulated the cultural transmission of
projectile-point designs in groups of participants, under the assumption that ﬁtness was
determined by an underlying adaptive landscape, where different inventions constitute
peaks of different heights and successful innovation occurs when members of a population
converge on the same peak. Participants used simple reinforcement learning to ﬁnd locally
adaptive point designs, but these designs rarely persisted once participants were allowed
to engage in biased horizontal cultural transmission. After that, most participants converged on the point design of the most successful player (the highest peak in the adaptive
landscape). In summary, experimental simulations can be used, in conjunction with other
social science methods, to provide an interdisciplinary approach to the study of cultural
innovation, as part of a uniﬁed science of cultural evolution.
How to Study Cultural Innovation
“Innovation” describes the processes by which a novel trait (an “invention”) emerges and
becomes ﬁxed in a population (Erwin and Krakauer 2004). It has long been recognized
that innovation plays a key role in biological evolution (Mayr 1960; Nitecki 1990), where
it describes the emergence of novel phenotypic traits and their ﬁxation within a species
(see chapters 3 and 4, this volume). The recent proliferation of work that takes an evolutionary approach to human culture (e.g., Aunger 2000; Brighton et al. 2005; Henrich and
McElreath 2003; Lipo et al. 2006; Mesoudi, Whiten, and Laland 2004, 2006; O’Brien and

<-----Page 188----->176

Lyman 2002; Pagel and Mace 2004; Plotkin 2002; Richerson and Boyd 2005; Runciman
2005; Shennan 2002; Wheeler et al. 2002) suggests the need for a similar concept of
“cultural innovation”—the processes by which a novel cultural trait emerges and spreads
within a society.
Cultural innovation has long been studied to some degree within economics
(Schumpeter 1934, 1942), anthropology (Barnett 1953), and sociology (Rogers 1995), but
rarely in an objective, quantiﬁable manner. This changed in the 1980s with the introduction into anthropology of the population-genetics-inspired mathematical models of CavalliSforza and Feldman (1981) and Boyd and Richerson (1985). Those studies demonstrated
that the manner in which a cultural trait spreads though a population (and hence becomes
an innovation) depends on the cultural-transmission mechanisms by which it is propagated, including vertical, oblique, and horizontal transmission (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman
1981); one-to-many or many-to-one transmission (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981);
conformist, anticonformist, and prestige biases (Boyd and Richerson 1985); and discrete
or blending cultural inheritance (Boyd and Richerson 1985).
Different transmission rules will often generate distinct patterns of cultural change, such
as stable intergenerational traditions (vertical transmission), rapidly changing fashions or
fads (horizontal transmission), stable intergroup differences (conformity), or exaggerated
cultural traits resulting from runaway selection (prestige bias). Models of cultural evolution therefore suggest that an understanding of cultural transmission—who copies what
from whom, and how—will provide important insights into the spread of cultural innovations (see chapters 7, 9, and 12, this volume).
Although mathematical models are important tools for understanding cultural change,
they are only as good as their assumptions. In this case, the assumptions concern cognitive
biases that determine when people copy others (as opposed to learning individually),
whom they learn from (e.g., high-status models or the group majority), how they learn
(e.g., using language or imitation), and what they learn. This is very much the domain of
psychology, and I suggest that laboratory experiments that draw on the methods of social
psychology can be used to study these cognitive biases. In doing so, they provide important
insights into the processes of cultural innovation and cultural evolution in general (Mesoudi
2007; Mesoudi and Whiten 2008).
Although experimental studies that simulate cultural transmission and cultural evolution have been relatively rare in the past (but see Bartlett 1932; Insko et al. 1980;
Jacobs and Campbell 1961; Rose and Felton 1955), there has been a resurgence of such
studies in recent years (e.g., Baum et al. 2004; Efferson et al. 2007, 2008; Kameda and
Nakanishi 2002, 2003; Kashima 2000; McElreath et al. 2005; Mesoudi 2008; Mesoudi
and O’Brien 2008a, 2008b; Mesoudi and Whiten 2004; Mesoudi, Whiten, and Dunbar
2006). In a typical cultural-evolution experiment, participants in small groups (often
called “microsocieties”) engage in a predeﬁned task or game designed to capture some
simpliﬁed aspect of real-life cultural change. Over repeated experimental trials (or

<-----Page 189----->The Experimental Study of Cultural Innovation

177

“generations”), the participants can, where desired by the experimenter, learn from one
another, that is, engage in cultural transmission. Crucially, the experimenter can systematically control who learns what, and from whom and how, in order to examine the effects
the various cultural-transmission biases described above have on broader patterns of
cultural change.
There are several beneﬁts that experimental methods can bring to the study of culture.
Experimentalists can “rerun” history, allowing for the replication of ﬁndings; they have
access to complete, uninterrupted, and unbiased data sets; they can manipulate variables;
and they can randomly assign participants to different experimental and control groups
(Mesoudi 2007). Of course, what experiments gain in control and manipulation (their high
internal validity) they lose in their low external validity, that is, the degree to which they
capture the actual cultural change that we wish to learn about. We can never be sure
whether the artiﬁcial laboratory setting will properly capture the environments in which
actual societies live; whether the simple experimental task will properly capture the challenges that actual societies face; whether experiments that last a maximum of a few hours
can properly capture cultural change that occurs over years, decades, or centuries; or
whether the often-biased participant pool (usually Western psychology undergraduates)
will behave in the same manner as the people who were originally responsible for a particular aspect of cultural change.
These problems can be overcome by using experimental methods in conjunction with
other methods rather than in place of them. By integrating ethnographic, archaeological,
and experimental methods, together with other tools such as mathematical models and
computer simulations, we can attain a more complete understanding of cultural change
than is afforded by any one method alone. Indeed, the low external validity and high
internal validity of both experimental simulations and mathematical models complement
the high external validity and low internal validity of ethnographic and archaeological
methods. I will return to this point later. Here, I turn attention to two case studies that
highlight how innovation can be studied in laboratory settings.
Case Study: The Effect of Migration on Rates of Cultural Innovation and
Invention
An early experimental simulation of cultural innovation was conducted by the sociologists
Rose and Felton (1955) and provides several pointers as to how cultural innovation can
be studied in the lab. Rose and Felton presented two Rorschach inkblots to three separate
three-person groups of participants. During each trial, group members privately and separately wrote down what they thought they could see in each inkblot. Each group member,
in turn, presented his or her interpretations to the other members of the group, who then
rated the interpretations for plausibility both out loud and privately on paper. This process

of private interpretation and public rating was repeated nine times (giving nine generations,
or what Rose and Felton called “epochs”).
The key question concerned not the content of the interpretations but how different
interpretations spread through the groups and, speciﬁcally, how intergroup migration
inﬂuenced cultural diffusion. Different phases of the experiment simulated two different
group conditions: “open” and “closed.” During closed phases, participants stayed in the
same groups over successive epochs and repeatedly interacted with the same group
members. During open phases, participants moved across groups. During each epoch of
the open phases, participants moved from their parent group to a new group with different
participants. Figure 11.1 shows how this social mobility was organized and how four
exemplar interpretations (a white angel, a spur, a brassiere, and a map of Chile) diffused
through the groups during successive epochs.
In their analysis, Rose and Felton classiﬁed each interpretation into one of four categories: (1) an invention—a novel interpretation generated by a single participant; (2) a
habit—the repetition of an interpretation by its inventor in successive epochs; (3) a culture
borrowing—an interpretation that has been copied from another participant; and (4) a
culbit—the repetition of a borrowed/copied interpretation by the borrower in successive
rounds (after Tylor 1871). Hence, Rose and Felton distinguished between the introduction
of a novel form into a group, either through individual learning (“inventions”) or cultural
transmission (“culture borrowings”), and the subsequent persistence of those novel introductions (“habits” and “culbits,” respectively), mirroring the modern distinction between
invention and innovation.
Informal inspection of ﬁgure 11.1 underscores several points. First, we can see two
modes of diffusion: (1) direct cultural transmission between participants within the same
groups and (2) the diffusion of interpretations resulting from people moving between
groups. This can be seen in the white-angel diffusion (Rose and Felton’s experiment 1,
top left panel of ﬁgure 11.1), which ﬁrst spreads within society Y during the closed epochs
I–III by within-group cultural transmission, before spreading with participants d, e, and f
to the other groups during the open epochs IV–VII.
This contrast evokes debates in the anthropological literature (e.g., Ammerman and
Cavalli-Sforza 1984; Sampietro et al. 2007) over whether agriculture spread across

Figure 11.1
Rose and Felton’s experimental design, with example traditions (from Rose and Felton, 1955). Epochs proceed
down the vertical axis of each panel; letters (a–i) represent participants, who are divided into three groups, societies X–Z. The four panels show the diffusion of four different interpretations (white angel, spur, brassiere, or
map of Chile) in four different experimental designs. Shapes indicate how each interpretation was classiﬁed, as
either an invention (circle), culture borrowing (square), habit (hexagon), or culbit (triangle). Each panel shows
a different form of migration: Experiment 1 has three closed epochs followed by four open epochs, experiment
2 has ﬁve closed epochs followed by four open epochs, experiment 3 has four closed epochs followed by another
four closed epochs with different group membership (then a ﬁnal return to the original groups), and experiment
4 has four open epochs followed by ﬁve closed epochs.

Neolithic Europe by cultural diffusion (the movement of ideas/technologies by means of
cultural transmission) or demic diffusion (the movement of people, who bring novel ideas/
technologies with them). Although archaeological and genetic data will provide the best,
most direct evidence regarding this issue, such data are always fraught with difﬁculties of
interpretation. Perhaps experimental simulations of cultural and demic diffusion, along the
lines of Rose and Felton’s study, might offer additional insight into this and similar
debates.
A second informal observation obtained from inspection of ﬁgure 11.1 is that open
societies facilitate the spread of interpretations across groups. As already noted, this can
be seen in the top left panel of ﬁgure 11.1, where the white-angel interpretation appears
in all of the groups during the open epochs IV–VII, as well as in the top right panel of
ﬁgure 11.1, where the spur interpretation spreads across groups during only the open
epochs VI–IX. One might consider this to be unsurprising—how could the same interpretation be found in more than one group if there is no communication or movement of people
between those groups? But this ignores the possibility of independent invention in two
unconnected societies. This did not occur in the diagrams shown in ﬁgure 11.1, and Rose
and Felton do not mention it occurring in other trials, but it is possible that two people
might see the same object in an inkblot, given the similarities in people’s perceptual
systems and semantic knowledge.
This issue—how to distinguish between traits that are shared because of descent from
a common source versus traits that are shared because of independent invention (convergent evolution)—is explicitly dealt with by phylogenetic methods, which are increasingly being applied to cultural data sets (Lipo et al. 2006; Mace et al. 2006; O’Brien
and Lyman 2003; O’Brien et al. 2008). Experimental simulations might provide insights
into the reliability of phylogenetic methods by applying them to data generated in
experiments in which it is known exactly who copied what from whom. Indeed, this
has been done recently by Spencer et al. (2004), who applied phylogenetic analyses to
lineages of manuscripts generated by participants in the lab in order to test the reliability of such analyses when applied to actual historical manuscripts (e.g., Howe
et al. 2001).
A third observation from ﬁgure 11.1 is that interpretations sometimes went dormant,
during which time they were not presented to the group but must have been remembered
by the participants, given that they reappear during a later epoch. This can be seen in
experiment 2 (top right panel of ﬁgure 11.1), where the spur interpretation disappeared
during epochs III, IV, and V before reappearing in epoch VI and then spreading across
the groups. This bears some resemblance to the manner in which recessive alleles can
remain in a population of biological organisms with no observable phenotypic effects. It
also highlights the fact that ideas can persist with no observable record of that persistence,
which may present difﬁculties for historians or archaeologists when reconstructing lineages of cultural traits.

<-----Page 193----->The Experimental Study of Cultural Innovation

Following statistical analysis of their experimental data, Rose and Felton’s somewhat
surprising main ﬁnding was that the isolation of closed societies fostered invention (see
chapter 8, this volume). As participants moved from group to group in the open societies,
they tended to borrow from existing group members rather than invent novel interpretations. In the words of Rose and Felton (1955: 391), “in general, as mobility follows isolation, borrowing displaces invention.” As they also note, this ﬁnding that closed societies
foster invention counters the intuitive notion of “mobile and cosmopolitan urban populations having made the most cultural change” (p. 392), that is, that populations that encourage immigration and diversity (e.g., cosmopolitan cities such as New York or London)
are culturally more inventive and creative than populations that remain isolated (e.g., the
Amish [see chapter 10, this volume]), which are seen as culturally conservative and
uncreative.
Perhaps, though, Rose and Felton’s result is not too surprising in that being in the same
closed group over successive epochs meant that participants could not simply repeat previously presented ideas. Instead, they had to come up with novel ideas, whereas participants
who found themselves in new groups could forgo the difﬁculty of coming up with a new
idea and instead copy the idea of a member of their previous group. This explanation has
the beneﬁt of hindsight, however, and highlights the potential value of laboratory experiments that simulate cultural processes such as innovation and transmission in questioning
our intuitions and presumptions regarding cultural change, in this case the “bland presumption that social mobility leads inevitably to cultural creativity” (Rose and Felton 1955:
392).
It has to be pointed out that this was a highly simpliﬁed experiment with small numbers
of participants and groups, and a form of culture—inkblot interpretation—that is by deﬁnition functionless, arbitrary, and subjective. It may well be that if this experimental design
were repeated with functional cultural traits, we would see more creativity in open groups,
as different functional components generated by different groups are combined, allowing
cumulative cultural evolution (although whether this kind of recombination is classed as
“invention” or not is another matter). Alternatively, much of culture can be classed as
neutral and has been shown to change randomly (see chapter 8, this volume), so perhaps
inkblots are not too inappropriate for simulating actual cultural change.
Finally, Rose and Felton found that habits and culbits showed different patterns of
change: Habits tended to increase more in open societies than in closed societies, whereas
culbits increased uniformly irrespective of the society type. This ﬁnding highlights the
importance of a particular cultural form’s origin, individual or social learning, for its
subsequent persistence, although it is unclear what is causing this particular difference.
In summary, the pioneering study conducted by Rose and Felton (1955) illustrates how
experimental laboratory simulations can provide valuable insights into the processes that
govern cultural invention and innovation. These researchers showed how to distinguish
methodologically between invention (the emergence of a novel cultural form) and innovation

<-----Page 194----->182

Alex Mesoudi

(the persistence of that cultural form), and they highlighted the importance of distinguishing
between the origin of these kinds of cultural traits by showing that traits that originated in
individual learning exhibited different patterns of change from those that originated in social
learning. Consequently, their conceptual distinctions between inventions, culture borrowings, habits, and culbits may be useful in future studies of cultural innovation—not just
experimental studies but also analytical, observational, and historical studies.
Rose and Felton’s counterintuitive ﬁnding that invention was favored in closed societies
and curbed in open societies highlights the importance of empirically testing what may
appear to be obvious assumptions regarding human culture (e.g., closed societies are less
creative than open societies). Further experimental studies might test the effect of social
mobility on nonarbitrary cultural traits that allow functional improvement or cumulative
cultural evolution, or test the effect that variables other than social mobility have on patterns of invention and innovation, such as task difﬁculty or ethnic markers.
Case Study: Innovations Can Spread as a Result of Biased Cultural Transmission
in Multimodal Adaptive Landscapes
Rose and Felton’s (1955) study demonstrates how to simulate the spread of largely arbitrary cultural traits in the form of inkblot interpretations. It seems likely, however, that
many cultural innovations, particularly technological innovations, are not entirely arbitrary, such that their spread and persistence will depend to some extent on their cultural
ﬁtness. By “cultural ﬁtness,” I mean the properties of a culturally transmitted artifact, such
as its functional efﬁcacy, cost, durability, or social signiﬁcance, that affect the artifact’s
probability of subsequent persistence and transmission relative to other similar artifacts.
In an experimental study conducted in collaboration with Mike O’Brien (Mesoudi and
O’Brien 2008a, 2008b), we set out to explore experimentally this relationship between an
artifact’s ﬁtness and its invention and innovation. Speciﬁcally, we simulated the cultural
transmission of projectile-point technology, drawing on an archaeological study of
prehistoric Great Basin projectile-point cultural transmission conducted by Bettinger
and Eerkens (1999).
In our study, groups of participants played a simple computer game in which they
designed their own “virtual arrowheads” and tested them in a “virtual hunting environment.” Participants entered the attributes of their arrowheads—length, width, thickness,
color, and shape—and then received feedback on the success of their designs, in terms of
calories obtained during a hunt, equivalent to an arrowhead’s ﬁtness. The closer the arrowhead design was to a prespeciﬁed optimal design, the higher the feedback score. The aim
for the participant was to achieve as high a score as possible by ﬁnding the optimal design
in the environment. This could be done in two ways (see ﬁgure 11.2)—by individual
learning or by biased cultural transmission.

Figure 11.2
Experimental design of Mesoudi and O’Brien (2008a), showing the 30 trials (or “hunts”) comprising one session.

Following an initial trial (during which the participant could copy the ﬁnal point design
of a previous participant, although this is not relevant to the present discussion), participants engaged in 24 trials (or “hunts”) of individual learning, where they could use trial
and error to ﬁnd the optimal arrowhead design. Each hunt represented one opportunity to
modify and test the arrowhead design. Then, during the ﬁnal ﬁve hunts, participants could
additionally engage in biased cultural transmission. They were shown the cumulative
scores of other members of their six-person group, each of whom was playing the same
game in the same environment, and the participant could choose to view and copy the
arrowhead design of one of those other group members. Thus, participants could engage
in biased cultural transmission by preferentially copying the player with the highest score
(resembling Boyd and Richerson’s [1985] “indirect bias” or Henrich and Gil-White’s
[2001] “prestige bias” [see chapter 7, this volume]).
One goal of our study was to explore how the nature of the underlying ﬁtness
functions, which were used to calculate the feedback scores given to the participants,
affected arrowhead designs during different phases of the experiment. Speciﬁcally, we
wanted to test the idea that the spread of technological artifacts will be governed by
the shape of an underlying multimodal adaptive landscape. The concept of an adaptive
landscape is commonly used in evolutionary biology (Arnold et al. 2001; Simpson 1944;
Wright 1932) to represent the design space of all possible combinations of multiple
phenotypic characters, where the height of the landscape represents ﬁtness. If a landscape is multimodal, then there are multiple “peaks” of different heights, each representing a locally optimal phenotype of different ﬁtness. Any deviation away from any of
these locally optimal peaks would result in lower ﬁtness. There may, however, be higher
peaks elsewhere in the landscape that can be reached only by traversing low-ﬁtness
valleys. Hence, populations of organisms can get stuck on locally optimal but globally
suboptimal peaks.
Applied to cultural evolution, the ﬁtness of a cultural artifact would be determined by
its location in an equivalent adaptive landscape. This landscape would represent all
possible designs within a design space, with different peaks representing different locally
optimal artifact designs (similar to Lake and Venti’s [2009] conceptualization of bicycle
design space, although adding a consideration of ﬁtness).

<-----Page 196----->184

Alex Mesoudi

With respect to the topic of this volume, I suggest that different locally optimal peaks in
an artifact’s adaptive landscape can be seen as different potential inventions. Innovations,
on the other hand, can be seen as peaks at which the majority of actual artifacts in a population can be found, which may or may not represent the highest, globally optimal peak. In
terms of learning processes, individual learning would constitute the exploration of this
adaptive landscape by means of a random walk, leading to the discovery of one or more
locally optimal peaks, or inventions. Biased cultural transmission, however, would allow
people to jump across low-ﬁtness valleys, from their locally adaptive peak to a higher peak
found by a more successful individual, making this peak/design the innovation.
In our experiment (Mesoudi and O’Brien 2008a), we implemented a simple multimodal
adaptive landscape to determine the ﬁtness of the virtual arrowheads. The overall ﬁtness
of an arrowhead was the sum of the ﬁtness contributions from four independent attributes:
length, width, thickness, and shape as shown in ﬁgure 11.3 (the ﬁfth attribute, color, had
no effect on ﬁtness). Shape was discrete, taking one of four values of different ﬁtness. The
others were continuous, ranging from one to 100 arbitrary units, and their associated ﬁtnesses were given by bimodal ﬁtness functions.

thickness combined to create a multimodal adaptive landscape.

<-----Page 197----->The Experimental Study of Cultural Innovation

185

Combining these three bimodal ﬁtness functions speciﬁed a multimodal adaptive landscape that our participants could explore. For example, the highest peak in this adaptive
landscape can be found where length, width, and thickness are all at their global optima.
A slightly lower peak can be found where length and width are at their globally optimal
values but thickness is at its local optimum. The lowest peak can be found where length,
width, and thickness are all at their local optima. Any deviation away from each of these
peaks (there are eight in total) results in a decrease in ﬁtness and a lower score for the
participant. Participants were not told anything about the underlying ﬁtness functions,
just as real hunters are not informed about presumed real-life technological-ﬁtness
functions.
We wanted to test the key prediction that during the 24 individual learning hunts, different participants will by chance diverge onto different peaks in the landscape and,
because they are local optima, get stuck on these peaks. These are thus different “inventions” generated by our participants. Then, in the ﬁnal ﬁve hunts, during which biased
cultural transmission is allowed, we will see participants copying the most successful
player, who has, perhaps by chance, found the highest globally optimal peak (or the highest
peak found by anyone in that group). This is group “innovation.” This scenario would
therefore predict greater variation in the different participants’ arrowhead designs following the individual-learning phase, because different participants will ﬁnd different peaks
compared to the biased-cultural-transmission phase, when the participants converge on the
same peak. It would also predict lower mean ﬁtness during the individual-learning phase
because the different peaks will have varying ﬁtness compared to the biased-culturaltransmission phase, when players can copy a more successful fellow player and all converge on that player’s higher ﬁtness peak.
These predictions were largely conﬁrmed (for details, see Mesoudi and O’Brien
[2008a]). Figure 11.4a shows that within-group variation dropped sharply once participants could engage in biased cultural transmission and copy other group members (the
last ﬁve hunts), and ﬁgure 11.4b shows that mean ﬁtness increased during this period.
Further analyses supported the claim that the multimodal adaptive landscape was critical
to the ﬁtness advantage provided by cultural transmission relative to individual learning.
Statistical analyses showed that the number of participants with point designs at the
global optimum for each attribute was signiﬁcantly higher immediately following the
onset of biased cultural transmission than immediately before. Agent-based computer
simulations of the same experimental task (Mesoudi and O’Brien 2008b) as well as
subsequent experiments (Mesoudi 2008) conﬁrmed that in a unimodal adaptive landscape, where there is a single optimal peak, biased cultural transmission does no better
than individual learning. In sum, the shape of the underlying adaptive landscape was
instrumental in, ﬁrst, generating different inventions (representing different locally
optimal peaks) and, second, favoring the emergence of an innovation (representing the
globally optimal peak).

How realistic is this assumption of a multimodal adaptive landscape underlying cultural
innovation? With respect to projectile points speciﬁcally, Cheshier and Kelly (2006)
recently summarized experimental evidence for trade-offs in point designs among such
factors as accuracy, range, killing power, and durability, stating, for example, that “thin,
narrow points have greater penetrating power, but wide, thick points create a larger wound
that bleeds more easily” (Cheshier and Kelly 2006: 353). Functional trade-offs such as
these would potentially produce multiple locally optimal point designs, with, for example,
one optimal design maximizing penetrating power and another maximizing bleeding. As
Boyd and Richerson (1992) suggest, many technological artifacts are likely governed by
similar trade-offs between competing demands that may result in multimodal adaptive
landscapes. Much work remains to be done to test this claim adequately, although experimental simulations might be useful in identifying the kind of data that is indicative
of different cultural-ﬁtness functions, which can then be compared with actual cultural
data sets.
In general, viewing (a) different inventions as different ﬁtness peaks and (b) biased
cultural transmission as a means of traversing adaptive valleys that allows individuals to
converge on higher peaks (much as Fisher [1930] viewed sexual reproduction) may
provide important insights into long-term cultural innovation. For example, we might
predict that the more peaks there are in an adaptive landscape, that is, the more alternative stable designs exist, the more difﬁcult it should be to ﬁnd the peak/invention that
has the highest ﬁtness. Similarly, the greater the ﬁtness difference of alternative designs,
that is, the differences in height of the different ﬁtness peaks, the easier it should be
to identify the highest peak/best design by means of biased cultural transmission and
the more adaptive that biased cultural transmission should be relative to individual
learning.
Population size would also be important: The larger the effective population size, the
more likely it is that someone will ﬁnd the highest ﬁtness peak by way of individual learning, resulting in higher ﬁtness in the entire population following biased cultural transmission (see Mesoudi and O’Brien [2008b] for computer simulations that conﬁrm this effect
of group size). We (Mesoudi and O’Brien 2008a) also found that when participants had
to pay a cost to modify their point designs, that is, when individual learning was costly,
cultural transmission was relatively more adaptive, consistent with the results of previous
theoretical models (e.g., Boyd and Richerson 1995). Hence, we can predict that successful
innovations are more likely to spread by cultural transmission when individual learning
is costly.
Future experiments might simulate cultural evolution on differently shaped adaptive
landscapes or where trait characters are linked in more complex ways, that is, cultural
epistasis, as in Kauffman’s (1993) Nk model of adaptive landscapes, as well as the higherlevel combination of more distinct inventions, such as the combination of point designs
and bow designs into a bow-and-arrow cultural complex. This introduces notions of

<-----Page 200----->188

modularity, which has been a recent topic of interest in biological innovation: “invention
and innovation are about developing . . . new rules for combining biological and technological modules” (Erwin and Krakauer 2004: 1118; see also Callebaut and RasskinGutman 2005), suggesting that principles from EvoDevo may be useful for the study of
cultural innovation and cultural evolution (Mesoudi and O’Brien 2008c).
Conclusions
The preceding case studies hopefully have demonstrated that it is possible to simulate
cultural processes in the psychology laboratory in a manner that can provide potentially
useful insights into the mechanisms that underlie speciﬁc aspects of cultural change,
including cultural innovation. Rose and Felton (1955) showed how to distinguish methodologically between invention (the emergence of a novel cultural form) and innovation
(the persistence of that cultural form), and they tested the hypothesis that migration
increases the frequency of invention, ﬁnding the contrary result that closed societies
with no migration foster invention. Mesoudi and O’Brien (2008a, 2008b) showed that
when the ﬁtness of an artifact is determined by a multimodal adaptive landscape, then
individual learning can cause artifacts to diverge to different locally adaptive states,
that is, generate multiple stable inventions, whereas biased cultural transmission can
cause artifacts to converge on a single globally adaptive form, that is, produce an
innovation.
In conclusion, I reemphasize that experimental simulations of cultural innovation, or
cultural evolution in general, are not intended to replace observational, ethnographic,
historical, or archaeological methods. As noted at the outset, and echoing Larson’s (see
chapter 5, this volume) call for interdisciplinary research, all of these methods should be
used together to tackle the same problems, such that they complement one another’s
strengths and shore up weaknesses. Experimental studies can provide tests of speciﬁc
hypotheses under controlled laboratory conditions; ethnographic studies can provide naturalistic observational data; historical and archaeological studies can provide information
regarding long-term patterns and trends; mathematical models can provide rigorous analyses of speciﬁc problems; and so on.
Although different branches of the social sciences have traditionally been isolated
from one another, cultural-evolutionary theory provides an overarching theoretical
framework that promises to integrate and unify the social sciences (Mesoudi, Whiten,
and Laland 2006), just as Darwinian evolutionary theory integrated the biological sciences during the 1930s and 1940s (Mayr and Provine 1980). Indeed, the diverse contributions to this volume from anthropologists, archaeologists, biologists, philosophers, and
psychologists provide encouraging signs that such a synthesis for the social sciences is
not far off.

Social Learning, Economic Inequality, and Innovation Diffusion
Anne Kandler and James Steele

Evolutionary models of innovation processes should address not just the origination phase
but also the diffusion phase. Such models must be sensitive to socioeconomic context,
where that context clearly affects the diffusion dynamics. Here we study the adoption
dynamics of successful innovations, using as a model the sales of new consumer durables
(televisions, washing machines, microwaves, and the like). Figure 12.1 shows the typical
S-shaped adoption curve for such innovations. We consider the possible role of socialinﬂuence processes and of economic inequalities in determining the rate of growth in sales
of new products of this kind and propose a new model that includes both social-inﬂuence
processes and economic-inequality effects.
We start our consideration by contrasting two models of social-inﬂuence processes in
innovation diffusion, one from marketing science (Bass 1969) and the other from dualinheritance (DI) theory in anthropology (Henrich 2001). The Bass model of new product
sales growth and the DI model of innovation diffusion both assume a homogeneous population of adopters, and both assume that the ﬁnite diffusion rate for learned awareness of
the beneﬁcial nature of the innovation is what prevents everyone from adopting it immediately. In both models, basic social-inﬂuence effects on levels of awareness are modeled
as the rate term of a logistic growth process. The models diverge in their consideration of
additional effects. Bass assumes that takeoff may be accelerated by an additional constant
likelihood that an individual will choose to adopt independent of social inﬂuences
(“innovativeness”). Henrich’s DI model also assumes that takeoff may be accelerated by
an independent-learning effect but introduces an additional frequency-dependent socialinﬂuence effect (“conformist bias”) that actually delays takeoff.
For new products with signiﬁcant cost, it is likely that adoption decisions are also inﬂuenced
by price. In a community with money allocated unequally among individuals, people will
have different reservation price thresholds for adoption. We therefore deﬁne an alternative
approach, the “threshold heterogeneity” model. We demonstrate that where the price of a new
product declines at the rate typically seen in new product life cycles, a population distribution
of reservation prices based on empirical income distributions can produce the observed
S-shaped diffusion patterns equally as well as the Bass and DI social-inﬂuence models.

Time since Introduction
Figure 12.1
Typical adoption rate and cumulative adoption curves for new products.

To decide which of the considered models provides the most accurate explanation of
the dynamics of adoption decisions, we need to consider additional information as well
as sales growth. In his implementation of a DI approach, Henrich (2001) argued that
biased-transmission processes must have predominated in the adoption decisions of populations of homogeneous agents in all empirical cases that show a sigmoid diffusion curve.
Independent-learning processes cannot produce an adoption curve of this kind.
The assumption of agent homogeneity, however, is too restrictive and clearly inappropriate when studying adoption of costly goods in populations with high levels of economic
inequality. A number of recent studies in the marketing literature have considered this
problem (Golder and Tellis 1998; Van den Bulte and Stremersch 2004). They indicate that
affordability is indeed an important criterion in individual decisions about when to adopt.
For costly new products such as consumer durables, people are often aware of the product
and its desirability long before they purchase it because they have had to wait for its price
to come down to their own reservation price threshold.
To incorporate both social inﬂuences and affordability, we also propose a combined
model. The key ﬁnding of this model is that although the adoption pattern will be determined primarily by social-inﬂuence processes where initial price is low and/or the subsequent price decline is rapid, the pattern will be determined primarily by affordability
constraints when the initial price is high and the subsequent price decline is slow.
The Bass Model of Innovation Diffusion
Typically in the innovation-adoption literature from marketing science, diffusion of an
advantageous new product by independent assessment of efﬁcacy is expected to produce
an r-shaped cumulative growth curve, whereas diffusion by imitation of prior adopters
is expected to produce an S-shaped curve (Bass 1969). Bass’s inﬂuential model

<-----Page 207----->Social Learning, Economic Inequality, and Innovation Diffusion

195

proposes that the population of adopters can be divided into innovators and imitators
and that the shape of the cumulative adoption curve will vary as a function of their
relative importance. The Bass model includes an innovation coefﬁcient, p, representing
the fraction of the population that will adopt the innovation, regardless of the availability of demonstrators, and an imitation coefﬁcient, q, representing the fraction of the
population whose choice is determined by the number of previous adopters. The basic
model states that
P (t ) = p + qY (t ) ,
where P is the probability of adoption by those who have not yet adopted at time t, and
Y(t) is the frequency of existing adopters at time t. This can then be expressed as a population rate of increase

∂Y (t )
= ( p + qY (t )) (1 − Y (t )) .
∂t

(12.1)

In cases where q > p, adoption will increase to reach an internal peak before declining,
leading to an S-shaped cumulative adoption curve. In cases where q ≤ p, adoption rates
will be at their maximum initially and then tail off, leading to an r-shaped cumulative
adoption curve. The empirical ratio q/p gives an index of the relative importance of innovativeness and of imitation in the diffusion of a particular new cultural trait and is a shape
parameter for the cumulative adoption curve.
The Dual-Inheritance Model
A similar model of innovation diffusion is provided by DI theory. In this approach, it is
assumed that the majority of human behavior is acquired through social learning (Boyd
and Richerson 1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman 1981; Henrich 2001). Following Boyd
and Richerson (1985), we can distinguish among several different decision mechanisms
affecting the adoption of traits:
• Guided variation—the selective retention of variants (including novel variants) found
to be efﬁcacious by individual trial-and-error learning.
• Direct-biased transmission—the selective copying of preexisting variants found to be
efﬁcacious by individual assessment.
• Indirect-biased transmission—the selective copying of variants from individuals with
speciﬁc qualities and attributes deemed to make them ﬁt models without assessing directly
the efﬁcacy of the copied variant.
• Frequency-dependent transmission—the selective copying of variants from individuals
on the basis of their commonness or rarity without assessing directly the efﬁcacy of the
copied variant.

<-----Page 208----->196

A. Kandler and J. Steele

In the DI model (Henrich 2001), the temporal social dynamic of the spread of cultural
variants by biased transmission can be modeled by the following differential equation:

∂Y (t )
= ξ ( P1 − PY
1 (t )) + η B (1 − Y (t )) Y (t ) ,
∂t

(12.2)

where Y(t) describes the proportion of the population that has already adopted the variant
at time t. The constants x and h represent the fractions of individuals in a population that
rely on guided variation and biased transmission, respectively. The parameter P1 is the
probability of adopting the innovation through guided variation (Henrich 2001), and the
parameter B represents the effects of the different forms of biased transmission on
the spread of the variant. Given that we are interested in the adoption process of costly
goods, we modify Henrich’s treatment of guided variation so that the individuals are not
allowed to revoke their adoption decisions if they cannot work out how to use the product
effectively; that is, if they have purchased a good, they cannot return it.
In this context we have to distinguish between cases in which B is a constant and those
in which B depends on the frequency, Y. In the ﬁrst case, equation 12.2 includes the effects
of direct and indirect transmission only, and the proportion of the population that has
adopted at time t can be expressed explicitly by
Y (t ) =

1 − e −(ξP1 +ηB )t
.
ηB −(ξP1 +ηB)t
e
+1
ξ P1

Conversely, conformist-biased transmission, where the rate has a positive frequency
dependence, can be included by setting
B = B(Y ) = b (1 − a ) + a (2Y (t ) − 1)
(Boyd and Richerson 1985). The constant component b(1 − a) models the inﬂuence of
direct- and indirect-biased transmission, whereas a(2Y(t) − 1) describes the inﬂuence of
conformist-biased transmission. The parameter a is a measure of the strength of that conformist bias. As mentioned in Henrich (2001), a should be chosen to be rather small;
otherwise conformist bias makes the spread of an initially rare variant impossible. In this
case, equation 12.2 can be written as

∂Y (t )
= ξ ( P1 − PY
1 (t )) + η [ b (1 − a ) + a ( 2Y (t ) − 1)] (1 − Y (t )) Y (t ) .
∂t

(12.3)

To illustrate the general spread dynamic given by equation 12.3, ﬁgure 12.2 shows
cumulative adoption curves for different parameter constellations. The fraction of the
population that relies on guided variation is assumed to be very small—P1 has a value
of 0.001, and the coefﬁcients determining the rates of individual and of social learning,

x and h, are both chosen to be 0.5. We can derive that a variant diffuses successfully by
all the different transmission mechanisms if B > 0.
Figure 12.3 shows the course of the frequency-dependent transmission coefﬁcient B in
dependence of the frequency Y, and we see that the coefﬁcients B(Y) are always positive
for the parameter constellations a = 0, b = 0.15; a = 0.07, b = 0.2; a = 0.07, b = 0.15,
and in these cases the variant is adopted by the whole population. However, in contrast,
if B < 0, the innovation is not supported by the whole of the social-transmission mechanism. The negative effect of conformist-bias transmission due to the rareness of the
innovation at the beginning cannot be compensated by direct and indirect transmission
biases, and the innovation will increase its frequency only by independent learning (see
the cumulative adoption curve for the parameters a = 0.2, b = 0.1 in ﬁgure 12.2). Even
a higher initial condition Y(0) = 0.05 is insufﬁcient to maintain the variant in the
population.
Further, comparison of the cumulative adoption curves with the parameters a = 0, b =
0.15 and a = 0.07, b = 0.15, which obviously differ only in the respective absence (a = 0)
and presence (a = 0.07) of the conformist-biased component, shows that such frequencydependent biases are able to produce long tails at the beginning. Conformist bias supports
the spread of common variables but impedes the spread of rare variants. Consequently, it
takes longer for a rare variable to spread if conformity is present as is reﬂected in the long
tails at the beginning. In contrast, parameter b inﬂuences the steepness of the curve. The

the whole population.
Comparison of the Dual-Inheritance Model with the Bass Model
Both the Bass model and the DI model provide possibilities to describe the diffusion of
an advantageous innovation in a population. In this section we explore how different or
how similar the models are in terms of the adoption dynamics. If we compare the models
without considering conformist bias, the cumulative adoption curves for the spread of
costly goods obtained by the Bass model and the DI model coincide exactly. The Bass
model deﬁnes the spread dynamic by equation 12.1, whereas the DI model without conformist bias determines the dynamic by equation 12.2. By setting
p = ξ P1 and q = ηB,

(12.4)

it is obvious that both equations are the same. This means that the fraction xP1 is equivalent to the parameter p in the Bass model—the fraction of the population that adopts
the innovation independently and not as a result of any imitation process—and hB is

equivalent to the parameter q, which determines the strength of the imitation process.
Figure 12.4 (curves labeled A) shows an example of this coincidence. With the parameters P1 = 0.001, x = h = 0.5, a = 0, and b = 0.15, we obtain p = xP1 = 0.0005 and q =
hB = 0.075.
The situation changes if we include conformist bias, which is responsible for a long tail
of the cumulative adoption curve at the beginning. Figure 12.4 (curves labeled B and C)
shows the divergence of the DI model from the Bass model, which cannot reproduce
this long-tailed pattern at the beginning. For these examples, however, the deviation
between cumulative adoption curves remains less signiﬁcant than the overall close
correspondence.
Because of this coincidence, we consider in the further numerical examples only the
DI model, given that the Bass model is equivalent to the DI model without conformist
bias. From this point forward, we shall refer to the DI model as “the social-learning
model.”

Alternative Explanation: Threshold Heterogeneity
The two previous models have the common assumption that the spread of an innovation
is determined by a mixture of individual exploration and social learning. It is assumed
implicitly that all individuals who want to adopt an innovation can actually do so. Having
the spread of costly goods in mind, we emphasize that this is not always the case. Rather,
only wealthy individuals will initially be able to afford an expensive innovation, whereas
the others will have to wait until the price of the innovation drops below their individual
thresholds for adopting it. Such “moving-equilibrium” effects are analyzed in probit
models in the economics literature (David 2005; Geroski 2000) and are not accounted for
in the social-learning model.
Based on the work of Van den Bulte and Stremersch (2004), we can examine this heterogeneity approach based on economic factors and show that both explanations—the
social-learning model and the threshold-heterogeneity hypothesis—can lead to nearly the
same S-shaped cumulative adoption curves.
In the following we assume that income is the factor that determines the adoption decision and timing and that income is unequally distributed through the population. The
heterogeneity approach presumes that an individual, i, will adopt an innovation if its price
is smaller than the individual’s threshold, qi, the reservation price depending on the individual’s income. We note that an unequal income distribution leads naturally to an unequal
distribution of adoption-price thresholds. In this context, initial innovators are not the
venturesome and daring individuals of the Bass model. Rather, they are the people who
can initially afford the innovation.
Different considerations (Salem and Mount 1974) have shown that one means of
approximating the income of a population, and consequently the price-threshold distribution, is by using a two-parameter right-skewed gamma distribution given by the
function
fΘ(θ ) =

λ α α −1 − λθ
θ e , with α , λ > 0 and θ ≥ 0.
α

(12.5)

The two parameters, a and l, can be interpreted as measures of inequality and scale of
the distribution.1
Different sets of these distribution parameters lead to different degrees of inequality, as
shown in ﬁgure 12.5, where theoretical distributions of adoption thresholds for a new
product of the form (5) with the parameters l = 6 and a = 2, 3, 4 are illustrated. The levels
of income inequality can be quantiﬁed by the Gini income concentration coefﬁcients2 of
0.375, 0.313, and 0.273. It is obvious that the population’s income is distributed most
evenly for the smallest Gini coefﬁcient, 0.273.
Assuming the income distributions shown in ﬁgure 12.5 as proxies for the adoptionthreshold distributions, and with an exponential price decline for the new product over time,

the cumulative adoption curves (solid lines) in ﬁgure 12.6 are obtained. They are S-shaped,
but here the shape reﬂects income heterogeneity and not contagion/diffusion. The interpretation of S-shaped curves in the social-learning model applies only in cases where there is
population homogeneity in the economic factors determining the threshold for adoption
subsequent to exposure. Figure 12.6 (solid lines) shows that different price-threshold distributions result in different adoption processes in a threshold-heterogeneity model. A more
unequal income distribution implies that a larger proportion of the income will be earned
by fewer individuals. This means that for a new product with high initial cost and a steady
pattern of price decline, diffusion of the innovation through the population will take longer,
given that the price threshold of the majority of the population will be lower.
In order to derive an analytical expression for the spread dynamic shown in ﬁgure 12.6
similar to equations 12.1 or 12.3 for, respectively, the Bass and the DI model, we use the
cumulative-distribution function, FΘ(q), of the price threshold, Θ, which can be interpreted
as the proportion of the population with a threshold less than or equal to q. Then,
F (t ) = FΘ( ρ (t )) ,
where the price, r(t), of the innovation is a decreasing function in time. As a further consideration, we assume an exponential price decline of the form r(t) = r0e−bt, where the
innovation has an initial price of r0. In this case, we can determine the change, dF(t)/dt,
in the proportion that has already adopted at time t by

We have formulated the analytical expressions for the time course of the adoption
process based on the contrasting social-learning (equation 12.3) and thresholdheterogeneity hypotheses (equation 12.6), and now we compare the resulting cumulative
adoption curves. Figure 12.6 shows that the shapes of the adoption curves can be similar.
The solid lines represent the curves obtained by the heterogeneity approach with different
degrees of inequality, whereas the dashed lines illustrate the spread dynamic produced by
the social-learning approach under different transmission biases.
This raises the question of which values for the measure of income inequality and which
transmission parameters, P1 and B, lead to the same cumulative adoption curves. To answer
this, we assume different gamma-distributed price thresholds with corresponding Gini
coefﬁcients of 0.273, 0.313, and 0.375 (as shown in ﬁgure 12.5) and a price decline for
the innovation given by r(t) = 45e−0.1t; that is, the initial price of the innovation is 45 and
it then decreases exponentially. In the next step we determine the parameters that minimize
(in a quadratic sense) distances between the function Y(t) in the social-learning model and
the function F(t) in the threshold-heterogeneity approach. In mathematical terms, we look
for the unique solution of the optimization problem
min F (t ) − Y (t )

Table 12.1 shows the corresponding values of the parameters of the social-learning
curves (with x = h = 0.5), which are the best quadratic approximations of the function
F(t). We ﬁnd that a = 0 for all three examples, so the transmission parameter B reﬂects
only the effects of direct- and indirect-biased transmission.
This analysis shows that curve forms in the threshold-heterogeneity model—forms
that vary with income inequality, which we take as a measure of inequality of the
reservation-price distribution—and in the social-learning model—forms that vary with
the relative importance of guided variation and biased transmission—are directly proportional. This fact is illustrated in ﬁgure 12.7, where the shape ratios, q̃/p̃, and the

Gini coefﬁcients are contrasted. The relation between these two parameters is almost
linear.
A Combined Model
As shown in the previous sections, both models—one based on the social-learning hypothesis and the other on the threshold-heterogeneity hypothesis—provide good ﬁts for
S-shaped adoption curves. The social-learning model assumes that the spread of an innovation is determined by cultural-transmission biases in the population. The innovation
favored by these transmission mechanisms will spread across the whole population. This
approach assumes that every individual who wants to adopt is able to do so and that there
are no external constraints on the adoption decision. In contrast, the heterogeneity model
is based on such an external constraint and assumes that the adoption process is determined
only by an individual’s price threshold—the ability to afford the innovation. However, in
this case it is assumed that all individuals in the population want to adopt the innovation
as soon as possible.
For modeling the spread of costly goods, it might seem more appropriate to combine
both hypotheses by developing a model in which the desire to adopt is inﬂuenced by social
biases but where the timing of adoption is constrained by affordability. This leads to the
following approach,
X (t ) = Y (t ) F (t ) = Y (t ) (1 − FΘ( ρ (t ))) ,

(12.7)

where F(t) is the cumulative adoption curve obtained by the threshold-heterogeneity approach
and Y(t) is the cumulative adoption curve of the social-learning model given by equation
12.3. This model assumes that acquiring a preference to adopt the innovation is independent
of income. People are heterogeneous with respect to price thresholds for adoption but homogeneous with respect to mechanisms for acquiring the preference to adopt.
What about the spread dynamic of the combined model and the inﬂuences of different
patterns of price decline? As stated before, the cumulative adoption curve of the sociallearning model is by deﬁnition unaffected by changes in economic factors and stays the same
in the following examples, where we compare the adoption curves of the social-learning
model, the threshold-heterogeneity model, and the proposed combined model for different
patterns of price decline. At ﬁrst we assume that the price is constant over the entire time
period. Figure 12.8 illustrates this situation, with a constant price, r = 10, an unequal income
distribution indexed by a Gini coefﬁcient of 0.375, and social-transmission parameters a =
0.05 and b = 0.15. The cumulative adoption curve of the threshold-heterogeneity approach
is simply a constant, given that the price does not change from the initial value.
The cumulative adoption curve of the combined model shows an S-shaped pattern. It is
dominated in the ﬁrst time period by the social-learning model, but the economic constraints

delay the spread of the innovation through the population. Given that the price is constant,
only the part of the population whose reservation price is greater than or equal to 10 will ever
adopt, and, as a result, the innovation will not spread successfully through the whole population, despite the fact that the whole population is aware of the innovation. This can be seen
in ﬁgure 12.8, where the cumulative adoption curve of the combined model coincides with
the cumulative adoption curve from the threshold-heterogeneity approach at the time where
Y(t) = 1. By then, all individuals have been inﬂuenced to want to adopt the innovation, which
means that the assumption of the heterogeneity approach is fulﬁlled, and the combined model
is identical to the threshold-heterogeneity approach (compare equation 12.7 with Y(t) = 1).
In contrast, ﬁgure 12.9 shows the cumulative adoption curves if the price decreases
exponentially from 45 to 10 and then stays constant. All other parameters are the same as
in the previous example. Again, in a short time period at the beginning, the shape of the
cumulative adoption curve of the combined model is dominated by the social-learning
dynamic, but it coincides with the cumulative adoption curve from the heterogeneity
approach at the time where Y(t) = 1. Because of economic constraints (the price will never
fall below 10), the proportion of the population that will adopt the innovation is the same
as in ﬁgure 12.8. However, given that the price has to decrease to reach the value of 10,
the adoption process takes slightly longer.
The last example (see ﬁgure 12.10) assumes that the price decreases exponentially
with no restriction; all other parameters are the same as in the preceding examples.

and b = 0.15.

Figure 12.10a is obtained with price decline of the form r(t) = 45e−0.05t. Notice that the
income inequality has little inﬂuence on the spread of the innovation. The shape of the
cumulative adoption curve of the combined model is dominated by the social-learning
components. This is not surprising, given that the chosen initial price and the price decline
will not produce a sufﬁciently long delay between the time where the richest individuals
and the poorest individuals can afford the innovation. However, with more-costly goods,
we consider a price decline of the form r(t) = 100e−0.03t (see ﬁgure 12.10b). Now, the initial
price is nearly doubled, and the decline is slower. In this case “willingness” to adopt an
innovation spreads faster than the individuals can actually afford it, and the shape of the
cumulative adoption curve of the combined model is dominated by the threshold-heterogeneity components of the model, that is, the affordability constraints.
These examples demonstrate that economic factors have to be included where they would
counteract or delay the spread predicted when only learning mechanisms are considered. To
increase the realism of the model, we can relax the implicit assumption of the thresholdheterogeneity approach (see note 2), namely, that all individuals will have the same propensity for spending their income on an innovation. This means that we now incorporate the
fact that the ratio between discretionary income and income is higher for wealthier individuals and tends to zero out for individuals with a small income. Figure 12.11 illustrates
the approach. The dashed line shows the previous assumption of a constant propensity for

spending, regardless of income. Now we assume a quadratic dependence between income
and the propensity for spending (solid line). This leads to a higher number of adopters at the
beginning but also decreases the proportion of the population that will adopt at late time
points, compared with the situation of a constant propensity.
Figure 12.12 makes that effect obvious. The chained line represents the cumulative
adoption curve for a heterogeneity approach with a constant propensity for spending, and
the solid line shows the cumulative adoption curve produced by the income-dependent
propensity given in ﬁgure 12.11. At the time period from t = 0 to roughly t = 50, the
adoption curve of the “variable”-heterogeneity approach (solid line) is above the curve of
the “constant”-heterogeneity approach (chained line) because the wealthier individuals
tend to spend a higher proportion of their incomes on an innovation. As time goes by, the
price of the innovation decreases so that more individuals can afford it. The “variable”heterogeneity approach, however, assumes that the poorer the individuals, the smaller the
proportion of their incomes they spend on the innovation. Therefore, the solid line is below
the chained line for later times. This causes a long tail at the end.
The Case of Black-and-White Television Adoption in the United States
In the case of the adoption of black-and-white television sets in the United States, Wang
(2003) argues that the observed delay reﬂects income inequality. When the new product

was introduced in 1946, high-income consumers tended to adopt it ﬁrst. The price then
fell with cumulative output, and demand grew as the product penetrated into lower income
groups. Based on the considerations of Bayus (1993) for the time period from 1946 to
1960, we assume an exponential price decline for black-and-white sets of the form

ρ (t ) = 1283e −0.087t.
This implies that the initial price of a set at market launch was $1,283 and that afterwards
a relatively steep price decline was observable. We adjust this to take into account the
simultaneous growth in nominal per capita gross domestic product in the United States,
which we take as a proxy for average nominal per capita income. Based on data for the
period 1946–1971 in Johnston and Williamson (2007), we estimate the exponential rate
of economic growth as e0.045, which means that the price decline for black-and-white sets
(as a fraction of average income) can be approximated as

ρ (t ) = 1283e −0.1322 t.
The family-income distribution is approximated by a gamma distribution, and we use
the parameter a = 2.49 and l = 3.9 ⋅ 10−4, estimated in McDonald and Ramson (1979) for
the year 1960. The corresponding Gini coefﬁcient is 0.34, which shows that family income
in 1960 was relatively unequally distributed. Evidence suggests that the Gini coefﬁcient
was fairly stable and constant during the period of diffusion of this innovation.

Cumulative black-and-white-television-set adoption curves for the Bass, threshold, and combined models. The
Bass curves were ﬁtted to actual sales data, whereas the threshold curves are based on income distribution and
on the exogenous growth-adjusted price trend. Threshold was set as a constant fraction of income.

Bass (1969) estimated his model from sales data and obtained the coefﬁcient of innovation, p, as 0.0279 and the coefﬁcient of imitation, q, as 0.25. Bayus (1993) ﬁtted the Bass
model to the actual sales data and estimated the coefﬁcient of innovation at 0.0159 and
the coefﬁcient of imitation at 0.39. We can use these data to model the diffusion rate for
black-and-white sets using the threshold-heterogeneity model and employing the two
Bass-curve ﬁts as our targets for comparison. We note in passing that in contrast to the
threshold-based curves, these best ﬁt Bass curves are not constrained by any independent
empirical data on the strength of imitative bias among adopters.
In ﬁgure 12.13, the dashed line represents the curves obtained by the thresholdheterogeneity approach, with c = 1/11 as the constant propensity of spending on television
sets. This means that the individuals or families would spend up to about 10 percent of
their annual income on their ﬁrst set. Comparison with the two ﬁtted Bass curves shows
that the general behavior is similar, although it does not ﬁt exactly. In contrast, the black
solid line represents the cumulative adoption curve obtained by the combined model with
the income distribution of the year 1960 for the threshold-heterogeneity approach and Bass
parameters p = 0.06, q = 0.3. This means that compared with the pure Bass model as
estimated by Bass (1969) or by Bayus (1993), the probability is slightly increased that an
individual will decide to adopt the innovation independently of social inﬂuence.

Figure 12.14 differs in that we assume a variable proportion of income as discretionary
in the combined model, which now has Bass parameters p = 0.035, q = 0.35. It is evident
that the threshold distribution predicts the correct timescale for the diffusion process and
that the social-contagion component of the combined model improves the ﬁt to the Bass
curves by delaying takeoff in the higher income groups.
Summarizing, our empirical threshold distribution gives a good ﬁt to the Bass sales
curves for this case study, and the combined model improves that ﬁt by introducing a
social-learning element to explain the observed delay in takeoff. Overall, we infer that
inequality in a population’s income distribution is indeed likely to be an important factor
in explaining the time course of new product diffusion.
The Diffusion of Hybrid Corn in the United States
Agricultural innovations might not be thought of as being subject to the same affordability
constraints and price dynamics as consumer durable goods. Henrich (2001), however, has
applied the social-learning model in such cases, suggesting that the observed long forward
tail to the adoption curve for hybrid corn among Iowa farmers in the late 1920s and
1930s was a result of conformist bias. If we combine the social-learning dynamic with a

heterogeneous, variable-c adoption-threshold distribution, we obtain a cumulative adoption curve (combined model in ﬁgure 12.12) showing an S-shaped pattern with longer tails
at the beginning (caused by the social-learning dynamic) and end (caused by the variable-c
adoption-threshold dynamic). This characteristic of the adoption curve is also known from
data on the spread of hybrid corn in the United States (see ﬁgure 12.15, especially the
curves for Wisconsin and Kentucky).
Regarding these large-scale lag patterns, Griliches (1957, 1960) preferred an explanation in terms of unequal supplier effort, with commercial seed-corn suppliers initially
targeting regions with large farm units and high corn acreage (and contiguous areas with
similar climate, soil, and pest characteristics). However, there also may have been a contribution that resulted from heterogeneity in decision thresholds among farmers. For a
business such as a farm, immediate-acquisition cost has to be measured not against disposable income but against future proﬁt from the gain in yield. In the 1930s, commercially
acquired hybrid seed corn cost almost ten times as much to adopters as homegrown seed
corn (Griliches 1958), and the extra yield also imposed potential additional input costs
(fertilizer, water, and extra labor for harvesting). The extra cost of hybrid seed represented
a ﬁxed cost per unit area, whereas yield varied (Dowell and Jesness 1939). It is plausible
that late adopters included farms with lower typical corn yields, for which the high relative
cost of the new strain was a signiﬁcant factor delaying the adoption decision.
The same point is made by David (2005), by analogy with his analysis of thresholdheterogeneity effects on adoption timing for the mechanized reaper in the antebellum
American Midwest (David 1966). The most recent and thorough examination of the
hybrid-corn diffusion data is Young’s (2005) acceleration analysis, which indicates a relatively poor ﬁt of the data with the logistic adoption curve predicted by the Bass model.
To our knowledge, an empirically derived threshold model has yet to be ﬁtted to the
detailed corn-diffusion data, although clearly this would be desirable.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we make some brief remarks on the implications of the above for evolutionary anthropology. If we discount any propensity for consumers to reject advantageous new
products after adoption because they have misunderstood their use, then other than its
optional conformist-bias element, the DI model (Henrich 2001) is identical to the Bass
model (Bass 1969), which has been used extensively to analyze sales growth and life
cycles of many well-documented new products. The Bass model is the subject of a massive
amount of literature going back nearly 40 years, which includes many discussions of
alternative drivers of the typical S-shaped sales pattern (including affordability). Anthropologists seeking such an empirical testing ground for the predictions of DI theory may
ﬁnd that much of the work has already been done by their colleagues in economic forecasting and marketing science (Chandrasekaran and Tellis 2007).
However, both the Bass and the DI models assume that agents are homogeneous with
respect to the economic capacity to adopt. This is an oversimplifying assumption that does
not recognize the evolutionary dynamics of complex societies with large economic surpluses in which wealth inequalities are characteristic and that can be modeled by quite
simple mechanisms (e.g., the Law of Proportionate Effect [Gibrat 1931]). An evolutionary
approach to innovation adoption in developed market economies, therefore, has to consider
the evolutionary dynamics of economic inequality as well as those of social-learning
processes.
Notes
1. The Gini coefﬁcient is a statistical measure of the inequality of an income distribution introduced by Gini
(1955). It is deﬁned as a ratio with values between 0 and 1. The closer the coefﬁcient is to 1, the more unequal
is the distribution. In the considered case of a gamma-distributed income, the Gini coefﬁcient is deﬁned by
2B0.5(a, a + 1) − 1, where B0.5 stands for the incomplete beta function (Salem and Mount 1974).
2. Given that determining an individual’s price threshold is more difﬁcult compared with determining an individual’s income, it is common practice to model the price threshold, q, by
θ = cI with 0 ≤ c ≤ 1,
where I is the individual’s income and c describes the propensity for spending money on the innovation (Wang
2003). For a constant, c, the price threshold resembles the observed income distribution, which means that it is
gamma distributed and possesses the same degree of inequality (as expressed by the Gini coefﬁcient). A constant
propensity of spending for all levels of income is a very simplistic assumption and one that we relax in a later
discussion.

Technological Innovations and Developmental Trajectories: Social
Factors as Evolutionary Forces
Valentine Roux

Historical (e.g., Duby 1962), anthropological (e.g., Creswell 1996), sociological (e.g.,
Mendras 1984; Ogburn 1957 [quoted in Akrich 1994]), and materials (e.g., Gille 1978)
research has shown how technological change can unbalance a cultural system, causing
its total reorganization and transforming it into a new system following its own dynamics.
However, even if these studies sometimes explicitly show the relations between technical
transformations and transformations of socioeconomic, legal, political, ideological, and
demographic systems, the mechanisms by which technological changes are introduced are
still poorly understood and continue to be the subject of debate (e.g., Akrich 1994). Here
I discuss ways in which technological innovations are introduced and spread, that is, the
mechanisms underlying the emergence and ﬁxation of new technological traits, in order
to better understand the impact of innovations on cultural systems.
The ﬁeld of technology distinguishes among technological change, which is considered
an emergent historical phenomenon and thus an unrepeatable scenario; the conditions for
portraying these scenarios, which correspond to the production context of technological
tasks; and the conditions for ﬁxing the new features, which correspond to the transmission
context (Roux 2003). These conditions are assumed to act as evolutionary forces, and
studying them should give us insights into the evolutionary mechanisms of ancient
cultures.
Study of the emergence and ﬁxation of new technological features implies two levels
of analysis: individual and collective. Invention occurs on the scale of the individual as
opposed to innovation, which is the adoption of an invention on a collective scale (a current
distinction generally adopted by technologists; see, e.g., Gille [1978] and van der Leeuw
and Torrence [1989]). In other words, invention can be considered a cognitive activity on
an individual scale, whereas innovation corresponds to a historical event. Below, I ﬁrst
deal with technological inventions and their order and mode of development as well as
the possible role of the individual in the differential occurrences of inventions. Next, I
examine the mechanisms underlying innovation and ﬁxation processes.

Technological Evolution
Technological evolution is assessed by examining the trends of individual technologies
and determining the modes that produce them. Is the passage from one technology to
another characterized by incremental additions, or does it proceed by jumps? Accordingly,
I distinguish between continuous and discontinuous inventions. The hypothesis is that if
both kinds of invention can participate in technological evolution, the mechanisms underlying their emergence and ﬁxation may vary.
Trend of Evolution: Cumulative Character and Order of Development
Studies in the history of technology show that techniques are cumulative in the sense that
any transformation of a technique always incorporates previous knowledge (e.g., Creswell
1996; Deforge 1989; Gille 1978). In this respect, invention is often considered as an
incremental modiﬁcation or a combination of preexisting elements (e.g., Lemonnier 1993;
Schiffer 2005; chapters 7 and 14, this volume).
Because techniques are cumulative, their evolution follows a certain order of development. The ﬁrst stone tools were not created by indirect percussion but by direct percussion,
the ﬁrst pottery was made not with the help of rotary kinetic energy (RKE) but with muscular energy, pyrotechnologies did not begin with high-temperature technologies but with
low temperatures, and so on. In other words, inventions always take place within the
logical suite of historically detectable antecedents (Gallay 1986). However, the fact that
techniques necessitate a certain order of development does not mean that this order is
the same everywhere (Creswell 1996). Some groups can ignore certain stages and jump
straight to more complex stages, given certain environmental or cultural factors.
This order of technological development, observed at a macroscale and independent of
the historical trajectories of the inventions, can be characterized in evolutionary terms.
The hypothesis is that the general trend is toward less expenditure of human energy
(Creswell 1996; Deforge 1989; Gille 1978; Simondon 1958). Such a trend would correspond to “laws of evolution” (Deforge 1989; Simondon 1958), according to which techniques evolve logically from a state (“abstract”) where the elementary operations underlying
the manufacture of an object are ﬁrst juxtaposed to a state (“concrete”) where these operations are related and cannot be separated from each other, given their interaction in a
synergistic fashion.
The analysis is based on well-documented lineages of objects that evolve from a stable
technical principle and are established after an analysis of the genesis of the objects. In
other words, they can be considered as a genealogy of physical principles (Creswell 1993,
1996). The corollary to the passage from the “abstract” to the “concrete” object is that,
all things being equal, objects will evolve toward less volume, less weight, a lesser number
of pieces, less response time, and a lesser price (Deforge 1989). This theory of the evolution of objects has been applied in archaeology by Boëda (2005) in order to better describe

<-----Page 231----->Technological Innovations and Developmental Trajectories

219

lineages of ancient lithic industries, to understand their evolution in structural terms, and
to explain convergences as well as, for example, the emergence of blade technology.
As far as pottery-manufacturing techniques are concerned, in the Southern Levant one
can trace an evolution of the coiling technique into the wheel-coiling technique (use of
RKE for thinning and shaping coiled roughouts) into the wheel-throwing technique (use
of RKE on a mass of clay). This latter technique, which appears as an entirely mechanized
manufacturing process, can be considered an ultimate stage in the development of ceramic
techniques using RKE in accordance with the “laws of evolution” proposed by Simondon
(1958). Indeed, the different operations are exerted in synergy through the use of RKE.
Such synergy is unique among pottery-production techniques, which are usually a series
of independent operations, such as the wheel-coiling technique. Hence, there is a considerable gain of time (Roux and Courty 1998).
The necessity of establishing lineages of objects based on technological process for
an appropriate understanding of their relationships—and therefore of the evolution of
objects—has been well argued by Creswell (1993, 1996), who, in analyzing the evolution
of mills, shows that the relationships based only on morphological features are inappropriate and misleading, whereas those based on technological process enable us to consider
all the different variants that have occurred over the centuries. Before Creswell, Haudricourt (1987) argued that the genealogy of tools should take into account their physical
properties. He suggested that the ancestor of the plow was not the spade or the stick but
the rake, given its handling system that characterizes the plow as an instrument dragged
and not hit. In support of this hypothesis, he pointed out that the ﬁrst plows in Egypt and
Mesopotamia were used at sowing time for work similar to that of the rake or the harrow
(see chapter 1, this volume).
As far as pottery is concerned, if only morphological types are considered, the relationships mix morphological vessels that are formed using different techniques. Such relationships do not permit an analysis of the evolution of objects, which necessarily implies an
analysis of the relationships between forms and techniques. On the other hand, if one takes
into account the technological process, then the relationship diagrams will highlight, for
example, relationships between objects with variations of forms but made according to
the same technique or the lack of relationship between objects with comparable shapes.
In archaeology, lineages of objects based on technological process are still to be created
and represent one of the most compelling agendas in the study of cultural technology
(O’Brien and Lyman 2003).
Mode of Evolution: Gradual versus Rapid
On the basis of numerous technological studies, Creswell (1994, 1996) suggested that
innovation appears in two ways: (1) as an autonomous and progressive development not
motivated by any speciﬁc social factors and responding mainly to technological rules and
(2) as a development by jumps between stages determined by social mutations. In the ﬁrst,

<-----Page 232----->220

Valentine Roux

innovations can be considered as progressive and continuous. They develop in response
to their own technological tendency up to a certain extent, which is ﬁxed by limits. In the
latter case, the passage from one stage to another appears to follow a logarithmic function
and not a linear one. Innovations can be considered discontinuous, going beyond the limits
imposed by the internal logic of the techniques. They are not simply the combination or
addition of preexisting elements but introduce new technological lineages (see chapter 1,
this volume). The technological jump produced by these techniques can be assessed quantitatively and qualitatively.
Creswell (1993, 1994, 1996), in a study of mills used in the Middle East to extract olive
oil, demonstrates that the evolution of techniques can proceed by jumps. He shows that
there are two main thresholds in the evolution of milling techniques. The ﬁrst consists
of using traditional mills, which extract around two-thirds of the oil that is theoretically
possible to obtain. These traditional mills, which present morphological variants, develop
pressures between 1 and 5 kilograms per cubic centimeter, with an output of between 20
and 25 kilograms. The second threshold corresponds to the complete extraction of the oil
using modern mills. These mills are hydraulic presses that develop, on average, 50 kilograms per cubic centimeter of pressure, with an output of around 30 kilograms. This output
represents the upper limit of the quantity of oil contained in the fruit (around 25 percent
of the weight).
As shown in ﬁgure 13.1, when one considers the pressures and the output of the traditional and modern mills, the group of traditional mills is far from showing a linear trend
between zero and the group of modern mills. The passage from the ﬁrst threshold to the
second follows a logarithmic function. Hence, the general law proposed by Creswell is
that technological evolution proceeds according to thresholds, not only by incremental

additions. By deﬁnition, each threshold corresponds to an invention, here called “discontinuous,” which is characterized by the introduction of new physical principles in the
technological process, that is, new principles of propulsion, and is limited in number, corresponding not to inﬁnite recombinations of preexisting elements but to new starting points
in the evolution of objects reaching the end of their evolution (Deforge 1989). Each
threshold or discontinuous invention gives rise to new lineages of objects characterized
by new physical principles. These new lineages coexist, at least for a while, with the
ancestral lineages.
It follows that the diagrams obtained when searching to represent, for example, the
evolution of ceramic-vessel lineages produced from the ﬁfth through ﬁrst millennia b.c.
in the Southern Levant, are cladogenetic (see chapter 1, this volume), as shown in
ﬁgure 13.2. There, each new fashioning technique gives rise to a new lineage alongside
the ancestral one. Each corresponds to new physical principles: The wheel-coiling technique is characterized by the use of RKE (the new trait) for transforming clay walls made
from assembled elements (the ancestral trait), and the wheel-throwing technique is characterized by the use of RKE (the ancestral trait) to transform a clay mass (the new trait)
into a vessel.
Passage to the wheel-coiling technique is a ﬁrst jump when assessed in terms of source
of energy. The clay walls are now deformed under the combined energy of ﬁnger-to-palm
pressures and RKE. RKE requires the wheel to revolve around an axis with a sufﬁcient
kinetic energy to resist the strength of the pressures. It has to reach a speed of around 80
revolutions per minute. The manufacturing time is divided by half. The jump is even larger
for the passage to the wheel-throwing technique. The quantity of required kinetic energy

for transforming a mass of clay into a vessel is much higher in order to resist the strength
of the pressures on the clay mass. The wheel has to reach a speed of 150 revolutions per
minute. The manufacturing time is divided by 20.
When considering the lineage of wheel-coiled vessels in the Southern Levant, technostylistic variants are observed. Different fashioning methods were invented, and new
morphological types were wheel coiled in the course of centuries. The different fashioning
methods correspond to modiﬁcations of the stage at which RKE was used (preforms or
roughouts [Roux and Courty 1998]). In other words, they correspond to gradual variations
following the same physical principle—the use of RKE on assembled elements
(ﬁgure 13.3). Methods can be plotted linearly when one is considering strength of pressures
and manufacturing time. Thus, there is no jump between these methods. They represent
continuous inventions on the basis of the threshold introduced by the wheel-coiling technique. The spatial extension of continuous variants most often indicates frontiers between
social groups—the groups where they developed (e.g., Gallay 2007; Lemonnier 1993;
Stark 1998; Stark et al. 2008).
To sum up, empirical data suggest that technological evolution is made up of both
continuous and discontinuous innovations—inventions by small-scale cumulative modiﬁcations not excluding radical jumps from time to time. The tempo of discontinuous innovations can be quite rapid. In the case of the wheel-coiling technique in the Southern
Levant, this new technical feature is clearly identiﬁed in strata of numerous sites dating
from the second half of the ﬁfth millennium b.c., whereas the use of RKE for smoothing
the surface of clay walls appears for the ﬁrst time on a few vessels belonging to sites
dating from the ﬁrst half of the ﬁfth millennium b.c. (Roux et al. n.d.).

Cognitive Activity and Inventions
I now consider the cognitive activity involved in discontinuous inventions in order to
examine the possible role of the individual in technological evolution. The hypothesis is
that the individual and his or her cognitive activity could act as a random factor in an
evolution that otherwise follows, at a macroscale, a necessary order of development.
Following the ecological approach, coupled with referencing studies on the learning
process of complex skills (e.g., Bril 2002; Gibson 1977; Reed 1988), invention can be
considered as the result of an exploratory activity in the body–matter–energy system and
the discovery, in the course of action, of the possibilities offered by the environment. Thus,
invention of the wheel-coiling technique has been interpreted as the result of a dynamic
interaction among the task (discovery of the use of RKE for making bowls), the body
(discovery of the skills for forming a bowl with RKE), and the instrument (discovery of
the properties of the wheel for producing RKE; Roux 2003).
As for the skills involved in discontinuous craft inventions, such as the ones involved
in wheel fashioning, they can be viewed as phenomena that break with tradition. Indeed,
recall that the difﬁculty in learning skills involved in any craft lies mainly in mastering
the technique itself (physical modalities according to which raw material is processed),
which implies controlling elementary movements, which vary depending on the ﬁnished
products (Roux and David 2005). Learning and developing new elementary movements
will imply a different tuning of the previously learned elementary movements. This will
require rehearsal thousands of times (Bril et al. 2005).
From this point of view, the emergence of new techniques, characterizing discontinuous
inventions, signals the presence of individuals who modiﬁed their elementary movements and
developed new skills apart from those they learned previously. Thus, the wheel-coiling technique signals new skills different from the ones involved in the coiling technique; the wheelthrowing technique signals skills different from the ones involved in the wheel-coiling technique
(Gelbert 1997; Roux and Corbetta 1990). Years of apprenticeship separate these techniques.
Stoneknapping is another discontinuous innovation that signals the development of new
skills radically different from the ones involved in cracking open nuts—the possible
ancestral lineage from which stoneknapping evolved—even though both tasks correspond
to thrown percussion. They require, in particular, a level of movement tuning for controlling the conchoidal fracture (Pelegrin 2005; Roche 2005). These movements combine
precision and force and are exerted according to a ﬁne bimanual coordination. No ape or
monkey seems to achieve such a combination (see chapter 3, this volume). They reveal
capacities that are uniquely hominin (Roux and Bril 2005).
Who, then, were the inventors who were able to break with tradition and develop new
skills? The learning process itself is carried out according to a model (the way of doing by
a group for the purpose of obtaining a given ﬁnished product), which is the transmitter’s

<-----Page 236----->224

Valentine Roux

way of doing something (Bril and Roux 2002). In this respect, there never is invention while
one learns motor skills. At the end of the apprenticeship, skills necessary for reproducing
the tradition, and only these skills, are literally “embedded.” The skills then participate
directly in the maintenance of the tradition, in the sense that it becomes difﬁcult for subjects
to conceive of making things in other ways, given the cognitive and motor skills they have
developed, which act as “ﬁxers” of worldviews (Roux 2007).
However, recall that subjects can develop different levels of expertise (Bril et al. 2005).
The expert is one who, when confronted with the constraints of the task, is able to achieve
the technological process through a constant dynamic ﬁt between the state of the object
and the next step. In other words, the expert has an extensive capacity to detect
the appropriate information resulting from the ongoing course of action coupled with the
ability to incorporate the new information into his or her actions.
Moreover, expertise does not consist only of tuning as well as possible the properties
of the system (the task–environment–organism system). The expert also is one who is able
to force the system in one direction or another to adjust to new features (Bril et al. 2005).
These new features can be “emergent performance problems” (see chapters 1 and 14, this
volume), new situations (e.g., new raw material), or “disturbances” in the system (e.g.,
ﬂaws in the material).
We would expect to ﬁnd the invention process among experts who are most familiar
with the task’s constraints (Ericsson and Lehman 1996), that is, experts who are able to
explore body–material–energy properties, in this case going beyond the cultural representations that have formed their way of seeing and doing. These individuals are exceptional
as much for their skills as for their rarity, as anthropological studies have shown.
In India, inventions in pyrotechnology I saw were made by the most skillful craftsmen,
attested as such by their products and reputation. This could explain why, all other things
being equal, some techniques appeared in certain areas of the world and not in others.
Such is the case of the wheel-fashioning technique, which was never invented either in
America or in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the knowledge of the rotary movement for
ﬁnishing operations. I suggest that in these areas no individual developed the cognitive
activity that led to the discovery and the mastery of RKE for transforming clay volumes—
hence the hypothesis that individuals and their cognitive activities might be a random
factor in the evolution of techniques. This random factor also could well explain phenomena of technological convergences.
The Dynamic of Discontinuous Technological Innovations
The question raised now is how technological innovation occurs—how an invention made
at an individual scale becomes an innovation at a collective scale. It is the temporal course
of these two interacting variables—the individual and the collective—that gives the

<-----Page 237----->Technological Innovations and Developmental Trajectories

225

technological system its faculty to adapt and bring about technological change (Roux
2003). More precisely, the phenomenon of innovation is the result of a dynamic process
emerging from complex interactions among its constitutive components: (1) the technical
task, here deﬁned in terms of chaînes opératoires (e.g., Lemonnier 1993; Sellet 1993);
(2) the environment, which provides the materials used in the technical task; and (3) the
subject, who carries out the technical task and whose intention(s) are rooted in the group’s
sociocultural representations.
Properties of these various components possess constraints (whether physical–chemical,
biomechanical, environmental, or cultural). Innovations play on these constraints and are
initiated according to terms dependent on political, economic, social, and/or religious
situations in which the demand for new objects plays a part. From this point of view,
innovations invariably refer to particular historical scenarios. These scenarios, even though
particular, should enable us to examine Creswell’s general hypothesis that jumps in technological evolution are determined by social mutations. And they should also allow us to
assess relationships between historical scenarios and their conditions of actualization,
deﬁned here as the context of craft production.
Discontinuous Innovations and Social Factors
As an example of a historical scenario, consider the emergence of the wheel-coiling technique. In the Southern Levant, wheel coiling appeared during the second half of the ﬁfth
millennium b.c., during the period called “late Chalcolithic,” among farmer–pastoralist
cultures whose material culture is especially remarkable for its innovations (in particular,
new ceramic and metallurgic techniques). Throughout this period of about 300 years,
wheel coiling was used for only a single morpho-functional category—small, open vessels
with rectilinear walls, called “V-shaped bowls.” These bowls are found as much on settlement sites as in sanctuaries or in mortuary contexts, where they are found systematically
in primary and secondary tombs. A detailed study of the wheel-coiled bowls found on the
site of Abu Hamid (Dollfus and Kafaﬁ 1988), in the middle Jordan Valley, suggests that
these bowls had a ceremonial function (Roux 2003).
The innovation of wheel coiling has been interpreted as having emerged from a complex
interaction among an invention made on an individual scale, a favorable geological environment, and a demand at a collective level for objects of ceremonial value—a demand
initiated by politico-religious changes and marked in particular by the emergence of chiefdoms (Levy and Holl 1988). Such a demand has been interpreted as emanating from an
elite, given the function of the objects and the politico-religious context. In other words,
in the Southern Levant the innovation of wheel coiling appears rooted in a demand initiated by an elite at a period when new sociopolitical structures were emerging.
This scenario has numerous analogues in various chrono-cultural periods in the sense
that the main technical inventions known from the preindustrial era apply to objects that
are related most often to an elite context. For example, the emergence of iron- and

<-----Page 238----->226

Valentine Roux

steel-related activities in the north of the Parisian Basin during the second Iron Age (ﬁfth
century b.c.), as with the wheel-coiling technique, appears as rooted in a demand initiated
by an elite, as shown by Bauvais (2008), who argues that the ﬁrst iron objects were mainly
prestige goods placed in tombs (ornaments, armaments, cart wheels) at sites containing
elite residences and made sporadically by itinerant blacksmiths responding to the demands
of the elite.
Another example can be seen in the domain of agriculture, with the “traction complex”—
yoke, plow, travois, and cart—which appeared in western European Neolithic cultures
during the third millennium b.c. This innovation had a decisive economic impact, as it
allowed a growing population to be better managed through increased productivity. At
ﬁrst, this innovation may have been the monopoly of only a part of the population, which
seems to have used it to further strategies for control of political power. This hypothesis
is based on the incorporation of the traction complex in symbolic rock art, which shows
that the plow and wheel were ﬁrst ideological and social phenomena related to the elites
before being incorporated as common tools into a society’s economic structure (Gallay
2006).
A similar phenomenon has been observed among peasants of historical periods (from
the Middle Ages to modern times), known throughout history for their resistance to innovation. It appears that innovations were always made by elites, who then transmitted them
to the peasantry (Mendras 1984). The elite were open to experimentation, and only they
had enough economic margin to face the risk every trial entails (Mendras 1984).
These different historical scenarios suggest that (1) in traditional societies, discontinuous innovations are initiated by individuals having some form of power—religious, political, and/or ﬁnancial; and (2) these innovations are actualized not for their techno-economic
advantages but for symbolic and/or social reasons. This argues in favor of Creswell’s
(1996) hypothesis that continuous transformations in techniques can be more or less
autonomous as part of an evolution, whereas discontinuous changes follow changes in
society.
The concept of “change” is controversial, given that social groups are always changing.
In Creswell’s view, social mutations at the origin of innovations correspond to those
moments where there are close interactions between society and techniques. Close interactions can also be at the origin of absence of change and preservation of traditional features
(see chapter 10, this volume). In both cases, these interactions determine to a large extent
the mode of evolution of technological systems. Thus, the emergence of discontinuous
innovations supposes both elites originating new demands to meet social or symbolic
needs and social components able to actualize the new demand. Such a mechanism can
be explained by cognitive constraints weighing on traditional cultures, favoring cultural
preservation.
Periods of close interaction can alternate with periods of looser interaction. Creswell
(1994) talks about the cyclical nature of relations between technique and social processes.

<-----Page 239----->Technological Innovations and Developmental Trajectories

227

In archaeology, the rate and nature of innovations testify to such a cycle. Indeed, some
historical periods are characterized by numerous technological discontinuous innovations,
such as the late Chalcolithic societies in the Southern Levant, whereas others are characterized mainly by continuous innovations, such as the Early Bronze I (fourth millennium
b.c.) in the Southern Levant. Given the importance of the demands of the elite in the
innovation process, the alternation between these periods could well be explained in
sociopolitical terms.
The Spread of Discontinuous Innovations
It sometimes can take a few millennia for discontinuous innovations to become predominant. This is the case of the wheel-fashioning technique in the Southern Levant (Roux
2008). As we shall see, the rhythm of ﬁxation of discontinuous techniques can be explained
by the transmission context, the properties of which are determined by the environment
of production, that is, the conditions for actualizing inventions.
In the Southern Levant, the wheel-fashioning technique was invented during the
Chalcolithic period for the manufacture of ceremonial bowls. The Chalcolithic cultures
collapsed in Early Bronze I (fourth millennium b.c.), and 75 percent of the settlements
disappeared. The ceramic-material culture became characterized by strong regionalism
and the appearance of new techno-stylistic traits (Miroschedji 1989). As for wheel coiling,
it practically disappeared from the Southern Levant. In Early Bronze IB, the rotary instrument was present, but contrary to the previous periods, RKE was used only for ﬁnishing
operations, not for thinning or shaping clay walls (Charloux 2002, 2006). Wheel coiling
was again present in Early Bronze II and III.
The latter period, dating from the ﬁrst half of the third millennium b.c., is marked by
the presence of fortiﬁed cities with monumental construction. At Tel Yarmouth, a fortiﬁed
town about 30 kilometers southwest of Jerusalem and principal site of the southern region
of Southern Levant, two basalt tournettes have been found in the palace enclosure
(Miroschedji 2000a, 2000b). Contrary to expectations, only 3 percent of ceramic objects
were made with RKE, suggesting that few craftsmen used the tournettes. This low number
of craftsmen persisted steadily throughout the period of the Early Bronze III, covering
about 500 years. There was no borrowing of the wheel-fashioning technique, which would
have helped to raise the proportion of vessels formed on the wheel (Roux n.d.). In Early
Bronze IV (end of the third millennium b.c.)—a period of dramatic historical changes
marked by the collapse of cities—wheel coiling disappeared again. The technique reappeared during the second millennium b.c., becoming predominant in the middle of the
period (Middle Bronze Age II).
Thus, it took three millennia for the wheel-coiling technique to become widely adopted.
It disappeared twice, once after the Chalcolithic period and once after Early Bronze III.
This developmental trajectory and its nonlinearity can be explained by examining the
craft-transmission context, which can be inferred from the context of production. For the

<-----Page 240----->228

Chalcolithic period, a techno-petrographic study carried out on the scale of the Southern
Levant showed that the craftsmen who formed bowls on the wheel were small in number,
itinerant, and attached to an elite (Roux and Courty 2005). Wheel coiling was handed
down within a restricted circle of craftsmen whose status was distinct from the other, more
numerous potters at various sites in the region and who were responsible for the utilitarian
pottery. In Early Bronze III, wheel coiling seems to again have been the prerogative of an
elite—exclusive to some specialized craftsmen who, given the presence of tournettes in
the palace, must have been attached to it.
In summary, craftsmen who used wheel coiling in the ﬁfth and third millennia b.c. were
a few specialist craftsmen who were attached to an elite and who reserved the technique
for making objects for this elite. Most production did not beneﬁt from the innovation,
which resulted in a technological system characterized as fragile and closed and explains
why wheel coiling disappeared twice and was so slow to develop.
Fragile versus Robust Systems
The fragility of a technological system can be deﬁned according to the size of the network
by which it is transmitted. If the network is too limited, the system is fragile and cannot
resist strong historical events such as those that transform a society’s socioeconomic
structure. During the ﬁfth and third millennia b.c., potters using wheel coiling were few
in number. Consequently, the transmission network was limited in size, and when confronted with the various historic upheavals that ended the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze
Age cultures, the network was broken and the technique disappeared.
In contrast, robust systems are characterized by transmission networks large enough
for the technological feature to have sufﬁcient redundancy to resist historical events (see
chapters 7 and 8, this volume). Thus, when wheel coiling became prevalent and was
transmitted by a large network, it resisted various events that agitated the Southern Levant
throughout history. The importance of a transmission network’s size for ﬁxing technical
innovations has been underlined by various authors (e.g., Henrich 2001; chapter 7, this
volume), including primatologists who have shown that, among the different groups of
nonhuman primates, the ones who develop and ﬁx technical skills are those with the
highest level of social tolerance between individuals, which ensures transmission networks
solid enough to guarantee the skill’s survival (van Shaik and Pradhan 2003; chapter 3, this
volume).
Closed versus Open Systems
Closed systems make no exchanges with other systems. They are kept closed by a oneto-one relationship between producers and the technological task. This relationship acts
as a nonexchange mechanism between the closed system and other systems. The result is
an absence of technological-task transfers or borrowings between producers (the ones who

<-----Page 241----->Technological Innovations and Developmental Trajectories

229

make and the ones who might borrow) with noncompatible status and, consequently,
rhythms of development that are very slow.
This was the case with wheel coiling during the ﬁfth and third millennia. The technique
was in the hands of a small number of specialized craftsmen and was not subject to any
transfer (by the potters) or borrowing (by other craftsmen), remaining a fragile technological system for more than two millennia. This was also the case for metallurgy of the
lost-wax technique. Invented during the Chalcolithic period exclusively for the fabrication
of prestige metal objects—scepters, maces, and crowns (Shalev 1994)—the technique
disappeared with the collapse of the Chalcolithic cultures, only to resurface during the
second millennium b.c. A recent study by Y. Goren (unpublished) shows that the lost-wax
technique must have been in the hands of priests, who worked in secret places and who
reserved this technique for objects of a politico-religious nature. The lost-wax technique
was invented and made a system in the same way as wheel coiling—innovation tied to an
elite’s politico-religious needs, one-to-one relationship between status of craftsmen and
technical task, and a small transmission network. Its disappearance along with the end of
the Chalcolithic politico-religious structure thus was to be expected.
Given the mechanisms explaining their emergence, discontinuous innovations generally
are actualized into a closed fragile system—when emerging, they are in the hands of a
few individuals aimed at making a restricted range of objects. It follows that, even though
they present techno-economic advantages, discontinuous innovations can be subject to
nonlinear developmental trajectories and a long ﬁxation process.
Transformation of Fragile Systems into Robust Systems
There are two ways for systems to become robust: Either the closed system transforms
itself into an open system, or the closed system develops at the expense of the technical
tasks used by open systems on the same objects. As opposed to closed systems, open
systems exchange on both the object level and the task level and therefore are not restricted
in their development.
Transformation of Closed into Open Systems
Transformation of closed systems into open systems supposes that those involved in the
innovations make a point of integrating them into usage by the majority. Changes in
peasant societies are an excellent illustration of this mechanism (Mendras 1984). In these
societies agricultural innovations were promoted by the elite (who were landowners and
farmers), many of whom took interest in the progress of their estates and had far-reaching
contacts that enabled them to introduce novelties into their region. The process of integrating innovations into the existing system generally included a test phase, a phase of proof
of the experiment’s success repeated year after year, and ﬁnally a phase of integration into
common experience, which would then be transmitted from one generation to the next.

<-----Page 242----->230

Valentine Roux

This progressive integration by the elite into common practice could be the mechanism
by which, for instance, ceramic craft used at ﬁrst in closed systems (e.g., in the Greek
Neolithic [Vitelli 1989]) subsequently was used in open systems.
Expansion of Closed Systems
For closed systems to develop, innovative technical practices have to be applied to a
wide range of objects used by the majority. In the Southern Levant, ceramic production
made with RKE increased during the Middle Bronze Age II, along with expansion of the
Canaanite cities and, probably, development of a market economy. Workshops using the
wheel-coiling technique and making a large array of vessels progressively expanded, to
the detriment of domestic production, which was then restricted to the making of cooking
pots (Maeir and Yellin 2007).
More generally, from the recent periods forward, I suggest that all discontinuous innovations requiring lengthy apprenticeship tended to emerge, develop, and expand in closed
systems. In multiple techno-economic-task societies, innovations characterized by a long
learning period can expand within closed systems only as a result of the biobehavioral
inability of individuals in the same sex or age grade to master a large number of tasks
requiring several years to be learned. One of the immediate consequences of bringing
innovations to technical tasks characterized by long learning times would be an escalation
in the number of tasks carried out in closed systems and eventually, given their technoeconomic advantages, their development in place of the open-system tasks, which were
generally distributed among individuals belonging to different grades.
Conclusion
Technological evolution appears to be the result of both continuous and discontinuous
innovations. The latter allow social groups to jump from one stage to another and to go
beyond previous technological limits. They occur when there is a strong interdependency
between techniques and societies. In this regard, the rate of discontinuous innovations
cannot be reduced to the sole question of both a population’s size and its degree of cultural
interconnectedness. Organization of societies is another important social factor that appears
determinant, notwithstanding the role of the individual, which can act as a random factor.
In ancient times, it appears that technical innovations met needs that at ﬁrst were not
economic but rather social or symbolic as suggested by authors such as Cauvin (1994).
They emerged in fragile, closed technological systems and developed slowly, according
to nonlinear trajectories. They were ﬁxed through their development into a robust system,
whether closed or open. I suggest that in farmer–pastoralist cultures, when length of learning times imposed restrictions, new technical tasks developed in closed systems instead
of open systems, thereby directly contributing to societies’ growing complexity.

Can Archaeologists Study Processes of Invention?
Michael Brian Schiffer

The archaeological record has long served as the sole source of evidence on the invention
of many technologies. Thus, when studying a technology that originated in a prehistoric
context, such as pottery making or copper metallurgy, researchers have taken note of its
earliest appearance and charted its subsequent occurrences over time and space. The
cumulative ﬁndings of two centuries of research have made it possible to answer the when
and where questions about the invention of a great many prehistoric technologies. This is
a signiﬁcant accomplishment that has immeasurably enriched our understanding of the
human past.
Having worked out the broad time–space parameters of numerous technologies, archaeologists are now apparently poised to elucidate the actual processes of invention—that is,
answering the how and why questions about the behavioral origins of material variation.
However, I argue here the counterintuitive position that the archaeological record seldom
furnishes ﬁne-grained, robust evidence on speciﬁc invention processes. Even so, because
archaeologists are not tethered to the archaeological record, we can turn to other research
strategies and other lines of evidence to help create invention models. This chapter develops that argument by (1) situating invention within the overarching context of technological change; (2) assessing the archaeological visibility of the major technological
processes—invention, development, replication, and adoption; and (3) furnishing examples of invention models that have arisen in an expanded ethnoarchaeology, a research
strategy that uses historical evidence.
On Technological Change
Technological change is deﬁned here as changes in the kinds and quantities of artifacts
made and used by people in a particular society or in a designated area (such as a region).
This behavioral deﬁnition seemingly translates directly into archaeological-context terms:
temporal change in artifact types and frequencies. However, it’s not that simple. Archaeological observations document the end product of the operation of varied cultural and

<-----Page 248----->236

Michael Brian Schiffer

environmental formation processes, including reuse, reclamation, and deterioration
(Schiffer 1987). As a result, evidence of technological change potentially can be conﬂated
with traces of other processes.
In order to ameliorate these effects and to orient studies of invention processes, I recommend that we make three methodological moves. First, search for those archaeological
deposits that might retain high-resolution evidence of inventive activities as in the primary
refuse of highly mobile peoples (D. J. Seymour, pers. comm., 2007). Second, develop
models by employing research strategies such as ethnoarchaeology, computer simulation,
experimental archaeology, modern material-culture studies, and historical research. In
these research contexts, the confounding effects of many formation processes are lessened.
Third, formulate research questions in behavioral—not archaeological-context—terms.
Thus, technological change is framed as behavioral change—alteration in activities. The
focus becomes the activities that took place during the life history of a kind of artifact
or a kind of technology, old or new (hereafter, I use “artifact” and “technology”
interchangeably).
Life histories are segmented (for present purposes) into four major processes: invention,
development, replication, and adoption. Each process—actually, a family of more speciﬁc
processes—consists of activities, which, in turn, are composed of varied interactions
among people, artifacts, and externs (the latter are unmodiﬁed phenomena of the natural
environment). There are various kinds of interactions, including mechanical, thermal,
chemical, and electromagnetic, and many interactions also involve human senses such as
sight, sound, taste, and touch (Schiffer and Miller 1999). Interactions are enabled by performance characteristics, which are an artifact’s activity- and interaction-speciﬁc behavioral capabilities. Thus, a cooking pot must possess sufﬁcient thermal-shock resistance to
survive repeated heating and cooling during activities of food preparation, and a ﬂag must
possess a particular color pattern to be visually identiﬁable in display activities as the
symbol of a particular nation. In short, performance characteristics determine a technology’s ability to carry out its utilitarian and symbolic functions in a given activity (LaMotta
and Schiffer 2001; Schiffer 2000, 2005a, 2005b; Schiffer and Miller 1999; Skibo and
Schiffer 2008; Walker et al. 1995).
The dominant global pattern of technological change over time, as inferred from the
archaeological record, is that of increasing formal variation—more kinds of things. We
tend to attribute this pattern to invention processes. Although invention is the source of
new variants, the other major processes generally have the effect of reducing variation.
That is, only some inventions are developed; only some developed inventions are replicated; and only some replicated inventions are adopted. Thus, the increase in artifact
variation over time is, ﬁnally, the result of several technological processes taking place in
the past, of which invention is but one.
In the life history of any technology, these processes can occur coevally and iteratively.
Indeed, the models presented below make clear that inventive activities often arise during

<-----Page 249----->Can Archaeologists Study Processes of Invention?

237

development, replication, and even adoption. However, whenever and wherever invention
occurs, the products are subject to selection. Notwithstanding this behavioral complexity,
I retain the simple linear model to make the presentation manageable.
Invention
Invention is the creation of an idea or vision for a technology having performance characteristics that differ from those of other technologies present in that society or area. The
idea may be little more than the minor modiﬁcation of an existing artifact, or it may be a
vision breathtaking in its audacity, and it may be entirely original or be inspired by an
import or by a technology seen somewhere else. Inventions are often materialized as
prototypes, as models, or as descriptions and drawings. Invention produces the variants
selected by development processes. (New variants that arise by accident and through errors
in replication are also subject to selection, but handling these sources of invention is
beyond the scope of this chapter.)
Development
Development involves problem solving, usually through trial-and-error experiments.
People strive to reﬁne the design of a selected technology so that it can meet the speciﬁc
performance requirements—utilitarian, symbolic, or both—of an anticipated activity or
activities (Schiffer and Skibo 1997; Skibo and Schiffer 2001, 2008; chapter 12, this
volume). This entails spanning a “developmental distance” between a prototype (or model)
and a technology that can competently perform a speciﬁc function or functions (Schiffer
2005b, 2008b). Traversing a developmental distance requires resources such as time,
money, organization, labor, skill, tacit knowledge, raw materials, tools, facilities, and
structures. In complex societies, a technology’s proponents (e.g., inventors, entrepreneurs,
engineers) may draw on family wealth and income, loans and gifts, government grants
and contracts, and stock sales for securing resources such as labor and materials (see
chapters 7 and 12, this volume). However, creating tacit knowledge and skill requires
experience and, thus, time, and forming an organization requires a suitable societal framework, including permissive laws. These necessities cannot always be bought.
In small-scale societies, opportunities to obtain resources for covering a great developmental distance are far more limited and may require the participation, over long periods,
of many local groups in a region. I have proposed elsewhere that this process, which might
be termed “distributed development,” appears to have enabled the transition from pit-house
to pueblo dwellings in the prehistoric American Southwest (Schiffer 2005b; see also
Schiffer 1992). During the century or so that this development process transpired, people
in local groups—each perhaps consisting of a half dozen households—invented and tried
out different kinds of dwelling and storage facilities, gradually acquiring knowledge about
the performance characteristics of each variant throughout the activities of its life history.
These performance characteristics—some learned rapidly, like ease of manufacture, and

<-----Page 250----->238

Michael Brian Schiffer

others learned after many years, like ease of maintenance—became common knowledge
throughout the region.
Such information transmission was facilitated by, for example, exchange networks,
exogamy, and religious sodalities. Eventually, the pueblo—masonry and adobe—was
judged to have the most favorable mix of performance characteristics in the context of
increasing dependence on agriculture, growing populations, and reduced residential mobility, and so it was selected by most groups when they built new structures. It is doubtful
that any one local group could have mustered in a very brief time period the resources
required for trying out a variety of new structures and ascertaining their performance
characteristics in all relevant life-history activities.
In societies large and small, a short developmental distance can often be traversed by
tinkering with an established recipe (Schiffer and Skibo 1987; chapter 11, this volume).
Thus, an experienced potter can turn his or her skills toward making a larger vessel of an
extant form–function type with minimal resource needs beyond time to practice. In contrast, building a canal-irrigation system in a society solely dependent on dry farming
requires new tools and materials, much time and labor, and, signiﬁcantly, new organizations for coordinating labor, maintaining the system, setting water policy, and resolving
disputes. The functioning of the irrigation system may also necessitate new rituals, perhaps
involving new artifacts, and activity-maintaining ideologies (see chapter 15, this volume).
In the course of spanning a great developmental distance, trial and error leads to the accrual
of new techno-science, socioscience, and ideo-science (Schiffer 1992), as people learn
through experience what works and what doesn’t in speciﬁc activity contexts. Development produces the variants selected by replication processes.
Replication
A technology ostensibly meeting its performance requirements may then be readied for
replication. Replication of some technologies in large-scale societies often requires the
creation of new manufacturing processes, new tools, new skills, and new organizations.
In other cases, as in small-scale societies, replication may be easily handled by the people
and organizations that already possess the appropriate skills, tools, and materials. Success
at replication results in the reproduction, distribution, and marketing or exchange of the
new technology, thereby producing the variants that are selected by adoption processes.
Adoption
In the adoption process, consumers have the opportunity to acquire and (usually) use the
new technology. Consumers may be individuals or groups, including households and communities, churches and companies, and polities at every level. In considering whether to
acquire a new technology, consumers—the ﬁnal arbiters of a technology’s replicative
success (Leonard and Jones 1987)—compare its anticipated performance characteristics
to those of any competing technologies and, most important, to the performance require-

ments of speciﬁc activities, ongoing or anticipated (see chapters 7 and 12, this volume).
Technologies, it should be noted, are commonly adopted differentially by a society’s
individuals and groups, which may have varying performance requirements (Schiffer
2000, 2005a). Adoption decisions can be studied by means of a performance matrix, which
displays, side by side, the performance characteristics of competing technologies in relation to activities (Schiffer 2000, 2005a).
Segmenting Life Histories
In some projects, I collapse development and replication into commercialization (Schiffer
1996, 2000, 2001, 2008b), whereas in other projects I subdivide commercialization into
a half dozen or so very speciﬁc processes (Schiffer 2005b, 2008b). In view of this ﬂexibility in segmenting life histories, the question is, how many processes should one identify
before proceeding with a project? Obviously, this depends on the researcher’s interests
and priorities, and the answer may not be evident at the outset. However, a good rule of
thumb is that the number of processes should mirror the number of consequential social
groups participating in that technology’s life history. Thus, we identify the general groups
of decision makers who, acting as agents of selection, determine whether a technology’s
life history will continue (Schiffer 2008b).
Even in small-scale societies in which craft skills are widely shared in gender- and
age-deﬁned groups, different process-related groups decide whether to replicate and adopt
an invention. For example, let’s assume that a potter comes up with an entirely novel
method of decorating serving vessels. Producer groups—the other potters in that society—
can choose whether to replicate the new decoration on their own pots. Moreover, user
groups, which include members of households and corporate groups, may decide to adopt
the new pots, depending on whether the decoration’s visual performance is expected to
enable the vessels to carry out their symbolic functions during everyday meals, in religious
rituals, and in feasting activities as well as or better than existing decorations. Obviously,
inventor, producer, and user groups may have overlapping memberships, but the decisions
are group and process contingent. Even in small-scale societies, collapsing technological
change into just two processes, such as “invention and adoption” or “invention and innovation,” is apt to be profoundly misleading.
Archaeological Visibility of Technological Processes
Although invention, development, replication, and adoption all contribute to technological
change, these processes, I suggest, are represented unequally in the archaeological record.
One might be tempted to propose that invention should be highly visible. After all, an
invention process took place, somewhere, at the beginning of every adopted technology’s
life history, perhaps leading to a plethora of variants. However, the vast majority of

<-----Page 252----->240

Michael Brian Schiffer

inventions, as one-of-a-kind items selected against, are apt to leave only subtle archaeological traces, especially if their materials are immediately reused.
However, some unreplicated variants may be identiﬁable in well-known regions—for
example, those having very large artifact samples from many excavated sites—as the
unique or rare artifacts, including structures and other features, that fall outside existing
typologies (Schiffer 2005b). It is possible that some of the uncommon artifacts over which
we traditionally dote, and which have high newsworthiness, may be nothing more than
singular creations—artisans giving free reign to their imaginations—that were never developed or replicated. Unique items, I hasten to add, can also be produced, for example, by
children (Bagwell 2002; Crown 2002), other novices, and artists. In any event, we should
pay close attention to unique and rare artifacts in well-known regions because some of
these items may be attributable to invention processes. Although investigating invention
processes in prehistory is likely to be difﬁcult, any study’s feasibility has to be assessed
on a case-by-case basis.
Development processes may be somewhat better represented in the archaeological
record than invention. As in the study of invention, the key to identifying the traces of
development is to search well-known regions for unique artifacts, features, and structures.
In addition, one might ﬁnd traces of developed products that were not replicated, perhaps
in work areas or workshops that retain primary refuse or in secondary refuse areas that
resulted from simple and short waste streams (Schiffer 1987).
Once replication begins, we often ﬁnd unambiguous traces of manufacturing processes
in the form of waste products, rejects, raw materials, tools, and facilities. In general, replication ought to be represented far more consistently in the archaeological record than
invention or development.
Adoption is the one process that consistently stands proud in the archaeological record.
With the exception of poorly preserved artifacts, and those that were rare in the past, the
adoption process of any technology is likely to yield many archaeological examples. After
all, almost every artifact showing traces of use is evidence that that artifact type had been
adopted.
Many previous studies of technological change have been ﬂawed because researchers
conﬂated the major processes. Typically, investigators assume that the archaeological
record faithfully reﬂects invention, whereas they are dealing almost exclusively with
adopted technologies, the ﬁnal product of sequential selection processes. As a consequence, archaeologists, especially those employing diffusion theory, erroneously explain
technological change exclusively in terms of invention and innovation, that is, the origin
and spread of ideas. It is preferable to keep the major processes conceptually distinct
and to handle each one by process-speciﬁc models, theories, laws, and heuristic tools
(Schiffer et al. 2001). However, a number of critical variables, such as performance
characteristics and performance requirements, may occur in models pertaining to different processes.

<-----Page 253----->Can Archaeologists Study Processes of Invention?

The following section presents examples of the kinds of models that archaeologists can
build by employing an “expanded ethnoarchaeology” (Schiffer 2008a), a strategy using
historical evidence. The long-term goal of these efforts is to create models that specify
the general conditions and factors fostering inventive activities. By furnishing such expectations, these models can inform the study of technological change in archaeological cases.
Moreover, when joined with information about formation processes, the models can
furnish guidance about the kinds of deposits likely to preserve evidence of inventive
activities (D. J. Seymour, pers. comm., 2007). (Promising invention models that have
arisen in other disciplines, from psychology to economics, might be evaluated in an
expanded ethnoarchaeology.)
Models of Invention Processes
I have found it productive to fashion models that explain bursts of inventiveness—the
activities that yield a set of related inventions clustered in time and often in space. Thus,
each of the following models denotes a kind of invention process that gives rise to spurts
of inventive activities and is deﬁned on the basis of speciﬁc boundary conditions—that is,
it occurs in a particular “behavioral context” (LaMotta and Schiffer 2001).
Stimulated Variation
A very general model is that of “stimulated variation,” which speciﬁes that selective pressures emanating from two selective contexts, immediate and extended, can give rise to
bursts of invention (Schiffer 1996). The immediate selective context is the entire sequence
of processes that take place during an already adopted artifact type’s life history, such as
procurement of raw materials, manufacture, transport, distribution, storage, use, maintenance, reuse, and disposal. Any change in these activities can create selective pressures
for invention. The extended selective context includes activities, agents, and mechanisms
that are coupled by ﬂows of energy, artifacts, or people to activities of the immediate
selective context (Schiffer 1992).
Stimulated variation is set in motion when changes in selective contexts affect an
adopted technology’s performance in one or more life-history activities. Indeed, a burst
of inventiveness is likely to occur when potential inventors judge that the technology’s
performance characteristics fall short of meeting an activity’s performance requirements.
Often, these kinds of deﬁciencies are framed as problems to be solved or, on occasion, as
opportunities to be pursued.
An example comes from the ﬁrst era of radio, known as “wireless.” As wireless communication technologies—transmitters, receivers, and the like—began to enjoy adoptions
for maritime and military activities during the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century, users
learned that interference from other transmitters broadcasting simultaneously confounded

<-----Page 254----->242

Michael Brian Schiffer

point-to-point communication. Thus, the need for precise tuning of transmitters and receivers was identiﬁed as a pressing problem and stimulated a variety of inventions (Aitken
1976). The proximate cause of this burst of inventiveness was pressures in the immediate
selective context—the unreliable performance of wireless apparatuses during use. In turn,
these performance deﬁciencies arose because of the increasing adoption of wireless technologies manufactured by many companies in many nations, whose signals increasingly
interfered with each other (extended selective context).
Stimulated variation created a spate of inventions for overcoming interference; some of
these were developed and replicated, and a few were widely adopted. In other cases,
however, every invention generated by stimulated variation is judged to be ineffective,
and so other behavioral changes may be necessitated (Schiffer 1996).
Invention Cascades
The invention-cascades model (Schiffer 2005b), a close relative of stimulated variation,
applies to the development process of a complex technological system (CTS). The latter
is ﬂexibly deﬁned as any technology consisting of a set of artifacts—component parts—
whose interactions among themselves and with people (and perhaps with externs) permit
that system to function. Examples include irrigation systems, boats, and churches. People
in small-scale societies also developed CTSs, such as particular hunting, gathering, foodpreparation, and ritual technologies.
The cascade model posits that, during development, emergent performance problems,
recognized by people as shortcomings in that technology’s constituent interactions,
provoke sequential spurts of invention. After each performance problem is solved by
invention, people encounter new and often unanticipated problems, which initiate more
inventive spurts, and so on. The result is a series of “invention cascades.” The model’s
distinctive feature, which promotes its generality, is the premise that processes in a developing CTS’s life history are the immediate contexts in which performance problems
emerge and stimulate invention cascades for new component parts. Thus, processes such
as fashioning a prototype, manufacture, use, and maintenance are suitable analytical units
for investigating invention cascades.
In an analysis of the development of the nineteenth-century electromagnetic telegraph,
I discussed the basic processes, which came to include creating the prototype, technological display, demonstrating “practicality,” replication, marketing and sales, installation, use/
operation, and maintenance. People addressing the performance problems encountered
during these processes fomented numerous cascades and invented multiple variants of
basic components such as senders, wires, relays, batteries, insulators, lightning protectors,
and receiver-printers (Schiffer 2008b).
The cascade model indicates that the invention of prototype electromagnetic telegraphs, which was accomplished by many people in many nations during the 1830s, was
merely a starting point in a long sequence of inventive activities. Indeed, the prototype,
usually a telegraph that could be exhibited at work in a laboratory or display setting,

<-----Page 255----->Can Archaeologists Study Processes of Invention?

243

served merely to attract resources for the development of a full-scale system. Once under
way in earnest, the development process itself consisted of incessant inventive spurts
that resulted, eventually, in replicable telegraph systems, a few of which were widely
adopted.
The cascade model is a potent antidote to diffusionist explanations of technological
change. This has been convincingly shown by Arnold (2007) in her rebuttal of a diffusionist explanation for the appearance of the Tomol, the oceangoing canoe of the Chumash, a
southern California group. In this instructive case, she argues that even if voyagers had
arrived in canoes that had been made across the Paciﬁc—a point she does not concede—
the Chumash still would have had to invent tools and acquire skills for using local materials
to make their own versions of seaworthy canoes. This development process, she maintains,
would have taken some time, requiring inventive spurts to solve emergent performance
problems (see chapter 15, this volume).
In general, then, the transmission of information about, or examples of, a CTS made
elsewhere cannot account for the invention-laden development process with its organization of people and artifacts needed to replicate copies locally (Pacey 1990). I hasten to
add that neither the cascade model nor diffusion theory can explain why the development
process got underway in the ﬁrst place, how its resource needs were met, and why it was
pursued to a successful conclusion (see chapter 2, this volume). Only by taking into
account many contingent factors—for example, the presence of organizations able and
willing to furnish resources to initiate and sustain development, and potential consumers’
anticipated demand—can the archaeologist craft a deeply contextualized narrative that
accounts fully for a CTS’s development (Schiffer 2008b). However, the cascade model
does specify that as long as development is proceeding, the CTS will be an incubator of
inventive spurts giving rise to variants of component parts.
Cultural Imperatives
In a previous work, I deﬁned a cultural imperative as “a product fervently believed by a
group—its constituency—to be desirable and inevitable, merely awaiting technological
means for its realization” (Schiffer 1993: 99; see also Schiffer 1991). The imagined
product is usually visualized in terms of speciﬁc performance requirements. Members of
the constituency, who may be a tiny minority in a society, seek to fashion their product
employing any and all promising technologies that come along, regardless of their source.
Sometimes these inventions are developed further, replicated, and adopted.
The shirt-pocket portable radio, which is my favorite example of a cultural imperative,
was conﬁned to a small group of mostly young, male electrical enthusiasts, beginning in
the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century. The vision of a radio receiver small enough to
carry around and play in a shirt pocket was perpetuated in hobbyist and electronic trade
magazines. This publicity recruited new members to the constituency, alerted members to
new technologies that might be exploited, and conferred bragging rights on the makers of
the clever one-off radios featured in articles.

<-----Page 256----->244

Michael Brian Schiffer

As new electrical technologies came along in later years, members of the constituency
episodically churned out a ﬂurry of new pocket radios. Thus, when crystal detectors were
replicated in the ﬁrst decade of the twentieth century, hobbyists immediately used them
to build tiny radios, sometimes placing them in the cases of old pocket watches. Because
these radios needed an antenna and ground connection, they were far from fully portable,
and they could not be tuned. With the widespread commercialization of vacuum tubes in
the 1920s, “pocket” radios incorporating these new components were far too large to ﬁt
into shirt pockets, and thus many inventors resorted to building more sophisticated crystal
sets. Although some crystal radios built and commercialized in the 1920s and 1930s had
rudimentary tuning, they retained those pesky wires for antenna and ground connections.
They were shirt-pocket size but neither self-contained nor fully portable, and so they did
not entirely satisfy the cultural imperative.
The ﬁrst sets that met the performance requirements of a shirt-pocket radio incorporated
subminiature vacuum tubes—about 3–4 centimeters long and about 0.5–0.8 centimeters
in cross-section. Originally developed by Raytheon for hearing aids, these tubes saw
extensive adoptions during World War II for use in military equipment, such as proximity
fuses in bombs and in artillery shells. After the war, experimenters and several companies,
including Raytheon, invented a plethora of shirt-pocket radios employing subminiature
tubes. Raytheon went further, not only developing its own radio but also replicating it
through a subsidiary company, Belmont Radio, in late 1945. The Raytheon engineer in
charge of this project, Norman Krim, was a member of the shirt-pocket-radio constituency, had been an avid reader of hobbyist magazines during his youth, and became the
principal advocate of this invention at Raytheon. The Belmont radio, played only through
an “earplug,” was entirely self-contained, but one wire to the earplug doubled as the
antenna.
With the replication of transistors in the early 1950s, which had vastly better battery
economy than vacuum tubes, experimenters created the ﬁrst solid-state, shirt-pocket
radios. In 1954, Texas Instruments invented one that was completely self-contained and
had a built-in speaker. It was further developed by an Indiana company (I.D.E.A.) and
marketed as the Regency TR-1. Within a few years, American and Japanese companies
by the score developed and replicated countless new models, which were eagerly adopted
by millions of consumers.
An essential condition of the cultural-imperative model is the presence of a constituency
that is perpetuated over time. Equally important, however, is that the constituency be
present in a society experiencing many technological changes. Otherwise, members of the
constituency would have available few new components, materials, and processes that
might be tried out for creating its pet product. In modern industrial societies, a constituency can consist of people and ﬁrms that are part of the military–industrial–academic
complex, such as those advocating, and proﬁting from, efforts to invent fusion-power
technology, a cultural imperative since the 1950s. Although the cultural-imperative model

<-----Page 257----->Can Archaeologists Study Processes of Invention?

245

seems to account for certain inventive activities in industrial nation-states, I believe that
it may sometimes apply to small-scale societies undergoing many technological changes,
assuming the presence of cultural imperatives.
Component-Stimulated Invention
Component-stimulated invention is the ﬂowering of creativity that sometimes follows the
appearance of a new part or component (Schiffer 2008c). In capitalist–industrial societies,
people commonly invent devices that employ or are built around a new component, such
as the vacuum tube, transistor, laser, and computer microchip. I suspect that the process
is more widespread, perhaps also occurring in small-scale societies.
This invention process is typiﬁed by the electromagnet (Schiffer 2008c). Beginning in
the early 1830s, replication of the modern electromagnet immediately stimulated the
invention of telegraphs, magnetos (a kind of generator), and motors. In addition to these
celebrated offspring, it begat hundreds of lesser-known inventions prior to the widespread
adoption of steam-driven dynamos in the 1870s. Drawing current from batteries, most of
these inventions, ranging from ﬁre alarms to musical instruments to facsimile machines,
were materialized as prototypes and patented. However, relatively few were developed
and replicated in the period 1840–1875. Nonetheless, these obscure inventions represent
a noteworthy creative ﬂorescence, for the electromagnet was imagined as the core component in countless electromechanical devices.
There are two idealized patterns of component-stimulated invention. In the ﬁrst, the
component is conceived as a substitute for another in extant devices. For example, in its
ﬁrst decades the transistor was regarded mainly as a substitute for vacuum tubes, and so
myriad transistor types were invented that mimicked the performance characteristics of
speciﬁc vacuum-tube types. This pattern yields new designs of the component for existing
applications and, often, redesign of other components with which it interacts. Thus, with
the lower voltage requirements of transistors compared to vacuum tubes, some manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to redesign other components such as resistors,
capacitors, and inductors that could be miniaturized.
In the second pattern, the component is visualized as functioning in—indeed, making
possible—new artifacts and CTSs, sometimes across a broad societal front. The engine of
creativity lies in inventors’ envisioning connections between a component’s unique combination of performance characteristics and potential technologies that might exploit these
for carrying out actual or anticipated functions.
People acquainted with the electromagnet, perhaps having seen it operating in the
receiver-printer of a telegraph ofﬁce, would have internalized its most salient performance
characteristics. To wit, it (1) produces magnetism of potentially great strength, (2) turns
on and off rapidly, (3) is actuated through wires at distances long or short, and (4) creates
reliably and repeatedly precise motions of small amplitude through simple mechanisms.
By matching these performance characteristics to the requirements of a technology that

<-----Page 258----->246

Michael Brian Schiffer

could solve a perceived problem in some realm of activity, an inventor might envision
new devices and CTSs.
Although we might wonder which came ﬁrst, the component or the problem, it is probable that both sequences occurred. Some inventors were captivated by the new component
and sought applications; others began with a problem that they believed the new component could help solve. What matters most is that inventors, by repeatedly forming a nexus
between problems and the component, came up with new technologies. (It should be
obvious that this model can be easily generalized to cover inventions stimulated by the
replication of a new product or new technology.)
Material-Stimulated Invention
Another potent ﬁllip to invention is the appearance of a new material or material technology, such as chipped stone, pottery, iron, or Bakelite, that potentially can be fashioned
into many forms serving many functions. In a case study of bone tools spanning the prehistoric and historic periods in the Northern Plains, Grifﬁtts (2006) demonstrated that
contact situations are especially conducive to material-stimulated invention. Indeed, we
can be reasonably conﬁdent that indigenous artisans would have played with any new
materials and processes that came their way, seeking to make artifacts that might meet the
performance requirements of ongoing and anticipated activities. Material-stimulated
invention should be a widespread process, especially in societies undergoing rapid social
and technological changes.
Inventive spurts occasioned by the appearance of a new material ought to follow two
idealized patterns. In the ﬁrst, the new material is envisioned as a replacement for a material used in extant artifacts (Grifﬁtts 2006). We can imagine, for example, that the ﬁrst
people in a society to acquire rudimentary pottery-making skills might have tried to form
vessels in the shapes of basket, gourd, and skin containers and perhaps even fashioned
zoomorphic forms to mimic carved stone or wooden efﬁgies. Likewise, in the late 1830s,
the inventors of electrometallurgy—the process of working metals through electrical
deposition—formed varied objects, from medallions to printing plates, that traditionally
had been made from other materials or by other processes (Schiffer 2008b).
In the second pattern, artisans dabble in making new kinds of artifacts, perhaps capable
of performing new functions (Grifﬁtts 2006). Potters might have tried to create vessels for
holding materials that formerly lacked a specialized storage or heating container. By
electrodepositing copper—the easiest metal to work electrically—early experimenters
copper-plated numerous organic forms whose surfaces had been made conductive, including insects, fruits and vegetables, and lace, exhibiting the technology’s promise to produce
endless novelty items. They also created recipes for depositing gold and silver, which led
to experiments in plating ornate objects made of base metals, altering their visual performance so as to mimic much pricier items (Schiffer 2008b).
In general, we can expect the appearance of a new material or material technology to
provoke a burst of inventiveness aimed at making artifacts, old and new. And in societies

<-----Page 259----->Can Archaeologists Study Processes of Invention?

247

undergoing rapid growth and change, artisans may have incentives to extend the reach of
their technologies toward new applications (“producer pressure” [Schiffer and Skibo 1987;
see also Schiffer 2001]). These experiments may be episodic, particularly if the new material technology itself undergoes changes in performance characteristics. In the course of
trials, artisans acquire a richer understanding of a new material’s performance characteristics in relation to manufacture, maintenance, and anticipated use activities of particular
artifacts. The growth of this techno-science lays a foundation for further experiments and
inventions.
Peer-Group Competition
By combining elements of Hayden’s (1998) “aggrandizer” model with the general notion
of “peer-polity interaction” (e.g., Renfrew and Cherry 1986), one can craft a model that
identiﬁes widespread conditions—peer-group competition—that might lead to bursts of
inventive activities. The model is based on the premise that in societies where peer groups
(of individuals, households, neighborhoods, sodalities, churches, corporations, cities, and
nation-states) compete among themselves for resources, consumers, territory, political
power, prestige, and so forth, inventive activities will take place to supply new technologies to serve emergent utilitarian and symbolic functions (see chapter 15, this volume).
We are all familiar with the institutionalized invention processes found today in the
laboratories of corporations making everything from ice cream to nuclear reactors. Incessant competition drives invention as corporations strive to increase market share, come up
with “the next big thing,” or just generate salable patents.
Competing polities such as towns, cities, and nation-states promote inventions in, for
example, roads, canals, ships, harbors, bridges, forts, palaces, public buildings, parks, monuments such as tombs and statues, paintings and murals, highly decorated serving wares, and,
of course, armaments. Before any invention is developed, however, ofﬁcials usually select
from among a host of new designs and models proposed by the inventors, whether they be
artisans, engineers, or architects. One example is the nineteenth-century competition among
major maritime nations, especially between England and France, which led to the invention
of new kinds of navigation aids (Schiffer 2005a). In the twentieth century, the missile and
space races between the superpowers gave rise to numerous spurts of invention in areas of
technology as diverse as nuclear weapons and solid-state electronics.
Clearly, peer competitions can be a very powerful driver of invention, as well as of
development, replication, and adoption in societies at all scales.
Conclusion
In view of the scant archaeological visibility of inventive activities, it is tempting to conclude that we are not in a very good position to study them. Perhaps we should concentrate
on investigating replication and adoption processes. However, avoiding invention

<-----Page 260----->248

Michael Brian Schiffer

processes would be a mistake, for a comprehensive understanding of technological change
requires insights into processes that give rise initially to variation in artifacts. Thus, I
maintain that archaeologists do need to build invention models. The examples in this
chapter raise hopes that an expanded ethnoarchaeology—as one promising research strategy among many others—may furnish invention models of potential archaeological utility.
I have found it useful to build invention models that identify the factors in speciﬁc
behavioral contexts that are apt to promote inventive spurts. Such models, along with a
sophisticated understanding of formation processes, might enable us to seek and recognize
any subtle traces of inventive activities that do survive in the archaeological record. Invention models also encourage us to ask new kinds of questions about the origins of material
variation. Answering these questions, I suggest, can promote a better understanding of the
hows and whys of technological change, past and present. Perhaps archaeological models
can contribute to the discussions of modern technological change taking place across and
beyond the academy.

War, Women, and Religion: The Spread of Salado Polychrome in
the American Southwest
Todd L. VanPool and Chet Savage

An old adage holds that necessity is the mother of invention. This is especially true when
it comes to humans seeking to kill, or to keep from being killed by, their fellows. Innovation in, and spread of, military technology can be rapid and often represents a case where
evolutionary forces can be directly linked to the generation of cultural variation and
changes in behavior and technology. For example, the acceptance of the bow and arrow
is tied to warfare (Blitz 1988; Wallace and Doelle 2001). As Blitz (1988: 135) observes,
“groups confronted by hostile neighbors armed with the bow would be under signiﬁcant
pressure to adopt it themselves.” In such cases, the evolutionary importance of technological change is quite straightforward.
Here we deal with war and technological change, but we focus speciﬁcally on its aftermath, when the causes of technological innovation and its acceptance are less obvious. In
the late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a.d., the Salado ceramic tradition spread across
the American Southwest. This tradition is unique in that it crosscuts the three general
archaeological traditions that have been deﬁned for the region—the Anasazi, the Mogollon, and the Hohokam (see ﬁgure 15.1). Crown (1994: 37) notes that this crosscutting
reveals “unanticipated convergence in [Southwestern] ceramic manufacturing traditions,”
but “the Salado polychromes seem to have been added to the longstanding repertoires of
southwestern potters, so that potters continued to use their traditional techniques and styles
to manufacture other vessel types after the Salado polychromes appeared.” In other words,
the Salado ceramic tradition linked people in previously distinct cultures but didn’t replace
these differences. Instead, cultural differences continued, but the Salado demonstrates a
shift in social interaction such that distant people were symbolically and politically integrated in a way that they had not been previously (Crown 1994).
The dual nature of the Salado system, which emphasizes integration but maintains
regional differences, has puzzled archaeologists, who have variously described the Salado
as a tradition, a culture, a ceramic horizon, a phenomenon, a mirage, and an enigma.
Archaeologists can’t create trait lists separating the Salado from other cultural groups
(Nelson and LeBlanc 1986), making it unique in the Southwest, where archaeologists are
proud of their ability to identify and trace particular groups for millennia (e.g., Haury

1975). Archaeologists can characterize parts of the Salado phenomenon, but we haven’t
been able to place the pieces into a meaningful, coherent package.
At its core, the Salado is best characterized, and perhaps may only be characterized, as
a pottery tradition (Dean 2000; Nelson and LeBlanc 1986; Ravesloot and Regan 2000),
but the fact that so many people began to make uniformly decorated pottery within a
generation demonstrates a signiﬁcant cultural change in Southwestern groups. Although
Crown (1994) presents strong evidence that the Salado wares reﬂect the spread of a religious system, the impetus and social signiﬁcance of the pottery and its associated belief
system are unclear. Here, then, is an enigmatic case of cultural invention and transmission:
Salado pottery developed and spread quickly across 130,000 square kilometers of the
Southwest, uniting diverse groups using shared symbolism. What are the cultural processes
that led to its development and spread? And what do they tell us about how human cultures
evolve?
We propose that the Salado was the result of intense female competition created by the
inﬂux of thousands (perhaps tens of thousands) of female war refugees and their children

<-----Page 265----->War, Women, and Religion

253

into central and southern Arizona and New Mexico. The extreme female competition
resulted in immigrant women’s developing and spreading the Salado religion, which
emphasized unity and inclusiveness and drew heavily from their previous ceramic technologies. This religious system helped reduce female conﬂict and was most clearly
manifested in pottery, a product made and used primarily by females. Although the Salado
religion profoundly impacted the course of Southwestern prehistory, it isn’t clearly
reﬂected in the ritual activities of males, who are considered by Southwestern archaeologists (e.g., Crown and Fish 1996; Mills 2000) to be the primary ritual participants. It
appears instead to have been a “mundane” religious system associated with the everyday
life of women as reﬂected by the mundane use of Salado pots.
Late Prehistoric Warfare and the Salado Phenomenon
The late thirteenth and fourteenth centuries a.d. in the Anasazi area of the Southwest was
a period of tremendous strife. Starting about a.d. 1250, large-scale village-on-village
warfare (and perhaps even conﬂict between village alliances) became intense and led to
the eventual abandonment of areas that had been occupied for millennia (LeBlanc 1999;
Lekson 2002a; Wilcox et al. 2001). Armed conﬂict shattered the remnants of the Chaco–
Aztec system that had culturally united much of the northern Southwest and led to the
mass emigration of as many as 20,000 people (Lowell 2007). Violence led to the virtual
abandonment of the Kayenta and northern Anasazi area (see ﬁgure 15.1; Fowles et al.
2007; LeBlanc 1999; Lipe 1995; Lowell 1991). Although some communities appear to
have moved en masse (Lekson 2002b), many migrants moved into previously existing
communities, perhaps joining distant kin or trading partners. A common pattern in these
cases was an extreme gender imbalance reﬂected in mortuary remains; women tended to
outnumber men two to one in many areas, and subadults were far more common than in
previous groups (Lowell 2007).
Arrival of a substantial number of migrants relative to the indigenous population corresponded with a shift in settlement strategies, as populations began to aggregate in
pueblos with defensive attributes, including protected plaza areas and defensive locations,
and new architectural features such as platform mounds (Elson et al. 2000; Lowell 2007).
Populations in some areas experienced perhaps as much as a tenfold increase as dispersed
local populations and the new immigrants clustered into larger settlements such as
Grasshopper Pueblo (see ﬁgure 15.1). Increased variation in pottery decoration and technology, female (but not male) mortuary practices, and hearth morphology (e.g., the apparent introduction of rectangular, slab-lined hearths) reﬂect a sizable inﬂux of female
refugees from the north (Lowell 2007), but evidence of increased variation in malecentered material culture such as ceremonial architecture (e.g., circular kivas used by the
Anasazi) and projectile-point shape is absent (Lowell 2007).

<-----Page 266----->254

Architectural and skeletal evidence indicates that immigrating women and children
inhabited both previously built and newly constructed structures in the communities they
entered, were forced to rely more heavily on wild crops than the indigenous inhabitants
were, and had poorer nutrition compared to their contemporaries (Lowell 2007). Further,
warfare appears to have followed these migrants, with increased conﬂict over one or more
generations and eventual abandonment of communities as populations moved farther south
(Elson et al. 2000; Lowell 2007). For example, portions of the Tonto Basin in central
Arizona were occupied and abandoned in a span of 50 years from a.d. 1275 to around
a.d. 1325, with most of the villages being burned and the populations moving elsewhere
(Elson et al. 2000).
Starting around a.d. 1275, during and slightly after the peak of the immigration from
the north (Crary et al. 2001; Crown 1994), the Salado ceramic tradition spread across the
Southwest. Salado polychromes were locally made but have clear antecedents in the
Kayenta and Tusayan Anasazi traditions from which the immigrants came (Crary et al.
2001; Crown 1994). Other than the pottery, distinctive characteristics of the Salado vary
considerably (Dean 2000), as the mixture of cultural traits between immigrants and indigenous peoples produced differences across this vast region (Zedeño 1995).
Yet in the midst of this diversiﬁcation, “uniform” Salado polychromes (Crown 1994:
90) were produced across 130,000 square kilometers. Salado polychromes (see ﬁgure 15.2)
were perhaps ﬁrst made in the Salt River and Gila River areas of south-central Arizona,
but they rapidly spread throughout central and southern Arizona and New Mexico (Crown
1994; Lekson 2002b). They tended to be made at the household level out of locally available resources and through a variety of forming techniques, including those introduced by
the immigrants as well as those previously used by indigenous artisans (Crown 1994,
1995). Further, Salado polychromes seem to follow, at least in part, individual potters as
they moved across the landscape (Crary et al. 2001; Crown 1994; Lowell 2007).
Crown (1994) evaluated competing hypotheses concerning the social importance of the
Salado polychromes and concluded that the pottery reﬂects the rise of a new religious
system. In brief, she found that the pottery was made by local potters with a wide range
of skill levels (as opposed to specialists making the pottery for elite usage and exchange);
that Salado wares were produced and consumed at the household level for mundane use
(as opposed to specialize ritual–elite use); that the pottery was highly valued but was not
restricted to any particular age or sex cohort in burials; and that the redundant icons
reﬂected a widely held belief system focused on the earth, sun, weather, impersonations
of deities, and fertility but did not correspond with a single burial or ritual system. Ultimately, Crown (1994: 7) argued that “the pottery was accepted in association with a
religious ideology, as reﬂected in the imagery. . . . Rather than an exclusive ideology
associated with a cult of the dead or ancestor worship, the Salado polychromes reﬂect the
presence of an inclusive ideology, a regional cult that helped to stabilize social relations
during this time of change in the Southwest.”

What is peculiar about this religious system is that it was not consistently reﬂected in
ritual items and architecture associated with males, who typically dominated religious
ritual in the prehistoric Southwest (Crown and Fish 1996; Lowell 2007). In fact, the only
unambiguous indication of the spread of Salado religion is the pottery, a product that
ethnographic analogy and archaeological evidence indicate was manufactured by women
(Crown and Wills 1995; Mills 2000; Spielmann 2000). We propose that the Salado religion
and its associated pottery reﬂects female-centered religious expression that developed and
spread to reduce female competition in communities stressed by the immigration of thousands of women and their children into the area. The inﬂux of these refugees had a profound, destabilizing impact on community structure, just as it does today (Zolberg et al.
1989). The social tension created by these marginalized women and their families would
have been particularly intense, given that both the indigenous and immigrating groups
may have been matrilineal. Marrying local males would not have helped integrate the
immigrants, given that land and other resources were inherited through the mother’s line.
Economic difﬁculties of the refugees would have been passed down to their (especially
female) children, possibly for generations. (Even in a patrilineal–patrilocal system, the
low economic and political status of the immigrants likely made them less desirable marriage partners.) In this context, unhappiness, scalar stress, and general intracommunity
strife were intense in the Salado area, as illustrated in the rapid formation and abandonment of large villages, forced resettlement over generations as villages were destroyed,
and the formation of defensive settlements and broad village coalitions (Elson et al. 2000;
Lowell 2007; Simon and Gosser 2001; Tuggle and Reid 2001; Wilcox et al. 2001).
Female conﬂict is ubiquitous in primates (De Waal 2000; Geary 1998), and among
humans it is often expressed by advertising qualities valued by men (e.g., beauty and
status) and by indirect (typically verbal) aggression toward other females, often through
gossip and social exclusion from cliques (Cambell 2004; Hess and Hagen 2006; Merten
1997). However, in contexts where men with substantial resources are in short supply,
competition can intensify into physical, often deadly, conﬂict (Campbell 2004; O’Brien
1988). Such conﬂict has evolutionary implications for women, given their reproductive
constraints and high parental investment relative to men in most cultures (Campbell 2004).
Women consequently use a variety of mechanisms to help mitigate conﬂict and avoid or
reduce the deadliness of direct physical confrontations, including formal political or religious coalitions to increase integration (e.g., the women’s movement of Zimbabwe [Win
2004]). We believe this was the case with the Salado.
In Southwestern cultures where religion, politics, and economy are tightly integrated,
a women’s movement emphasizing religious integration (and sociopolitical integration by
extension) would have been ideal for reducing conﬂict. This system of shared belief integrated both the indigenous and immigrant women across families and even villages,
reducing the stress that threatened to split communities and potentially engulf another
portion of the Southwest in catastrophic, unrelenting open war. After the rise of the Salado

<-----Page 269----->War, Women, and Religion

257

tradition, village life became more stable as aggregated communities lasted for longer
periods of time (Lowell 2007).
The hypothesis that the Salado system reﬂects a female-based religious system created
in response to war refugees accounts for the empirical record associated with the Salado.
First, male ritual did not change substantially, given that females and their relationships
were the focus of the Salado religion. Second, Salado polychromes demonstrate a strong
emphasis on Kayenta and other Anasazi imagery because immigrant women from those
economically and politically marginal regions would have been the ﬁrst to develop and
adopt a system that helped them integrate within and among communities. Third, the
integration of women reﬂected by the Salado would not necessarily be reﬂected in other
aspects of the material culture, which, in turn, accounts for the large cultural variation and
lack of deﬁning characteristics other than pottery associated with the inﬂux of refugees
and the subsequent spread of the Salado. Fourth, the earliest Salado corresponds with the
arrival of the immigrants. Fifth, the development of the Salado religion corresponds with
increased evidence of social strife and warfare.
Additionally, the hypothesis accounts for aspects of Crown’s analysis that determined
the Salado reﬂected a religious cult. Crown (1994: 5–6) outlined six predictions corresponding with the hypothesis that the Salado reﬂected a religion: (1) There should be
evidence beyond pottery for the rise of a religious system; (2) the pottery should be
restricted to ceremonial contexts; (3) the pottery should be associated with a single mortuary ritual; (4) pottery in burials should not reﬂect prior use for secular activities; (5) pottery
designs should reﬂect a belief system using ubiquitous and redundant icons, which may
also be reﬂected in other religious contexts such as kiva murals; and (6) vessel forms
should be limited to those used for ritual consumption.
Surprisingly, given her conclusion that the Salado reﬂects a religious cult, Crown (1994)
found little support for most of these predictions. Predictions 2, 3, 4, and 6 are not supported because the Salado wares take a variety of utilitarian vessel forms, are not restricted
to mortuary contexts, are used prior to their inclusion in burials, and are associated with
different mortuary patterns (Crown 1994; see also Ravesloot and Regan 2000). The only
Salado pots in her study that are exclusively associated with ritual contexts are a single
vessel from a kiva and two from a cache that might have a primary ritual role (Crown
1994: 108).
Crown (1994: 6) notes, though, that if the pottery was not restricted to ritual or mortuary
contexts, which are likely male-dominated religious expressions (Crown and Fish 1996),
then only expectations 1 and 5 are likely to be met, which is in fact the case in her analysis.
Crown (1994: 223) concludes that the pottery’s use in mundane contexts, as opposed to
ritual contexts, indicates that the Salado religion was open to all who chose to participate.
Such openness is concordant with the proposal that the Salado is associated with a
women’s movement to reduce conﬂict, as is the fact that some high-status burials have
little or no Salado pottery, whereas other burials, including low-ranked burials, can have

<-----Page 270----->258

Salado polychrome in abundance (Ravesloot and Regan 2000). Hence, the Salado religion
was not focused on elites but was instead “a poor woman’s religion.”
The Invention and Spread of Cultural Traits
We opened this chapter with the adage that necessity is the mother of invention. In the
case of the innovation and adoption of the Salado system, this does indeed appear to be
the case. What might the evolutionary mechanisms have been that resulted in the generation of variation, including a religion-based women’s movement and its rapid diffusion
across 130,000 square kilometers in the form of the Salado tradition? Schiffer (1996,
chapter 14, this volume) has described “stimulated variation,” in which the invention of
technological traits is completed through the initial creation of considerable variation and
the subsequent winnowing of those variants that have the requisite performance characteristics that make them superior to other variants. This model is applicable to the origin
of the Salado religion. The “necessity” that required the “invention” was the need to create
and stabilize communities during a period of massive population upheaval and unprecedented violence resulting in signiﬁcant immigration. As predicted by Schiffer’s model,
tremendous cultural variation ensued (Zedeño 1995), with the Salado religion being one
of the behavioral variants with outstanding replicative success (Leonard and Jones 1987)
resulting from its performance characteristics, which helped integrate populations by mitigating strife, especially among females.
It is also clear that the Salado religion did not spring fully formed into the Southwestern
scene because it was “required.” The cliché linking necessity and invention implies that
humans will ﬁnd solutions to problems they face, using their ingenuity and/or their inborn
cognitive algorithms and abilities. If this were so, then the explanation for both behavioral
variation and its acceptance is simply the presence of a need to which humans intentionally
adapt (see chapters 2 and 7, this volume). Yet such an adaptationist perspective is belied
by the warfare that created the refugees in the ﬁrst place. Attempts to decrease conﬂict
were tried in the northern Southwest without success. Lekson (1999, 2002a), for example,
argues that the Aztec system that succeeded the Chacoan system (and was also reﬂected
in religious iconography) was a failed attempt to politically unite the northern Anasazi.
Such failures do not mesh with adaptationist perspectives, in which selective forces
directly dictate successful cultural responses. This fact brings two related issues into sharp
focus: (1) Intentionality and agency are insufﬁcient for explaining the structure and continuation of cultural variation, and (2) a Darwinian evolutionary system structures cultural
transmission.
Archaeologists and other social scientists frequently emphasize intentionality to explain
cultural variation (e.g., Cowgill 2000; Dobres and Robb 2000). Proponents of “agencybased” explanations hold that humans are socially embedded actors who optimize their

<-----Page 271----->War, Women, and Religion

259

resources as they feel appropriate, seek to form social networks and gain social power,
frequently plan for the future, and otherwise try to intentionally adapt to their social and
ecological surroundings—facts that are undeniable to all who study humans. The implication, then, is that the proper explanation for the generation and continuation of behavioral
variation must reside in the socially embedded intentionality of the actors themselves
(Cowgill 2000). Although humans are “imperfect, and often impractical people” (Dobres
and Robb 2000: 4), it is undoubtedly true that some cultural variation is attributable to the
intentional modiﬁcation–production of behavioral traits resulting from human agency (see
chapter 7, this volume), although “copying error” caused by incomplete and imperfect
transmission of cultural traits also creates variation (Eerkens and Lipo 2005).
However, human intentions do not constitute an adequate explanation for the structure
of behavioral variation (VanPool and VanPool 2003). Humans may, or may not, recognize
inadequacy in their technology and other cultural traits, but they don’t know what behavioral variants will provide solutions, if solutions are possible at all. Even when operating
in the same social and ecological context, people will frequently derive different responses
to the same problem, none of which may be effective, as illustrated by the failure of the
thirteenth-century Anasazi to abate the intense warfare. People’s motives and subsequent
intentionality may superﬁcially explain why variation is introduced, but it does not explain
why speciﬁc solutions are effective and therefore why speciﬁc cultural traits continue to
be replicated (VanPool and VanPool 2003). Further, unintended consequences of cultural
variation can have far-reaching impacts beyond any individual’s intentions (e.g., the
increase in anemia associated with increased reliance on maize).
The open warfare of the northern Southwest spread to the Salado area, but the presence
of cultural variation (the Salado religion) that helped integrate communities across the
region decreased its disruptiveness and intensity. Yet a satisfactory explanation for the
Salado cannot have as its major component the concept of intentionality, given that it is
neither explanatorily necessary nor sufﬁcient. Undoubtedly, people involved in the religious system “meant to” participate in it and perhaps they even “intended” to unify the
community and reduce scalar stress through the shared religion (although this is impossible
to establish archaeologically), but neither the success of the Salado nor the failure of the
other efforts to increase inter- and intracommunity integration reﬂects primarily the actors’
intentions. Salado religion was an adaptation for decreasing community conﬂict because
it possessed performance characteristics that led to its continuation in the selective context
of intense female competition and extreme scalar stress.
The lack of a connection between the selective environment in which people ﬁnd themselves and the usefulness of cultural variation has profound implications for cultural evolution. Darwinian evolution operates when heritable variation that impacts the probability
of survival and reproduction is generated independent of the selective environment
(Leonard and Reed 1993; Lewontin 1970; Lyman and O’Brien 1998; Rindos 1989;
VanPool and VanPool 2003). Given that cultural traits clearly are heritable and frequently

<-----Page 272----->260

T. L. VanPool and C. Savage

impact an individual’s survival and reproduction (as illustrated by warfare in the American
Southwest), the independence between creation of cultural variation and selective pressures necessitates that Darwinian evolution is applicable to cultural traits. It follows that
natural selection, drift, and other evolutionary mechanisms are the processes through
which the generation and continuation of cultural traits can be satisfactorily explained
(O’Brien and Lyman 2000; Shennan 2002).
Previous research indicates variation in some cultural traits reﬂects the strength of the
selective forces, with strong selective forces resulting in limited variation compared to
traits under weaker selective pressures (O’Brien and Holland 1992, 1995; VanPool 2001,
2003). The generalization can be expanded, however, to include considerations of the
nature of the selective environment and the time that selection has had to operate. To begin
with, variation in traits is expected simply because of the transmission process in both
biological and cultural contexts (Eerkens and Lipo 2005). Transmission “errors” consistently generate variation in cultural traits. Some variation will be selected against because
it creates performance characteristics inconsistent with the selective environment, which
is the product of both social and ecological factors. The frequency of variation that isn’t
selected against—that is “favored”—will increase, creating adaptations through the process
of natural selection (O’Brien and Holland 1995; VanPool 2002).
In stable selective environments, the generation of variation and its archaeological
manifestation will be limited with respect to selectively important traits because changes
are unlikely to be beneﬁcial, given that variation in an adaptation is unlikely to improve
it. However, in either a changing or erratic selective environment, such strong selective
pressures will often be inconsistent or eliminated, allowing for the transmission of a comparatively greater amount of variation. In culture, a signiﬁcant factor modifying selective
environments will be changes elsewhere in a technological system as illustrated by
Palmer’s (chapter 10, this volume) discussion of the Amish and the telephone.
This likely underlies Schiffer’s (2005; chapter 14, this volume) cascade events, in that
minor changes, whether they are the result of ecological variation, social changes, or the
introduction of new technological variation, shift the selective environment, which, in turn,
initiates structural changes in traits that may not have even been recognized as related to
the original source of variation and the selective pressures operating on it. Such unintended
consequences further illustrate that human intentionality is of limited explanatory utility
when discussing the generation and spread of cultural variants (VanPool and VanPool
2003). We consequently suspect that the process of selection and the structure of variation
in cultural evolution will follow exactly the pattern outlined by Lake and Venti (2009),
Lyman and O’Brien (2000), and Lyman et al. (2008): Variation will initially be great and
will be winnowed over time as an adaptation is created.
Creating adaptations—descent with modiﬁcation—necessitates intergenerational cultural transmission. In preindustrial societies, children typically are trained within family
units, causing vertical transmission to be paramount (Guglielmino et al. 1995; Palmer

<-----Page 273----->War, Women, and Religion

261

et al. 2005; Shennan and Steele 1999; VanPool et al. 2008; chapters 1, 10, and 13, this
volume). Continuation of the Salado religion for roughly 200 years demonstrates intergenerational transmission, but its spread within a generation was a product of horizontal
transmission. The rapidity of the spread was a product of the cascade effect caused by a
shift in the selective environment. Whether horizontal or vertical transmission is dominant
in a particular case of cultural transmission is an empirical question whose answer will
vary (e.g., variation in Salado pottery-forming techniques reﬂects vertical transmission as
reﬂected by continuation of the previously existing forming techniques, but design variation was at least initially transmitted horizontally).
Further, we propose that the dominance of vertical or horizontal transmission is somewhat dependent on the selective environment. In a stable environment, metatraditions, as
discussed by VanPool et al. (2008) and Palmer (chapter 10, this volume), may form as
adaptations to encourage faithful vertical transmission and thus decrease behavioral variation that is likely harmful. These traditions will necessarily act as barriers to a cascade of
technological innovation.
In contrast, drastic modiﬁcation of the selective environment will likely weaken or
eliminate metatraditions because it will lead to increased behavioral variation. This variation may result in the absence of consistent behavioral traits within a generation, which,
in turn, will make cultural transmission of consistent behavioral traits between generations difﬁcult and thereby change social relations such that the metatraditions no longer
effectively facilitate vertical transmission. Natural selection may also work against traditional behavior and consequently select against continuation of the metatradition
through the process of hitchhiking (Hurt et al. 2001). Thus, increased horizontal transmission and the (re)combination of traits that were part of separate cultural lineages will be
signiﬁcant parts of stimulated variation in nonindustrial societies. Such recombination
is certainly evident among the Salado, as previously distinct cultures began to share a
variety of traits.
Conclusions
We have outlined a historical narrative underlying the generation and spread of cultural
variation that fundamentally altered Southwestern prehistory. Our argument is presented
in more detail in VanPool and VanPool (2008) but can be abridged as follows: The rise
of intense warfare characterized by the massacre of entire communities led to the spread
of female refugees and their families throughout much of what is now central and southern
Arizona and western New Mexico. This created a new selective environment that impacted
those living in the communities, as intense female–female conﬂict was created by immigrants vying with each other and with native women for mates and resources. The result
was intense intra- and intercommunity conﬂict. The arrival of the immigrants initiated

<-----Page 274----->262

T. L. VanPool and C. Savage

what Schiffer (2005; chapter 14, this volume) characterizes as a “burst of variation” associated with a cascade of innovation. The increased behavioral variation was especially
pronounced in activities associated with women and led to the formation of a uniform
pottery style, Salado polychromes, that spread across a vast area containing previously
distinct cultures.
We propose that the Salado pottery tradition reﬂects strong selective pressures operating
on the expansive cultural variation. In this context, a women’s religious system that
emphasized integration had performance characteristics well suited to the selective environment and as a result had tremendous replicative success as it spread across much of
the Southwest in a very short time (between a.d. 1275 and a.d. 1300) through the process
of horizontal transmission and migration. The selective pressures limited variation in the
ceramic tradition such that there was relative uniformity in icons and other aspects of
decoration across the region, despite the fact that the Salado wares were locally produced
and reﬂected previously existing and diverse morphological forms. Participation in the
Salado tradition decreased intracommunity stress, which helped mitigate but certainly did
not eliminate intercommunity stress, such that large, stable communities formed across
the Salado region.
We propose that the patterns illustrated in the Salado case study are typical of the generation and transmission of cultural variation, and even in genetic evolution, as bursts of
variation are associated with the opening of previously unavailable adaptive space. Cultural variation does occur in “bursts” and “cascade events” associated with changes in the
selective environment, yet, as illustrated by the very fact that there are “bursts of variation,” the generation of variation is not dictated directly by the selective environment. As
a result, natural selection will reduce the range of initial variation to form adaptations,
despite the fact that experimentation and copying errors will continually generate variation.
In the case of the Salado, strong selective pressures led to the formation and spread of a
cultural adaptation over an expansive area while greatly limiting variation within the
cultural trait. Less severe selective environments may allow more variation than present
in the Salado, but we suggest that this same pattern is typical of cultural evolution.
