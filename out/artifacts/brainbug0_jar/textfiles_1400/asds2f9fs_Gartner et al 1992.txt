This paper suggests that entrepreneurshlp Is the process of "emergence." An organizational behavior perspective on entrepreneurship wouid focus on the process of organizational emergence. The usefulness of the emergence metaphor is explored through an exploration of two questions that are the focus of much of the research in organizational
behavior: "What do persons in organizations do?" (we will explore this question by looking
at research and theory on the behaviors of managers), and "Why do they do what they do?"
(ditto for motivation). The paper concludes with some impiications for using the idea of
emergence as a way to connect theories and methodologies from organizational behavior to
entrepreneurship.

The purpose of this article is to propose some relationships between the entrepreneurship and organizational behavior disciplines. We suggest that thinking of entrepreneurship as the process of "emergence" offers a very fruitful metaphor for relating
entrepreneurship to other disciplines. This paper uses the emergence metaphor to explore
how the organizational behavior area might be connected to entrepreneurship by thinking
about the organizationai aspects of entrepreneurship—entrepreneurship as organizational
emergence.
Connecting entrepreneurship to a discipline that is inherently multidisiplinary (organizational behavior) in a special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice that
is devoted to exploring how various disciplines might offer new theoretical insights into
the nature of entrepreneurship presented us with some interesting challenges. One
challenge involved specifying the unique aspects of organizational behavior {vis-a-vis
the other disciplines) as a focus of study. As Pfeffer (1985) points out, organizational
behavior borrows from sociology, psychology, economics, political science, and anthropology. Identifying organizational behavior's specificity is, therefore, problematical. Weick {1979, p. 31) indicates that "organizational behavior" is inherently ambiguous:
. . . one is never certain whether it means behavior that occurs in a specific place,
behavior with reference to some certain place, behavior controlled by an organization, behavior that creates an organization, or just what.

<-----Page 1----->While Nord (1976) suggests that organizational behavior is connected to psychology and
sociology, it is neither one nor the other. Organizational behavior is about organizations,
a phenomenon that is not the sum of individual processes (e.g., need for affiliation), or
the manifestation of a particular social process (e.g., transactions). Organizations are
simultaneous individual and social phenomena (Katz & Kahn, 1966; Weick, 1979) that
require a multitude of different disciplinary perspectives in order to see their natural
complexities.
Besides the necessity of seeing organizations from a multitude of disciplines, another source of ambiguity stems from the multilevel nature of organizations; that is, talk
about organizational behavior at any level of analysis (e.g., individual, group, organization, community, society) requires a recognition of the other levels as well.
In our review of the organizational behavior literature for ideas and methodologies
that might lend more substance to the entrepreneurship area, we found that there is no
dominant paradigm in organizational behavior, only a multitude of various perspectives
and ideologies. Pfeffer concluded his review of the organizational behavior literature
with the observation that organizational behavior was a form of "lay preaching" (Pfeffer, 1982, p. 293). If organizational behavior is, in fact, "lay preaching," it seems
appropriate that this review be offered as a particular gospel about entrepreneurship: one
of many possible sets of beliefs that might be true about entrepreneurship as a phenomenon.
Given the multilevel/discipline/ideology complexities inherent in organizational behavior, the ability to offer a comprehensive and detailed overview of all of the "organizational" factors that could be gleaned from all of the different disciplines and perspectives that comprise organizational behavior is beyond the scope of any one review.
A "unified field theory" that would integrate such a diverse set of topics as personality,
attitudes, motivation, group dynamics, roles, communication, decision making, structure, technology, environment, culture, power, leadership, and change about organizations does not exist. The organizational behavior area is just too large and complex. This
review will, therefore, not be a primer on organizational behavior. A general overview
of the field can be obtained by perusing any introductory organizational behavior undergraduate-1 eve I textbook. Current theory and research about organizational behavior
can be found in journals (e.g.. Academy of Management Review, Journal of Management) or books (e.g.. Annual Review of Sociology, Research in Organizational Behavior) that systematically attempt to assess and review this field.
In Table I, we outline the primary topics addressed in the organizational behavior
area. This list is intended to convey the sense that organizational behavior encompasses
a diverse set of topics that could be connected to entrepreneurial issues and concerns.
Our solution to the challenges of identifying the unique aspects of the organizational
behavior area as well as attempting to relate the organizational behavior area to entrepreneurship is to offer this paper as a type of methodology for making those connections.
This methodology involves using a metaphor about the nature of entrepreneurship (entrepreneurship as emergence) as a way to highlight how entrepreneurship researchers
might approach any topic from an "entrepreneurial" point of view. In some respects,
this methodology (subsuming a topic area into a new frame of reference) has been the
strategy undertaken by researchers in organizational behavior. The organizational behavior topics we explore, behavior and motivation, are also important topics in other
disciplines (i.e.. anthropology, psychology, sociology, and social psychology). Organizational behavior researchers make a topic "organizational" by placing a person's
behaviors and motivations within an organizational context. In the same vein, it is our
goal to look at organizationai phenomena and make them "entrepreneurial" by placing
them within the context of emergence.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS ORGANIZATIONAL EMERGENCE
While there are many different ways that entrepreneurship might be defmed (Bird,
1989; Carland et al., 1984; Cole, 1946; Gartner. 1990), one plausible view ofthe nature
of entrepreneurship is to see it as an organizational phenomenon: the process of organization creation. We concur with Katz and Gartner (1988) that most theories about
organizations assume, a priori, that organizations exist. In the language ofthe institutional theorists (Zucker, 1981), the existence of organizations is a "taken-for-granted
aspect of everyday life" in most theoretical views of the organizational world. It would
seem that the primary task of the entrepreneurial theorist is not to take organizations for
granted, but to probe how and why organizations come into being. The connection, then,
between entrepreneurship and organizational behavior is the link between the phenomenon of organizational emergence and the phenomenon of the already-in-existence organization.
The connection between these two phenomena occurs by viewing entrepreneurship
as a type of organizing (Weick, 1979). In Weick's view, an organization is an on-going
process of interactions among individuals—pattems of interlocked behaviors—and discourse about organizational behavior is a discussion of these patterns of individual
interactions. We suggest that entrepreneurship's contribution to the discourse on organizational behavior is to explore how specific pattems of interlocked behavior are generated. The formation of organizations is fundamentally an "enacted" phenomenon
(Weick, 1979), a particular form of a socially constructed reality (Berger & Luckman,
1967). Seeing entrepreneurship in this way, as a type of psycho-social (read: organizational) phenomenon that is focussed on "emergence" (Katz & Gartner, 1988), offers a
way of connecting various entrepreneurship topics together. Topics such as corporate
entrepreneurship. the management of rapid growth and innovation, and the pursuit of
opportunity, can be seen as permutations of the process of emergence (Hansen &
Wortman, 1989; Stevenson & Gumpert, 1985; Van de Ven, Angle, & Poole, 1989).
Since our primary thesis is that entrepreneurial behavior is "different" from organizational behavior, we intend to compare and contrast these two areas by describing the
nature of individual behavior within the existing organization by looking at research and
theory on the behaviors of managers, a form of organization behavior with individuai
behavior "within" the emerging organization (entrepreneurial behavior). We do this by
discussing managerial work (Hales, 1986; Mintzberg, 1973; Stewart, 1967) and motivation (Landy & Becker, 1987; Vroom, 1964). We have chosen these two topic areas
because they offer complementary approaches to the study of individual behavior in
organizational contexts. The topic of managerial work delves into what activities are
undertaken by managers. The topic of motivation delves into why these activities are
undertaken.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EMERGING AND
EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS
The purpose of this section is to outline how emerging organizations are different
from existing organizations. If, as we have suggested earlier, the organizational behavior
literature begins with the assumption that organizations exist, a priori, then our ideas
about organization behavior are likely to be affected by these taken-for-granted assumptions.
The differences between emerging and existing organizations are not "differences in
degree" across certain dimensions, but quantum differences (Miller & Friesen, 1984)
between the two types. A quantum perspective views the change from an emerging

organization to an existing organization as radical and revolutionary (quantum), rather
than evolutionary (Bygrave, 1989a,b). The process of change from the emerging organization to the existing organization is not the "growth" of certain variables, but an
entirely new reconstitution, a "gestalt" (Miller & Friesen, 1984) of particular organizational characteristics and the interrelationships among them. Emerging organizations
are not smaller, "incomplete" versions of existing organizations, but unique states of
existence with organizational properties that are arranged in a fundamentally different
way from an existing organization. We may observe the same structural characteristics
and organizational processes in both types of organizations (emerging and established),
but each type will make different connections among these variables. For example, the
types of managerial work identified in most managerial work studies (Hales, 1986;
Kotter, 1982; Mintzberg, 1973; Stewart, 1967) are similar to the types of work undertaken by entrepreneurs. However, managerial work is likely to be manifest (enacted,
interpreted and retained) in a fundamentally different manner when compared to entrepreneurial work.
What, then, might be the "quantum" aspects of each organization type?
Emerging organizations are thoroughly equivocal realities (Weick. 1979) that tend
towards non-equivocality through entrepreneurial action. In emerging organizations,
entrepreneurs offer plausible explanations of current and future equivocal events as
non-equivocal interpretations. Entrepreneurs talk and act "as if" equivocal events were
non-equivocal. Emerging organizations are elaborate fictions of proposed possible future
states of existence. In the context of the emerging organization, action is taken in
expectation of a non-equivocal event occurring in the future. For example, Starr and
MacMillan (1990) describe a Cuban American entrepreneur who secures the use of a
friend's business resources (space, telephone, computer, copy machine, delivery van)
during the start-up of a clothing import business and uses these resources to "amplify"
(p. 84) the emerging business's size and legitimacy. The entrepreneur's use of the
friend's business resources enables the emerging business to appear "as if" it were an
existing business. If we assume that the interactions between the emerging business and
other individuals are loosely coupied (Weick, 1976), it is likely that most outsiders will
Spring. 1992

17

<-----Page 5----->" s e e " the delivery van, conference space, telephone, etc. that the Cuban American
borrowed as an existing business without immediate tests of its legitimacy. Outsiders
would "take for granted" that these resources represented an existing business. Outsiders are then likely to respond to this emerging business "as if" it were an existing
business: they will place orders, offer materials on credit, etc.
It is important to assert that we are not suggesting that appearances are reality, that
acting "as if" an emerging business is an existing business will result in an existing
business. In the case of the Cuban American's emerging business, the appearances of
having the capabilities of an existing business does not insure that customers will place
orders for imported clothing, or that the entrepreneur will be able to deliver the clothing
if orders were placed.
An emerging business is embedded in an equivocal reality where the possible results
of specific actions taken in the present can only have assumed future consequences.
These equivocal actions are the phenomenon of "enactment" (Weick, 1979). Based on
pragmatic ideas and values (Dewey, 1935; James, 1950), Weick (1979) argues that
organizational phenomena begin with behaviors, that is, acting precedes thinking. Enactment occurs when uninterpreted action occurs. These uninterpreted behaviors are a
source of variation of possible meanings that can be responded to in specific ways.
Responses to equivocal behaviors (selection) constitute the second phase of a cycle of
interactions (behavior-response-behavior) that form a double interact (Weick, 1979,
chapter 4). In an initial double interact, an equivocal behavior will tend toward a
repeated unequivocal behavior by the response offered to the initial action. A response
to a behavior in an equivocal situation generates an interpretation of the initial action.
When these original behaviors are undertaken again, they are now generated within the
context of an "understanding" of a likely response (retention). For example, the actions
of the Cuban American entrepreneur in setting up a display space (behavior) can begin
a cycle of interactions when potential customers arrive (response), which would encourage the entrepreneur to undertake setting up the display space again (behavior). Enactment, then, is an "as if" phenomenon. Emergence begins with enactment. Equivocal
behaviors are offered as a way of encouraging responses.
In contrast, the existing organization is bound-up in non-equivocal events. Individuals behave in a context of already determined (and interpreted) interactions. Individuals
in existing organizations "take-for-granted" that certain interactions will occur and that
these interactions will have a particular meaning to those individuals involved. Each
individual has a role (Katz & Kahn, 1978) to perform, a constellation of specific
behaviors and responses to specific situations. Existing organizations function because
individuals, both within and around the organization, have an understanding of what
appropriate behaviors are required in these cycles of interactions (Deal & Kennedy
1982; McGrath & Kelly, 1986).
The knowledge of what to do (what the appropriate interactions among individuals
are), and when to act, is what is generated in the process of organizational emergence.
Much of the problem in talking about the nature of organizational emergence is the
failure to recognize the variation in how and when the cycles of interactions are assembled. An entrepreneur can engage in a wide array of possible behaviors. These behaviors
have some degree of equivocality. Either the situation, itself, is equivocal, or the
entrepreneur will perceive equivocality. The entrepreneur will be uncertain as to the
outcome of taking particular actions. Both the equivocal nature of emergence, itself, and
the lack of knowledge of how specific unequivocal outcomes might be generated out of
equivocal situations, is a critical source of variation.
Entrepreneurs face a wide variety of equivocal situations in the process of organizational emergence. At one extreme, entrepreneurs can purchase nearly unequivocal
18

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->cycles of interactions by purchasing an established business or a franchise. In a franchise, the emergence process (the movement from equivocality to non-equivocality) is
specified and programmed. At the other extreme, the process of emergence for new
organizations in new industries is usually done in a more equivocal reality that requires
more time for all individuals that might become involved in interactions to create,
accept, and leam the appropriate behaviors (Aldrich, 1991). For example, the emergence of an organization that would be an independent start-up in a new industry might
involve entrepreneurs that are unsure of how the organization might be structured, the
nature and characteristics of the product or service to be offered, what particular manufacturing technology should be employed, and which customers should be contacted
and how they might be approached. Other individuals are also unsure of an appropriate
response to the emerging organization's actions. As investors reading the business plan,
customers facing a prototype, or individuals considering employment in the new firm,
they are engaged in the reduction of equivocality through their involvement in defining
the routines of the emerging organization. Given the equivocal nature of the process of
emergence, the process of organization formation appears to be inherently variable. The
variation in the phenomenon of organization emergence has yet to be specified in a
comprehensive manner.

BEHAVIOR IN EXISTING AND EMERGING ORGANIZATIONS
When organizations are seen as patterns of interlocked behaviors (Weick, 1979),
knowledge about the behaviors themselves would obviously become important as a
focus of study. Both entrepreneurship and organizational behavior scholars have sought
to identify these '"organizing" behaviors as well as develop theories connecting these
behaviors to larger organizational processes. The format of this section is to review some
of the literature on a specific aspect of research on individual behavior in organizations—managerial work (Mintzberg, 1973; Stewart, 1967), and show how this research
might be applied to the generation of theory on the nature of entrepreneurial behavior.
Nearly all of the organizational behavior literature offers some insights into how and
why individuals behave in organizational settings. Since our focus is on the nature of
behavior itself as an organizational phenomenon, we have directed our attention to the
research area that studies the behaviors themselves—managerial work. Scholars studying managerial work have focussed on describing the specific activities of managers.
They have used these descriptions as building blocks for more comprehensive frameworks about the nature of individual behavior in organizational settings (Kotter, 1982;
Mintzberg, 1973; Stewart, 1967). We use Hales' (1986) review and insights into over 30
empirical studies conducted on the nature of managerial work as a point of departure for
discussing how entrepreneurship theory might be generated or improved.
Tbe problems facing managerial work researchers appear to be very similar to the
problems entrepreneurship researchers have encountered. First, managerial work researchers have selected a wide range of individuals as candidates for study, so the
empirical evidence offers few clues as to how the managerial work school defmes what
is "managerial." While managerial work scholars seem to agree that a Chief Executive
Officer's job is a "managerial job," senior, middle, and lower manager, as well as
foreman jobs have also been studied as managerial work. This concern for defining a
managerial job is similar to the debate in the entrepreneurship literature on differentiating entrepreneurs from other types of individuals (Carland, Hoy, Boulton, & Carland,
1984; Gartner, 1989). Hales suggests that an outcome of studying such a wide range of
managerial jobs has been to identify a wide range of managerial activities. He points out
Spring. 1992

.

19

<-----Page 7----->that there seems to be agreement among a number of managerial work studies on broad
categories of managerial activities: acting as figurehead, liaison, monitoring, allocating
resources, handling disturbances, negotiating, innovating, planning, controlling, and
directing (Hemphill, 1959; Kotter, 1982; Mintzberg, 1973; Pheysey, 1972; Sayles,
1964; Stewart, 1967). Hales posits that managerial work researchers have failed to offer
a framework for differentiating managerial work from other types of work. At this point,
no definitive characteristics of managerial work have been offered. This failure is primarily because researchers have failed to observe non-managerial work with the same
degree of scrutiny.
Hales suggests that another problem with the managerial-work literature is tbat these
studies rarely separate observable activities (what is actually done) from implied tasks
(the intended or expected outcomes of the job). Observations of the day-to-day activities
of managers are unlikely to uncover a manager's intentions or cognitive orientations. For
example, most of the studies seem to suggest that managers do not " p l a n , " and all of
the studies reviewed describe managerial work as fragmented and brief. It appears that
the failure to identify intentional behavior in these studies is the result of the methodologies employed. Managerial work research might be thought of as a "bottom u p " look
at managerial behavior where researchers focus on describing specific, concrete, identifiable activities. Once these activities are identified and described, frameworks are
developed to show how these activities are related to higher order constructs about the
nature of managerial work. This "bottom u p " approach has tended to be a-theoretical
(Fondas & Stewart, 1990).
Hales also suggests that managerial work researchers have generated very little
empirical evidence about the differences between " g o o d " and " b a d " managerial work.
He believes that, in general, there is little research that links specific managerial activities to the organization's performance or to specific expectations or demands for that
managerial position. Hales links this concern about the expectations of good performance to the issue of "role demands" (Levinson, 1966). If a managerial job is a role that
has particular situational criteria that must be played out in order for the role to be
performed correctly, the managerial work literature offers little knowledge about
whether managers are successful at performing their roles. Ironically, while foundation
studies, such as Mintzberg (1973), Stewart (1967), and Kotter (1982), do not overtly
suggest the specific characteristics of " g o o d " managerial practice, many managerial
training programs have been based on their findings. For example, what these researchers observed (the fragmented nature of the work day, little uninterrupted time, the use
of non-written communications) has often been taught as what managers should do.
Entrepreneurship researchers can take solace from Hales' review by recognizing that
managerial work researchers appear to have made no further progress in defining what
is managerial, in differentiating managerial work from other types of work, and in
linking specific managerial activities to successful or unsuccessful organizational performance. The concern for defining the phenomenon being studied, its unique characteristics, and the effects of these characteristics on other variables is not unique to
entrepreneurship. These concerns are not easy to resolve. The managerial work research
literature might be able to offer guidance to entrepreneurship researchers through the
diverse methodologies used. Hales' review describes a broad array of data collection
methods: self-recorded diaries, observations of critical incidents, checklists, selfadministered questionnaires, interviews, activity sampling, analysis of appointment diaries and files, shadowing, and participant observation. The studies he identifies might
serve as models for conducting research on entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial activities.
As Aldrich (1990) indicates in his review ofthe methodologies used in entrepreneurship

20

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->research, more diverse data collection methods, particularly qualitative and ethnographic
methods, would add valuable and unique insights to understanding entrepreneurship.
Besides those studies identified by Hales, other researchers have sought to explore
what managers do. One innovative approach to studying managers links the intentions
of managers to their activities through the use of verbal protocols (Isenberg, 1984,
1986). Yet, even with the use of this methodology, Isenberg found it difficult to identify
"rationality" in the decision-making processes of the executives studied. The general
thought processes Isenberg (1984) identified—intuition, managing a network of interrelated problems, dealing with ambiguity, inconsistency, novelty, and surprise, and
integrating action into the process of thinking—are probably not much unique to the
work of senior managers.
Martinko and Gardner's (1985) overview of the methodologies employed in managerial work research identified problems with sample size, reliability checks (on observers' observations), coding methodology issues (problems with when an "activity"
might have multiple meanings), and conceptual issues (determining effectiveness, identifying environmental and managerial variability, lacking a theory, failing to incorporate
cognitive processes).
They suggest that managerial work research can be improved by using multiple
category coding, cross-tabular analysis, complementary observation methods, as well as
by capturing cognitive processes, developing coding schemes and micro-behavioral
analyses, increasing sample sizes, and measuring performance. The concerns of Martinko and Gardner (1985) have been answered in a pioneering study that focuses on the
processes of innovation and entrepreneurship (Van de Ven, Angel, & Poole, 1989). This
book describes a research program that uses a detailed, process-oriented, cognitive,
quantitative methodology that involves complementary observations and recognizes
multiple categories. The book catalogues a number of projects that are insightful studies
for describing individual behaviors and organizational processes. As a methodological
primer, these studies will be benchmarks of how to conduct empirical research on
managerial and entrepreneurial behaviors.
In summary, if the managerial work area is helpful as a model for how the entrepreneurship area might generate better theory, it is in offering an openness towards the
use of more methodologies for describing the specific activities of individuals. The
primary complaint about the managerial work area has been its a-theoretical orientation
(Fondas & Stewart, 1990; Hales, 1986; Sharifi, 1988). Yet, this lack of a theoretical lens
for viewing managerial activities appears to have freed the area to use diverse datacollection methods for describing what managers do. By not having a theory, researchers
in the managerial work area seem to have taken more liberty to describe what actually
occurs, rather than offer reasons for why such behaviors occur. In fact, in certain
circumstances, a lack of theory is helpful when attempting to understand a phenomenon
(Glaser & Strauss, 1967). It would seem difficult to generate a theory about the specific
activities of entrepreneurs if little is known about what those specific activities actually
entail. Theories about a phenomenon do require some infonnation about what the elements of the phenomenon itself are composed of. We suggest that theories on entrepreneurial behavior would benefit from more studies that utilize a variety of data-collection
methods that describe what entrepreneurs do. We concur with Aldrich's (1990) observation that the entrepreneurship area's pursuit of "rigor" has been narrowly construed
to encompass only large sample sizes and the use of the latest sophisticated numerical
analytical techniques, rather than an openness to use other methodologies that are likely
to produce significant insights into the phenomenon.
The problems facing entrepreneurship researchers are similar to the problems faced

<-----Page 9----->by managerial work researchers. Both areas lack an agreed-upon definition of what the
phenomenon entails, which has led to a variety of studies on different types of individuals. The focus on different types suggests a large degree of variation in the phenomenon
studied, which has made it difficult to specify the unique aspects of managerial/
entrepreneurial work. Yet, managerial work researchers seem to be less concerned with
the conceptual and theoretical problems with their area, and more willing to conduct
field research. We might find it beneficial to be less "demanding" in our attempts to
pursue a narTow view of '^rigorous research" and spend more time with entrepreneurs
as part of the theory-building process.

MOTIVATION IN EMERGING AND EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS
Even if we know, in detail, what entrepreneurs and managers do, this knowledge
would not explain why these particular activities are undertaken or whether these activities lead to more- or less-successful outcomes in particular emerging or existing
organizational situations. Theories of motivation focus on providing explanations for
why individuals behave as they do (BoUes, 1975). Kelly Shaver and Linda Scott's
"Person, Process, Choice; The Psychology of New Venture Creation," in the previous
special issue of Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, offers an overview of how social
psychology provides insights into understanding factors that influence an individual's
behavior. On the surface, the motivational issues addressed by social psychologists and
organizational behaviorists are the same. Both groups start with the same fundamental
orientation: B = f(P, E), in Shaver and Scott's words, "meaning that behavior is a
function of both person and environment." Since the "person" and the "environment"
comprehensively include all phenomena that might influence behavior, it would seem
that any unique claims that organizational behavior might make about understanding
motivation would be subsumed under the broad reaches of social psychology. Most
reviews of motivation found in organizational behavior-oriented publications (e.g., in
The Academy of Management Review and in Research in Organizational Behavior) are
predominantly written by social psychologists. What, then, is unique to the field of
organizational behavior in regards to the study of motivation?
An organizational behavior perspective on motivation is likely to place a greater
emphasis on the organizational factors that infiuence individual behavior. In the context
of organizational behavior research, the environmental infiuences on an individual's
motivation will be weighted towards organizational variables, such as the characteristics
of the task to be accomplished, the way that tasks are coordinated among other individuals, and the goals of the organization that employ the individual. It appears that
organizational behavior has an implicit ideology that focuses on how organizations
infiuence individual behavior. The outcomes of organizational behavior research seem to
suggest how the behavior of individuals might be manipulated in organizational settings.
But, this is not to suggest that social psychologists are not as concerned with how social
settings are manipulated by individual behavior. An organizational behavior perspective
on motivation is, therefore, unique only in its implicit emphasis on organizational
context regarding individual behavior.
Since the Shaver and Scott article offers a comprehensive overview of the motivational issues that infiuence an individual's behavior, vis-a-vis entrepreneurship {e.g.,
risk taking, locus of control, need for achievement), our contribution, from both organizational behavior and entrepreneurship perspectives, is to emphasize the emerging/
organizational factors that influence the motivations of individuals involved in organization creation. Our goal is not to provide a comprehensive analysis of how motivational
22

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 10----->theories in organizational behavior might be applied to entrepreneurship, but to demonstrate the usefulness of the idea of "emergence" as a way to shift theories used to
explain behaviors in established organizations into the territory of the emerging organization. We use Landy and Becker's (1987) overview of the motivation literature,
"Motivation Theory Reconsidered," as a framework for discussing why individuals
behave as they do in emerging and established organizational settings.
Before delving into the motivation theories outlined in Landy and Becker (1987), it
should be emphasized that the idea of emergence offers an important reorientation to
viewing aspects of motivation in organizations. As we suggested in an earlier section of
this article, organizational behavior assumes a "taken-for-granted" organization. Therefore, aspects of motivation are viewed and studied from a perspective that typically
focuses on how individuals are motivated in a "taken-for-granted" non-equivocal situation (e.g., through organizational structure, rewards and punishments, changes in
tasks and responsibilities). From an organizational behavior perspective, the antecedent
factors that influence the motivation of entrepreneurs have typically been explored (e.g.,
traits and characteristics of the entrepreneur and the environment). In this context, the
primary question asked is: What motivates entrepreneurs to start businesses? The entrepreneur's "motivation" is the dependent variable.
When viewing organizational phenomena through the lens of emergence, the entrepreneur is likely to be the independent variable because the entrepreneur is often critical
to the process of changing the equivocality of interactions among a number of different
individuals into the non-equivocal interactions of an organization. In emergence, the
motivation equation is reversed. The question becomes: How do entrepreneurs motivate
others? From the perspective of emergence, we will explore how Landy and Becker's
framework of types of motivations can be used as a tool kit of ways that entrepreneurs
influence others, rather than as factors that influence entrepreneurs to start businesses.
Landy and Becker (1987) suggest that the different theories of motivation are not
competing or comprehensive theories of motivation, but mid-range theories (Pinder,
1984) that focus on a limited range of issues. They classify these theories into five types:
neeJ(e.g., Alderfer, 1972;Maslow, 1954); mw/orc^menr (e.g.. Skinner, \91\); equity
(e.g., Goodman, 1977; Greenberg, 1989); expectancy (e.g.. House, Shapiro, & Wahba,
1974; Vroom, 1964); and goal (Locke, Shaw, Saari, & Latham, 1981). Becker and
Landy suggest that the five types of motivation theories are complementary. It is their
view that each theory emphasizes different dependent variables. Each theory places
differing priorities on such issues as choice, effort, satisfaction, performance, and withdrawal. We will provide a cursory description of each type of motivation theory and
offer some suggestions for how these theories might be applied to the study of organizational emergence.
Need theories specify how certain needs might be satisfied. (See, e.g., Maslow's
[19541 hierarchy of needs—physiological, safety, social, esteem, self-actualization;
Herzberg, Mausner, & Snyderman's [19591 motivator and hygiene factors; McClelland's needs for achievement, power, and affiliation [Stahl, 1986].) Thus, the dependent
variable in most needs-oriented studies is satisfaction. Landy and Becker (1987, p. 26)
indicate that need-type theories are not very helpful for predicting behaviors such as
effort and productivity because recent needs-oriented research suggests that individuals
have different constellations of needs. In general, needs appear to play an indirect role
as moderators in other motivational processes rather than as predictors of behavior.
The primary implication of current ideas about need-type theories of motivation for
researchers interested in studying individuals involved in emerging organizations is that
there is little likelihood that any needs will be found that can serve as predictors of
behavior. In addition, there are too many types of entrepreneurs (Gartner, Mitchell, &
Spring, 1992

23

<-----Page 11----->Vesper, 1989) to assume that a genera! profile of the needs of entrepreneurs can be
specified. It might be appropriate to explore the different "satisfactions" that entrepreneurs receive when starting organizations. For example, Norman Smith's (1967) dichotomous profile of entrepreneurial types (craftsman and opportunistic) might be expanded
to include other profiles of entrepreneurial needs. The study of needs as a motivational
influence on organizational creation might be directed towards understanding how entrepreneurs seek to satisfy the needs of others. For example, instead of a profile of the
needs of the entrepreneur, research could be directed to providing profiles of the needs
of investors, new employees, suppliers, and buyers. Research might also explore how
entrepreneurs go about discovering and satisfying each stakeholder's array of needs.
Landy and Becker (1987) emphasize that reinforcement-type theories of motivation
focus on how to predict, control, and understand specific behaviors that are typically
discrete parts of larger jobs. Since reinforcement-type theories often involve the study of
rewards and punishments for specific behaviors, it would seem plausible that entrepreneurship research based on these theories might explore the specific reward/behavior
linkages that stimulate entrepreneurial activity. For example, research could explore the
kinds and frequency of feedback (i.e.. rewards and punishments) given to entrepreneurs
involved in seeking resources from investors. What kinds of feedback seem to discourage entrepreneurs from continuing to seek resources? What kinds of feedback encourage
entrepreneurs? Conversely, research could focus on exploring the types and frequency of
rewards offered by entrepreneurs as inducements to new employees, investors, suppliers, and buyers to participate in the start-up of an organization.
Equity theories focus on the "(1) tension or distress experienced by individuals who
find themselves in inequitable situations, and (2) the strategies that individuals use to
eliminate or reduce this tension or distress" (Landy & Becker, 1987, p. 27). In general,
equity theories seem to be best for exploring an individual's sense of satisfaction in a
situation that is perceived as being either equitable or unequitable. One useful application of equity theory to the study of entrepreneurship might be the exploration of
perceptions of equity in negotiations for resources between entrepreneurs and investors.
For example, it would be valuable to compare and contrast situations where entrepreneurs had different perceptions of whether they were being treated fairly (vis-a-vis other
entrepreneurs) by venture capitalists. What happens to an entrepreneur's sense of satisfaction if the outcome of a negotiation results in an unfair deal for the entrepreneur?
How do entrepreneurs go about determining what is equitable treatment? Researchers
might also study how entrepreneurs manage a sense of equity in an emerging organization when employees might not share in the gains from a public stock offering. What
happens to perceptions of equity when the entrepreneur becomes a multi-millionaire and
founding employees continue to receive only a salary?
The process of emergence, the "as i f situation, appears to fit into the theoretical
propositions of expectancy theory (Guest, 1984; Vroom, 1964). In expectancy theory,
individuals make choices based on their assumptions and knowledge of various factors,
such as skill level, effort, task complexity, and outcomes. Wanous et al. (1983) suggests
that expectancy theory is most appropriate for modelling choices that involve thoughtful
consideration of alternatives, costs, and benefits. They emphasize that expectancy theory is valuable for explaining major choices like the choice of a career or joining an
organization, decisions that rank in significance to the decision to start a business.
Entrepreneurship researchers might identify the expectancies of different entrepreneurs
and how other factors (skill level, effort, task complexity) influence their perceptions of
the feasibility of undertaking the start-up of a particular business. We suggest that the
idea of "opportunity" (Herron & Robinson, 1990; Herron, Robinson, & McDougall,

24

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY a n d PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->1988; Stevenson & Gumpert, 1985) could be theoretically grounded in an expectancyoriented model.
Entrepreneurs interact with different types of individuals who have different expectancies of the outcomes of interaction in an emerging organization. For example, entrepreneurs are often involved in selling to individuals such as purchasing agents (potential customers for the new firm's products or services) who are motivated to make
purchases based on their organization's goals and objectives. Purchasing agents might be
rewarded for purchasing products based on the lowest price, the convenience of daily
deliveries, and knowledge of the product's previous satisfactory performance. In order
for an entrepreneur to motivate a purchasing agent to buy the emerging organization's
products/services, the entrepreneur needs some understanding ofthe purchasing agent's
reasons for buying. Instead of asking entrepreneurs for their attributions for getting into
business (Gartner, Gatewood, & Shaver, 1991), the organizational behavior researcher
might ask others for their attributions for getting involved (interacting) with emerging
organizations. Researchers might probe for the reasons individuals give for buying
products from new companies, becoming an employee of a new organization, or investing in a new company. One might assume that entrepreneurs seek out the reasons
other individuals offer for interacting with emerging organizations and utilize this
knowledge in designing the interactions that start the organizing process.
Goal theory, much like reinforcement-type theories, has typically focussed on the
study of behaviors that are specific and bounded. Solving arithmetic problems, assembling toys, and planting trees are simple and structured tasks compared to the larger and
more complex tasks of starting a business. Even so, goal theory's fundamental proposition, "difficult goals that are accepted by the individual result in higher levels of
performance than do easier goals accepted by the individual" (Landy & Becker, 1987,
p. 23) is likely to have some application to entrepreneurship research. Studies of the
goals (e.g., making the first sale, obtaining venture capital, developing the prototype)
set by entrepreneurs as well as studies of the goals entrepreneurs establish for other
individuals involved in the emerging organization might reveal that entrepreneurs who
set higher goals are more likely to enable their emerging organizations to survive and
grow larger than entrepreneurs without such goals.
Entrepreneurship researchers may be able to offer a unique perspective on motivation in organizational settings by specifying how motivations emerge. We suggest that
entrepreneurs create a constellation of different motivational systems to involve different
stakeholder groups in the organizing process. Entrepreneurs suggest (act "as if") to
different individuals (e.g., potential buyers, suppliers, investors, employees, partners,
governmental regulators) that certain outcomes (e.g., a better product, a significant new
source of demand, a high rate of return, a rewarding and stable position, involvement,
compliance with the law) will occur from the organizing process. Entrepreneurs, therefore, both seek out, as well as develop, motivations that will enable organizations to
emerge.
If Weick's (1979) dictum, "How do I know what I think, until I see what I say?"
is taken seriously in regards to how motivation is studied in emerging organizations, we
are likely to see the motivations of the entrepreneurs, themselves, change during the
process. The reasons why individuals become entrepreneurs may differ from the reasons
they continue as entrepreneurs. The process of "enactment" generates reasons for prior
behaviors. For example, an entrepreneur who begins the organizing process with the
motivation to "make more money" may, after working long hours without a paycheck
over many months or years to develop a new product, find a more reasonable explanation for these behaviors such as "by my own boss," or "develop a product that helps

<-----Page 13----->mankind." The equivocal nature of organizational emergence suggests that such factors
as the motivations of the individuals involved are likely to be equivocal as well.

IMPLICATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
Our experience into delving into a segment of the organizational behavior literature
has led to the following insights into the process of developing entrepreneurship theory.
First, entrepreneurship researchers need not "invent" any new theories in our quest for
developing theory about the nature of organizational emergence. There are countless
ideas and perspectives on the nature of organizations (e.g.. Table 1: leadership, participation, motivation, groups, organization development, power, teams, leaming, socialization, etc.) that are likely to be useful for thinking about emerging organizations.
Indeed, any organizational behavior topic seems ripe for use as an entrepreneurship
research topic merely by asking: "How is this
(e.g., construct, idea, hypothesis,
proposition, finding, result) about established organizations different for an emerging
organization?'' The gist of this article, therefore, is to suggest that just as organizational
behavior takes a topic such as motivation and makes it an "organizational behavior"
topic by focusing on the organizational influences of motivation, entrepreneurship
makes a topic entrepreneurial by focussing on the topic's "emerging" characteristics.
When emerging and existing organizations are viewed as particular quantum states
of equivocality/unequivocaiity, other processes in organizational behavior take on new
interpretations. For example, the process of organization change for each organizational
type (emerging or existing) can be seen as a movement towards its opposite. Change for
an emerging organization is a movement towards more certain interpretations and more
consistent cycles of interactions among individuals. Change for an existing organization
is a movement towards equivocality, that is, away from singular interpretations for
events and behaviors towards multiple meanings and a repertoire of actions (see, for
example, Kurt Lewin's [1951] state of "unfreezing"). We suspect that the creation of
non-equivocality is likely to be different from the creation of equivocality. The process
of change and the behaviors associated with undertaking change for each organizational
type is likely to be different from the other.
We should borrow boldly. Where we can exercise some wisdom in the borrowing
process is in knowing what, exactly, we are borrowing. The use of theories from
organizational behavior will require a thorough understanding of the problems and
limitations of these theories as well as how these theories have been linked to particular
methodologies for the generation of empirical support. As Gartner (1989) pointed out in
his suggestions for the improvement of research on entrepreneurial traits, the problem
with most entrepreneurship trait research has been the thoughtless and shallow use of
sophisticated theories and methodologies on individual traits and characteristics. Wise
borrowing will require us to become active participants in the organization behavior area
in order to be a part ofthe discourse in organization behavior (LaTour, 1987). It is likely
that the attainment of such expertise by entrepreneurship researchers will also result in
the entrepreneurship area providing new insights into the nature of organization behavior
as well.
Second, we need to be more open to a broader array of research methodologies when
studying entrepreneurial phenomena. We should be willing to conduct single case studies and recognize the different ways in which reliability and validity issues can be
resolved with small samples. Many aspects ofthe phenomenon of entrepreneurship are
not very likely to be understood with quantitative and survey method techniques. If we

26

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->are going to be open to all kinds of ideas and disciplines in entrepreneurship, we might
as well recognize that there are many legitimate methodologies for studying social
phenomena. We need to give ourselves more room to figure out what is going on in
entrepreneurship.
Our current methodologies do not let us explore very much of the "reality" of
emergence. For example, we need to legitimate the use of oral histories as a way of
gathering information on the nature of entrepreneurial activities. What people tell us
about how they behaved is a reasonable beginning to understanding what they actually
did. We must also realize it will be difficult to corroborate an entrepreneur's story
through the use of stories from "outsiders." Since emerging organizations are equivocal
phenomena, the actions and events of emergence are, by definition, open to a number
of different interpretations and perspectives. The nature of equivocal realities requires us
to appreciate the need for different viewpoints and perspectives as enhancements to an
understanding of the phenomenon. Weick (1979) suggests that the appropriate response
to equivocal phenomena is to develop and encourage requisite variety, that is, seeing and
understanding require various ways of seeing and various ways of understanding. The
nature of reliability and validity is therefore fundamentally different when studying
equivocal phenomena.
CONCLUSIONS
The phenomenon of organizational emergence is different from the taken-forgranted world of the existing organization. Our theories about the nature of organizational behavior are much more comfortable with unequivocal phenomena, rather than
with the equivocal realities that are the stuff of entrepreneurship. Much of the task of
generating theory about entrepreneurship will be in understanding both worlds: emerging
and existing, and in thoughtfully probing how connections between these two worlds can
be made. We concur with Pfeffer (1982, p. 294):
Possibly with a greater sensitivity to the range of approaches and perspectives
available, greater awareness of the extent to which research and thinking about
organizations has been affected by the context in which such theory was developed
and the prevailing types and conditions of organizational and management problems,
and some reminders about various criteria by which social science theory is evaluated, we can collectively get back to the task of pruning the garden of unproductive
theory and growing some new, more useful varieties.
The garden of entrepreneurial theories is ready for a variety of seeds from many different
disciplines and perspectives. As our field emerges, it might begin to look more like a
weed patch, rather than a neatly cultivated garden. At this stage in our development,
"weediness" should be encouraged. The fundamental property of emergence, equivocality, will require entrepreneurship theorists to acquire and appreciate a broad array of
methodologies and theoretical approaches to understanding this phenomenon. In our
acquisition of theoretical requisite variety, we may not, at this stage, possess the wisdom
to accurately differentiate between weeds and flowers—those ideas that are intellectually
vapid versus those ideas that will prove to be useful. Only through continued discussion,
dialogue, and practice (both through empirical testing and actual use) can our theories
about the nature of emergence be cultivated.
