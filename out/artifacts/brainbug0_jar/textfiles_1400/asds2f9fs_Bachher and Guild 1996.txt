INVESTMENT CRITERIA USED BY INVESTORS

ABSTRACT

This study sought to advance understanding of the decision making criteria currently
used by Canadian equity investors to evaluate early stage technology based companies. Three
types of equity investors participated: business angels (BAs, n=20), private venture capitalists
(PVCs, n=20) and public venture capital funds (PVCFs, n=20). A total of 95 criteria were
derived from previous investment literature and these subsequently received a priori
assignment to one of five categories: (1) characteristics of the entrepreneur(s), (2)
characteristics of the market, (3) characteristics of the venture offering, (4) investor(s)
requirements and (5) characteristics of the investment proposal.

INTRODUCTION

Small technology based companies have become a dynamic backbone of most
developed economic systems. We define technology based companies as those companies
intending to commercialize a technology for the first time and thereby expecting to derive a
significant source of competitive advantage from the technology. Examples might include
software and biotechnology companies. Throughout this manuscript, when the term
‘company’ is referred to as the unit of analysis, it will be assumed to imply ventures which
are new and small -- and will not encompass firms which are established and large in size.
At the early stages, most technology based companies require access to sources of
outside capital (other than their own personal funds) for them to achieve their potential.
Unfortunately, one of the main difficulties that they face is obtaining the capital to aid
growth. A high proportion of the small companies do not make it past the early stages
simply because they can not find adequate venture capital [Sharwood, 1989]. Venture capital

<-----Page 2----->is broadly defined as capital which is not secured by assets and is invested in or loaned to a
company by an outside investor. It is often referred to as risk capital since it is not only
unsecured, but it generally lacks liquidity as well.
Entrepreneurs who are just starting out typically have very different needs than those
well established and ready to expand their companies. Many investors have found that their
own skills are better suited to helping one type of entrepreneur than another. As a result,
investors tend to define their investment preferences by stages in the company’s
development. The early stages encompass seed, start-up and first-stage, at each of which the
company has different requirements for financing [ACVCC, 1992].
Seed stage financing is normally provided to prove a concept and is typically used
for developing a prototype.
Start-up stage financing is provided to companies for use in product development
and initial marketing. Companies may be in the process of being organized or may
have been in business for a short while (usually a year or less), but have not yet sold
their product commercially.
First-stage financing is provided to companies that have expended their initial
capital and started to sell their product, but require additional funds to initiate full
commercial production and sales.
Many early stage technology based companies differ from most other new firms by
their lack of tangible resources. They begin with only the entrepreneur's intelligence and
drive as inventory [Roberts, 1990]. The assets in technology based companies may literally
“walk out at the end of the day.” With such intangible assets, many entrepreneurs approach
formal financial institutions as their first stop when shopping for capital. Unfortunately, due
to the lack of tangible collateral, their search is generally fruitless. Many financial
institutions simply do not want to take high risks and do not want to lend money t o
companies with no assets. They are primarily in the business of debt financing rather than
equity investing. The next possible source of capital that often comes to the mind of an
entrepreneur is ‘venture capital’ [Roberts, 1990]. Unfortunately, the bulk of investors
known as venture capitalists show a greater willingness to invest in ongoing firms, rather than
raw startups [Roberts, 1991].
Business Angels (BAs), also known as private or informal investors, are individuals,
aside from the entrepreneurs or their family and friends, who invest their own funds in
private companies. BAs are known to invest their time as well as money in ventures
[Wetzel, 1981] with the hope of nurturing them to a size and stage that alternate sources of
financing may be provided by larger venture capital players [Dal Cin, 1993]. Private Venture
Capitalists (PVCs), also known as professional or institutional investors, assume equity or
equity-type positions in private companies. On behalf of their professional venture capital
companies, they mostly participate along with the management of the companies they
invest in, often with the intent of developing the company to the point where an initial
public offering (IPO) is possible. Their investments are expected to be relatively long-term
(three to eight years). Public Venture Capital Funds (PVCFs) are similar to PVCs. The main
difference between the two types of investors is their source pool of capital. While PVCs are
funded by private institutions, all PVCFs consist primarily of government funding. In PVCFs,
the final decision to invest in an opportunity is made by a board of directors which typically
consists of individuals external to the PVCF. The investment managers are responsible for
screening investment opportunities. After evaluating a selective few that they feel will

<-----Page 3----->conform to the guidelines for investments, they present a summarized investment proposal
to the board for approval.
The objective of this study was to better understand the decision making criteria used
by Canadian equity investors when evaluating technology based companies seeking early stage
financing. Specifically, it focused on understanding the criteria used by the three primary
sources of equity capital for these companies in Canada: PVCs, PVCFs and BAs. To keep
within the focus of this study, only those Canadian were considered who have invested and do
invest in early stage technology based companies. We focus on the decision making criteria
used for equity investments in private companies, as opposed to publicly traded companies.
It has been argued that investing venture capital in private companies is different from equity
financing in publicly traded companies [Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984].
This study involved questioning Canadian equity investors on the importance of
specific decision making criteria they use when evaluating early stage technology based
companies. These criteria were grouped into five distinct categories, namely 1) general
characteristics of the entrepreneur(s), 2) characteristics of the market targeted by the
venture seeking capital, 3) characteristics of the venture offering (product or service), 4)
characteristics of the investment proposal from the venture to the investor(s) and lastly, 5)
the investor(s) requirements. Data were collected using survey questionnaires administered
through personal interviews with the three types of equity investors across Canada.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The activities of an equity investor can be described in the form of a multi-stage
decision making process. Researchers have studied the decision making process used by equity
investors when evaluating new ventures seeking financing [Wells, 1974], [Tyebjee and Bruno,
1984], [Silver, 1985], [Hall, 1989], [Schilit, 1991]. Their results tend to show that the
activities carried out by equity investors making investment decisions involve at least two
distinct stages: screening and evaluation. It seems highly probable that different criteria are
used at different stages of the decision making process. While some researchers have used
methodologies to capture the decision making criteria used at the various stages of the
process, others have studied the decision making criteria used generally by these investors.
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) outlined the activities of US venture capitalists as an
orderly process involving five sequential steps. In the deal screening stage, they identified a
broad range of screening criteria including: size of the investment, investment policy of the
venture capital firm, technology and market sector of the venture, geographic location of
the venture and stage of financing. They tested for use of 23 additional criteria in the deal
evaluation stage. The five main characteristics used by venture capitalists in evaluating
companies included: market attractiveness (represented by size, growth, and accessibility);
product differentiation (which combines the uniqueness of the product, the profit margin, and
the patentability); managerial capabilities; environmental threats; and finally, cash-out
potential (reflecting the venture capitalists’ ability to liquidate the investment).

<-----Page 4----->As a replication and extension of the study reported by Tyebjee and Bruno (1984),
MacMillan, Siegel and SubbaNarasimha (1985) studied the decision making criteria used by US
venture capitalists.
They classified 27 criteria into six groups: the entrepreneur’s
personality, entrepreneur’s experience, characteristics of the product or service,
characteristics of the market, financial considerations, and the venture team. The most
significant criteria were related to the entrepreneur and the team; protectability of the
product; market growth; and the required rate of return (identified as ten times the
investment within five to ten years). The authors also distinguished essential criteria; the
absence of or shortfall on any of these would result in rejection of the proposal regardless of
any other redeeming characteristics. Five of the ten criteria most commonly rated as
essential were associated with the entrepreneurs themselves: their capability for sustained
effort, demonstrated leadership, track record relevant to the venture, reaction to risk, and
capability of articulating the venture well.
Bogle and Reuber (1992) investigated issues involved in the financing of Canadian
biotechnology firms by Canadian venture capitalists. Their objective was to identify those
concerns which biotechnology firms might address to obtain venture capital financing. They
concluded that the ratings of the investment criteria from their study were consistent with
findings in cross-industry studies from the US. This work suggested that venture capitalists
approach biotechnology investments in much the same way as they approach other
investments, and that Canadian venture capitalists make decisions on bases that are similar t o
those used by US venture capitalists. They believed that investing in experienced, highquality people makes good business sense.
Hall and Hofer (1993) studied the decision making process used by US venture
capitalists when evaluating companies, and presented a refined set of stages which they
claimed comprise an improved process. Using semi-structured interviews and verbal protocol
analysis, they identified the criteria used in each of these stages. The two key criteria used by
venture capitalists for initial screening were fit of the company seeking financing with the
venture firm's lending guidelines and long-term growth and profitability of the industry in
which the proposed business will operate. In the proposal assessment, emerging key criteria
were: a) source of the business proposal (which played a role in the venture capitalists’
interest in the plan), and b) proposal previously reviewed by persons known and trusted by
the venture capitalist. Both criteria received a high level of interest. They found a lack of
importance attached to the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team and strategy of the
proposed venture during the early stages of the venture evaluation process. This was
contradictory to all other studies described previously.
We believed that replicating a single previous study in the area of venture capital
decision making was not sufficient for our case. Our study was focused on understanding the
decision making criteria used by equity investors when evaluating technology based
companies seeking early stage financing. We could locate little published literature that had
attempted to study this area. It was therefore deemed to be important to realize that, even
though the previous studies may have provided a direction for our area of research, we would
have to develop our criteria specific to the focus of this study.
Most previous studies requested the investors under study to evaluate the relative
importance of their decision making criteria. As the results obtained from these studies were
similar, we sought as much consistency as possible but with minor changes to the criteria list.
Prior studies did not elaborate the criteria that investors might use when evaluating the

<-----Page 5----->technology component of a company. Because of our focus, we derived criteria from
extensive work which has been done on new product and service formulation and on the
factors that determine the success of new products. Cooper (1988, 1990) has developed a
tool that can be used by companies when evaluating several product ideas. From a set of
prospective ideas, a company can choose only a selected few to invest their research and
development funds. We considered this to be analogous to the situation with venture
investors. The latter are evaluating technology based companies seeking early stage
financing whereas the former are evaluating new product or service concepts to invest in and
subsequently develop a company’s existing business. In reality, they are both investing
fundamentally in a new product or service idea. Cooper (1988) has identified criteria which
he believes should be considered when evaluating new product ideas, we therefore decided t o
merge his factors in creating our list of criteria.
A review of studies on investors’ decision making criteria revealed that the authors
have not attempted to specifically describe the criteria used by Canadian equity investors
when evaluating technology based companies seeking early stage financing. By Canadian
equity investors, we are referring to BAs and only those venture capitalists (private and
public) who invest in early stage technology based companies.
In his study on initial capital for the new technological enterprise, Roberts (1990)
recommended that “despite increasing numbers of studies on the decision processes of
venture capitalists ..., additional comparable research is needed on the decision criteria of
informal investors.” We could locate little published literature that described the decision
making process and criteria used by BAs. The research literature on this type of investor
primarily focuses on their characteristics and motivations for financing early stage
companies [Wetzel, 1983]. Considering that BAs are known to be a primary source of equity
capital for technology based companies at their early stages, we believe it is important t o
understand the criteria they use to evaluate these types of companies.
In Canada, some of the PVCs and most PVCFs invest in early stage technology based
companies. In the last decade, we have seen anecdotal evidence of PVCs slacking off from
investment in early stage technology based companies, and PVCFs picking up the slack t o
make this their focus. With the latter being more focused on making such investments, their
decision making criteria may vary from the former; such a mandate enables them to foster
development of the Canadian economy and this may motivate them to invest in early stage
technology based companies, ventures which the private citizens may not want to invest in.
On the other hand, most PVCs are mandated to seek a healthy rate of return to their private
shareholders. As a result, they may tend to restrict the amount of risk taken, since it is
private money on the line. Due to possible differences in motivation for funding and in
source of capital, we believe that PVCFs and PVCs may focus on different sets of criteria
when investing in early stage technology based companies.
In summary, to understand the current typical practice among Canadian equity
investors, we attempt to explore the research question below for three different types of
equity investors, namely Business Angels (BAs), Private Venture Capitalists (PVCs) and
Public Venture Capital Funds (PVCFs):
What are the categories of decision making criteria stressed most by the three types
of Canadian equity investors when evaluating technology based companies seeking
early stage financing ?

<-----Page 6----->METHOD

The method for this study followed the survey research approach. We used a
questionnaire administered through interviews. Quantitative methods were employed t o
analyze data obtained from closed-ended items in the survey questionnaire. Remarks made by
investors during the completion of the questionnaire were captured and summarized
qualitatively. In the following sections, we describe the samples and procedures used to gather
the data for our study.
Samples
Our study involved three sample groups, each of which represented a different type of
equity investor. They were BAs, PVCs and PVCFs. Within each group, 20 investors
completed the survey. Each of these sample groups will be discussed in turn. Despite the fact
that there are no public directories of BAs or records of their investment transactions, we
were able to identify these individuals through referrals from PVCs and PVCFs. The latter
were located through the membership directory of the Association of Canadian Venture
Capital Companies (ACVCC), which is easily accessible to the public. The most recent
edition of this directory (July 1993) as of the time of data collection was used. Using the
snowball sampling approach, within two months we were able to generate a database of 50
business angel investors across Canada. All PVCs interviewed were either the managing
partners, presidents, or chief executive officers of the venture capital companies. In each of
these companies, the senior executives use their own decision making criteria to evaluate a
company seeking early stage financing. The intent of the study was to collect data from
those individuals who were involved in evaluating and making actual investment decisions.
The sample of PVCs from which data were collected in this study approached 100% of the
population of potential Canadian PVCs that fall under the guidelines of the study. From the
ACVCC directory, a total of five companies were classified as crown corporations, each of
which obtain their primary pool of capital from the government. Investment managers of
these crown corporations were interviewed. From each of the PVCFs studied, more than one
individual was interviewed for his or her subjective opinions.
Procedures
This section describes the procedures used to gather data using the survey
questionnaire. All surveys were administered during an interview with the investor, and the
same questionnaire was used across all three investor types, in order to allow for meaningful
comparisons across the groups. Data were collected from a total of 60 equity investors. The
time required for completion was approximately one hour.
The investors were requested to consider a recent example of an investment proposal
from an early stage technology based venture that they had accepted to invest in. In order t o
increase consistency across the groups of investors, all key terms used in the survey were
defined. This included definitions for risk capital, seed stage financing, start-up stage
financing, first-stage financing and technology based companies.

<-----Page 7----->The investors began by identifying the characteristics of the investment proposal.
Next, we requested the investor to consider a list of decision making criteria they use when
evaluating technology based ventures at their early stages of development. These decision
making criteria were grouped into five categories: 1) General Characteristics of the
Entrepreneur(s) 2) Characteristics of the Market Targeted by the Venture 3) Characteristics
of the Venture Offering (Product or Service) 4) Investor(s) Requirements and 5)
Characteristics of the Investment Proposal from the Venture to the Investor(s).
All investors were requested to rank the five categories in order of importance t o
their overall decision making, with “first” signifying the most important category and
“fifth”, the least important. The investors were then presented with five different color
coded sheets arranged in the order of importance of the criteria as they had indicated. This
helped to ensure that they were answering questions pertaining to their most important
criteria first, hence capturing their motivation and interest.
They evaluated all 95 criteria from the five categories using a seven point Likert
scale -- an importance scale. The investors were requested to indicate the degree of
importance of each criteria to them at the time of investment, when deciding to accept the
investment proposal. A response of ‘1’ on this scale represented that the criteria was not
important, ‘7’ signified it was very important, and ‘4’ on this scale implied that the criteria
was not influential in their decision making. Investors also had an optional choice, N/A,
defined to imply that the criteria did not apply to that investment proposal.

RESULTS

Investors ranked each of the five categories of decision making criteria in order of
importance. Within each of the three types of investors, 20 subjects ranked the five
categories. A Friedman two-way analysis of variance by ranks was used for testing the null
hypothesis that the five categories were drawn from the same population. If the null
hypothesis is in fact true, then the distribution of ranks in each category would be a matter of
chance, and thus we would expect the ranks of ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’, ‘4’, and ‘5’ to appear in all
categories with about equal frequency. The table below summarizes the Friedman two-way
ANOVA test results [Siegel, 1956]. For each of the three types of investors, p<.05
(significance level), implying that the rank sums differ significantly across the five
categories.

In the table above, for a particular type of investor, as the rank sum increases, the
importance of the category decreases. Hence, a rank of (1) implies the category of decision
making criteria is most important to the investor, and (5) implies the category is least
important. The frequency responses were also used to rank the five categories for each of
the investor types. Identical results were obtained. For each criterion, the number of
investors who responded (N), the mean degree of importance (M), and the standard deviation
(SD) were calculated. Means range from (1) to (7), with (1) implying that the criterion is not
important to the investors’ decision making and (7) implying that the criterion is very
important to their decision making. For criteria with N<20, it implies that some of the
investors indicated that it did not apply to their decision making.
For each type of investor, we decided to classify their responses concerning degree of
importance of the criteria into four classes of varying importance. The rationale for setting
a priori guidelines was that working with the full 95 criteria would often be too cumbersome
and some indication of criteria salience would be useful. The following selection guidelines
were used.

In describing the results from the table above, it should be understood that none of
the investors will make a decision to invest on the basis of just one of these decision criteria.
As they have all indicated, they look at several things and it is typically a combination of
these that help them in deciding to either accept or reject an investment proposal. Even
though this combination varies between investment proposals, the general set of criteria that
the investors consider key and important were identified.

DISCUSSION

All three types of Canadian equity investors consider the general characteristics of
the entrepreneur(s) as most important when deciding to invest in an early stage technology
based company. This is not surprising because previous studies on the decision making
criteria of Canadian and US venture capitalists reveal similar results. Studies on the
characteristics of BAs in Canada and the US also conclude that these informal financiers
invest primarily in the abilities of the entrepreneurial team. In fact, it is the entrepreneurial
team that will eventually turn the business opportunity into reality, especially at the early
stages in a company. Regardless of how attractive any other factors may be, if the business
lacks a well balanced entrepreneurial team, it is unlikely to be successful.
As a group, BAs consider the characteristics of the venture offering (product or
service) as next in importance after the entrepreneurs themselves. This is followed by
characteristics of the market targeted by the venture. BAs are commonly regarded to be the
primary source of financing for early stage companies. At these stages, in a technology based
company, it is sometimes difficult to analyze the market being targeted by the venture, as
was indicated by many BAs during our interviews with them. Hence, their focus is primarily
on the venture offering because the company’s success in capturing a market in the future
relies on the successful development of the product or service. Therefore, they must pay a
higher degree of attention to characteristics of the venture offering as opposed to the

<-----Page 12----->market. As described by one of the BAs: “At the seed stage, all we want to know is that there
is an excellent product idea. We feel most comfortable if we create the market.”
In contrast to BAs, PVCs as a group tended to consider the characteristics of the
market being targeted by the venture as being of greater importance than characteristics of
the venture offering. Most PVCs are mandated by their venture capital firm to provide its
shareholders with a rate of return on the investment between 25% and 40%. As a result,
their primary objective becomes seeking investments in companies which can provide this
sort of return. This may explain why PVCs are cautious about the risk to return ratio in the
investment opportunity. One of the many ways in which they can evaluate this ratio is by
understanding the characteristics of the market, especially the growth rate and size. Whereas
BAs are excited by the product or service, PVCs are attracted more by the market being
targeted by the venture. One of the PVCs indicated; “The first thing we look for is the
market. If its not there, we don’t invest.” PVCFs are similar to PVCs in their consideration
of the market and venture offering. This may not be surprising since both of them are
venture capitalists, a salient difference being the role of shareholders in the corporation for
the private venture capital companies.
BAs and PVCs rank investor(s) requirements as more important than characteristics
of the investment proposal from the venture. The results described in this study are for the
criteria used at the proposal evaluation stage of the decision making process used by
investors. The business plan has already successfully passed through the proposal screening
phase, and is therefore not as important later on in the process. Instead, they are more
concerned about the specifics within the plan. PVCFs show a reversal in importance of these
two categories. As crown corporations, their mandate is to foster the economic climate in
Canada by investing in companies that otherwise have difficulty in obtaining financing from
the traditional sources. Some of the PVCFs invest only in early stage technology based
companies. Most PVCFs who conduct the due diligence process use the business plan as their
primary tool in evaluating the investment opportunity. Therefore, it is crucial that the
document presented by entrepreneurs to this group of investors is well prepared and covers all
the aspects required by the PVCFs.
PVCs are attracted to early stage technology based companies which can fulfill the
requirements of their venture capital firm. At the time of making an investment, both PVCs
and PVCFs consider it key to be able to determine an exit strategy. This is reflected in their
response to importance of cash out potential expected by the investor(s) (e.g. going public).
PVCs also regard as key that they can determine the anticipated rate of return on the
investment and degree of market risk involved with the investment opportunity. BAs are
less concerned that they can fulfill their requirements at the time of making an investment.
As one BA indicated, “We invest as a hobby and are helping other entrepreneurs. It is very
difficult for us to determine things like the expected rate of return, degree of market risk, and
cash out potential at the early stages.” Another BA opined that: “If we are successful, we
invest again. If we lose money in one investment, we get very cautious with the next one,
even if it turns out to be a Bill Gates Deal. Its a game. We can’t always sit down and
understand the outcome.”
This study provides an understanding of the decision making criteria used currently by
Canadian equity investors to evaluate technology based companies seeking early stages of
financing (seed, start-up or first stages). Three different types of equity investors were
studied: Business Angels (BAs), Private Venture Capitalists (PVCs) and Public Venture Capital

<-----Page 13----->Funds (PVCFs). Seeking risk capital for early stage technology based companies can be made
easier if entrepreneurs have an understanding of what the investors are looking for. This
study has provided this understanding and will be of benefit to entrepreneurs seeking risk
capital for their technology based companies.
