Abstract
Little is known about the effect that cultural media has in influencing attitudes and behaviours
towards entrepreneurship. In addressing this research gap this article employs a neologism –
‘entre-tainment’ – briefly defined as televisual media that stage and perform entrepreneurship
for entertainment purposes. This study surveyed university students to test three hypotheses
which examine the relationship between perceptions of ‘entre-tainment’ and entrepreneurial
intent (multiple regression model using ordinary least squares). The findings conclude that
there is a positive relationship between the skills that students believe they ascertain when
they watch ‘entre-tainment’, and entrepreneurial intention. Furthermore, the social legitimacy
that they attach to this cultural media has a similar positive effect. Finally, the greater the social
legitimacy attached to ‘entre-tainment’, the stronger the relationship between perceived skills
and entrepreneurial intention. The analysis focuses on the broader implications of these findings
of potential effects of entre-tainment in transmitting narrow messages of what it means to
behave entrepreneurially.

Introduction
Since the days of the ‘robber barons’ – Vanderbilt, Rockefeller and Carnegie – famous entrepreneurs have been the focus of newspapers, books and film. Following the rise in the early 1980s of
what has become a global culture of enterprise (Keat and Abercrombie, 1990), the popular media
have intensified this interest such that for many, figures such as Richard Branson, Alan Sugar and
Donald Trump have come to stand for ‘the entrepreneur’. Doing entrepreneurship has even
become the context for elaborate game shows such as Dragons’ Den, where successful businesspeople, with established entrepreneurial dynasties, become celebrity entrepreneurs worthy of
attention and respect.
Scholarly interest from within entrepreneurship in such entrepreneurially-focused popular culture has not been extensive. Studies either have drawn tentative empirical conclusions on how the
media influences entrepreneurial behaviour from data excavated from general surveys (Hindle and
Klyver, 2007; Levie et al., 2010), or focused on the representation of culture and media more
directly from a cultural studies perspective (Boyle, 2008). There is an obvious practical imperative
for more detailed research in this area: policymakers are interested in understanding the potential
value of televisual entertainment in stimulating entrepreneurship (European Commission, 2007).
Theoretically there have been those that have emphasised the importance of the ‘social situation’
within which entrepreneurs operate, including ‘what is done towards them, when they are constructing and developing businesses – how they interact, what sorts of symbols and discourses
circulate within particular contexts’ (Goss, 2008: 133). Clearly, televisual media would form a
cultural aspect of this context. Other studies (Audretch, 2007; Gavron, 1998) have highlighted the
important role of ideologies in generating more entrepreneurially dynamic societies, and their
potentially negative effects (Ogbor, 2000). Again, television is a conduit through which such ideologies can be communicated.
The present study offers data derived from a detailed bespoke survey directly concerned with
the influence of entrepreneurially specific cultural media, for which the authors have coined a
neologism: ‘entre-tainment’ (Down, 2010). We do this in order to create a distinct conceptual and
empirical object which, we hope, will act as a conceptual attractor (Steyaert, 2007). A key question
in this research is: if entrepreneurial culture, and our specific focus, entre-tainment, is indeed
potentially transformative and generative of entrepreneurial ideology, how are we to know if and
how individuals become more entrepreneurially oriented or skilled as a result of engaging with
such cultural artefacts?
The following analysis examines the skills that individuals perceive to learn by watching
Dragons’ Den, and the social legitimacy that they attach to entre-tainment more generally. This
study makes two assumptions (which also form the basis of the hypotheses). First, if a person
thinks they have the necessary skills to start a business, they are more likely to do so. Second, this
propensity is enhanced further if they also perceive entre-tainment to be socially legitimate. That
is, this study seeks to investigate if entre-tainment has an effect on these factors that influence
entrepreneurial intention, which we understand as a commonly used proxy for understanding and
predicting the degree of entrepreneurial activity (Engle et al., 2010; Thompson, 2009). In this skills
and social legitimacy are being treated in a similar manner to self-efficacy and the opinions of
significant others, which have been shown to be strong predictors of entrepreneurial intention
(Armitage and Conner, 2001; Conner and Armitage, 1998).
This empirical contribution adds depth to the breadth already provided through analyses of
generic surveys such as the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) (Hindle and Klyver, 2007;
Levie et al., 2010). These previous studies (described more fully below) adopt a descriptive
approach. Through the regressions run on this study’s data it is possible to infer relationships

between social legitimacy, entrepreneurial skills and intentions in more detail. Specifically, the
study differentiates televisual, entertainment-based media which depicts entrepreneurial activity
from the study of other cultural signifiers such as newspapers (Nicholson and Anderson, 2005;
Radu and Redien-Collot, 2008), which are amalgamated in the more generic studies (Hindle and
Klyver, 2007; Levie et al., 2010). Televisual media are dominant cultural forms that serve to transmit enterprise discourses and ideology (Ogbor, 2000; Rehn, 2008), yet few studies have sought to
investigate empirically the effect that entre-tainment might have on beliefs or attitudes (i.e. social
legitimacy), skills and behaviour. Moreover, the discussion that emerges from the empirical findings on the influence of entre-tainment on entrepreneurial behaviours serves to push this emerging
interdisciplinary dialogue along. The broader aim is to use the empirical study as a sounding board
to make a conceptual contribution to understanding the intersection of entrepreneurship and culture. More practically, this research builds understanding about the effectiveness or otherwise of
entre-tainment as a means by which to transfer or reinforce entrepreneurial skills.
The rest of the article embeds more thoroughly the notion of entre-tainment with existing
research on culture and entrepreneurship, and draws on concepts and theories from the social sciences and cultural studies to ground the neologism. It then discusses the methodological procedures used in designing and administering the survey, and analysing the survey data, before
presenting the findings. The discussion deals with the contribution of this research in more detail
and elaborates further about other empirical questions of interest concerning the intersection of
televisual culture and the study of entrepreneurship. Finally, some of the theoretical and practical
implications for entrepreneurship more generally are explored and potential avenues for future
research advanced.

Literature review
Entre-tainment and entrepreneurial behaviour
Our interest in culture, a large and very well-swept intellectual corner – to misapply the object of
Geertz’s (1973) useful metaphor – is focused mainly on popular culture. Of course, popular culture
is a contested term (Storey, 2008), but as this study is concerned mainly with the role of specific
television programmes (e.g. Dragons’ Den), the theoretical nuances debated by cultural theorists
are not pertinent. It is not the present object of analysis, and hence we see popular culture descriptively and plainly as culture – in the sense of ‘signifying practices’ (Storey, 2008: 2), the production
and consumption of art, writing and so forth – that is ‘widely favoured or well liked by many
people’ (2008: 5): a synonym for mass culture.
That said, it is worth considering how entrepreneurship has approached culture more generally, in order to achieve this study’s subsidiary aim of using entre-tainment as a conceptual
attractor to examine the intersection of culture and entrepreneurship more broadly. The underlying approach to culture adopted here is to see it as a process of symbolic and interpretive action
manifested in a particular way of life. Thus, despite the methodological reductionism applied in
the empirical analysis reported in this article, we are keen to situate broader discussion of the
intersection of culture and entrepreneurship in a view that accepts that ‘culture is not a power,
something to which social events, behaviours, institutions, or processes can be causally attributed; it is a context, something within which they can be intelligibly – that is, thickly – described’
(Geertz, 1973: 14).
What this means is that when we attribute entre-tainment as influencing (or not) individual
values, beliefs and actions, what we are actually claiming is that as individuals watch, think about
and discuss such cultural artefacts or ‘signs’, they are making complex context-bound and

relationally contingent interpretations based on their place in their culture, their particular way of
life. How knowledge about business and entrepreneurial skills and the perceived social legitimacy
of entre-tainment – the specific empirical foci in this article – are transmitted or signified, need to
be seen against this conceptual background. Thus, culture in both these senses (descriptive and
contextual) intersect in the broader purpose of this study, if not its empirical contribution.
There have been only limited attempts to research the connections between Regarding popular
culture and entrepreneurial behaviour; this is something that the European Commission, Enterprise
and Industry Directorate-General acknowledged: ‘so far not much is known about the influence of
the media on occupational choices or on the attitudes towards entrepreneurship’ (2007: 4). It is
assumed here that entrepreneurship, as it is represented and signified by popular culture, has strong
potential for promoting enterprise, with policymakers seeking to see an explicit move away from
depicting entrepreneurs as ‘crooks and villains’ (European Commission, 2007: 34), and towards
representations showing entrepreneurship as a worthwhile and respectable career choice. There has
been some research on this issue. Hang and Weezel’s (2007) review of media and entrepreneurship
highlight three areas on which research has concentrated. First, there have been studies of entrepreneurship as a process within the media industries itself (Kelly and Boyle, 2011). Second, entrepreneurship as it is represented in, and disseminated through, the media. Studies such as those by Radu
and Redien-Collot (2008) and Nicholson and Anderson (2005) analyse popular press discourse
with a view to investigating how entrepreneurs and the entrepreneurial act are represented and
socially constructed (Anderson and Warren, 2011). Boyle (2009) has tracked the change in business and entrepreneurial representations on British television, and notes that there has been an
increase in the number of factual television programmes about business and entrepreneurship.
These two themes are peripheral to the interests of the present study and do not address the third
theme that Hang and Weezel identify: that is, the role that media plays in influencing entrepreneurial activity. Here, they conclude that ‘few efforts have been made to investigate how media affect
the entrepreneurship phenomena’ (2007: 17).
There have been studies which have addressed the broader relationship between business and
popular culture. In particular, Rehn (2008) makes an important theoretical contribution, coining a
more encompassing neologism, ‘econo-tainment’ (2008: 769), which refers to the more general
depiction of business in popular culture. Although not focused on entrepreneurship, his recognition
that popular culture should not be seen as uni-directional, with viewers consuming culture solely
as it is intended by producers – as a causally attributed power effecting behaviour – goes to the core
of any attempt to understand how television programmes such as Dragons’ Den might influence
behaviour. The audience (viewer, reader, or listener) plays an active role in interpreting and mediating any messages in the context of their particular way of life. Thus, to be clear, a middle-class,
business management graduate, who has aspirations to start a business and is seed-funded by
wealthy entrepreneur parents, is likely to view such programmes differently from a working-class,
non-university educated mechanic who, after serving an apprenticeship, decided to work for himself. We bring our own values and ideas to whatever we read and watch, and what goes on in this
mediation process is as much to do about our own values (such as the influence of family, friendship, social background, education, etc.) as it is to do with what the media presents. Rehn (2008)
argues that this two-way relationship is overlooked in business studies, and calls for more academic scrutiny into the influence that popular culture has upon the economy.
Work by Boyle and colleagues addresses the link between popular culture and entrepreneurship. Specifically, in relation to the aims of the present study, Boyle and Kelly ask audiences
about ‘their levels of engagement with business on television, their knowledge and understanding of the term entrepreneur and the relationship between television representations of business

<-----Page 5----->5

Swail et al.	

and entrepreneurship and the experiences that audiences themselves may bring to these programmes’ (2012: 3), using an audience research methodology. They found that responses varied
according to audience stages of entrepreneurial activity and experience. More established business owners view ‘entre-tainment’ media as entertaining and humorous, and nascent entrepreneurs see it as more a positive educational influence in terms of the skills and business ‘tips’ that
they may pick up.
Finally, there have been two important but limited studies of GEM data addressing the influence
of the media on entrepreneurial behaviour (Hindle and Klyver, 2007; Levie et al., 2010). Hindle
and Klyver (2007) used GEM data to track ‘stories about successful entrepreneurs, conveyed in
mass media’ (2007: 217). They argued that the mass media are capable only of reinforcing existing
audience values, and are not capable of changing or inverting such values. This means that such
success stories in the media only appeared to encourage those already taking part in entrepreneurial
activity. However, this conclusion is based on rather a narrow conceptualisation of mass media,
based on a single question related to the concept of role models and stories about successful entrepreneurs: ‘In your country, do the public media often have stories about successful new businesses?’ Similarly, Levie et al.’s (2010) analysis, using a longitudinal dataset combining the UK
GEM 2009 and a media-specific follow-up survey, found that ‘media coverage tends to reinforce
existing values and desires rather than create new or different values’ (2010: 3). This study, concluded that TV business reality programmes tend not to trigger actual entrepreneurial intentions or
action directly, and that the discernible effects are considerably lower than that of family, friends,
work colleagues and education and training in university or college. However, they do have ‘a
positive effect on social norms and values and thereby influence both the desirability and feasibility of entrepreneurship. In this sense, they do, albeit indirectly, influence actual patterns of entrepreneurship’ (2010: 3).
The present study looks to deepen the content and further theoretical discussion when
addressing culture and entrepreneurship. Both studies described above are limited by their use
of a narrow ‘media stories’ measures for culture. They perform only a descriptive analysis,
whereas the present study uses more detailed psychometric measures and inferential analysis.
Compared with the breadth achieved by these previous studies, empirically this article contributes a degree of depth in terms of the content of culture. It examines the content of culture and
entre-tainment through three main hypotheses that are tested in a survey. The article builds on
the assumption sketched above about the link between skills, social legitimacy and entrepreneurial intention.

Hypotheses
Impact of perceived skills on entrepreneurial intention
Radu and Redien-Collot (2008) argue that the media impact on efficacy and beliefs about the personal skills required to become a successful entrepreneur may increase or decrease feasibility
perceptions. This implies that programmes such as Dragons’ Den have the potential to shape feasibility expectation positively or negatively. This is reflected also in how Down (2010) emphasised
that through their ‘reality’ format, entre-tainment programmes ‘are essentially etiquette guides,
about how to be and behave in particular social contexts. Dragons’ Den shows people – both participant and viewer – what, and what not, to do in order to be a successful entrepreneur’ (2010:
185). Kelly and Boyle (2011) argue something similar when they conclude that the combined
entertainment or education focus of such programmes transmits quite detailed information about

<-----Page 6----->6

the fundamentals of business start-up. Consequently, this study seeks to explore whether the tacit
transfer of knowledge and skill through viewing entre-tainment programmes such as Dragons’ Den
results in increased entrepreneurial intention, which leads to the first hypothesis:
H1: There is a positive relationship between the skills which individuals believe they ascertain when
watching entre-tainment and entrepreneurial intention.

Impact of social legitimacy on entrepreneurial intention
Studies by Rehn (2008) and Boyle (2009; Boyle and Kelly, 2012) imply a strong link between the
way that business media is produced, interpreted and consumed, and perceptions of legitimacy and
significance among viewers. Moreover, research into entrepreneurial intentions shows that the
extent to which individuals feel motivated to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities will be reflected
in their belief that entrepreneurship is socially acceptable, and that entrepreneurs themselves are
respected members of the community (Down, 2010; Liñan et al., 2011; Reynolds et al., 2000).
Studies showing that countries value entrepreneurship differently demonstrate variability in perceived social legitimacy. For example, Fayolle et al. (2010) have shown that American culture
values entrepreneurship more than French or Scandinavian culture. Positive cultural representations of entrepreneurship are likely to both reflect and reproduce such perceptions. As well as
national and regional variability, it can be assumed that individuals will differ in the manner in
which they internalise and interpret entre-tainment based on their own backgrounds, values and
beliefs. This variability of social legitimacy is apparent also in a recent study by Drakopoulou
Dodd et al. (2013). They explored the positive and negative connotations associated with metaphors of entrepreneurship across five European countries, and found that entrepreneurship was
admired almost universally. However, they also found variation between countries, with the UK
and Ireland having a more positive outlook than Greece, for example. As popular media representations are likely to play an important role in creating and reproducing such metaphors (Langowitz
and Morgan, 2003), we can see that ‘the media may render entrepreneurship as more or less desirable, due to [its] impact on acceptability and legitimacy beliefs about entrepreneurs and their dayto-day actions’ (Radu and Redien-Collot, 2008: 261). The present study views entre-tainment as a
subset of popular media that will tend to impact positively on the degree of acceptance and legitimacy that individuals attach, both to the entrepreneur and to the practice of entrepreneuring in
societies. Of course, this assumption also underpins political interest in encouraging positive popular representations of enterprise (European Commission, 2007). Consequently, given that the social
legitimacy of entre-tainment for its viewers forms a cornerstone of the present study, the second
hypothesis states that:
H2: There is a positive relationship between the associated social legitimacy attached to entre-tainment
and entrepreneurial intention.

Moderating effect of social legitimacy on the effect of perceived skills
This article is based on the premise that the social legitimacy attached to entre-tainment facilitates
the formation of entrepreneurial intentions, by enhancing the effect of perceived skills on entrepreneurial intention. In addition, it argues that if an individual perceives entre-tainment as socially
legitimate and worthwhile, they will be more receptive to its content. Subsequently, they perceive
that when they view Dragons’ Den, they are learning something of value, even though they may

<-----Page 7----->7

Swail et al.	

not be able to determine exactly what they are learning. Rather, learning occurs implicitly through
a process which Claxton (1998) refers to as ‘osmosis’. This learning by osmosis demonstrates to
viewers how entrepreneurship should be done, more so than those who do not rate such programmes or further still, who believe that they are not beneficial to society at large. In essence, this
study views entre-tainment as the stage where ‘entrepreneuring’ is performed in front of a captive
audience. The degree to which viewers value what they observe also may influence their assessment of perceived skills developed. Therefore, given the hypotheses advanced above, this study
further predicts that these variables will have a mutually beneficial affect on entrepreneurial intention, which leads to the third hypothesis:
H3: The greater the social legitimacy attached to entre-tainment, the stronger the relationship between
perceived skills and entrepreneurial intention.

Method
Data collection
The data were collected by administering a survey instrument to all students at a UK university.
The authors acknowledge that prior studies on entrepreneurial intentions often are criticised for
being overly reliant on data collected from university students (McGee et al., 2009). Nonetheless,
to employ the university student as the unit of analysis was deliberate because they are the focus of
particular policy interest: the highly educated young. It is students in higher education that carry
the hopes of those that seek to build more entrepreneurially dynamic societies (Gavron, 1998). It is
these individuals who are increasingly exposed to enterprise pedagogy; with continuing structural
shifts in labour markets, and declining numbers and quality of traditional employment, there is an
expectation that forms of self-employment will become increasingly important to highly-skilled
graduates (European Commission, 2007).
Prior to administering the survey, care was taken to pilot the instrument with a small group of
students, researchers and other experts who offered feedback and advice. The survey was emailed to
the student population in November 2010 (a follow-up reminder email was sent in December 2010),
totalling 21,218 across undergraduate and postgraduate levels, including resident UK students and
international students. Of the mailout, 960 responses were received: a response rate of 4.5 percent.
In order to examine potential sampling bias, archival analysis was employed (Rogelberg and
Stanton, 2007) to compare the key characteristics of the respondents (gender, student discipline,
level and status) with the entire sampling frame. There was some response bias in relation to gender and student level, with a higher percentage of female students answering the questionnaire
(60:40%) when the university population distribution is 49 percent male, 51 percent female. In
addition, the largest discrepancy is in relation to undergraduate and postgraduate students, with
more postgraduate answering the survey (59:41%), when the university population distribution is
the opposite at 29:71 percent. Therefore, respective control variables were included in the analyses.
Since it is not the authors’ intention to generate representative descriptive statistics, but to explore
and test theoretical relationships, minor response biases are not considered overly problematic.

Measures
Response variable. The response variable in the analysis is entrepreneurial intention, which was
measured using Thompson’s (2009) Individual Entrepreneurial Intention Scale. This six-item scale

<-----Page 8----->8

was considered to be more versatile for the purposes of the present study than other available measurements of entrepreneurial intent (see Chen et al., 1998; Krueger et al., 2000; Lee and Wong,
2004), because it captures not only an individual’s interest in entrepreneurship, but also their
involvement in different activities, signalling a serious interest in starting a business. The Appendix
provides a full list of scale items.
Explanatory variables. The first explanatory variable in the analysis is the skills that the respondent perceives to learn by watching Dragons’ Den. It is assumed that when viewing Dragons’ Den,
the viewer is exposed to key entrepreneurial behaviours (such as communicating a business idea,
evaluating risk and so on) imparting tacit knowledge and potentially resulting in learning taking
place. A range of skills that viewers may possibly observe on the programme were considered, and
a list of 11 Likert-style items (see Appendix) was developed accordingly. It is important to note that
this study is measuring the perception of, rather than actual skills learned, and that it shares the
assumptions made by those investigating entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Chen et al., 1998; Wilson
et al., 2007), in that it considers the higher the agreement with perceived skill, the higher the entrepreneurial intent.
The second explanatory variable is the perceived social legitimacy of entre-tainment, which this
study measures with four items developed by the authors (see Appendix). The items in this scale
relate to the extent to which participants consider that entre-tainment is a positive influence in
British society in terms of encouraging entrepreneurship and positively impacting the economy. It
is considered that agreement with these items indicate a degree of acceptance and legitimacy
attached to the phenomenon of entre-tainment.
Control variables. The analysis includes a number of control variables in order to adjust the
model for factors that might influence the relationships between the explanatory and the response
variables. The first control variable is the respondent’s sex, which is included in the regression
model as a dummy with female coded as 1. The second control measure is the student’s country
of origin, measured as a dummy where domestic students are coded as 0 and international students
as 1. The third control variable distinguishes between undergraduate and postgraduate students,
so that postgraduate students are coded as 1 in the dummy. The fourth control variable captures
whether the respondent knows an entrepreneur personally. The final control measure denotes
whether the respondent has studied a module or course in enterprise, entrepreneurship or small
business.
Inclusion of these particular control variables was determined by both good practice evidence
from previous studies and common-sense considerations. First, it is acknowledged in the literature that females have both a lower propensity for embarking on entrepreneurship and lower
entrepreneurial self-efficacy (Chen et al., 1998; Kickul et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2004, 2007).
Therefore, it was considered that gender may affect entrepreneurial intention as well as perceived
skill variables. Second, following the previous research discussed above (e.g. Fayolle et al.,
2010), it was thought prudent to consider the country of origin, as language and other cultural
factors will influence the manner in which entre-tainment is interpreted and how subsequent opinions are formed. Furthermore, despite residing in the UK at the time the study was conducted, it
was assumed that exposure to ‘entre-tainment’ may be less for international students than UK
students. Third, distinguishing between undergraduate and postgraduate was deemed sensible, as
it was considered that knowledge, maturity and attitudes might be affected with increased exposure to further education, which in turn may influence the relationships between the variables.
Finally, knowing an entrepreneur and studying entrepreneurship has been shown to correlate with
entrepreneurial intent (Cox et al., 2002; Thompson, 2009), thus justifying inclusion of the fourth
and fifth dummy variables.

Factor analysis and descriptive statistics
The response variable and both explanatory variables constitute factors that comprise multiple
items. Before computing index scores and proceeding to regression analysis, the three measurement scales were subjected to a purification process. An exploratory principal components analysis
with direct oblimin rotation results in three factors that explain 59 percent of the variance in the
data. The rotated solution shows that all 11 items measuring perceived skills load on the first factor
(loadings 0.66–0.85); the four items that measure the social legitimacy of entre-tainment load on
the second factor (loadings 0.77–0.82); and all items that belong to the entrepreneurial intention
scale load on the third factor (loadings 0.65–0.89). No item cross-loads on another factor with a
loading higher than 0.15.
A subsequently performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) suggested the elimination of one
item in the entrepreneurial intention scale due to a low loading (<0.5), and one item in the perceived skills scale due to heavy correlations with other items in the scale (see Appendix). With
these modifications, all remaining indicators load significantly (0.1% level) on their intended constructs, and the conventional fit indices suggest a satisfactory fit between the model and the data:
the comparative fit index (CFI) is 0.954, which meets the recommended minimum of 0.95; the root
mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) is 0.056, which is below the recommended maximum of .06; and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) is 0.039, which is below the
recommended maximum of 0.08 (Hu and Bentler, 1999).
Table 1 summarises the results of the CFA and provides a number of additional indices for scale
reliability. For all three measurement scales, the composite reliability and Cronbach’s alpha scores
are above the recommended threshold of 0.7 (Chin, 1998; Nunnally, 1978). Similarly, the average
variance extracted (AVE) values for all constructs exceeding the recommended minimum of 0.5
suggest that the indicators explain more of each construct than other, external influences (Fornell
and Larcker, 1981), which indicates good convergent validity. The AVE also serves as a measure
of discriminant validity: if the square root of a construct’s AVE exceeds its correlation with the
other latent constructs in the CFA model, the model has good discriminant validity (Fornell and
Larcker, 1981). The present CFA fulfils this criterion: the square roots of the AVE scores range
from 0.72 to 0.74, while the respective correlation coefficients range from 0.33 to 0.60. Against
this backdrop, the authors concluded satisfactory reliability and validity for the measurement
scales and computed indices for each of them by averaging the item scores.
Table 2 displays the means, standard deviations and intercorrelations between all variables in
the regression model. The correlations are moderate, and thus do not suggest serious multicollinearity. The variation inflation factor (VIF) scores in the regression analysis support this conclusion, as the highest VIF score of 1.6 is below the conventional threshold of 10 for serious
multicollinearity.

Data analysis
For hypothesis testing, a multiple regression model was estimated using the ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimator with heteroskedasticity-consistent (robust) standard errors. The model estimation
process involves the following three steps. The first estimation step regresses entrepreneurial
intentions on both explanatory variables in order to examine the direct effects of these variables on
the dependent variable without additional covariates influencing the results (Model 1 in Table 3).
The estimates show that both explanatory variables have a positive and significant effect on entrepreneurial intentions. Hence, H1 and H2 are supported.

Before proceeding to the next step, it was ensured that these significant effects were not due to
common method variance, which is a potential problem with these data because the data for all
variables in each observation were collected with the same research instrument at the same time,
using the same informant. In order to control for the effect of common method variance, Model 1
was estimated as a structural equation model, with all constructs modelled as latent variables, and
included a single, unmeasured, latent method factor in the model specification. This procedure controls for systematic variance among the items associated with the three latent variables (entrepreneurial intention, perceived skills and social legitimacy) in the model by adding a first-order factor
with all of the said items as indicators (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The model has satisfactory fit (CFI

= 0.957; RMSEA = 0.057; SRMR = 0.031), and the maximum-likelihood estimates are comparable
with Model 1 in Table 3, even in the presence of the method factor. Perceived skills has a positive
effect on entrepreneurial intentions at the 0.1 percent significance level, and the coefficient for
social legitimacy is positive and significant at the 5 percent level. Therefore, it was deemed safe to
continue to further steps of the regression analysis, which is a more flexible analytical technique for
estimating interactions between continuous variables than structural equation modelling.
The second step in the estimation process adds the interaction between the two explanatory
variables into the model specification. Model 2 with Table 3 shows that the interaction term is positive and significant. The positive interaction term implies that when social legitimacy is high, the
effect of perceived skills on entrepreneurial intention becomes stronger than when social legitimacy is low. Before graphing with the interaction effect, the control variables were added to the
equation in order to estimate whether they modify the previously estimated relationships. The
estimates in Model 3 in Table 3 show that the previously estimated effects remain significant also
in the presence of the control variables.
Finally, the interaction effect based on the estimates in Model 3 was graphed (Table 3). Figure 1
illustrates the marginal effect of perceived skills at different levels of social legitimacy. Since the
variables are mean-centred, social legitimacy is at its sample mean when its value is zero. The illustration shows that the marginal effect of perceived skills is higher if the person also rates the social
legitimacy of entre-tainment highly. An examination of the confidence intervals reveals that perceived skills have a statistically significant and positive effect on entrepreneurial intention only when
social legitimacy is greater than or equal to approximately 1.3 units below its sample mean (i.e.
greater than or equal to 2.3, on a scale from 1–5). That is, at low levels of social legitimacy, perceived
skills do not exert a significant effect on entrepreneurial intention. This finding supports H3.

Discussion
It is evident that individuals who watch entre-tainment television programmes perceive that they
are gaining pedagogic value, and as a result have more positive perceptions of an entrepreneurial

career (H1). Through observing the staged successes and failures of contestants, the viewer believes
that they are learning effective ways of doing entrepreneurship, such as communicating business
ideas, evaluating risk and how to negotiate effectively.
However, what are they really learning? These programmes are aired primarily to entertain.
They are also highly selective in the sorts of business activity depicted; nonetheless, this does not
imply that they are not of value in terms of the implicit knowledge accrued, as this study’s findings
have shown. Formulating and delivering a venture capital pitch is not an everyday entrepreneurial
practice (Jarvis, 2006), but is a core activity in Dragons’ Den. In addition, these programmes advocate and promote a highly aspirational form of entrepreneurship that focuses on high growth and
profit, as opposed to the more modest income-generating reality for the vast majority of businesses. As a result, if entre-tainment is taken seriously as a pedagogic vehicle, the risk is that a
skewed and partial set of skills may be developed among its viewers.
This analysis has shown that if individuals perceive these programmes to be socially legitimate,
they will be more predisposed to launching a business (H2). In this context, these programmes provide a platform for the promotion of the entrepreneurial ideal. Thus entre-tainment, like all cultural
artefacts, is a vehicle for the transmission of ideologies, beliefs and values (Ogbor, 2000), which in
this case positively influences entrepreneurial intent. These programmes take a strong, positive
stance in support of the legitimacy of a particular form of entrepreneurship, by judging people on
whether or not they fit an entrepreneurial ideal. Furthermore, it is suggested that by showcasing a
distinct dichotomy between winners and losers, entre-tainment celebrates a certain truncated set of
socially legitimate behaviours. The viewer – that is, the potential entrepreneur – is presented only a
narrow window within which to view what it means to be successful. As a result, those who are
equipped with both the ‘right’ personality and idea to succeed are considered winners, whereas those
who do not fit the entrepreneurial ideal are portrayed as losers, often whose lack of mastery is

ridiculed. Moreover, these hyperbolic, polar distinctions between winners and losers misrepresent
what is in fact a matter of degree. The reality of entrepreneurship is that individuals succeed to varying extents. Failure is often the result of a number of culminating factors, both internal and external,
which may or may not include idea viability and personal ability (Cope, 2010).
Building on the supported hypothesis (H2), that positive perceptions of the social legitimacy of
entre-tainment have a positive effect on entrepreneurial intention, the final hypothesis (H3)
explored the moderating effect of social legitimacy on the effect of perceived skills. That is, if from
the outset, an individual has more positive pre-conceptions of entre-tainment as an effective stimulus for encouraging entrepreneurial action and growing the UK economy, will the skills they learn
when watching Dragons’ Den influence entrepreneurial intent more strongly? The analysis in this
study shows this to be the case.
Although, unsurprisingly, there were individuals in the study sample who showed such enthusiasm for both the values and subsequent learning gained through watching Dragons’ Den, are we at
risk of producing a group of enterprising neophytes who may well be surprised, should they actually start a business, when they are faced with the mundane realities of everyday business ownership? If programme-makers are going to conflate entertaining with educating (Kelly and Boyle,
2011), then policymakers need to be aware of the implications of individuals merging these activities and the messages that they convey. The risk is that with increased entrepreneurial intent these
individuals may embark on entrepreneurship with a heightened sense of optimism and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. In the longer term this could result in a negative effect on overall entrepreneurial
activity. Young individuals who start their businesses encouraged by positive perceptions of entretainment, only to fail, might be wary of starting businesses later on in their careers when they have
accrued actual, as opposed to perceived, skills by virtue of increased human and social capital
(Leitch et al., 2012).

Conclusion
It is evident from the present study that entre-tainment plays a significant role in shaping attitudes
and intentions of individuals towards entrepreneurship. However, it is acknowledged that entretainment reflects only a small part of wider cultural influences, and that this study truncates culture
to a uni-directional phenomenon due to the methodological reductionism employed. The results
presented are also by their narrow geographical and sectoral focus, set as it is in a UK regional
university. Clearly, future research should examine both additional geographical locations (UK
regions as well as country comparisons), and draw samples from different stages of the entrepreneurial process (e.g. nascent, established, failed entrepreneurs). In investigating further regional
variation on the impact of entre-tainment, it will be possible to contribute to the debates surrounding lagging and dynamic regions (e.g. total entrepreneurial activity in GEM). Similarly, by applying the survey instrument to individuals at different stages in the entrepreneurial process, as
initiated by Hindle and Klyver (2007) and Levie et al. (2010), it will be possible to gain insights
into the variable influences of culture on entrepreneurial activity.
As this initial discussion of culture and its interpretative complexity implies (Geertz, 1973),
the current study has been limited by its methodological scope. As is the case in much entrepreneurship research, in understanding the intersection of culture and entrepreneurship, a greater
range of research tools are required (Hindle, 2004). For example, audience studies, focus groups,
viewing diaries, interviews and so forth are all effective tools to capture greater degrees of interpretative insight with which to complement the quantitative findings of this study and prior work.
Given the ubiquity and rise of business entertainment formats, the influence of popular culture on

entrepreneurship should be taken more seriously. In order to do this, more sophisticated and interdisciplinary approaches are needed. Ideas and concepts from cultural theorists, culture and media
studies, sociologists and anthropologists should be more readily applied. Entre-tainment offers
potential in this regard, acting as a conceptual attractor by which to address broader questions of
culture and entrepreneurship in the field.
