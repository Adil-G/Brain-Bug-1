Abstract The article examines the use of three learning methods in the teaching of strategic
management; the case method, simulation and action learning, in the form of a consultancy
project. A survey of course members' perceptions of learning outcomes indicates that simulation
is the most effective method. Conclusions are provided for the design of strategic management
programmes and the development of action learning projects.

Introduction
The concepts and techniques of strategic management are a key component of
many MBA programmes, focusing upon issues of value creation, competitive
behaviour and corporate development. Courses in strategic management often
employ a variety of learning methods. Eldredge and Galloway (1983) find that
strategic management courses typically make use of a number of methods
based upon text, case, management games, field projects and guest speakers.
Similarly Jennings' (1996) survey of strategic management courses in the UK
found the majority of those courses to be using a combination of methods;
lectures with discussion, case studies, guest speakers, tutorials based on
current issues, business games, company-based research projects and
consultancy projects.
There can be a number of reasons for using multiple learning methods.
Various methods may complement each other to promote the development of a
wider range of skills (Teach and Govahi, 1993). Multiple learning methods can
also be included in an education programme in order to introduce variety to the
overall teaching programme.
The use of multiple methods in a programme invites questions concerning
their relative effectiveness in achieving learning outcomes and whether the
methods complement each other in the skills which they develop. This article
compares three learning methods used on a postgraduate masters course in
strategic management:
(1) the case method;
(2) the development of a proposal and plan for a hypothetical new business
(a simulation); and
(3) a workplace-based project involving principles of action learning (a
consultancy project).

The intention of the strategic management course, and of the overall masters
programme, was to promote the development of the students to become
management practitioners. This aim was reflected in the learning methods that
were employed by the course and their potential to address a range of
cognitive, behavioural and attitudinal learning outcomes, many of which
concern working with others, while undertaking strategy-based assignments.
The case method
The strategic management course made use of a number of case studies,
including several short cases of less than a thousand words. Cases were
generally used as part of a class to develop understanding of situations,
concepts and techniques. The class session typically included a brief period of
small group discussion before discussion by the whole class. The course also
included several decision orientated case sessions in which students were
asked to diagnose problems and propose options and recommendations. These
exercises were group-based and included presentations.
The use of the case method in management education was pioneered in 1910
by Harvard's newly formed school of business administration. Since then the
use of case studies has assumed a major role in the teaching of strategic
management (Alexander et al., 1986).
The term ``case method'' has come to refer to a wide range of teaching styles
and objectives that can be adopted within the use of case studies for teaching
(Dooley and Skinner, 1977). It has been proposed that the case method can be
used to:
.
gain illustration of particular points, issues or managerial principles;
.
provide managers with a neutral situation in which they are free to
explore problems (because they are not their own);
.
relate theory to practice;
.
confront the complexities of specific situations;
.
develop analysis and synthesis;
.
develop self-analysis, attitudes, confidence, responsibility;
.
develop interpersonal skills, communication and listening; and
.
develop judgement and wisdom and enliven teaching.
The method may gain the student's intellectual and emotional involvement and
assist the long-term retention of understanding and bring realism into
instructional settings (Romm and Mahler, 1991; Osigweh, 1989; Smith, 1987;
Christensen and Hansen, 1987; Dooley and Skinner, 1977).
The case method is not without its limitations. Cases may be limited in the
extent to which they present the realities of an organization. Yin (1989)
comments that a case need not reflect a complete or accurate rendition of actual
events; its purpose is to establish a framework for discussion among students.
Similarly Towl (1969) describing case writing at Harvard Business School

<-----Page 2----->emphasises the need for a ``plot structure'' and not to be simply a ``photographic
slice of life'', in order to develop sufficient interest for students to ``take at face
value the situation which the case presents, forgetting that it is artificial''.
The situation presented by the case method has been the subject of
criticism. Mintzberg (1990) proposes that the case method may be counterproductive in teaching strategic management, providing a misleading
simplification of the realities of the strategy process, in which managers wait
in their offices ``waiting for pithy reports instead of getting outside where the
real information for strategy making usually has to be dug out''. Argyris's
(1980) study of case teaching sessions during an executive programme
concluded that the intended joint exploration of open situations, where there
were no answers, became structured to converge on the lecturer's own analysis
and recommendations.
Simulation of a new business venture
Although simulation remains less popular than the use of cases in strategic
management instruction, Faria's (1998) survey of US business school education
reported that simulation usage had increased to the extent that 97.5 per cent of
AACSB (American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business) made some use
of simulations.
A simulation models some aspects of reality in a safe and time-compressed
setting (Hequet, 1995) with the simulation aimed at capturing elements of the
real situation that are important to the training objectives (Read and Kleiner,
1996). The learning opportunities available through simulation can be
summarized (Gilgeous and D'Cruz, 1996; Solomon, 1993). Simulation allows
experience to be gained in handling new situations while avoiding
unacceptable risk; simulation stimulates discussion of complicated topics,
promotes decision making, heightens self-awareness and the examination of
own behaviour, particularly in relation to the work group. However, the tasks
and decision-making environment presented by the simulation may not
duplicate those of real-world management situations (Wolfe, 1976).
The strategy programme employed simulation in the form of an activity
simulation, a structured experience based on a practical task (Elgood, 1989).
Students formed project groups, identified, researched and planned a new
business initiative. The scope of the task included identifying a business
opportunity, researching markets, defining the product/service offering and a
competitive strategy, defining the resources, systems and organisation
required, developing a projected balance sheet and profit and loss statement,
together with an identification of principal risks and contingencies.
The simulation of enterprise creation provides a learning situation that
promises to address many of the central concerns of strategic management,
combining innovation in the creation of value with business research, analysis
and planning. In addition the use of simulation may be prompted by instructors
attempting to authenticate the learning situation by importing realism
(resemblance to real life) into the classroom (Gunz, 1995).

The simulation required a great deal of time to be spent in gaining
information from secondary and primary sources including potential suppliers
and customers. The exercise took place over a three month period and resulted
in the submission of a business plan and presentation to a panel that included
the representative of a bank experienced in business lending. The formally
taught parts of the strategy course were developed in parallel with the
simulation. In terms of teaching resources the business venture simulation was
the least expensive of the learning methods to operate, only requiring the
operation of briefing and feedback sessions.
Action learning: a consultancy project
The consultancy project represents a move from the classroom setting and
hypothetical situations to engage course members in problem situations within
an organization. A number of companies participated in the programme by
allowing students to act in a consultancy role by developing a proposal for a
product or process innovation of strategic importance to the company, with the
proposal to include a consideration of the innovations implementation. The
assignment took the form of a group-based project taking place over a six
month period, a duration that may not be uncommon for this form of higher
education activity (Lamond, 1995).
The management consultancy project is an example of action learning,
originated by Revans as a result of his experience of working within the UK
coal mining industry. Within an action learning approach learners work in
teams to solve real problems in the workplace, with learning arising through
problem solving and interaction with other members of the group (Lamond,
1995). Individuals learn from experience through reflection and action.
Although a number of alternative action learning perspectives have
developed (Marsick and O'Neil, 1999), the method has three main components:
(1) people who accept responsibility for taking action on a particular task or
issue;
(2) problems, or the tasks which are acted on; and
(3) a set of colleagues who support and challenge each other to make
progress on problems and to learn reflectively (Marsick and O'Neil,
1999; Pedler, 1997).
The projects have to be:
. . . real and alive . . . not manufactured simply for the set . . . action learning is for enabling
people to undertake action to further real issues or resolve real problems (McGill and Beaty,
1996).

Revans (1997) insists that the complexities and anxieties of taking action, that
lie beyond the stage of report writing, are an essential part of action learning. In
this respect the consultancy project may not entirely follow the philosophy of
action learning.

<-----Page 4----->A wide range of learning outcomes have been suggested as arising from an
action learning approach; they include the following:
.
increased awareness of self, others and organizational beliefs and the
political and cultural dimensions of change;
.
development of insight into the application or misapplication of
concepts and theories to actions;
.
promotion of critical reflection concerning the individual's assumptions
and beliefs that shape practice; and
.
improved interpersonal skills and increased capacity to learn from
experience (Marsick and O'Neil, 1997; Raelin, 1997; Weinstein, 1997).
For a higher education provider the use of consultancy projects presents a
number of challenges. Establishing the partner relationships for consultancy
projects is a time-consuming process. Projects may present a tension between
meeting client needs and providing a valuable learning experience for the
students involved. Students may lapse into accepting workplace practice at the
expense of developing critical thinking, leading to the development of
``quick-fix'' solutions. High expectations and the critical examination of
students' work may make the process a stressful and at times painful
experience; students may seek to avoid and minimize the effect of the learning
situation by completing the project as directly as possible as opposed to more
exploratory use of the situation (Lamond, 1995). In addition, avoidance of the
risk of projects failing to progress and meet the expectations of partner
organizations requires monitoring, and at times intervention, by academic
staff.
Comparing learning methods: a survey
Although the three methods indicate very different learning situations (e.g.
classroom vs workplace, a few hours duration vs several months), the claimed
learning outcomes frequently overlap; all three methods have been seen as
promoting the development of interpersonal skills, insight into own behaviour,
and the examination of theory vs practice. The possible duplication of proposed
outcomes invites a comparison of the relative effectiveness of the three
methods.
A questionnaire was administered to two cohorts of students (46 responses)
attending the strategic management course as part of a masters degree in
management at a UK business school. The respondents ranged in age from 22
to 35 years old and were most commonly recent graduates with one or a few
years business experience.
Each questionnaire was administered before the course members had
received evaluative feedback for the assignment associated with the learning
method. The simulation was completed by the end of the first semester, the
action research project by the end of the second semester, the case activity
covered both semesters.

The questionnaire (items listed in the Appendix) was based upon Miles et al.
(1986) skills acquisition questionnaire. The survey used 22 six-point rating
scales, addressing a range of learning outcomes and issues relevant to the
strategic management course. The questionnaire items can be grouped as
follows:
.
knowledge (gaining and integrating) ± 1, 2;
.
problem solving and decision making ± 3-6;
.
planning and implementation ± 7- 8;
.
working independently ± 9;
.
awareness of feelings and beliefs ± 10-11;
.
working with others ± 12-16;
.
changing own behaviour ± 17-18;
.
management (perspective, self as a manager) ± 19-20;
.
add realism to the course ± 21; and
.
clarify career interests ± 22.
Table I presents the average scores for each of the three learning methods
together with the results of a t-test. The scores are based upon a six-point scale
where a score of 1 indicates that the learning method helped the development of
that factor ``very much'' as against 6, ``not at all''. Figure 1 provides a graph of
the average score per item for the three learning methods.
A dominant method: simulation
The average scores show an ordering between the three learning methods with
the simulation being rated as superior to the action learning project for all
questionnaire items and equal or superior to the case method for all but two
items.
The business simulation was rated as significantly superior (at a 5 per cent
level of significance) to the action learning project for 13 of the 22 questionnaire
items, the items referred to helping to:
.
integrate learning from functional areas of a business;
.
identify problems, seek and use information for problem solving;
.
plan and implement;
.
become more aware of the feelings and beliefs of others and more able to
provide meaningful feedback;
.
experiment with and learn new behavior;
.
gain top management perspective and learn about self as a manager;
.
add realism to the course; and
.
clarify career interests.

Three learning methods

(Italics indicate items where the business simulation scores were also
significantly superior to those for the case method.)
The questionnaires included a section in which respondents could describe
the particular strengths of each learning method, weaknesses and how the
method could be improved. The new business simulation was seen as

<-----Page 7----->Journal of
Management
Development

662

providing the opportunity to address what was perceived as the real world
through a demanding situation that encompassed numerous aspects of
business with the participants carrying out what they believed was a
management role. The realistic aspects of the situation were however seen as
being mitigated by the exercise concerning a hypothetical situation, lacking the
implementation of planned actions as a test of their quality.
The simulation appears to enable the acquisition of a wide range of skills in
a setting that, while hypothetical, is perceived by course participants to be
significantly superior in adding realism to that achieved by locating students in
established organizations.
The case method: learning outcomes
The case method also received ratings that were superior to those for the action
learning project (for 20 of the items) with significant differences for items
concerning helping course members to: identify problems, seek and use
information for problem solving, become aware of the feelings and beliefs of
others and gain top management perspective, while adding realism to the course.
The majority of participants recalled particular cases as providing insight
into specific management situations; this mirrored the intention for including
those cases in the programme. The majority believed that cases had provided
real life examples and insight as a basis for illustrating or inviting the
application of theoretical concepts. Issues for improvement focused upon the
material provided by cases with a need for more background information and
the ability to make comparisons between companies in the case situation and
other companies.
Problems posed by action learning
Despite its comparatively poor ratings participants believed that the
consultancy project exercise provided an opportunity to experience practice
and that it provided insight into both an industry and the way managers think,
but that experience was seen as being curtailed by limitations in the
relationship with the company, managers being seen as too busy or unwilling
to provide information, lacking time to build a relationship or failing to
co-operate. Revans (1997) proposes that such difficulties, including encounters
with the ``micropolitics of the organization'' are an essential, if often painful,
component of what is learned in action. The difficulties in operating in a realworld setting are apparent in the suggestions for how to improve the
consultancy project; overwhelmingly these concerned the need for closer (daily)
contact with the managers in the company and a longer project duration to
enable the development of information acquisition and creative ideas. The need
to recognize the extensive time commitment of action learning is emphasised
by Weinstein's (1997) survey of action learning participants, highlighting the
need for sufficient time to build trust, complete the project, time for the lessons
from action learning to form and become apparent, ideally by reiterating cycles
of learning.

<-----Page 8----->Simulation gives the student a central role in the management process, and
the case method also provides that viewpoint; action learning may require but
not provide it. Students engaging in action learning may experience a lack of
control of the situation in comparison to the managing role implicit in other
learning methods. The greater development of skills and insights associated
with the simulation may reflect greater control in access to information, control
of the learning situation and an ability to engage in development in a
comparatively risk free environment. That environment can be recognized by
course participants as artificial. While simulation and the case method may add
the perception of realism to a course, participants also recognize that
simulation is limited by not providing learning from real world implementation
of decisions and the consequent results of those decisions.
Conclusions for programme design
The use of multiple learning methods is a common feature of strategic
management education that may, through the possibility of providing
complementary learning outcomes, appear to be an attractive aspect of course
design, as may locating student learning in real life work situations. However
the evidence of the comparative survey does not support either principle.
Learning methods may not complement each other to develop a range of skills,
one method offsetting weaknesses in another; a single method may
predominate in perceived effectiveness. A particular learning method, in this
study a simulation, may be associated with superior ratings across a wide
range of learning outcomes.
The following conclusions can be made to aid the design of strategic
management, and possibly other management, programmes:
.
A single learning exercise can provide a wide range of skill
development.
.
The use of a series of learning methods may introduce a variety of
learning situations but this may not result in course members perceiving
a development in their attainment of skills (the simulation and use of the
case method preceded the consultancy project).
.
Successful learning experiences can be based upon a limited use of
course resources; the simulation required only a briefing session, two
interim feedback/monitoring sessions and presentation of plans.
.
Case studies, available as a part of many strategic management texts,
can provide the perception of having access to the realities of business
and its management, lead to recall of specific situations and a wide
range of skill development.
.
Action learning projects can be time consuming to establish and
monitor. They may require a more prolonged duration than anticipated
to allow the development of understanding, proposed solutions and
reflective learning. The methods implications for access to managers

and information can be underestimated, as may the need to maintain an
emphasis upon reflection by students to increase the opportunities for
learning and to avoid the emergence of a task focused approach.
``Reflection on past actions makes the difference between having 20
years of experience and having one year of experience 20 times'' (McGill
and Beaty, 1996).
