Human choice behavior takes account of internal decision costs:
people show a tendency to avoid making decisions in ways that are
computationally demanding and subjectively effortful. Here, we
investigate neural processes underlying the registration of decision
costs. We report two functional MRI experiments that implicate
lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) in this function. In Experiment 1, LPFC
activity correlated positively with a self-report measure of costs as
this measure varied over blocks of simple decisions. In Experiment
2, LPFC activity also correlated with individual differences in effortbased choice, taking on higher levels in subjects with a strong
tendency to avoid cognitively demanding decisions. These relationships persisted even when effects of reaction time and error were
partialled out, linking LPFC activity to subjectively experienced costs
and not merely to response accuracy or time on task. In contrast to
LPFC, dorsomedial frontal cortex—an area widely implicated in performance monitoring—showed no relationship to decision costs
independent of overt performance. Previous work has implicated
LPFC in executive control. Our results thus imply that costs may be
registered based on the degree to which control mechanisms are
recruited during decision-making.

uman choice behavior has been held to be subjectively rational,
or, “rational, given the perceptual and evaluational premises of
the subject (1).” One key subjective premise, according to inﬂuential rational accounts (2–4), is that intensive information processing
can carry an internal cost. Accordingly, “better decisions—decisions closer to the optimum, as computed from the point of view of
the experimenter/theorist—require increased cognitive and
response effort which is disutilitarian (2).” On this view, decisionmakers balance a motive to maximize gains with a motive to minimize decision costs. The concept of decision costs helps explain such
behavioral phenomena as effort-accuracy tradeoffs (3, 5), reliance
on fast and frugal heuristics (6), failure to consider all available
alternatives (7), effort discounting (8), the use of stereotypes (9),
and salutary effects of monetary incentives (10, 11). Ampliﬁed
decision costs might play a role in clinical depression (12) and
chronic fatigue syndrome (13). This idea is related to the view that
decision-making consumes a limited resource (14), and, more
generally, that humans act as cognitive misers (15).
The neural mechanisms that underlie the registration of decision
costs have never been directly investigated. We hypothesized that
costs might be evaluated based on the degree of engagement of
brain regions subserving executive control; these speciﬁcally include
lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and dorsomedial frontal cortex
(DMFC) (16–19). Our hypothesis ﬁnds support in existing evidence
that decision makers prefer to minimize demands for working
memory (20), task set conﬁguration (21), and conﬂict resolution
(22–24), all hallmark functions of the executive control system.
We focused our experiments on simple decisions: response
selections in the context of a cued task-switching paradigm. Task
switching is widely understood to demand executive control (25,
26); furthermore, previous work (27) and our own initial behavioral
results (see below) suggest that participants prefer to minimize such
demands. In two functional MRI (fMRI) studies, we tested whether

activity in executive control-related brain regions would account
for internal decision costs (measured through participants’ tendency to avoid a demanding task) even when external demands
were controlled.
Decision costs can be documented in the laboratory by embedding decisions in a demand selection task (DST) (22, 28). Fig. 1 A
and B illustrate a particular instantiation of the DST together with
behavioral choice data. Participants (n = 12) were permitted to
draw task trials repeatedly from either of two locations. Trials taken
from one location demanded greater executive control by requiring
participants to switch tasks more frequently (26). As expected,
participants tended to avoid this high-demand location, instead
drawing trials preferentially from the low-demand location.
The result of this preliminary experiment bolsters our hypothesis
that activity in brain regions associated with control, such as LPFC
and DMFC, might directly index the evaluation of internal decision
costs. If this hypothesis is correct, activity in these regions should
covary with internal costs even independently of external task
conditions. We evaluated this possibility in two complementary
fMRI experiments.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 elicited repeated self-reports of experienced decision
costs. Costs were measured in terms of participants’ rated desire to
avoid the task. Participants completed 10-trial blocks of simple
decisions in a task-switching paradigm (judging the magnitude or
parity of single digits). Participants were told that the speciﬁc
stimulus sequence in any block would be generated by one of four
different undisclosed algorithms (“sources”). Participants were
asked to rate, after every block, their inclination to avoid future
blocks from the same source. We assumed that there would be
endogenous variability both in brain activity and in reported
avoidance tendencies, even though stimuli were in fact generated
using a uniform procedure. We further assumed ratings would
reﬂect the same internal factors that drove avoidance in our
behavioral experiment. Whole-brain analyses evaluated withinsubject correlations between block-related BOLD amplitudes and
the subsequently assigned avoidance ratings. We expected to
observe a positive correlation in control-related cortical regions.
Our analyses partialled out the inﬂuence of reaction time
(RT) and error because these variables could plausibly inﬂuence
both brain activity and avoidance ratings. Indeed, individual
subjects showed positive correlations between avoidance ratings
and the number of errors per block (mean r = 0.50, t[9] = 10.25,
P < 0.01; mean error rate = 3.2%), but ratings spanned the full
range of the scale even when only blocks free of errors were

considered (76% of blocks on average) (Fig. 2). Ratings were
also correlated with block mean RT (mean r = 0.29, t[9] = 5.93,
P < 0.01) (Fig. S1). After separately modeling RT and error
(Fig. 3 A and B), we observed signiﬁcant correlations between
block-related BOLD response and avoidance ratings in two
anatomical clusters: one in left LPFC (90 voxels; peak x = −51,
y = 12, z = 27), and a smaller region in right LPFC (34 voxels;
peak x = 48, y = 9, z = 24; Fig. 3C).
All blocks demanded frequent task switching, with the speciﬁc
number of switches (versus repetitions) per block ranging from 5 to
8. Within this range, the number of switches predicted RT (F[1,9] =
30.8, P < 0.01) but not avoidance ratings independently of RT
(F[1,9] = 0.42). After RT and error were removed, the number of
switches did not signiﬁcantly correlate with BOLD response in any
brain region. Thus our statistical control of RT succeeded in capturing variance associated with external task difﬁculty.

Fig. 3. Group analysis results of fMRI Experiment 1 (n = 10). (A) Regions
responsive to error commission included dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC)
and bilateral anterior insula. (B) Regions modulated by reaction time (RT)
included dorsomedial and dorsolateral PFC, insula, precentral gyrus, thalamus,
and posterior parietal cortex. Only positive effects are depicted in A and B. (C)
In left and right lateral prefrontal cortex clusters, avoidance ratings were correlated with single-block BOLD amplitude estimates. Correlations in C were
estimated after factoring out the effects of RT and error shown in A and B. (D)
Avoidance rating-correlated regions found in a follow-up analysis that did not
exclude the inﬂuence of error and RT.

In contrast to LPFC, DMFC activity showed no relationship to
avoidance ratings in the whole-brain analysis. This was unexpected, given past ﬁndings linking DMFC to the monitoring of
demand for cognitive control (22, 23). We took three steps to
probe this null result more closely.
First, we examined a 33-voxel region of interest (ROI) centered on peak dorsal anterior cingulate coordinates reported in a
previous study of performance monitoring (29). Signal in this
ROI was positively related to RT and error in every subject
(signed-rank P < 0.01) but was not additionally correlated with
decision costs (P = 0.77).
Second, we used the RT parameter to identify task-activated
clusters in both left LPFC and DMFC, taking the top 200 RT-related
voxels in each region. We then directly tested each cluster’s relationship to decision costs (Fig. 4). The left LPFC cluster was positively related to avoidance ratings (signed-rank P = 0.02), whereas
the relationship in DMFC was nonsigniﬁcant with a negative trend
(signed-rank P = 0.08).* LPFC showed a signiﬁcantly greater relationship to decision costs than DMFC (signed-rank P = 0.01).
Third, we repeated the primary analysis, this time without
removing the inﬂuence of error or RT. Clusters correlating positively with ratings were found in DMFC, as well as bilateral regions
of LPFC, insula, and precuneus (Fig. 3D). Together, these results
conﬁrm that DMFC is related to overt performance, which in turn
predicts reported costs. Indeed, DMFC could well code costs
relating to moment-to-moment changes in behavior, as has been
suggested previously (22, 29). However, DMFC—unlike LPFC—
showed no relationship to the subjective evaluation of decision costs
independent of overt performance.
Experiment 2
Our second experiment sought to conﬁrm the relevance of LPFC
to the evaluation of decision costs, with costs now measured
directly in terms of observed avoidance behavior. Here we
assumed that decision costs would vary not just over time but
also across individuals. We leveraged individual differences in

*The negative direction of this trend, although interesting, is difﬁcult to interpret given
that the common inﬂuence of RT has been regressed out (30). We focus our interpretation on the clear presence of performance-independent effects in LPFC and on the
difference between the effects seen in LPFC and DMFC.

greater in LPFC than DMFC, and differed from zero in LPFC only.

subjects’ tendency to avoid the more demanding alternative in
the DST (Fig. 1) and tested whether these differences were
related to task-evoked brain activity.
Participants ﬁrst performed both high- and low-demand versions
of the decision-making task in the MRI scanner, with the element
of free choice removed. Then, outside the scanner, participants
completed the DST. In contrast to the ﬁrst experiment, instructions
to the participant in both phases of this study made no reference to
the themes of cognitive demand or mental effort.
Consistent with previous work (22), the median rate of lowdemand selections in the DST (61%) exceeded the chance rate of
50% (signed-rank P < 0.01; Fig. 1C). Importantly, and again
consistent with precedent, individuals varied in the strength of this
bias (range: 41–95%), and the DST was internally consistent in
measuring this interindividual variability (α = 0.87). For further
analyses we divided participants into a high-avoidance group
(individuals showing a signiﬁcant bias in a signed-rank test across
the eight DST runs; n = 10, z ≥ 2.15), and a residual group with
choice data falling closer to the indifference line (n = 12, z ≤ 1.30;
see Fig. 1D). We assume that our manipulation led to greater
differential decision costs in individuals who showed the stronger
bias. Accordingly, we predicted that the previously identiﬁed
LPFC region would show greater differential task-related activity
in these individuals.
To analyze the fMRI data we ﬁrst contrasted brain activity in
the high- vs. low-demand decision condition, while simultaneously modeling the effect of response errors (Fig. 5A). We
then tested whether the high-avoidance group would show
greater contrast values in left LPFC, the location of the largest

effect in the previous experiment. Small volume-corrected
analysis, focusing on the region activated in Experiment 1,
detected the expected group difference in a signiﬁcant 45-voxel
cluster (peak x=−51, y = 12, z = 21). Thus, differential
engagement in left LPFC was indeed greater for individuals who
went on to show a consistent behavioral bias, implying that they
experienced greater differential decision costs. The same pattern
was found if parameter values were spatially averaged across the
left LPFC cluster identiﬁed in Experiment 1 (Fig. 5B); responses
to the high- vs. low-demand task differed by a greater amount for
high-avoidance participants.
As in Experiment 1, the relationship between LPFC activity
and decision costs did not depend on RT. RT was greater in the
high-demand condition for every subject (985 ms vs. 744 ms;
signed-rank P < 0.01), and this difference was marginally greater
in the high-avoidance group (268 ms vs. 218 ms; rank sum P =
0.07). However, even after contrast coefﬁcients were regressed
on differential RTs across subjects, the residuals remained
greater for high-avoidance subjects in a signiﬁcant 25-voxel
LPFC cluster. (Figs. S2 and S3 for error-related brain activity,
whole-brain exploratory analysis of group differences, and group
differences in pupil diameter.)
As in Experiment 1, we tested the DMFC ROI drawn from
ref. 29. This region showed no difference between groups (rank
sum P = 0.92).
Discussion
We have examined the idea that decision-makers experience a
motive to minimize internal decision costs. Although the impact of
internal costs on choice behavior (2, 3) and cognition in general (4,
21, 31) has been widely considered, little is known about how such
costs are registered or evaluated at the neural level. Our results
identify a relationship between decision costs and activity in left
LPFC. We found that activity in this region correlated with participants’ self-reported avoidance tendency across epochs of a
decision-making task (Experiment 1), and with directly observed
rates of avoidance across individuals (Experiment 2).
Importantly, whereas cognitively demanding decisions may
sometimes be accompanied by errors and slow RTs, performance
differences per se do not account for the present ﬁndings. Given
that RT itself has sometimes served to operationalize decision
costs (10, 32), it is notable that the relationship between LPFC
and cost still holds independent of RT.
Our ﬁnding counters the intuitive possibility that decision
costs reﬂect overall mental workload or metabolic consumption
throughout the brain (33–37). Our task engaged a constellation
of brain regions consistent with past studies of task switching
(25), and it would have been logically possible for internal costs
to depend on activity ﬂuctuations throughout this network. In
fact, however, we observed the effect uniquely in LPFC, implying
a speciﬁc role for this region and for the control processes it is
believed to implement.
In particular, LPFC and another control-related region,
DMFC, differed markedly in their relationship to decision costs
after overt performance was accounted for. This occurred
despite the fact that both regions were strongly activated by our
experimental tasks, are consistently implicated with task switching and with control demands in general, and moreover are
functionally connected (18, 19, 25, 38, 39). Indeed, DMFC has
been linked to the registration of effort-related costs by substantial indirect evidence (22).
Why might lateral and medial prefrontal regions have differed?
Although our neuroscientiﬁc data do not uniquely specify the
underlying cognitive variables, we can readily interpret our ﬁndings
in light of established theories of PFC function. DMFC has been
proposed to play a role in monitoring outcomes and information
processing efﬁciency, whereas, in contrast, LPFC is thought to
impose top-down control, ultimately serving to regulate performMcGuire and Botvinick

<-----Page 3----->Participants. Participants were members of the Princeton University community. In the preliminary behavioral experiment, n = 12 (age 18–22, 7
females). In fMRI Experiment 1, n = 10 (age 18–34, 4 females), with one
additional participant excluded because of high error (19.5%). In fMRI
Experiment 2, n = 22 (age 18–30, 14 females); one additional participant
misunderstood instructions during scanning and was excluded.
Demand Selection Task. For the initial behavioral test, the DST was programmed using E-Prime (Psychology Software Tools, Inc.). Choice cues
appeared as circular patterned patches. Participants mouse-clicked a patch to
reveal a colored number. Depending on the number’s color, participants
judged either its magnitude or parity, responding via left-hand keypress.
There was a 250-ms intertrial interval; otherwise the task was self-paced.
One choice cue repeated the previously shown color on 90% of trials (lowdemand), whereas the other switched colors on 90% of trials (high-demand).
Each subject completed eight 75-trial runs. Choice cues in each run were
unique in appearance and location.
Choice cues were always separated by an angular distance of 45° along the
perimeter of an imaginary circle centered on the monitor. The mouse cursor
was initially positioned midway between the two cues on each trial. The
mapping of speciﬁc cues to demand levels was counterbalanced across participants. DST internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s α, treating
the eight runs as subtests.
Experiment 1 Procedure. Computerized tasks for both fMRI experiments were
programmed using the Psychophysics Toolbox (PTB) extensions for Matlab

McGuire and Botvinick

Experiment 2 Procedure. Participants performed magnitude/parity task
switching as described above. Participants initially viewed two rectangles to the
left and right of the screen, one colored green and the other orange, which were
described as decks of cards containing imperative stimuli. Participants pressed a
left or right key to select a deck, then responded to a sequence of eight trials (at
2-s intervals) on the deck they selected. Importantly, participants were asked
to choose each deck an approximately equal number of times over the course of
the experiment, without using simple patterns (e.g., alternating). The deck
choice procedure was adopted to test hypotheses regarding task anticipation,
which are not discussed further in the present report.
One deck alternated between tasks (high demand), whereas the other
deck repeated the same task for an entire block (low demand). The mapping
of deck color to demand level remained constant for each participant (but
was counterbalanced across participants), whereas the left/right positions of
the decks reversed in successive scanning runs. Digits were shown on a gray
ﬁeld in the center of the selected deck. Results showed that subjects were
successful in choosing the two decks equally often (mean low-demand
selection rate, 0.48; range, 0.40–0.60).
The two decks appeared anew at the beginning of each block, following a
2- to 8-s blank interval. After an 8- to 14-s delay, white borders appeared,
signaling participants to indicate their choice. Task trials began 2- to 8-s later.
There were 48 task blocks divided among six scanning runs, yielding 948
functional volumes per subject.
Subjects performed the DST in a behavioral testing room after scanning
was complete. Participants were instructed that, unlike during the scanning
phase, they were free to choose one alternative more often if they developed
a preference. Each participant’s low-demand selection rates in eight 60-trial
runs were evaluated in a signed-rank test against 0.50 to provide the basis
for between-subjects fMRI analyses.
fMRI Acquisition and Preprocessing. MRI data for both experiments were
acquired using a 3T Siemens Allegra scanner at Princeton University, and were
processed and analyzed using AFNI (49), SPM (www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/),
and Matlab.
An echoplanar imaging sequence acquired 34 3-mm oblique axial slices (no
gap) with repetition time = 2 s, echo time = 30 ms, ﬂip angle = 90°, and ﬁeld of
view = 192 mm yielding 3-mm isotropic voxels. An MPRAGE anatomical scan
was acquired at the end of the session, consisting of 160 1-mm sagittal slices
(TR = 2.5 s, TE = 4.38 ms, ﬂip angle = 8°, ﬁeld of view = 256 mm).
We performed slice acquisition time correction using Fourier interpolation
and motion correction using a six-parameter rigid body transformation to
coregister functional scans. Timepoints adjacent to large changes in motion
parameters or spikes in spatially averaged global signal were excluded from
analyses. A despiking algorithm was used to attenuate outliers in each voxel’s
time course. Data were spatially blurred until total estimated spatial autocorrelation was approximated by a 3D 6-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. Signal
in each voxel was intensity-normalized to reﬂect percent change.

(47, 48). Participants performed magnitude/parity task switching as described
above, initially completing approximately 140 practice trials outside the scanner.
During scanning, trials were shown at 2-s intervals, grouped into 96 10-trial
blocks. The same digit never appeared twice consecutively. The ﬁrst color
was chosen randomly; thereafter, colors switched ﬁve, six, seven, or eight
times per block.
Participants were told that they would probably ﬁnd some blocks harder
than others, that difﬁculty would depend partly on the speciﬁc sequence of
stimuli shown, and that the computer used four algorithms to construct the
sequences. Participants did not know the source of any given block but were
instructed to provide a rating, directly afterward, of their desire to avoid
blocks from the same source. In making ratings, participants were instructed
to consider the amount of aversive mental effort they had experienced.
Instructions were designed to elicit an event-by-event measure of participants’ inclination to avoid the cognitive task. For this reason, instructions
intentionally refrained from describing block-to-block differences in any detail.
The ﬁrst trial of each block was preceded by a 1-s ﬁxation cross. After the
last trial the ﬁxation cross returned for 1 s, followed by the rating prompt,
which consisted of four horizontally arranged boxes marked “none,” “a
little,” “some,” and “a lot.” The rating scale disappeared when a response
was made, and the next block began 7–13 s later. Participants responded to
the prompt by pressing one of four keys. It was explained that participants’
indicated preferences would not inﬂuence future trials and that they should
use the full range of the scale, for instance, responding “a lot” for blocks
they preferred to avoid relative to others in the experiment.
The 96 experimental blocks were divided into eight runs of functional
scanning, which yielded 1,616 functional volumes per participant.

ance (18). Although the monitoring role of DMFC may be closely
tied to observable changes in error and RT, application of cognitive
control may entail an additional internal cost.
This interpretation parallels conclusions from work on a seemingly very different topic: the perception of physical heaviness. In
principle, the heaviness of an object held in the hand could be
judged either on the basis of “bottom-up” sensory signals reﬂecting
the object’s downward force or “top-down” efferent signals
engaged in supporting the object. Research has suggested that the
latter play a predominant role (40). Analogously, decision costs
might arise not only from bottom-up performance feedback, but
also from top-down control engagement. Humans may experience
a drive to be “frugal” in their exertion of cognitive control, alongside their motive to perform tasks quickly and successfully.
We have studied decision costs in simple, highly controlled
laboratory tasks. An immediate question is thus whether the relevance of the present ﬁndings extends to more complex decisions,
such as choices among multiattribute alternatives. In addition, we
have focused on the tendency of decision makers to avoid highcost decisions outright, but decision costs are also thought to drive
strategy selection (41). For example, internal costs might motivate
decision makers to choose less systematic strategies (2, 41) or to
favor the strategies that best suit their personal abilities (11, 42).
Internal costs might also supply a motive to employ “reactive” as
opposed to “proactive” cognitive control strategies (43, 44). The
role of prefrontally mediated costs in driving strategy selection is
an attractive target for future investigation.
We have said little about subjective phenomenology. Decision
costs might conceivably involve sensations of effort, self-awareness,
boredom, fatigue, frustration, or risk. Here we remain agnostic to
which of these variables is most relevant; we assume only that costs
are reﬂected in measures of avoidance, and we focus on the neuroscientiﬁc correlates of these avoidance measures.
Future work might focus on individual difference variables,
such as working memory capacity, or on clinical disorders viewed
as involving heightened sensitivity to effort-related costs. One
such disorder, clinical depression, has indeed been associated
with increased task-evoked LPFC activity (45, 46). Outside the
context of psychopathology, however, the motive to minimize
internal decision costs might serve a beneﬁcial purpose, guiding
behavior toward maximally efﬁcient tasks and strategies.

<-----Page 4----->Both experiments were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM).
Baseline regressors included zero- through third-order polynomial trends and
each run’s spatially averaged global signal timecourse.
fMRI Data Analysis: Experiment 1. BOLD response amplitudes for individual
error-free blocks were estimated in a GLM. The model also contained regressors
for error trials, blockscontainingerrors, rating-selectionevents, and linear effects
of individual-trial RT.
The resulting error-free block amplitudes in each voxel were converted to
ranks and tested for correlation with numerical avoidance ratings (coding
“none” as 1, “a little” as 2, and both “some,” and, “a lot” as 3). This resulted
in a correlation map for every subject, which reﬂected monotonic relationships between ratings and response amplitudes. A secondary analysis used
the same procedure to test correlations between block amplitudes and the
number of task switches per block.
Correlation maps were spatially normalized and tested in a group-level t test.
Spatial normalization was accomplished by warping each subject’s anatomical
image to match a template in Talairach space (50) using a 12-parameter afﬁne
and nonlinear cosine transformation. This transformation was then applied to
statistical maps. Second-level analyses treated subject as a random variable and
were spatially masked to include only voxels with acceptable signal intensity
in all subjects. Monte Carlo simulation was used to ﬁnd a combined intensity

and cluster-size threshold that controlled whole-brain α to 0.05 (single voxel P <
0.01, cluster extent ≥ 31 voxels).
fMRI Data Analysis: Experiment 2. GLM regressors of interest included the
mean response to high-demand and low-demand task blocks, error trials,
deck selection responses, and the visual onset of the decks at the beginning of
each block.
Each subject’s data yielded a contrast map representing high-demand vs.
low-demand task performance. This map was spatially normalized, and
differences between the two groups were assessed in individual voxels using
a nonparametric rank sum test.
To improve sensitivity, analyses were restricted to a left PFC region corresponding to the largest cost-related cluster observed in Experiment 1 (Fig. 3C).
A small-volume-correction search region of 225 voxels was deﬁned by masking
the Experiment 1 results at a liberal threshold (single voxel P = 0.05). A Monte
Carlo simulation identiﬁed a cluster-size threshold that controlled alpha inside
this search region to 0.05 (single voxel P < 0.05, cluster extent ≥ 17 voxels).
