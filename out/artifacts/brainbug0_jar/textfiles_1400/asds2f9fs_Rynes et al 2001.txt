There is a crisis in the field of organizational science. The principal symptom of this crisis is
that as our research methods and techniques have become more sophisticated, they have also
become increasingly less useful for solving the practical problems that members of
organizations face (Susman & Evered, 1978: 582).
Each August, we (academics) come to talk with each other; during the rest of the year we
read each others’ papers in our journals and write our own papers so that we may, in turn,
have an audience the following August: an incestuous, closed loop (Hambrick, 1994: 13).
A substantial body of evidence suggests that executives typically do not turn to academics
or academic research findings in developing management strategies and practices (e.g.,
Abrahamson, 1996; Mowday, 1997, Porter & McKibbon, 1988). Similarly, researchers rarely turn
to practitioners for inspiration in setting their research questions (Sackett & Larson, 1990) or for
insight in interpreting their results (Rynes, McNatt & Bretz, 1999). Given this state of affairs, it is
hardly surprising that considerable gaps often exist between the normative recommendations of
organizational researchers and actual management practices in organizations (e.g., Johns, 1993;
Miller, Greenwood, & Hinings, 1997; Pfeffer, 1998).
That there is a wide gap between organizational research and managerial practice is hardly
a new observation. Discussions of the causes (and potential solutions) to this gap have been
widely debated for some time. For example, there have been previous forums on research
utilization (e.g., Beyer & Trice, 1982) and research relevance (e.g., Aldag, 1997), as well as
several books devoted to the topic (e.g., Campbell, Daft & Hulin, 1982; Hakel, Sorcher, Beer &
Moses, 1982; Lawler, Mohrman, Mohrman, Ledford & Cummings, 1985; Murphy & Saal, 1990).
Moreover, the gap is not restricted to the organizational sciences, but rather is found in nearly all
fields in which there are both researchers and practitioners (e.g., Glaser, Abelson & Garrison,

<-----Page 2----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 3

1983; Leontif, 1982; Rogers, 1995). For example, Mosteller (1981) reported that it took nearly
200 years from the time a clear and convincing cure was found for scurvy in the British shipping
industry to the time it was widely adopted by the British Navy.
The pervasiveness of the research-practice gap has led thoughtful observers to conclude
that its origins are deeply embedded in academics’ and practitioners’ most basic assumptions and
beliefs (e.g. Shrivastava & Mitroff, 1984; Thomas & Tymon, 1982). For example, Shrivastava &
Mitroff (1984) have suggested that academics and practitioners have fundamentally different
frames of reference with respect to such things as the types of information believed to constitute
valid bases for action, the ways in which information is ordered and arranged for sense-making,
the past experiences used to evaluate the validity of knowledge claims, and the metaphors used to
symbolically construct the world in meaningful ways. Similarly, others have shown that there are
notable differences between academics and practitioners with respect to the goals they seek to
influence, the social systems in which they operate, the variables they attempt to manipulate, and
acceptable time frames for addressing problems (Johns, 1993; Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998;
Thomas & Tymon, 1982).
After reviewing the literature on research utilization prior to 1982, Beyer and Trice
concluded that “the most persistent observation . . . is that researchers and users belong to
separate communities with very different values and ideologies and that these differences impede
utilization” (608). Thus, despite longstanding concerns about the limited research-practice
interface (e.g., Campbell et al., 1982; Susman & Evered, 1978), many observers are skeptical
about whether closer relationships are possible (e.g., Cummings, 1990; Garland, 1999; Hakel,
1994; Oviatt & Miller, 1989) or even desirable (e.g., Earley, 1999; Fagenson-Eland, 1999;
Gillespie, 1991).

WHY THIS FORUM?
Against this backdrop, one might wonder about the usefulness of exploring, yet again, the
topic of knowledge transfer between academics and practitioners. However, we believe the issue
is ripe for re-examination for at least two reasons.
First, economic and political conditions have been changing in ways that have made both
academics and practitioners potentially more receptive to allying and learning from with one
another (e.g., Burack, 1999; Rynes & Trank, 1999; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997). Second, although
many claims continue to be made about the nature of the academic-practitioner interface (e.g.,
Larwood & Gattiker, 1999), the vast majority are based on personal predilections and anecdotal
evidence rather than solid empirical data.
Environmental Changes
Changes in economic and political conditions have substantially altered the climate for
collaboration between academics and practitioners. On the practitioner side, intensified
competition in worldwide markets has increased organizational performance pressures and made
practitioners more receptive to any ideas – academic or otherwise -- that might make them or
their organizations more effective (Abrahamson, 1996; Micklethwait & Wooldridge, 1996;
Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000). Additionally, many organizations have downsized their corporate
research staffs, creating a void that is increasingly filled by academic and government researchers
(Cohen, Florida, Randazzese, & Walsh, 1998; Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998). To meet the
challenge of global competitiveness, public policy has also changed in ways that encourage
industry-academic cooperation, such as providing tax breaks for corporate funding of university
research and developing funding programs that require industry-university collaboration as a
condition of funding (Cohen et al., 1998).

<-----Page 4----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 5

Taken together, these developments have resulted in practitioners becoming more heavily
involved in academia and academic research. This involvement has taken the form of increased
donations to higher education, expanded participation in academic advisory boards, increased
recruitment of academic researchers by private industry, participation in university-industry
research consortia (UIRCs), and location of corporate research and development activities near
major universities (e.g., Burack, 1999; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997; Stross, 1997). According to
Powell and Owen-Smith (1998), corporations that have the strongest networks with university
researchers and the strongest internal capacity for identifying and evaluating scientific research
will be in the best position to solve the really important problems that impede further progress.
On the academic side, dramatic changes in resource dependencies have increased higher
education’s reliance on the private sector for both research and teaching support. Public funding
for higher education as a percent of total revenues and federal research support per academic
researcher have both been declining for over two decades (Cohen et al., 1988; National Center for
Education Statistics, 1997). Additionally, corporate and for-profit universities are beginning to
emerge as serious competitors to higher education (Meister, 1998; Mowday, 1997), just as
consulting firms are emerging as competitors to university researchers (e.g., Abrahamson, 1996;
Huey, 1993; Micklethwait & Wooldridge, 1996). These changes, which have been observed in
several countries (Slaughter & Leslie, 1997), have made universities increasingly dependent on
private funds at a time when competition for those funds has been intensifying (Cohen et al.,
1998; Hambrick, 1994).
At the same time that universities have become more dependent on alternative forms of
support, public policy has also increased the incentives for universities (and individual faculty
members) to produce knowledge that has commercial value (Powell and Owen-Smith, 1998;

<-----Page 5----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 6

Press & Washburn, 2000). For example, the 1980 Patent and Trade Amendments (commonly
known as the Bayh-Dole Act) allowed universities to retain the property rights to scientific
inventions, a development that has led to a blurring between the traditionally distinct roles of
academia and industry (Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998; Slaughter & Leslie, 1997).
There is considerable evidence that academics have responded in ways consistent with
these changing opportunities and dependencies. For example, since the passage of Bayh-Dole,
there has been dramatic growth in the number of formal university-industry research partnerships
(UIRCs), both in the organizational studies area (e.g., Burack, 1999; Lawler et al., 1985) and in
academia more generally (Cyert & Goodman, 1997). Cohen, Florida and Goe (1994) reported that
in 1990, more than 1,000 UIRCs spent approximately $4.12 billion on cooperative research – a
figure more than twice the amount provided by the National Science Foundation. Moreover, the
initiative for the vast majority of these centers (73%) came from universities rather than industry,
and most (61% versus 12%) were initiated by individual faculty members or departments rather
than university administrators (Cohen et al., 1998). Thus, the growing desire of many academics
to interact with practitioners seems clear.
Claims in Search of Evidence
The second factor that argues for re-examining knowledge transfer between academics
and practitioners is the paucity of empirical work on the topic, particularly in the organizational
sciences. Although many volumes now exist describing the gap between organizational science
and practice (e.g., Lawler et al., 1985; Hakel et al., 1982; Larwood & Gattiker, 1999; Murphy &
Saal, 1990), the vast majority of this work has been in the form of personal reflections and
speculation (Campbell et al., 1982 is an exception). The nonempirical nature of previous
discourse in the organizational sciences has resulted in widely varying views of academic-

<-----Page 6----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 7

practitioner collaborations (see, for example, Burack, 1999; Hakel et al., 1982; Susman & Evered,
1978, or Wright, 1999 versus Earley, 1999; Gillespie, 1991 or Fagenson-Eland, 1999), with little
empirical basis for sorting among the various claims.
For example, academics are deeply split in terms of whether they see research
collaboration with practitioners as having primarily positive, or primarily negative, effects on the
advancement of science. On the positive side, some have argued that practitioners can be
excellent sources of important and stimulating problems and that their unique insights, when
combined with those from an academic perspective, can stimulate important new scientific
discoveries (e.g., Boehm, 1980; Campbell et al., 1982; Dunnette, 1990; McCall & Bobko, 1990).
Indeed, Betz (1996) and Powell and Owen-Smith (1998) argue that practitioners are most likely
to seek alliances with outside researchers primarily for the most difficult and important scientific
problems, due to the difficulty of solving them by themselves. In addition, pursuing joint research
in organizational settings lends itself to examination of important variables that are difficult to
simulate or manipulate in other types of research (e.g., Hackman, 1985).
On the negative side, many worry that collaborating with practitioners may mean that only
narrow, short-term, or commercially profitable projects will be pursued (e.g., Murphy & Saal,
1990) or that managerial interests will be pursued at the expense of employees or the broader
society (Fagenson-Eland, 1999). Other concerns are that scientific progress will be stymied by
corporate restrictions on data collection, interpretation, and dissemination (e.g., Cohen et al.,
1998), or by the difficulties of meeting the conventional requirements of normal, positivist
science in organizational settings (e.g., Cook & Campbell, 1979). Finally, some worry about the
ease with which researchers can be subtly (e.g., Beyer & Trice, 1982; Gillespie, 1991) or not so
subtly (e.g., Press & Washburn, 2000) co-opted by corporate interests and incentives.

<-----Page 7----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 8

The ability to choose among these claims is limited, first by the paucity of empirical
evidence and second, by partially conflicting results among the studies that do exist. For example,
with respect to whether academic-practitioner collaboration tends to be associated with more (or
less) important research problems, Campbell et al. (1982) found some evidence for both
propositions. Specifically, although a relatively large proportion of studies that researchers
identified as their “most significant” resulted from academic-practitioner collaborations, so did a
relatively large percentage of “least significant” studies (e.g., outgrowths of consulting projects).
Similarly, Rynes and colleagues (1999) also reported somewhat mixed results. On the
positive side, they found that researchers who spent more time at organizational research sites
reported greater personal learning than those who spent less time, and also that the resultant
research was cited more heavily by other researchers. On the other hand, they also found a
negative relationship between practitioner involvement in formulating the research question and
subsequent citations by other researchers. Thus, at least in terms of citation rates (which are
admittedly more academic than practitioner-oriented), the best results seemed to be attained when
academics posed their own questions, but then more fully immersed themselves in organizations
during the process of investigation.
Moving outside of the organizational sciences, Louis, Blumenthal, Gluck and Stoto (1989)
and Cohen et al. (1998) report that the most successful academic researchers in the biological and
physical sciences also tend to have the highest levels of interaction with practitioners. Similarly,
Pelz and Andrews (1976) found that corporate researchers who spent at least part of their time
working on assigned (rather than self-chosen) problems and who had boundary-spanning roles
(e.g., management) in addition to pure research tasks were also the most productive. Thus, a
preponderance of the evidence suggests that collaborations between researchers and practitioners

<-----Page 8----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 9

increase research productivity and in some cases, quality as well. However, the latter variable
seems to depend on the specifics of the collaboration.
With respect to whether or not practitioners place limits on scientific inquiry or
dissemination, Rynes et al. (1999) found little evidence of such problems among the
organizational scientists they studied. However, an important limitation of their sample was that
they inquired only about studies that had successfully made it through the top-tier publication
review process. Moreover, evidence from the life sciences, where commercialization is generally
a much more immediate prospect than in the organizational sciences, suggests that organizations
are increasingly placing constraints on the dissemination of results obtained through private
funding (Cohen et al., 1998; Press & Washburn, 2000). However, these results might not apply to
the organizational sciences (Powell & Owen-Smith, 1998), since commercialization potential and
implementation success are far less certain than in the physical sciences (Barney, 1991; Pfeffer &
Sutton, 2000).
Given the potential for both positive and negative outcomes from collaborative research,
there is a need for additional evidence that can create a more sophisticated picture of the sciencepractice relationship. We turn now to a description of the types of evidence submitted to this
forum.
THE ARTICLES
Forty-nine manuscripts were submitted to this forum. Of these, 24 were returned without
review, 16 were rejected on first review, five were rejected after revision and resubmission, and
five were accepted for publication. Characteristics of the submissions are listed in Table 1.
(Insert Table 1 about here)

<-----Page 9----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 10

Perhaps the most notable characteristic of the submitted manuscripts concerns the large
number of studies that were returned without review. The most common reason for not reviewing
articles was that they did not contain any data, as required by AMJ’s mission statement and
guidelines for contributors. Thus, the previously noted tendency for academics to express
opinions about academic-practitioner relations in the absence of data characterized many
submissions to the present forum as well. After eliminating articles that were not reviewed, the
most common reasons for rejection were construct validity problems (77%), mismatches between
theory and methods (46%), and weak or nonexistent theory (37%).
Another interesting set of findings concerns the extent to which the articles themselves
appeared to reflect collaboration between academics and practitioners. Coding revealed that fewer
than 20% of the studies involved practitioners in the initial design of the study or engaged them as
co-authors after the study had been completed. On the other hand, 53% of the authors had direct
contact with practitioners during the course of their studies, and approximately three-fifths of the
articles stressed that academics and practitioners could learn from each other (as opposed to
assuming that academics were the more knowledgeable group, and that the problem of transfer
runs only in one direction). Finally, various forms of collaboration tended to be highly correlated;
for example, involving practitioners in the initial stages of the design was correlated .73 with
having a practitioner co-author.
Finally, we analyzed whether there were any detectable relationships between article
characteristics and editorial decisions (e.g., reject, revise and resubmit, accept after revision). This
analysis revealed that articles were more likely to be accepted if both academics and practitioners
provided data for the study (r = .32) and if the authors assumed that knowledge transfer was a
two-way street, rather than a unidirectional process in which knowledge flows from academics to

<-----Page 10----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 11

practitioners (r = .45). In fact, these two characteristics were evident in four of the five articles
eventually accepted for publication, as described below.
In the first article, Susan Mohrman, Cristina Gibson and Allan Mohrman examine the
factors associated with practitioner evaluations of research usefulness in a multi-organization
research project. Because the participating organizations displayed different degrees of
involvement with the research, the researchers were able to assess the extent to which three
hypothesized factors – joint interpretive forums, perspective-taking, and research impact on
organizational change decisions – were associated with practitioner perceptions of research
usefulness. More than anything else, their results stress the heavily social nature of the knowledge
transfer process.
In “The Science and Practice of Team Development: Improving the Link,” Lynn
Offermann and Rebecca Spiros surveyed 245 team development practitioners (59% practitioners
and 41% academics) from the Organizational Development and Change Division of the Academy
of Management. Their objectives were to determine the current state of team development
practice, the research needs of team development practitioners, and ways to improve the linkage
between the science and practice of team development. Their results reveal a number of causes
for optimism about the flow of knowledge between academics and practitioners, as well as some
areas for concern.
In “Knowledge Representations and Knowledge Transfer,” Richard Boland, Jagdip Singh,
Paul Salipante, John Aram, Sharon Fay and Prasert Kanawattanachai draw upon theories of
cognition and learning to test whether managers exposed to different forms of knowledge
representation (interpretive, abstract, or particular) subsequently display different decision
making processes and outcomes. They hypothesized that these three different ways of presenting

<-----Page 11----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 12

knowledge would activate different types of information processing schema, which in turn would
lead to different decision patterns on a subsequent task. Although different decision patterns
indeed emerged, they were not all in the directions predicted by the hypotheses.
In “Academic-Practitioner Collaboration in Management Research: A Case of CrossProfession Collaboration,” Teresa Amabile, Chelley Patterson, Jennifer Mueller, Tom Wojcik,
Paul Odomirok, Mel Marsh and Steven Kramer present a case study of a three-year collaborative
research venture involving academics and practitioners from several universities and business
organizations. The authors use a variety of data sources (e-mail archives, surveys, minutes of
meetings and participant observations) to create a preliminary model of success determinants in
cross-profession collaborations (i.e., “collaborations between individuals from different
professions and organizations who come together primarily as individuals rather than as
organizational representatives to accomplish a particular work project”). The model that
ultimately emerges reflects a combination of earlier models of interorganizational collaboration
(e.g., Dyer & Singh, 1998; Gray & Wood, 1997) and individual collaboration within
organizations (e.g., Tjosvold, 1986).
In “How Relevant is University-based Scientific Research to Private High Technology
Firms?” Jennifer Spencer examines the extent to which U.S. and Japanese corporate researchers
in the flat panel display (FPD) industry cited both academic and corporate research in the precommercialization stages of FPD technology. In addition, she looked at the extent to which
published research diffused across international boundaries. Her results point to the potential
importance of cross-cultural and institutional differences (such as those created by Bayh-Dole), as
well as the importance of publishing in practitioner journals for knowledge transfer to
nonacademics.

<-----Page 12----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 13

CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE
With the exception of the papers by Amabile et al. and Mohrman et al., the articles in this
forum do not share many obvious similarities. Methodologically, there are two case studies, one
experiment, one survey, and one archival analysis. The dependent variables of interest include
perceived research usefulness (Mohrman et al.; Offermann & Spiros), transfer of knowledge to a
decision task (Boland et al.), research citations (Spencer), and goal achievement, team
functioning, and team member outcomes (Amabile et al.). Also, as is typical of much research in
this area, three of the five articles (Amabile et al., Boland et al., Mohrman et al.) employ small
samples.
The articles contribute to understanding of both the creation and diffusion of knowledge,
two crucial underlying processes with respect to knowledge transfer (Choo, 1998; Knott &
McKelvey, 1999; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1996). Of the forum articles, Amabile et al. deal most
directly with issues related to joint academic-practitioner knowledge creation. Amabile and her
colleagues suggest a number of ways in which the eventual quality of research is likely to be
enhanced by practitioner participation. In the study they describe, practitioners contributed
directly to research quality by generating additional study participants, facilitating high response
rates, and contributing to improved content coding schemes.
However, practitioners also contributed to research quality in more subtle ways as well.
For example, by challenging the lead researcher’s tendency to interpret results primarily in light
of previous theory, practitioners provided the kind of alternative interpretations that often lead to
new theoretical breakthroughs or syntheses (e.g., Bartunek, 1988; Bartunek & Louis, 1996; Daft
et al., 1987; McCall & Bobko, 1990; Weick, 1989). Second, by pressing for greater participation,
practitioners exposed the academics’ tacit assumptions about how the project was “supposed” to

<-----Page 13----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 14

operate and thus opened the way for more diverse contributions by a larger number of people.
Finally, by pressing for preliminary results early in the research process, practitioners appear to
have facilitated a variant of fast prototyping. Although the benefits of prototyping have not yet
been tested against other methods in organizational science research, these processes have been
found to produce better solutions than linear sequential methods in product development settings
(Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995).
The processes described by Amabile et al. (and to some extent, Mohrman et al.) also
highlight the importance of good social relations between academics and practitioners for
successful knowledge creation. For example, Jehn, Northcraft and Neale (1999) have shown that
the benefits of knowledge diversity can be derailed if they become overshadowed by process or
values conflicts. Thus, both Amabile et al. and Mohrman et al. paid a great deal of attention to
team- and trust-building activities such as frequent electronic mail and face-to-face interactions,
joint sense-making sessions, procedural restructurings, and conflict resolution procedures.
With the exception of Amabile et al., the articles here focus primarily on knowledge
diffusion. One of the most persistent findings from previous research is that the adoption of new
knowledge tends to be a slow process, even under highly favorable circumstances. For example,
transfer of knowledge has been shown to fail even in situations where there is strong evidence of
its superiority over prior understandings, when those transmitting and receiving new knowledge
are both from the same organization, and when the target for the knowledge has great need of a
solution and may even have commissioned a search for alternatives (e.g., Argyris, 1996; Corwin
& Louis, 1982; Dougherty, 1992; Glaser et al., 1983; Mosteller, 1981; Rogers, 1995). Given the
difficulties of knowledge transfer under such favorable conditions, it is hardly surprising that such

<-----Page 14----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 15

different groups as academics and practitioners often experience difficulties in learning from one
another.
The articles in this forum provide some clues regarding barriers to dissemination, as well
as some potential solutions. For example, both Spencer and Offermann & Spiros show that
knowledge transfer can be impeded by the choices that academics make about where to publish
their research. Consistent with previous research (e.g., Terpstra & Rozell, 1997a), Offermann and
Spiros find that many practitioners – even those with doctoral degrees – stop reading academic
journals once they enter the world of practice. (Indeed, even many academics turn more to the
practitioner literature for guidance when they take administrative positions in universities;
Argyris, 1996). Still, Spencer finds that when university scientists publish their work in journals
that are read by practitioners, their research is nearly as influential as the research published by
practitioners (at least in the United States, although not in Japan).
In addition to impediments that follow from decisions about where to disseminate
academic findings, there are also issues of how academics communicate when they do try to reach
practitioners. In particular, the studies by Boland et al. and Mohrman et al. suggest that the typical
way of presenting academic information (through objective, declarative knowledge) is a relatively
ineffective way of getting knowledge to “take” in practitioner settings (see also Perrow, 1993 and
Van de Vall, Bolas & Kang, 1976). Taken together, both Boland et al. and Mohrman et al.
suggest that practitioners are either less motivated, or less able, to process written declarative
information than information presented in other ways. As one participant in Morhman et al. put it,
“When we went over the data, it really, really helped to have the researcher interpret the
results…if you just gave that output to people to read, they wouldn’t…with interpretation of the

<-----Page 15----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 16

data and a summary and then a discussion of the data and its relevance, that’s really where it’s
at.”
The preceding quote also illustrates the strong advantages of face-to-face interaction for
knowledge transfer between groups with widely differing perspectives. Such interaction appears
to be crucial for developing many types of shared knowledge. However, because face-to-face
interactions are a very time-intensive way of transmitting knowledge, most dissemination of
academic research takes place through a variety of intermediaries. Indeed, Abrahamson (1996:
263) notes that “entire industries often stand between the creators of innovations and the masses
who use them.” Thus, academics who are interested in disseminating research to those who might
use it will generally have to find ways to both motivate and enable practitioners to process and
use academic findings, even those with direct implications for practice (see also Argyris, 1985;
Conger, 1998; Petty & Cacioppo, 1996, and Rynes & Trank, 1999). Boland et al. suggest two
methods of presentation (interpretive and particularistic) that may motivate more active
information processing among nonacademics, while Choo (1998) and Conger (1998) suggest
others.
Finally, Offermann and Spiros report that there is a sense among those engaged in
organizational development that academic research is behind, rather than ahead of, organizational
practice. Although this perception might reflect little more than a self-serving bias among
practitioners, there is other evidence to suggest that this observation may well be valid (Galbraith,
1980). For example, Barley, Meyer & Gash (1988) used text analysis to show that academics
tended to follow, rather than lead, practitioners with respect to thinking and discourse about
organizational cultures. Similarly, others have found that researchers followed practitioners with
respect to quality circles and quality management (Abrahamson & Fairchild, 1999; Dean &

<-----Page 16----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 17

Bowen, 1994). Given these findings, it is interesting that so much attention has been focused on
the benefits of research diffusion to practitioners and their organizations (Gannon, 1983; Terpstra
& Rozell, 1987b), but so little on the potential benefits of practical knowledge for researchers and
for the advancement of science.
WHAT NEXT?
Previous research suggests that the quality and rate of knowledge creation are enhanced
by various forms of creative tension – tensions between different disciplines (Bylinsky, 1990)
or different types of knowledge (Jehn et al., 1999), between competing hypotheses (Platt, 1964;
Latham, Erez & Locke, 1988), between cognition and action (Connolly, 1982), between plans
and prototypes (Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995), between thinking and writing or speaking
(Weick, 1979) and between theory and implementation (Lewin, 1946; Susman & Evered,
1978). These patterns suggest that the rate of knowledge creation, dissemination, and
utilization can be increased through deliberate institutional strategies and tactics (e.g., Choo,
1998; Leonard-Barton, 1995; Stewart, 1997). In this final section, we discuss how
organizational scientists and practitioners might develop a strategy to increase the pace and
quality of knowledge creation and dissemination through collaborative efforts.
Recently, Nonaka (1994) and colleagues (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Nonaka &
Konno, 1998) have developed a theory of knowledge creation that is consistent with the view
that significant knowledge emerges from the combination of disparate perspectives. Nonaka
et al. propose that there are basically two kinds of knowledge, tacit and explicit. Tacit
knowledge is personal, context-specific knowledge that is difficult to formalize and
communicate, and includes cognitive (e.g., mental models, schemata), technical (concrete
know-how or skill), and subjective (insights, hunches) insights. In contrast, explicit or

<-----Page 17----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 18

codified knowledge is transmittable in formal, systematic language in symbols, words or
numbers.
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) and other similar models (e.g., Choo, 1998; LeonardBarton, 1995) propose that new knowledge is created most rapidly when there is continual
cycling from one form of knowledge conversion to another (e.g., tacit to explicit, explicit to
tacit). Beginning with the individual but then moving on to higher levels, they hypothesize
that a “knowledge spiral” is created through four interactive methods of knowledge
conversion: socialization (tacit to tacit), externalization (tacit to explicit), combination
(explicit to explicit) and internalization (explicit to tacit). Table 2 illuminates these four
processes in light of the articles in this forum, as well as in the broader context of academicpractitioner knowledge creation and dissemination.
(Insert Table 2 about here)
In socialization, tacit knowledge is exchanged through joint activities (e.g., spending
time together, learning together) in order to produce some form of shared mental model,
metaphor, analogy, or culture which can then be employed as a framework for moving
forward. Successful socialization requires that individuals empathize with one another enough
to incorporate the other’s feelings and beliefs, such that a larger sense of situation and
possibility can emerge (Nonaka & Konno, 1998). Because socialization involves acceptance
of the beliefs, feelings, and emotions of others, it is very difficult to achieve without some
form of shared face-to-face experience.
The importance of socialization processes for moving forward to other forms of
knowledge conversion is illustrated in both the Amabile et al. and Mohrman et al. articles. In
Amabile et al., frequent face-to-face and electronic mail sessions were used to create systems

<-----Page 18----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 19

that enabled improved data collection and interpretation processes, while in Mohrman et al.,
early perspective-taking and joint sense-making sessions increased perceived usefulness of
the research that eventually emerged. More generally, academics and practitioners can share
and convert tacit knowledge through joint symposia (such as those held at Academy of
Management meetings), consulting relationships, academic advisory councils, and “key
school” recruiting relationships.
Externalization is the process by which tacit knowledge is made explicit. In
externalization, intuitions or images are converted into tangible statements, metaphors,
analogies, hypotheses, or models (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: 64). A good example of
externalization was provided by Amabile et al. in this forum, where challenges from
practitioners made academics aware of their preconceived notions with respect to both
research process and substance. More broadly, tacit assumptions of practitioners can be made
explicit through interaction with academics employing case analysis, grounded theory or
protocol analysis. Alternatively, tacit assumptions of researchers can be brought into sharp
relief during the process of conducting ethnographic research.
In combination, explicit knowledge from different disciplines, functional areas, or
perspectives are analyzed for commonalities and discrepancies in order to produce a new
synthesis. Combinations of explicit knowledge comprise the vast majority of contributions to
scientific journals (Daft & Lewin, 1990; Sackett & Larson, 1990), although most such
combinations appear to derive solely from the academic knowledge base rather than from a
combination of academic and practitioner knowledge (Rynes & McNatt, forthcoming; Sackett
& Larson, 1990). Academics also transmit explicit information to practitioners through books
and publications in practitioner journals (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000; Spencer, this volume), but

<-----Page 19----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 20

most of this output does not reflect new knowledge in the sense defined by Nonaka, as it does
not represent a synthesis of academic and practitioner knowledge but rather a simple
translation of academic findings to presumed practitioner language and format. Perhaps the
failure to truly integrate practitioner and academic perspectives is what causes this form of
knowledge transfer to be generally ineffective (Boland et al. and Offermann & Spiros, this
volume; Conger, 1998; Terpstra & Rozell, 1997a).
In internalization, explicit knowledge is converted to tacit knowledge through learning
by doing. The Boland et al. paper suggests ways of transmitting knowledge – through
interpretive or particularistic frameworks – that may be more likely to accomplish that goal
than the typical journal article. More generally, there are a variety of ways in which
academics and practitioners might internalize knowledge across boundaries. For example,
action research presents opportunities for both academics and practitioners to add to their tacit
knowledge base through implementation and subsequent modification of academic theories.
Additional knowledge creation and utilization can then be further accelerated by embodying
the newly combined knowledge into some form of summary model, tool, or framework.
According to Nonaka et al., knowledge creation increases in greater-than-additive
fashion when all four forms of knowledge conversion are actively pursued and reflected
against each other:
The key to knowledge creation lies in the mobilization and conversion of tacit
knowledge…a spiral emerges when the interaction between tacit and explicit
knowledge is elevated dynamically from a lower ontological level (e.g., the
individual) to higher levels (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: 56-67).
This framework generates a number of insights that help explain why the knowledge

<-----Page 20----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 21

gap between academics and practitioners remains so persistent. For example, the theory posits
that the root of all knowledge creation is the mobilization of tacit knowledge. However, the
most elite organizational science journals are heavily dominated by explicit to explicit
knowledge conversion, which is the form least directly associated with tacit knowledge. In
addition, the vast majority of this research is based on knowledge conversion within the
bounds of the academic community, rather than across academic-practitioner boundaries
(Rynes & McNatt, forthcoming). In addition, surveys of researchers (Campbell et al., 1982)
and empirical coding of journal articles (Sackett & Larson, 1990) both suggest that the vast
majority of ostensibly combination-based research actually consists of very modest extensions
of previous research, rather than truly new combinations.
Second, Nonaka et al. suggest that unless successful socialization occurs between
academics and practitioners -- with each side truly understanding and empathizing with the
other -- attempts to transfer explicit knowledge across boundaries are likely to fall on deaf
ears (see also Glaser et al., 1983; Rogers, 1995). In the absence of effective inter-group
socialization, the independent social identities of academics and practitioners are likely to
solidify (Ashforth & Mael, 1991), with accompanying increases in in-group/out-group
thinking reducing the motivation for each side to learn from the other (Weick, 1996).
Third, Nonaka et al. suggest that all knowledge creation begins with individuals and
then moves up to progressively higher levels. However, empirical examination of our
scientific literature has shown that case studies, reflective essays, and inductive theorybuilding have become increasingly disadvantaged in organizational science journals over the
years (Daft, 1980; Dunbar, 1983; Locke & Cooper, 2000). And yet, as Boland et al.
demonstrate in this volume, these are the types of research that are most likely to resonate

<-----Page 21----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 22

with practitioners (see also Beyer & Trice, 1982; Dunbar, 1983), perhaps because they
emerge through socialization and have as one of their goals the externalization of
assumptions, norms, and practices (i.e., tacit knowledge).
Nonaka et al’s framework not only sheds light on reasons for the continuing academicpractice gap; it also suggests that current academic knowledge generation processes are likely
to be suboptimal even when viewed from a purely academic perspective. Setting aside the
issue of whether or not knowledge is crossing academic-practitioner boundaries, it has been
noted that there are also relatively few visible instances of socialization, externalization, and
internalization within the academic community (Argyris, 1996; Weick, 1996). For example,
there has been a general decrease in the number of personal reflections by academics
(externalization) in top-tier journals (Van Maanen, 1998), and few cases where researchers
with competing ideas get to the bottom of the other’s assumptions (socialization) so that truly
new combinations of knowledge can occur (Argyris, 1996; Tannen, 2000; see Latham et al.,
1988 for an exception).
In light of these observations, we make four general suggestions for academics who
wish to both serve and learn from organizations, and to increase the relevance and value of
published research for both practitioners and academics. First, we urge researchers to seek,
rather than avoid, the tensions inherent in academic-practitioner interactions. Because many
of the kinds of tensions that have been found to enhance knowledge creation also tend to
characterize academic-practitioner interactions (e.g., relative emphasis placed on thought
versus action, particularism versus generalization, tacit versus explicit knowledge, problem
solving versus theory building), higher levels of direct contact with practitioners would be
expected to improve the quality of academic research. Thus, we echo the advice offered by

<-----Page 22----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 23

Campbell et al. (1982: 107) nearly two decades ago:
Significant research is an outcome of investigator involvement in the physical
and social world of organizations. The implications for scholars are clear:
Make contacts. Leave your office door open. Look for wide exposure and
diverse experiences. Go into organizations… Listen to managers. Activity and
exposure are important because significant research often results from the
chance convergence of ideas and activities from several sources.
Second, we encourage officers of professional associations to continue recent trends to
facilitate increased interaction between academics and practitioners. The Academy of
Management, for example, has recently expanded the Practitioner Series at its annual
meetings and offered fellowships to those who use service learning projects in their
classrooms or who conduct original research on service learning or community engagement
projects. Nonaka’s theory of knowledge creation, as well as the Amabile et al. and Mohrman
et al. articles in this volume, stress that good social relations, mutual empathy, and some sort
of common ground are prerequisites for achieving optimal outcomes in cross-boundary
knowledge creation (see also Bartunek & Louis, 1996; Easterby-Smith & Malina, 1999;
Rogers, 1995). Additionally, Mohrman et al. emphasize the importance of face-to-face
interactions for disseminating, as well as creating, knowledge.
Because knowledge transfer is fundamentally a social process (Rogers, 1995), the
power of increased interaction between academics and practitioners for generating new
knowledge should not be underestimated, even when such interactions are not explicitly
research-oriented (see also Dunnette, 1990). However, we suggest that the format of any new
interactions be designed not just with practitioners in mind, but also in attendance.

<-----Page 23----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 24

Third, because the current composition of elite organizational science journals is
heavily skewed toward combinations of explicit knowledge derived almost entirely from
inside the academic community, we recommend that journal editors make conscious attempts
to solicit and provide more room for articles reflecting the full range of knowledge creation
techniques – socialization (e.g., ethnographies), externalization (e.g., reflective essays;
grounded theory), and internalization (e.g., action research). Without system support at higher
institutional levels, individual researchers (as well as those who advise them) will continue to
be risk-averse about broadening their research paradigms to include forms of knowledge
creation other than combination.
In making this recommendation, we recognize that the power of journal editors to
influence what gets published is limited by a number of factors, including the types of
manuscripts that individual researchers choose to submit (e.g., Campbell, 1982). Still, we
believe that editors can nudge research in desired directions through such actions as editorial
policy statements, selection of editorial board members, special research forums, and the
types of advice given to authors in editorial decision letters regarding how to improve their
research. In fact, these processes are already occurring to some extent. For example, Van
Maanen (1998) found a slight upward trend for various forms of qualitative research in
Administrative Science Quarterly in recent years. In addition, the number of special forums
(which tend to be more flexible in terms of paradigmatic approaches) have increased in many
journals, including those published by the Academy of Management. We applaud these
developments and encourage additional ones in future (e.g., awards for articles with the
greatest implications for practice).
Fourth, we encourage the gatekeepers of scientific journals to move toward

<-----Page 24----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 25

broadening both the language and the rhetorical strategies used in organizational science
discourse. The increasing specialization of scientific language and its negative implications
for cross-boundary fertilization of knowledge is well known (Daft, 1980; Hayes, 1992;
McCloskey, 1984). Specialized language raises the costs of becoming an expert in any given
field and thus reduces the likelihood that scientists will be capable of combining knowledge
from different disciplines, or that practitioners will combine their own knowledge with that of
academics (Hakel, 1994; Offermann & Spiros, this volume).
Although specialization of language is widely recognized as an impediment to
knowledge transfer across boundaries, two equal if not greater dangers come from the limited
range of rhetorical strategies employed in scientific discourse (Locke & Golden-Biddle, 1987;
McCloskey, 1984). The first of these is that conventional scientific discourse tends to obscure
the actual processes of knowledge creation. For example, Locke and Cooper (2000) argue that
authors are typically required to force-fit their research into prior theoretical frameworks
regardless of whether or not they provide the best fit to the data. Sutton and Staw (1996)
discuss how authors’ expositions of their methods often bear little resemblance to the actual
processes that got them to the final product, while Boehm (1980) notes that researchers
working inside organizations often feel pressure to “twist” their designs away from what
would be most useful in an organizational context toward something more likely to be
acceptable to journal reviewers.
In their intensive analysis of significant versus not-so significant research projects,
Daft et al. (1987) concluded that there was a duality or paradox associated with the most
significant research projects. Specifically, significant projects tended to begin in an organic,
messy, “fuzzy state,” but end with something that was “clear, tangible, and well understood”

<-----Page 25----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 26

(Daft et al., 1987: 783). The transformation from fuzziness to clarity tended to require
“intense effort and resolve, rigor and clear thinking,” yet most of that process is excised from
public access during the publication process. As just one example, the current editor of
Journal of Applied Psychology argues that in a “good” piece of published research, “the
results are likely to be mildly interesting (in a good piece of research, you already know pretty
much what you are going to find), and the discussion hardly interesting at all (in a good paper,
you already know what it means)” (Murphy, 1996: 133).
The second danger of conventional rhetorical strategies is that they also tend to
suppress the assumptions, norms, and values that underlie the research. As Argyris (1983,
1996) and McCloskey (1985, 1994) have noted, some of the most fundamental assumptions of
scientific disciplines have become so taken-for-granted that they are no longer “discussible”
in public forums. As a result, many of the most fundamental discussions among academics
tend to take place “in the dark of the night” (McCloskey, 1985). Argyris (1996) has argued
that keeping such discussions private impedes knowledge creation by inhibiting combination.
However, assumptions and premises that are part of the “undiscussible domains” within
communities (Argyris & Schon, 1996) may also be at the heart of problems of “relevance” to
the practitioner community. Because underlying assumptions, values, complexities, and
processes are omitted from the discussion, research conclusions appear less tentative and
conditional than they really are. This “sanitization” of complexities and uncertainties is likely
to make research findings less credible to practitioners who, after all, live and work in
“messy” worlds.
In closing, we remind readers that the gap between research and practice has been a
longstanding concern to many members of both communities. Special forums devoted to the

<-----Page 26----->In Press - Academy of Management Journal
Knowledge Transfer 27

topic of research relevance and utilization have been accelerating over time, and the gap
between academics and practitioners has become a prominent topic in recent Academy of
Management Presidential addresses (e.g., Hambrick, 1994; Mowday, 1997; Huff, 2000).
In this paper, we have suggested that new models of knowledge creation (e.g., Argyris
& Schon, 1996; Choo, 1998; Leonard-Barton, 1995; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995) provide a
powerful lens for understanding the great knowledge-creation potential of increased
academic-practitioner interaction, as well as for crafting interactive, double-loop solutions to
bring it about. However, Nonaka et al. and similar frameworks will be useful for narrowing
the research-practice gap only to the extent that knowledge creation is actually a high priority
to both academics and practitioners. If the goals of improved knowledge creation and
enhanced utilization are dominated by other goals, use of Nonaka’s framework is unlikely to
prove any more successful than previous efforts to narrow the science-practice gap.
Previous research suggests that rigidity and complacency in the face of changed
circumstances are two of the major causes of professional, organizational, and institutional
demise (Abbott, 1988; Kotter, 1996; Staw, Sandelands & Dutton, 1981; Weick, 1996).
Concerted effort at all levels, but especially among gatekeepers at the institutional level, will
be needed to actualize the potential of the academic-practice interface to create a truly
improved science of organizations.
