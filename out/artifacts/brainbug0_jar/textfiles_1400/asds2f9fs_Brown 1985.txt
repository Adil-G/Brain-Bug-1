ABSTRACT

Numerous successful small companies have been created in recent years
based on technology
developed within universities. Often the companies
are direct spin-offs from the university, involving faculty members who
participated
in the research and development
programs which created the
technology.
These companies present interesting problems as well as opportunities
for both the university and the faculty members involved.
The paper discusses several aspects of these problems and suggests a mechanism to help the universities become more effective in encouraging such
companies and sharing in the economic rewards, while maintaining their
own integrity.

INTRODUCTION

The explosive growth of technology-based
firms over the past several
years in areas such as microelectronics,
biotechnology,
telecommunications,
computers, and new materials has been closely linked to university research
regions of high-technology
programs. It is apparent that the outstanding
business development
in the United States are close to good universities,
and it is widely accepted that proximity
to a first-rate, research-oriented
university is a significant advantage to a high-technology
start-up company.
The universities play a significant role in conducting research, educating
engineers, scientists and managers; and aiding in the creation of an environment where high-technology
business can flourish. All major universities
conduct research and train students, and yet in many instances it is difficult to see much evidence of successful business spin-offs in the vicinity
of the university. Proximity to good universities appears to be a necessary,
but not a sufficient condition for development
of a complex of high-technology industries.

As available
federal
research
funds
have diminished
in recent
years,
more and more universities
have begun
to examine
ways of capitalizing
on the commercial
potential
of technology
developed
in their laboratories.
Such activity
is encouraged
by the desire of local and state governments
to develop high-technology
business in their communities.
Private
universities
such as Stanford,
MIT, Harvard,
and more recently
Resselaer,
have developed
atmospheres
either
consciously
or by chance
which
encourage
technical
entrepreneurs.
State universities
are becoming
more aware of opportunities
to achieve
economic
benefits
through
equity
and/or
royalty
positions
in fsms spawned
within
the university
and are
striving
to be more effective
in encouraging
commercialization
of technology.
The purpose
of this paper is to explore
the problems
associated
with spin-offs
from state universities
and to suggest a mechanism
for creating
spin-offs
in a manner
that will be mutually
beneficial
to the university,
the principals,
who may well be faculty
members,
and the investors
who
supply the capital required
to make the venture
viable.
OPTIONS
FOR
TECHNOLOGY

COMMERCIALIZATION

OF UNIVERSITY-DEVELOPED

Universities
seeking
to reap
financial
rewards
from
commercializing
technology
developed
in their research
programs
face a common
set of
problems.
The first and foremost
is that they are not good at business.
The management
structure
is wrong. They are adverse to risk. They cannot
make timely
decisions
(committees
don’t run successful
businesses).
Their
reward
system
is inappropriate
for business
(businessmen
are not judged
on the number
and origin of college degrees,
publication
records,
citation
indices
or student
reviews).
They lack incentives
to succeed
in business
(legislators
will likely
penalize
them for their success).
The second
problem is that
universities
cannot
correct
these deficiences
to make them
effective
business
entities
without
compromising
the ability
to carry out
their primary,
and much more important,
missions of teaching
and research.
Facing
this dilemma,
most universities
have chosen to license their technology
to others.
Faculty
and staff members
at most universities
are required
to execute
patent
agreements
assigning
their intellectual
property
rights to the institution.
Then acting through
established
licensing
agencies
or their own patent
or product
development
offices,
the universities
attempt
to license
technology
they feel is promising
to outside
companies.
This approach
has not been very fruitful
for most universities.
Professional
licensing
organizations
tend
to high-grade
the available
ideas,
choosing
only those
they perceive
to be the very best. Outside
organizations
lack
the inventor’s
enthusiasm
for the idea. Licensing
technological
concepts
which are not fully developed
into working
prototypes,
as is often done,
leads to problems
downstream
when the concept
has been expanded
and
modified
to the point where strong differences
of opinion
exist concerning

<-----Page 2----->21

its origin. This leads to disputes over whether royalties are indeed justified.
Also, licensing the technology
to existing companies often results in its
development
in another state. Thus, the state which supports the university
may not reap the jobs and other economic advantages which result from a
successful financial endeavor based on the technology.
Universities have another option; spinning off the technology
into local
companies and acquiring equity positions for both the university and the
inventor. University spin-offs are common enough, but spin-offs in which
the university retains equity are less frequent. Universities lack mechanisms,
procedures,
skills, and policies for accomplishing
this objective. However,
since the potential economic benefits are large, it is in the interest of universities to develop techniques for achieving equity in spin-off companies.
UNIVERSITY

OF UTAH

SPIN-OFF

COMPANIES

The author has had the opportunity
to observe the formation of a number of technology-based
companies over the past twenty years which developed at the university as the basis of the company. The author’s exposure
to the companies varied from being close observer, to being dean over the
college in which some of the technology
was developed, to being a participant in founding some of the companies. This experience has provided
insights into the problem and has convinced the author that mechanisms
can be developed
which protect the integrity of the university and provide economic benefits for both the university and its employees.
Many of the companies were product-oriented,
covering a broad spectrum of technology
including: computers and computer
peripheral equipment, geophysical
sciences, automated
materials handling systems, plant
biotechnology,
biomedical
devices,
biomaterials,
medical
instruments,
telecommunications,
ceramics, and automated
test equipment.
Numerous
service companies involved in specialized consulting, based on the expertise
of faculty members, have also developed.
Several of the companies have been very successful in achieving substantial sales and profitability.
Some have gone public, others have been
acquired by large corporations,
and several have failed. The most successful of the companies have been on the forefront of the technology
in their
area of specialty and have placed achievement of technical excellence high
among their priorities. These factors aided greatly in overcoming the sales
resistances faced by new start-up companies. The community
has benefited
from the creation of over two thousand jobs, most of them requiring high
levels of skill. Graduates from the university have more local job opportunities and the local economy has benefited. Some of the entrepreneurs
who founded the companies and their early investors have acquired significant wealth. Facilities in the University
Research Park have grown
considerably
to house many of these companies and the land leases have
generated immediate revenues for the university. The overall impact of the
new companies on the community has been very positive.

<-----Page 3----->22

ROLE OF FACULTY

MEMBERS

IN NEW COMPANIES

Several of the companies
were created
by faculty
members
to commercialize technology
developed
in their research
programs.
The faculty
member’s participation
in the company
varied from resigning
his academic
position and devoting
full-time
to the company,
to taking a much more passive
role such as serving as a consultant
and/or
director
of the company.
Between
these extremes
were faculty
members
who arranged
part-time
university appointments
and spent the balance of their time with the company.
Problems
arise for both the professor
and the university
whenever
a
company
spins out of the university.
The cleanest
arrangement
is for the
faculty
member
to resign his position
and go full-time
with the company.
However,
most universities
hate to lose their talented
and creative
people.
In addition,
the company
may not require
nor be able to afford the fulltime services of the professor
in its beginnings.
As a compromise,
the university
may be agreeable
to a part-time
arrangement
where
the faculty
member
takes a reduced
salary for a part-time
commitment
to the company and devotes the remainder
of his time to the university.
Such arrangements
can be very productive,
providing
the academic
administration
is
very tolerant,
the faculty
member
is very diligent,
and both are willing
to work out the many problems
such arrangements
invariably
create. Such
arrangements
worked
best in the Utah companies
when the conditions
of
renumeration,
tenure,
duties
and time committees
were cleary negotiated
in advance.
Several of the Utah examples
illustrate
that faculty
members
can devote
full-time
to their academic
pursuits
and serve in only an advisory
role with
the company.
Lending
their prestige to the company
and serving as a consultant
and a director
can be very satisfying,
providing
that strong
managers are found to run the business.
BENEFITS

AND

PROBLEMS

FOR THE UNIVERSITY

Universities
tend to be viewed
by legislators
as bottomless
holes which
can adsorb
enormous
quantities
of money,
Any state university
that can
demonstrate
its ability
to create jobs and improve
the economic
base of
the community
through
formation
of spin-off
companies
should
make a
favorable
impression
on its funding
body.
When a spin-off
company
utilizes
university-owned
patents,
the company
generally
executes
a license agreement
with a potential
royalty.
Until recently, the University
of Utah
did little to encourage
equity
participation.
The university’s
current
policy
is to seek a combination
of both equity
and royalty
payments.
As a result, the university
now has equity
in several
of its recent
spin-off
companies.
Over the past twenty
years, most of the
Utah spin-off
companies
left without
committing
either royalties
or equity
to the university,
even though
the technology
or expertise
relevant
to the

<-----Page 4----->23

company
was developed on campus. This illustrates at least two things.
First, the company did not utilize university-owned
patents, for this would
have required a licensing arrangement.
Second, and perhaps more significant, no one in the university requested an equity position as the company
was being formed. Universities have the ability to assist spin-off companies
in many ways and a small amount of equity in return for assistance is a
reasonable sign of gratitude.
If the company succeeds, the value of the
equity interest can be sizable, and if not, the university probably has not
lost much.
Universities have traditionally
exhibited great reluctance to take equity
positions
in spin-off companies.
Fears abound that the integrity of the
university may be violated in some mysterious
manner, that its mission
may become distorted,
or that it will encourage its faculty to abandon
conventional
academic
roles to become entrepreneurs.
These fears are
largely ungrounded
and do not represent reality. The reality is that the
overwhelming
majority of the faculty do not want to be entrepreneurs.
Furthermore,
sufficient
barriers exist to block the path and discourage
all but a few to take such a drastic step as to become an entrepreneur.
While it is clear that problems do exist in transferring technology
out
of a university
into a private business entity, there is ample evidence to
illustrate that the potential financial rewards to the university, its faculty
and the community,
can be significant. Furthermore,
a national need exists
to maintain the technological
lead the United States has developed in the
past half century. Mechanisms should be developed to commercialize
university-developed
technology
while at the same time protecting the rights
of the faculty and the integrity of the university.
PROPOSED MECHANISM
FOR COMMERCIALIZING
DEVELOPED
TECHNOLOGY

UNIVERSITY-

One mechanism which may have merit would be to establish a corporation, limited partnership,
or other appropriate
business entity (herein referred to as the XYZ Corporation)
owned jointly by the university or
perhaps a university-owned
foundation,
and a private business entity (herein referred to as ABC Corporation).
The charter of XYZ Corporation
would be to assist in the commercialization
of university-developed
technology. XYZ Corporation
would be governed by a small board of directors,
managed by ABC Corporation,
and assisted by a technical advisory board
comprised primarily of senior faculty members who would review projects
to determine their suitability for commercialization.
The business expertise
of ABC Corporation
would thus be combined with the technical expertise
residing within the university to effectively
commercialize
promising research developments.
XYZ Corporation
would not be an operating company which would
manufacture
or market products, but instead would become a shareholder

<-----Page 5----->21

in several
satellite
companies.
It would
create
each company
established
as one operating
in a specific
technical
market
area. ABC Corporation,
would
assume
responsibility
for the business
as the managing
partner,
relationships
involved
in establishing
the satellite
companies,
raising
investment
capital,
recruiting
a management
team,
assisting
the companies
to become
successful
and, eventually,
helping
them achieve
liquidity
for
their shareholders.
The satellite
companies
would
raise capital
by selling
equity
to outside
investors
and would
be structured
to attain
liquidity
for investors
within
five to seven years through
royalties,
by becoming
a public
company,
merging
with a company
whose stock is trading
publicly, or outright
sale of the company.
The XYZ Corporation
would pass
its liquid assets through
to its shareholders
which, of course, includes
the
university.
The university
would,
in turn, pass the proceeds
on to the appropriate
research
units within
the university
on some previously
established arrangement.
Figure
1 illustrates
the relationships
described
above.
Technical
concepts appropriate
for commercialization
flow from the researchers
to XYZ
Corporation.
Some of these pass through
a university

office, if such

exists,
resulting
in licenses
issued to XYZ Corporation.
XYZ Corporation
would seek technical
guidance
from the Technical
Advisory
Council
before
it accepted
concepts
for commercialization
and ongoing
advice as the businesses develop.
Operating
corporations
would
be developed
around
the
business
concepts,
each with its own officers
and directors.
Outside
capital would
be raised from investors
for equity
in these corporations.
Additional
funding
could
come from R&D partnerships,
government
SBIR
grants
or other
sources.
In appropriate
situations
the companies
would
subcontract
research
and development
back to the university
research
units. ABC Corporation
would recruit the management
and technical
team
and would
participate
actively
in the affairs of each company.
As funds
become
available,
the Technical
Advisory
Council
could receive compensation for the services it provides.
The sale of products
or services by a company
would generate
income
for the company’s
growth.
It is not anticipated
that the companies
would
pay dividends;
however,
they may pay royalties
which would be available
for immediate
distribution.
They may also wish to contract
with university research units for R&D services. However,
the primary
financial
return
to the university,
ABC Corporation
and the investors,
will come from
stock appreciation.
One goal of each company
would be to achieve liquidity for its stockholders
by merging
with a publicly
held corporation,
selling the company
for cash or taking the company
public.
The term “proceeds” on the chart refers to a combination
of royalties
and cash or marketable securities.
It should
be recognized
that it would usually
take several
years to develop
the company
to a position
where its shareholders
would
develop liquidity.
XYZ
Corporation
would
distribute
its proceeds
to its shareholders,
ABC Corporation
and the university.
Through
an understanding,
which
would have to be developed
within the university,
some of the funds would
flow back to the originating
units for research support
and equipment.
This arrangement
has the virtue of developing
private companies
without
faculty
members
being required
to leave their faculty
positions.
The new
company
utilizes
the university
and its faculty
in an advisory
role and
provides
economic
benefits
to both.
It also isolates
the university
from
the day-to-day
problems
of managing
the businesses
which develop
the
technology
into commercial
processes
and products.
This approach
requires
not only the availability
of a capable
business
team, which would
form
ABC Corporation,
but also requires
a willingness
of both groups
to commit
to the arrangement.
How the university
chose to deal with its
own faculty
would vary from one institution
to another.
Most universities
would
probably
not insist that XYZ Corporation
be an exclusive
outlet
for commercialization,
but
would
expect
that
the organization
would
attract
its fair share of such opportunities
due to its superior
performance.
