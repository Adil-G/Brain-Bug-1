This paper provides theory and evidence relating information asymmetries and agency
costs to exit outcomes in venture capital-backed entrepreneurial ﬁrms. Where venture
capitalists are able to better mitigate information asymmetries and agency costs faced by
the new owners of the ﬁrm, they will be more likely to have a successful exit outcome.
Information asymmetries and agency costs will vary depending on the characteristics of
the venture capitalist and entrepreneurial ﬁrm, as well as the structure of the ﬁnancing
arrangement. This paper introduces a new dataset comprising all venture capital exits in
Canada for the years 1991 to 2004. The data provide strong support for the conjecture
that the ability to mitigate information asymmetries and agency costs is a central factor
in inﬂuencing exit outcomes.

Introduction

Venture capitalists (‘VCs’) typically invest in early stage high-tech entrepreneurial ﬁrms
for the purpose of achieving capital gains upon an ‘exit’ transaction (see e.g. Cumming
and MacIntosh 2003a,b; McKaskill, Weaver, and Dickson 2004; Farag et al. 2004;
Parhankangas, Landstrom, and Smith 2005; Fleming 2004; Kutsuna, Cowling, and
Westhead 2000). Early stage high-tech ﬁrms generally do not have suﬃcient cash ﬂow to
pay interest on debt and/or dividends on equity investments; hence, venture capital (‘VC’)
returns are derived from capital gains upon exit transactions. VCs are widely regarded as
being experts at due diligence in screening potential investments, and adding value to their
investee ﬁrms through sitting on boards of directors and providing ﬁnancial, strategic,
marketing and managerial advice, as well as facilitating a network of contacts for investee
ﬁrms with suppliers, accountants, lawyers and investment banks (Gompers and Lerner
1999; Bascha and Walz 2001; Bergmann and Hege 1998; Wright and Lockett 2003;
Kanniainen and Keuschnigg 2003, 2004; Megginson 2004; Neus and Walz 2005; Mayer,
Schoors, and Yafeh 2005). VCs typically invest for two to seven years prior to exit events.
There are ﬁve primary types of VC exits: initial public oﬀerings (IPOs, or new listings
on a stock exchange for sale to the general public), acquisitions (in which the VC and
entrepreneur sell to a larger ﬁrm), secondary sales (in which the VC sells to another ﬁrm or
another VC, but the entrepreneur does not sell), buybacks (in which the entrepreneur
repurchases the interest of the VC) and write-oﬀs (liquidations). This paper provides

theory and evidence relating information asymmetry and agency costs to exit outcomes in
VC-backed ﬁrms.
Where VCs are able to better mitigate information asymmetries and agency costs faced
by the new owners of the ﬁrm, they will be more likely to have a successful exit outcome.
IPOs are typically the most diﬃcult exit outcome to achieve, as information asymmetries
are the most diﬃcult to overcome. IPOs are sold to a large number of diverse shareholders,
many of which do not have the time, inclination or expertise to carry out due diligence on
the quality of the ﬁrm being sold. At the same time however, IPOs typically enable the
ﬁrm to raise the most amount of capital and thereby generate the greatest returns for the
VC. Acquisition exits may be just as proﬁtable as IPOs, and possibly more proﬁtable
depending on the particular transaction. In an acquisition exit, however, the acquiror ﬁrm
does have the time, inclination and ability to carry out the due diligence to ascertain the
merits of the purchase, which is in contrast to the IPO. In secondary sales the new owner is
able to carry out due diligence as in the case of acquisitions; but secondary sales are
typically not as proﬁtable as acquisitions because the new owner does not gain control
over the entire ﬁrm but rather only the VC’s share. In a buyback exit the entrepreneur
repurchases the ﬁrm from the VC and therefore there are no problems arising from
information asymmetry. Buybacks are typically less proﬁtable as there is no new capital
coming into the ﬁrm.
This paper introduces a new comprehensive dataset for all exited VC-backed ﬁrms in
Canada over the period 1991 to 2004. The rich details in the data indicate how exit
patterns depend on conditions of information asymmetries and agency costs, among other
things. The evidence is generally consistent with the central theme that better exits result
when information asymmetries and agency costs are mitigated. We develop more speciﬁc
hypotheses as explained herein, and provide new insights into the ways VCs exit their
investments.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses factors that give rise to VCbacked IPOs versus acquisitions, secondary sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs. Section 3
introduces the exit data and describes the proﬁle of exited ﬁrms in Canada. Multivariate
empirical analyses are provided in section 4. Concluding remarks and policy implications
are discussed in the last section.

Hypotheses

A number of potential factors might aﬀect VC exit outcomes in terms of IPOs,
acquisitions, secondary sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs.1 At a general level, successful exits
depend on the ability of new owners to resolve information asymmetry and value the ﬁrm
and the allocation of control rights between the VC and entrepreneur,2 among other
things.3
In this paper, we do not seek to understand return diﬀerences across diﬀerent exit
outcomes. Rather, we address the preliminary question of what gives rise to diﬀerent exit
outcomes. These questions are in part related, as returns have been shown to
systematically vary depending on the diﬀerent exit routes. For example, Cochrane
(2005, Table 6) shows average log returns are 81% for IPOs and 50% for acquisitions
based on a sample of United States (‘US’) VC investments from 1987 to 2000.
Nikoskelainen and Wright (2007) ﬁnd from a sample of 321 United Kingdom (‘UK’)
private equity exits from 1995 to 2004 that IPOs had an average IRR of 136.9%, trade
sales yielded 23.0%, secondary sales yielded 10.4%, and write-oﬀs were associated with a
return –21.5% (not 100% due to partial recovery of the investment). In earlier work based

on a sample of Canadian and US investments, Cumming and MacIntosh (2003a, 2003b)
generally ﬁnd returns follow their posited pecking order of exits; that is, higher quality
entrepreneurial ﬁrms will rank exits in the following way: IPOs, acquisitions, secondary
sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs. Note that exits do not cause returns; rather, underlying
factors associated with quality and market conditions drive both exit outcomes and
returns.
In this section we develop hypotheses that relate a VC’s ability to mitigate information
asymmetries faced by the new owner(s) to diﬀerent exit outcomes. Where VCs are able to
provide more governance to their investee ﬁrms (such as ﬁnancial, human resource,
marketing, and administrative advice to professionalize the ﬁrm and facilitate greater
transparency upon going public), the entrepreneur’s ability to achieve a more successful
exit outcome is higher. The theoretical development in this section is in the ways in which
agency costs and information asymmetries are mitigated across diﬀerent fund
characteristics, entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics and transactions characteristics. At
the end of section 2 we summarize the testable hypotheses. Empirical analyses follow in the
subsequent sections.
2.1.

VC characteristics

A VC is a ﬁnancial intermediary between the entrepreneurial ﬁrm and the new owners
(public shareholders in the event of an IPO, and the acquiring ﬁrm in the event of an
acquisition). A VC can facilitate two primary roles:
(1) add value through active assistance provided to the entrepreneurial ﬁrm, including
strategic, ﬁnancial and marketing advice, as well as facilitate a network of contacts
with legal and accounting advisors, investment banks, suppliers (see Sahlman 1990;
Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir 1996; Gompers and Lerner 1999; Lockett and
Wright 2001); and these aspects are typically enhanced by geographic proximity
(see Cumming and Johan 2006; Cumming and Dai 2007); and
(2) certify the quality of the entrepreneurial ﬁrm (Barry et al. 1990; Megginson and
Weiss 1991; Lerner 1994; Gompers 1996; Gompers and Lerner 1999; Baker and
Gompers 2003; Hsu 2004; Hochberg 2005; Hochberg, Ljungqvist, and Lu 2007) so
that information asymmetries between the entrepreneurial ﬁrm and the new owners
are lower than they otherwise would have been at the time of exit. Through both
roles, the sale price of the entrepreneurial ﬁrm is higher by virtue of the presence of
the VC.
The certiﬁcation role of a VC diﬀers for an IPO and acquisition because the new
owners in an IPO (disparate retail-based shareholders) are unlike the new owners in an
acquisition (a large corporation). We may conjecture that a large company acquiring the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm is better able to resolve information problems and monitor the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm relative to a group of disparate shareholders in the case of an IPO. In
an IPO, greater information asymmetry (all else being equal) is associated with more
underpricing. As such, the role played by a VC, particularly the role in certifying quality,
matters to a much greater degree for IPOs than it does for acquisitions. Information
asymmetries matter to a signiﬁcant degree in acquisition transactions as they are inversely
correlated with the sale price. All else being equal, the certiﬁcation provided by the VC
lowers the indirect costs of an IPO (underpricing) and increases the probability of an IPO
relative to an acquisition (Barry et al. 1990; Megginson and Weiss 1991; Lerner 1994;

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 12:35 26 March 2009

D. Cumming and S. Johan

Gompers and Lerner 1999). Both the value-added and certiﬁcation roles of a VC of course
depend on VC characteristics.
The certiﬁcation role of a VC diﬀers according to the characteristics of the particular
VC, and the most notable diﬀerences are between limited partnerships, corporate and
government VCs. Prior research is consistent with the proposition that limited partnerships provide greater value-added and quality certiﬁcation relative to other VCs (Gompers
and Lerner 1999).4 The primary reason is that limited partnership VCs face contractual
covenants that minimize agency costs associated with running the fund, and incentive
compensation arrangements that give incentives to maximize the value of the fund’s
investments (Gompers and Lerner 1999). In contrast to limited partnerships, corporate
VCs tend to have less eﬃcient compensation arrangements and lack autonomy in decision
making from their larger corporate headquarters (Gompers and Lerner 1999). Also,
corporate VCs have overriding strategic reasons for investment (Dushnitsky and Lennox
2006; Riyanto and Schwienbacher 2006) that often lead to preferences for acquisitions
over IPOs so that the technology developed by the investee entrepreneurial ﬁrm can be
acquired by the corporation. Government VCs are often structured with ineﬃcient
statutory covenants that diminish the value-added that funds provide to their investees,
and thereby limit the success potential of the investee entrepreneurial ﬁrms (Halpern 1997;
Cressy 2002; Cumming and MacIntosh 2006, 2007).
In sum, limited partnerships are expected to have a greater proportion of successful
exits, and IPO exits in particular, as limited partnership VCs certify quality in IPOs.
Corporate VCs are more inclined to acquisition exits given their strategic reasons for
investment. Government VCs are less likely to achieve successful exits due to the ineﬃcient
statutory contracts governing their organizational structure.
Hypothesis 1: Limited partnership VCs are more likely to have successful exits in terms of both
IPOs and acquisitions due to their ability to mitigate information asymmetries and agency
costs.
Hypothesis 2: Corporate VCs are more likely to have acquisition exits due to their strategic
incentives for investment.
Hypothesis 3: Government VCs are more likely to have unsuccessful exits (secondary sales,
buybacks and write-oﬀs) insofar as they have ineﬃcient organization structures.

Further to the type of VC, it is equally important to consider the number of syndicated
VCs (Lockett and Wright 2001; Wright and Lockett 2003; De Clercq and Dimov 2004;
Manigart et al. 2006; Meuleman and Wright 2006). Syndication enhances due diligence
with the initial investment and facilitates value-added provided to the investee ﬁrms. We
therefore expect a greater number of syndicated investors to be associated with more
successful exit outcomes, in particular IPO exits as the syndicated VCs can better certify
entrepreneurial ﬁrm quality to a group of diverse public shareholders.
Hypothesis 4: A greater number of syndicated VCs mitigates adverse selection and more
hazard costs, enhances value-added post investment, and certiﬁes the quality of the ﬁrm to the
new owners upon exit, and thereby improves the probability of an IPO.

2.2. Entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics
A number of diﬀerent entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics can aﬀect IPOs versus
acquisitions; examples include the size of a ﬁrm’s assets (minimum listing requirements
for IPOs include minimum asset size), and the primary industry in which it operates.

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 12:35 26 March 2009

Venture Capital

201

Generally, these characteristics aﬀect the ability of the new owners to value the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s technology and monitor the ﬁrm. All else being equal, the cost of an
IPO is lower when a ﬁrm’s information problems attributable to its own characteristics are
less pronounced. Younger ﬁrms without a track record in high-tech industries have more
pronounced information problems (Gompers 1995); therefore, all else being equal, smaller
high-tech ﬁrms face greater costs associated with going public than being taken over.
Industry characteristics can also be related to transaction synergies, which could favour
acquisitions relative to IPOs for certain high-tech ﬁrms, subject to investor preferences in
diﬀerent market conditions (see also subsection 2.4 below). In addition, because IPOs and
acquisitions may generate diﬀerent proceeds in the sale of the ﬁrm, an entrepreneurial
ﬁrm’s growth potential and capital needs may also be relevant for the choice between an
IPO and acquisition. Firms in high-tech industries have higher market/book ratios and
greater growth options and therefore may be more likely to go public (Gompers and
Lerner 1999).
Hypothesis 5: Life science and other high-tech ﬁrms are more likely to go public as IPO
investors have a greater appetite for technology ﬁrms.
Hypothesis 6: VC investments in the seed or early stages of development are more likely to be
write-oﬀ exits due to the greater risks at the earlier stage of investment, while expansion stage
investments are less likely to be written oﬀ.
Hypothesis 7: Larger investments are more likely to go public as there are minimum capital
requirements for listing.

Further, we may expect entrepreneurs residing in the same province as their investor to
be more likely to have better exit success (in terms of an IPO or acquisition). Lerner
(1995), for example, shows VCs that are geographically closer to their entrepreneurial
investee ﬁrms are more likely to serve on the ﬁrm’s board of directors. Geographic
proximity gives rise to improved due diligence (lower adverse selection costs) and greater
value-added facilitated by regional proximity (lower moral hazard costs). Geographic
proximity therefore should be positively correlated with exit success.5
Hypothesis 8: Investors and entrepreneurs residing in the same province are less likely to have
secondary sale, buyback and write-oﬀ exits since proximity enhances due diligence and adverse
selection problems, and VC value-added is facilitated by regional proximity.

2.3. VC–entrepreneur contracts
An important diﬀerence between IPOs and acquisitions arises from the fact that an
entrepreneur may have a non-pecuniary preference for an IPO over an acquisition if the
entrepreneur seeks to be the CEO of a publicly traded ﬁrm. The entrepreneur’s nonpecuniary preference for an IPO may be viewed as an agency cost since at times of poorly
performing IPO markets the entrepreneur may not always be interested in maximizing the
ﬁnancial return to the venture. In an acquisition exit, the founding entrepreneur often
leaves the merged organization, which is frequently viewed as a negative and emotional
event for the entrepreneur (Petty, Martin, and Kensinger 1999; see also Black and Gilson
1998). Hence, exit outcomes may be inﬂuenced by the allocation of control rights between
the VC and entrepreneur. When IPO markets are in a slump and an acquisition is
comparatively more proﬁtable but the entrepreneur still prefers an IPO due to the nonpecuniary beneﬁts, then IPOs are more likely when the entrepreneur has control rights
over exit, but acquisitions are more likely when the VCs have control rights. When IPO

<-----Page 6----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 12:35 26 March 2009

D. Cumming and S. Johan

markets are ‘hot’ and both the entrepreneur and VC prefer an IPO exit then the allocation
of control rights would not aﬀect the exit outcome.
We conjecture that VC–entrepreneur contracts are related to exit outcomes. Contrary
to the conventional wisdom put forth by more than 20 years of academic research (see e.g.
Bascha and Walz 2001; Berglöf 1994; Bergmann and Hege 1998; Casmatta 2003; Cornelli
and Yosha 2003; Gompers 1998; Gompers and Lerner 2001a,b; Hellmann 1998; Kaplan
and Strömberg 2003; Marx 1998; Sahlman 1990; Schmidt 2003; Trester 1998 and others),
VCs do not always use convertible preferred equity securities. More recent research from
Canada (Cumming 2005), Germany (Bascha and Walz 2007), Europe (Schwienbacher
2003; Hege, Palomino, and Schwienbacher 2003; Cumming 2006), developing countries
(Lerner and Schoar 2005), Australia (Cumming, Fleming, and Suchard 2005) and Taiwan
(Songtao 2001) shows that VCs use a variety of securities, including warrants, common
equity, debt, convertible debt, preferred equity and convertible preferred equity, and
convertible preferred equity is not the most frequently used security. The US is the only
country in the world (where data have been collected) where convertible preferred equity is
the most frequently used security (hence the 20 years of academic work indicating
convertible preferred shares are optimal), and Gilson and Schizer (2003) show that there is
a unique tax bias in favour of convertible preferred securities in the US.
Security design involves the allocation of both control and cash ﬂow rights (Aghion
and Bolton 1992; Berglöf 1994; Hart 2001). Common equity holders are residual claimants
whose payoﬀ increases in proportion to the value of the ﬁrm. Equity holders also have
voting rights to choose the members of the board of directors, which in turn has the right
to make speciﬁc decisions. Prior work has also shown common equity typically carries
with it fewer contractual veto and control rights apart from the security itself (for
theoretical work, see Bergmann and Hege 1998; Trester 1998; Cestone 2002; Casamatta
2003; Schmidt 2003; Elitzur and Gavious 2003; Hellmann 1998; for empirical evidence, see
Gompers 1998; Kaplan and Stromberg 2003; and Cumming 2006). Debt holders, by
contrast, are ﬁxed claimants whose payoﬀ does not depend on the value of the ﬁrm so long
as the ﬁrm is able to repay the principal and interest payments on the debt. If the ﬁrm is
unable to repay its debt, then debt holders have the ability to force the ﬁrm into
bankruptcy and acquire the rights normally held by equity holders in regard to decision
rights. Debt contracts can be written with convertibility clauses that enable the debt holder
to convert the debt contract into common equity at pre-speciﬁed (that is, speciﬁed at the
time of initial contract) rates and terms of conversion.
Preferred equity holders are also ﬁxed claimants in that the value of preferred equity
depends on the present discounted value of preferred dividends associated with preferred
equity. Preferred equity does not by itself provide voting rights, and a ﬁrm is not obligated
to pay preferred equity dividends in the same way as it is obligated to meet interest
payments on debt. A ﬁrm that does not pay its pre-speciﬁed preferred equity dividends on
a timely basis cannot be forced into bankruptcy, unlike in the instance of failure to pay
interest payments on debt. Preferred equity holders have priority over common equity
holders in bankruptcy, but preferred equity holders rank behind debt holders in
bankruptcy. Preferred equity contracts can have convertibility options which enable the
contract to be converted into common equity at pre-speciﬁed rates and terms of
conversion.
Generally speaking, debt is more suited towards high positive cash ﬂow businesses that
can meet the ongoing interest payment obligations on debt, while equity is more suited
towards high growth businesses (Hart 2001). In the context of VC contracts, seminal
papers examined the US market which indicated that US VCs ﬁnance their entrepreneurial

<-----Page 7----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 12:35 26 March 2009

203

investee ﬁrms with convertible preferred equity. This work also made clear the fact that
VC contracts separate cash ﬂow and control rights to appropriately allocate incentives
that best maximize the expected value of the venture. VCs invariably use convertible
preferred equity securities in the US and there is a unique tax bias in favour of convertible
preferred equity in the US (Gilson and Schizer 2003). However, in Canada (Cumming
2005) and Europe (Schwienbacher 2003; Cumming 2006), as well as all other non-US
countries from which VC data are available (Lerner and Schoar 2005), VCs use a variety
of securities. Hence, it is interesting to contemplate the relation between security design
and exit outcomes for VCs, as this issue is very relevant for all non-US VC markets where
VCs use a variety of securities.6
In theory, it is natural to expect the allocation of control and decision rights between a
VC and entrepreneur to aﬀect the choice between an IPO and acquisition (Aghion and
Bolton 1992; Berglöf 1994; Bascha and Walz 2001). Security design can (1) mitigate agency
problems between the VC and entrepreneur (bilateral and/or trilateral moral hazard
problems7); and (2) facilitate quality signals to the new owners. There is a trade-oﬀ
between these two factors. On the one hand, theoretical research has established that
convertible securities optimally mitigate agency problems in venture ﬁnance (Berglöf
1994). As such, convertible securities could be associated with lower moral hazard
problems, higher valuations and a greater probability of an IPO (Bascha and Walz 2001;
Bayar and Chemmanur 2007). On the other hand, capital structure can signal information
to the new owners upon exit. Entrepreneurs take decisions during the early life of the
enterprise that have eﬀects that do not manifest until much later in the life of the
enterprise, after the IPO or acquisition. The implications of the decisions for future cash
ﬂows will not be observable at the time of exit. Because an acquisition involves the
entrepreneur being eﬀectively ousted from the ﬁrm, the degree to which the entrepreneur’s
decisions early in the life of a ﬁrm are in conﬂict with the long-term eventual new owners
of the ﬁrm will be more pronounced in acquisitions than in IPOs. The new owners in an
acquisition will be more sanguine about the long-term, value-enhancing nature of past
decisions where such decisions were made under strong VC control rights. A strategic
acquirer will therefore discount the value of the residual claim accordingly to the extent
that past decisions were under the control of the entrepreneur. Conversely, if the VC
employs a weak contract with few control rights and securities without downside
protection, public shareholders contemplating an IPO may view the lack of strong VC
governance and the entrepreneur’s ability to negotiate control away from the VC as a
favourable signal of entrepreneurial skill and ﬁrm quality.8 Recent legal scholarship is
consistent with this prediction (Fried and Gaynor 2006; see also Broughman and Fried
2006). As such, weak VC contracts with the use of common equity could be associated
with a greater probability of an IPO.9
It is important to note that weak VC contracts, through the use of common equity,
may also be associated with a greater probability of an IPO for reasons of bargaining
power. Higher quality entrepreneurs (in terms of skill and experience) may be able to
negotiate control rights away from the VC (and VCs are more willing to acquiesce control
to higher quality entrepreneurs), and are more likely to go public.10
In sum, investments with common equity securities are associated with fewer VC rights
of control, such as drag along, redemption and anti-dilution rights.11 If the VC holds
common equity then the VC is less able to bring about a successful acquisition exit when
the entrepreneur would otherwise prefer an IPO. As well, higher quality entrepreneurs that
are more likely to be able to reach an IPO are more likely to negotiate better deal terms
(including common equity and not convertible securities) which aﬀord the VC fewer rights

<-----Page 8----->204

of control. Convertible securities provide VCs with added incentives to provide valueadded advice to entrepreneurs and thereby increase the probability of an IPO or
acquisition relative to secondary sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs. Straight debt and straight
preferred equity securities do not provide incentives for VCs, and thereby are more likely
to be associated with IPOs or acquisitions.

Hypothesis 9: VC investments made with common equity are more likely to be associated with
IPO exits as common equity allocates greater control rights to entrepreneurs and
entrepreneurs have a non-pecuniary preference for IPOs over acquisitions. Further, higher
quality entrepreneurs that are more likely to go public are also more likely to negotiate control
rights away from VCs and obtain common equity ﬁnancing as opposed to other securities such
as convertible preferred equity or convertible debt.
Hypothesis 10: VC investments made with convertible preferred equity or convertible debt
provide incentives for the VC to add value and thereby increase the probability of both IPOs
and acquisitions over secondary sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs.

Note that in our empirical analyses (sections 3 and 4) we control for diﬀerent types of
securities as well as combinations of securities.
2.4. Market and regulatory control variables
IPO markets are subject to swings (see references in note 4). We control for the returns in
the public market (with the country-speciﬁc Morgan Stanley Capital International
(‘MSCI’) data) in the year prior to exit (as well as other possibly relevant periods). We also
use investment year and exit year dummy variables. There may also be regional diﬀerences
related to economic regulatory factors. The data (described below) are from Canada.
Canada comprises 10 provinces and three Northern Territories. Each province’s
regulatory system is based on the common law system, with the exception of Quebec.
To oﬀer securities for sale throughout Canada, however, regulatory standards of each of
the provincial securities commissions must be met. Hence, regulatory issues are not
expected to generate regional diﬀerences. Regional diﬀerences may nevertheless exist due
to economic conditions in diﬀerent provinces. We control for regional diﬀerences in the
empirical analyses with the use of provincial dummy variables.

Summary

The central theme in this section was to point out a potentially pivotal role for VCs in an
entrepreneurial ﬁrm’s IPO or acquisition outcome. This section also discussed the
importance of market and institutional conditions, as well as VC and entrepreneurial ﬁrmspeciﬁc characteristics. Table 1 summarizes the testable hypotheses discussed above. The
following sections of this paper introduce a new dataset to test the hypotheses outlined in
this section.
3. Data
In this section we introduce a dataset from 518 exited VC-backed ﬁrms in Canada over the
1991 to 2004 period. The data are ﬁrst graphically presented in Figures 1 to 5. Statistical
comparison tests and a correlation matrix are also presented in Tables 2 and 3,
respectively. The data are from Macdonald and Associates, Ltd, Toronto. Additional data

(continued)

Increases the probability of an IPO over an acquisition, as
common equity signals favourable information to the
public market. In addition, higher quality entrepreneurs
are more likely to negotiate common equity contracts.
Further, entrepreneurs typically have stronger control
rights when the VC uses common equity, and therefore
entrepreneurs with a non-pecuniary preference for an IPO
are less likely to be acquired than go public

Higher probability of an IPO and acquisition as adverse
selection problems are mitigated and value-added facilitated by regional proximity

Increases the probability of an IPO, as IPO investors often
have an appetite for technology ﬁrms
Increases the probability of an IPO, as IPO investors often
have an appetite for technology ﬁrms
Higher probability of a write-oﬀ as risks are greater the
earlier the stage of investment
Lower risks relative to seed and early stage investments, and
therefore a lower probability of a write-oﬀ
Larger investments are more likely to go public as there are
minimum capital requirements for listing

Acquisitions are more likely than IPOs as the corporate VC
has strategic incentives to invest
Weaker governance structure associated with government
funds, and therefore a greater probability of secondary
sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs
A greater number of syndicate VCs will reduce adverse
selection problems and facilitate value-added, thereby
increasing the probability of an IPO

IPOs and acquisitions are more likely than secondary sales,
buybacks and write-oﬀs for limited partnership VCs

Macdonald and Associates data. Macdonald and Associates believe their data are close to
being 100% comprehensive for the entire Canadian VC industry. There does not exist
comprehensive industry-wide data from any other country whereby contractual details
such as security design can be matched to exit outcomes. Hence, the Macdonald and
Associates data provide a useful source of information for the examination of VC
contracts and exits.
Figure 1 depicts the percentage of exits by exit type and over time. There are 32 IPOs,
197 acquisitions, 66 secondary sales, 116 buybacks and 107 write-oﬀs. In total there were
518 exited ﬁrms between 1991 and 2004. The percentage of VC-backed IPOs relative to
other exit types (6.2%) is extremely low in Canada, lower than in other countries. VCs
achieved 34% of their exits as IPOs in Australasia in 1989 to 2001 (Cumming, Fleming,
and Schwienbacher 2006), 17% of their exits as IPOs in Europe in 1995 to 2005 (Cumming
2006) (25% of their exits as IPOs in the 1990 to 2001 period in Europe (Schwienbacher
2002)), and US VCs achieved 16% of their exits as IPOs in the 1980 to 2003 period (Giot
and Schwienbacher 2007). The poor performance of Canadian VCs in achieving IPO exits
is most likely attributable to the dominant presence of labour-sponsored venture capital
corporations (‘LSVCCs’) in Canada.12 Buybacks have been the most frequently used type
of exit in 2004, followed by acquisitions, and then an equal number of secondary sales and
write-oﬀs. There were no VC-backed IPOs in Canada in 2003 or 2004. VC-backed IPOs
reached their peak in 2000 in conjunction with the peak of the Internet bubble.
There are six types of VC funds in Canada (see also Macdonald 1992; MacIntosh 1994;
Halpern 1997; Amit, Brander, and Zott 1998; Cumming and MacIntosh 2006, 2007):
limited partnership, corporate, government, institutional direct (formerly known as hybrid
funds), foreign, and LSVCCs. Limited partnership VCs are similar to US private funds
(described, inter alia, by Gompers and Lerner 1999, and Sahlman 1990), and are organized
as limited partnerships. They tend, however, toward a lower degree of specialization in
investment activity than their US counterparts (MacIntosh 1994; Amit, Brander, and Zott
1998). Canadian corporate VCs are analogous to US corporate VCs (as described by
Gompers and Lerner 1999), but tend to ﬁnance a somewhat more heterogeneous group of

entrepreneurial ﬁrms (Cumming 2005). Government funds are government-funded funds
managed by independent professional VC managers that ﬁnance a wide variety of
diﬀerent entrepreneurial ﬁrms. The ‘hybrid’ category consists of public pension funds that
invest money directly in entrepreneurial ﬁrms, rather than investing through the medium
of a private intermediary fund. As of 2004, all institutional actors that make direct
investments are reported as ‘institutional direct’ funds, although this category largely
corresponds with funds previously reported as hybrid funds (i.e. most are public pension
funds). Foreign funds are mostly US-based limited partnership funds operating in
Canada.
LSVCCs are the largest category of funds in Canada that comprise roughly 50% of all
VC capital under management as at 2004 (Cumming and Macintosh 2007).13 LSVCCs are
governed by statute, and their statutory covenants are arguably much less eﬃcient than
those of limited partnership VC funds (Osbourne and Sandler 1998; Cumming and
MacIntosh 2007). LSVCC constraints include: (1) all LSVCCs are constrained to invest
only in the sponsoring jurisdiction (as determined by the location of the investee ﬁrm’s
assets, employment, or other similar factors); (2) an eight-year investor lock-in period; (3)
restrictions on the number of allowable funds in certain jurisdictions; (4) statutory
penalties for failure to reinvest ﬁxed percentages of contributed capital in private
entrepreneurial ﬁrms within a stated period of time (typically one to three years); and (5)

constraints on the size and nature of investment in any given entrepreneurial ﬁrm. These
constraints can have the eﬀect of forcing investments to be made in inferior ﬁrms and/or
without adequate due diligence, limiting competition across LSVCCs, and limiting
investor discipline through threat of withdrawal of capital contributions. Many covenants
suitably designed to mitigate opportunistic behaviour among limited partnership VC
funds are completely absent among LSVCCs, including restrictions on the use of debt,
restrictions on co-investment by the organization’s earlier or latter funds, restrictions on
co-investment by VC managers, restrictions on fundraising by VC managers, and
restrictions on other actions of VC managers, among other things (Gompers and Lerner
1999). Gompers and Lerner (1999) show that the use of these covenants varies depending
on the characteristics of fund managers and economic conditions, and attribute this
ﬂexibility to one of the major factors leading to the success of the US VC industry. By
contrast, LSVCC covenants are inﬂexible across fund managers and invariant over time
(subject to statutory changes). Given the ineﬃcient governance of LSVCCs through
poorly designed statutes, we may expect LSVCCs to provide less governance to their
investee ﬁrms. This reduces the probability of IPO and acquisition exits for LSVCCbacked ﬁrms. Furthermore, the ineﬃcient LSVCC governance also means that LSVCCs
have a diminished capacity to certify the quality of their investee ﬁrms to IPO investors.
This further reduces the probability of IPO exits for LSVCC-backed ﬁrms.
Figure 2 and Table 2 categorize the percentage of exit outcomes for each of the
diﬀerent VCs. Importantly, note that the data in Figure 4 are presented for the VC(s) that
invested in ﬁrst round (i.e. the deal originators). Corporate VCs and limited partnership
VCs have had much greater success at picking ﬁrms that eventually achieved an IPO than
government VCs, hybrid VCs and LSVCCs. Government VCs, hybrid VCs and LSVCCs

have had a much higher proportion of buyback exits. LSVCCs have had the greatest
proportion of both buybacks and secondary sales, which are inferior exit outcomes (see
section 2 above). This is consistent with evidence of poor governance provided by
LSVCCs (Cumming and MacIntosh 2003a,b, 2006, 2007). Table 2 also shows LSVCCs
are statistically most likely to exit by secondary sales, followed by buybacks, write-oﬀs,
IPOs and acquisitions. Corporate VCs and limited partnership VCs, by contrast, are
statistically more likely exit with IPOs and acquisitions than secondary sales, buybacks
and write-oﬀs.
The percentage of exits by the stage of ﬁrst investment is depicted in Figure 3 and
Table 2. Write-oﬀs are more often seen at the seed investment stage, and least likely to
have been pursuant to buyouts and turnaround investments. IPOs are more likely for later
stage investments such as buyouts. Secondary sales and buybacks were most often a result
of turnaround investments. Acquisitions were more often seen in early stage and seed
investments than later stage investments.
The percentage of exit outcomes by type of security used at the initial investment round
is depicted in Figure 4 and Table 2. For most IPOs, the security used at the initial
investment is unknown; however, for those which are known, common equity was used for
investments that went public. Securities for which the VC has downside protection are
more likely to be divested through acquisitions than IPOs. These ﬁndings are consistent

with the prediction discussed in section 2 that strong VC control rights are associated with
acquisitions and weak VC control rights are associated with IPOs. Table 1 is consistent in
that it shows that IPOs are also less likely than acquisitions when the security used has
downside protection for the VC (although these diﬀerences between IPOs and acquisitions
are signiﬁcant and at the 10% level for debt only). As well, the data indicate buyback exits
are more likely for investments that involved some debt, which is also expected as debt
does not aﬀord ownership to the VC and the entrepreneurial ﬁrm repays the principal
upon expiration of the debt investment.
Table 2 shows the percentage of exit outcomes for ﬁrms in the life science industries
(medical, environmental and biotechnology), other types of high-tech (computers,
electronics, Internet) and non-high-tech (such as manufacturing). Life science ﬁrms were
more likely to go public than other types of high-tech and non-high-tech ﬁrms. Non-hightech ﬁrms are more likely to be exited as buybacks, which is expected as such ﬁrms
typically have cash ﬂows that may enable the entrepreneur to repurchase the interests of
the VCs.

D. Cumming and S. Johan

Table 2 presents the exit data for transactions for which the VC and the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm were and were not resident in the same province at the time of ﬁrst
investment. Exits via acquisitions are more likely where the VC and the entrepreneurial
ﬁrm are not residing in the same province, and more likely to be IPOs where the VC and
the entrepreneurial ﬁrm are residing in the same province. Note that secondary sales and
write-oﬀs are more likely for investments within the same province. Figure 2 above
indicated LSVCCs are more likely to experience buybacks and secondary sales. LSVCCs
are also bound by statute to invest in the same province; hence, it not surprising that
buybacks and secondary sales are observed where the VC and the entrepreneurial ﬁrm are
residing in the same province.
Table 2 shows the exit outcomes for the actual province in which the entrepreneurial
ﬁrm is based. Canada comprises 10 provinces: British Columbia (BC), Alberta (AB),
Saskatchewan (SK), Manitoba (MB), Ontario (ON), Quebec (QC), Newfoundland (NF),
New Brunswick (NB), Nova Scotia (NS) and Prince Edward Island (PEI). As well, there
are Northern Territories (NT). Very few exits are from ﬁrms based in the Maritime
Provinces (NF, NB, NS and PEI). There was only one exit from NB (which was an IPO).
The majority of activity is from BC, ON and QC. VC-backed ﬁrms in BC, ON and QC
have had a greater number of IPOs and acquisitions than ﬁrms in the other provinces
(Table 1), although the IPO and acquisition exit outcomes as a fraction of total exits
within the province is high in AB, SK, NS and NB.
Table 2 also presents evidence showing the exit outcomes in relation to the location of
the VC. We may expect regional diﬀerences that are in part associated with diﬀerent skill
levels among VCs in diﬀerent provinces, as well as proximity to greater levels of economic
activity. The data indicate IPOs are more likely to have been ﬁnanced by VCs based in
ON. Write-oﬀs are more likely to have resulted among VCs in SK and NS. Foreign VCs
are more likely to have exited by acquisitions.
Table 2 further depicts the exit outcomes by the duration of investment (time in years
from ﬁrst investment to exit) and the number of syndicated VCs at the time of ﬁrst
investment. IPOs and acquisitions have a slightly higher average number of syndicated
VCs relative to secondary sales and buybacks. This is in part consistent with the idea that
syndication facilitates screening and value-added. Cumming (2005) also shows LSVCCs
are less likely to syndicate, and this is consistent with the greater proportion of LSVCC
exits as secondary sales and buybacks (Figure 2). Write-oﬀs also have a slightly higher
average number of syndicated VCs for the ﬁrst investment round.
The shortest time to exit is experienced for IPOs, followed by write-oﬀs and
acquisitions (Table 2). Buybacks and secondary sales have the longest investment
duration. The data indicate that VCs rush to IPO to take advantage of stronger market
conditions, consistent with the US evidence in Giot and Schwienbacher (2007). Table 2
also presents the amount of the average VC investment and the average deal size
(including syndicated VC investments) for the ﬁrst round investment for each exit type.
IPOs and acquisitions were much larger initial investments. Secondary sales, buybacks and
write-oﬀs were much smaller initial investments, and thereby possibly riskier investments
resulting in worse outcomes. These diﬀerences are statistically signiﬁcant, as indicated in
Table 1.
The univariate relationships across the variables are further described by the
correlation matrix in Table 3. The correlations provide similar empirical support for the
view that IPOs are more often related to common equity transactions, larger deal sizes and
non-government VCs, among the other things discussed above. The correlations also
provide guidance regarding areas of concern for collinearity problems in the regression

<-----Page 19----->Venture Capital

analyses, as provided in the next section below. Note that each type of security is used by
each type of VC (see Figure 5 and the correlations between VC type and security in
Table 3; see also Cumming (2005) for additional evidence on security design by VC type),
and hence it is possible to isolate the eﬀect of VC type and security design on exit outcomes
in the regression analyses below.

Regression analyses

The regression analyses in this section consider the factors that give rise to each of the ﬁve
alternative exit outcomes: IPOs, acquisitions, secondary sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs.
Multinomial logit regressions are used to simultaneously capture these alternative exit
routes. Five alternative regressions are presented in Table 4 Panels A to E to show
robustness to alternative speciﬁcations. Alternative speciﬁcations are available upon
request. The ﬁrst regression presented in Panel A of Table 4 considers the full sample of
518 exits, and a fairly complete set of explanatory variables (described below). The second
and third regressions (Table 4 Panel B and C, respectively) also use the full sample but
with a diﬀerent set of explanatory variables to assess robustness. The fourth regression
(Panel D) considers the subsample of exits for which the duration of investment from date
of ﬁrst investment to exit was not less than two years. Panels E and F present regressions
whereby the subsamples considered are exits for which investment duration was not less
than three and four years, respectively. Panels D, E and F consider more parsimonious
speciﬁcations given the reduction in the sample size of exited investments. The full sample
comprises 518 exits, but only 32 IPOs. For instance, the reduction in the sample size gives
rise to eight IPO exits in Panel E and hence it is appropriate to reduce the set of righthand-side variables. The regressions in Panel D, E and F are important robustness checks
to ascertain the robustness of the results in regard to ﬁnancing structures to potential
endogeneity.14 Deals completed a greater number of years prior to exit are less likely to be
prone to endogeneity (potentially endogenous variables include the choice of security and
location). Where the regressions provide stable estimated eﬀects for diﬀerent subsamples
with diﬀerent investment duration, we would be less concerned that estimates are biased
by endogeneity. Table 4 presents the marginal eﬀects, not the standard multinomial logit
estimates, in order to highlight the economic signiﬁcance of the results alongside the
statistical signiﬁcance.
Table 4 Panel A presents the ﬁrst multinomial regression with the full sample and a
large number of explanatory variables. The ﬁrst set of explanatory variables comprises a
variable for limited partnership VCs and the number of syndicated investors. Panel B
considers variables for corporate VCs and government VCs. These variables are not all
simultaneously included in the same regression to avoid collinearity problems. These
variables are used to test Hypotheses 1 to 4 outlined in section 2.1. The second set of
explanatory variables comprises variables for entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics,
including dummy variables for ﬁrms in life science and other types of high-tech industries,
and dummy variables for the seed/early and expansion stage of development at ﬁrst
investment (a single variable for seed and early stages is used to avoid collinearity).
Dummy variables for non-high-tech ﬁrms and other stages of development are suppressed
to avoid collinearity. As well, a dummy variable is used to indicate whether the VC and
entrepreneurial ﬁrm are based in the same province, and a variable for the log of deal size
is included. These variables are used to test Hypotheses 5 to 8. The third set of explanatory
variables includes transaction characteristics variables for the proportional use of
common equity and convertible securities. Variables for straight debt, straight preferred

Notes: This table presents multinomial logit regressions of the probability of each exit outcome. Panel A considers the full sample. Panels B and C consider diﬀerent sets of
explanatory variables with the full sample. Panels D, E and F present subsamples of the data whereby investment duration from ﬁrst investment to exit is not less than 2, 3 and
4 years, respectively. Ordinary multinomial logit coeﬃcients are not presented; rather, marginal eﬀects are presented to explicitly highlight the statistical signiﬁcance alongside
the economic signiﬁcance. White’s (1980) robust standard errors are used in all regressions. *, **, *** ¼ signiﬁcant at the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.

equity and/or mixes of straight debt and equity are suppressed to avoid collinearity
problems. These variables are included to test Hypotheses 9 and 10. Finally, four control
variables are used for economic conditions: dummies for the year of exit for 1999 and 2000
(for the Internet bubble), and the returns to the MSCI index in the year of exit as well as
the year prior to exit.
The data indicate VC characteristics strongly inﬂuence the exit outcomes. Panel A of
Table 4 shows strong evidence in support of Hypothesis 1 that limited partnership VCs
achieve better exit outcomes than their counterparts. The regressions indicate limited
partnership VCs are 2.4% more likely to achieve an IPO and 16.1% more likely to achieve
an acquisition than the other types of VCs. In Panel B, note that consistent with
Hypothesis 2, corporate VCs are 28.2% more likely to have an acquisition exit than
limited partnership VCs and other types of VCs (the comparison is in reference to dummy
variables for other types of VCs that were suppressed to avoid collinearity). This is
consistent with Gompers and Lerner (1999) and Riyanto and Schwienbacher (2006) who
show corporate VCs are strategic VCs and not just primarily interested in ﬁnancial proﬁts.
Acquisitions facilitate the merging of interests with regard to transaction synergies for
certain technologies. Similarly, secondary sales are 25.1% less likely for corporate VCs, as
corporate VCs are less interested in selling to other competing investors technology for
which they have invested and not (yet, possibly) brought to fruition. Corporate VCs are
also 19.1% more likely to have a write-oﬀ than limited partnership VCs, possibly
suggesting they are comparatively less skilled than limited partnership VCs (as also
suggested by Gompers and Lerner 1999).
In Panel B note as well that government VCs (predominantly LSVCCs) are 2.1% less
likely to achieve an IPO than limited partnership VCs, and 22.9% less likely to achieve an
acquisition, 7.1% more likely to achieve a secondary sale, and 14.6% more likely to
achieve a buyback. This is consistent with our expectations (Hypothesis 3) that LSVCCs
have inferior statutory governance mechanisms that lower the quality of their investments,
and hence have a worse exit track record.
The evidence on syndication is for the most part insigniﬁcant, or not robust. Panels A
and B indicate a greater number of syndicated investors gives rise to a smaller probability
of a buyback. An extra syndicated VC reduces the probability of a buyback by 5.7% in
Panel A (and 5.3% in Panel B), and this eﬀect is signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This is
intuitive, as buybacks are an undesirable exit outcome and syndicated VCs are more likely
to more eﬀectively screen potential investee ﬁrms via due diligence, as well as add value in
order to reduce the probability of a buyback. However, this eﬀect is not robust in Panels C
to F. Also note that Panel A suggests syndicates are more likely to achieve a write-oﬀ, but
this eﬀect is only signiﬁcant at the 10% level and not robust in the other Panels of Table 4.
Overall, the data do not oﬀer very strong support for Hypothesis 4.
Table 4 also indicates that a variety of entrepreneurial ﬁrm characteristics are
signiﬁcant determinants of exit outcomes. Panel A shows life science ﬁrms are 3.6% more
likely to go public and 39.9% more likely to be acquired than non-high-tech ﬁrms, and
10.4% less likely to be sold as a secondary sale and 25.9% less likely to be bought back
than non-high-tech ﬁrms. Other types of high-tech ﬁrms (electronics, computer, etc.) are
35.6% more likely to be acquired, 7.1% less likely to be secondary sales and 24.3% less
likely to be bought back than non-high-tech ﬁrms. These results are expected as positive
cash ﬂow non-high-tech businesses (e.g. manufacturing) are more likely to be able to
repurchase the VC’s interests, unlike high-tech ﬁrms. The statistical and economic
signiﬁcance of these eﬀects is very similar in the other Panels in Table 4. Overall, this is

very strong evidence in support of Hypothesis 5. Early stage ﬁrms are 3.2% less likely to
go public than late stage investments, which is consistent with Hypothesis 6.
The estimated regression coeﬃcients in Table 4 Panel A indicate that deal size is a
relevant factor indicating the probability of an IPO exit outcome, consistent with
Hypothesis 7. Larger initial investments are more likely to go public, but the economic
signiﬁcance is not large and the statistical signiﬁcance is only at the 10% level. In particular,
a Can$10,000,000 initial investment is 0.9% more likely to go public than a Can$1,000,000
initial investment. Given the log speciﬁcation, increasing the size of the initial investment
increases the probability of an IPO at a diminishing rate. A Can$20,000,000 investment is
0.2% more likely to go public than a Can$11,000,000 investment. First round deal size is
also an important determinant of write-oﬀs, and this eﬀect is statistically signiﬁcant at the
1% level. Write-oﬀs are 5.6% less likely for Can$10,000,000 initial investments than a
Can$1,000,000 initial investment, while a Can$20,000,000 initial investment is 1.5% less
likely to be written-oﬀ than a Can$11,000,000 investment.
Note, however, that larger initial deal sizes are not more likely to go public in Panels C
to E, unlike the position for the full sample estimates in Panels A to C. One explanation
for these diﬀerent results is that size is more important in terms of meeting IPO listing
standards in Canada for ﬁrms that have shorter track records, while length of operating
history may be considered in lieu of size for smaller ﬁrms (Harris 2006).
Hypothesis 8 conjectured that entrepreneurial ﬁrms that are resident in the same
province as their VC investor(s) are more likely to have better exit outcomes due to better
screening and value-added. There is some support for this in Panel A of Table 4, which
shows entrepreneurial ﬁrms in the same province as their investors are 3.6% more likely to
go public. That eﬀect, however, is statistically signiﬁcant only at the 10% level and not
robust in the other Panels in Table 4.15
The data indicate that an IPO is 2.2% more likely when common equity is used in the
transaction, and this eﬀect is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This supports the
prediction (Hypothesis 9) that security design is important for IPO exits. We noted two
alternative explanations for this eﬀect in section 2.3. First, where both the entrepreneur
and VC prefer an IPO exit, there is no conﬂict of interest between the entrepreneur and
VC. However, in times of poor IPO markets when acquisitions may be relatively more
attractive, entrepreneurs may prefer an IPO due to non-pecuniary beneﬁts to the
entrepreneur while VCs prefer an acquisition. As such, common equity is more likely to be
associated with an IPO because entrepreneurs have greater control rights and prefer IPO
exits. Second, we may infer that common equity is used for higher quality entrepreneurs
that seek and obtain greater control rights, and by VCs that wish to signal to the
investment bank(s) taking the ﬁrm public and the new public shareholders that the
entrepreneur is of high quality (see Hypothesis 9 and accompanying text).16
Recall that Panel C comprises a more parsimonious speciﬁcation of right-hand-side
variables than Panels A and B. The main diﬀerence with the regression results in Table 4
Panel C is that the economic signiﬁcance is larger for some of the key variables. Most
notably, by not including the variable for convertible securities in Panel C (unlike Panels A
and B), the economic signiﬁcance of the common equity variable is twice as large for IPOs.
IPOs are 5.0% more likely with common equity investments, and this eﬀect is signiﬁcant at
the 1% level. Note as well that common equity is also 5.3% more likely to be associated
with a secondary sale and 7.8% less likely to be associated with buybacks, and both of
these eﬀects are statistically signiﬁcant at the 10% level. Hence, the support for Hypothesis
9 is quite robust to alternative speciﬁcations.

Table 4 Panels D, E and F provide speciﬁcations for which the sample excludes
investments for which investment duration is less than two, three and four years, respectively,
from date of ﬁrst investment to date of exit. These robustness checks are important to
ascertain whether the estimates in Panels A, B and C were subject to endogeneity biases in
regard to transaction structures. Longer duration investments are less likely to have exited
in the way contemplated at the time of ﬁrst investment (that is, assuming the VC and
entrepreneur contemplated the likely exit route at the time of ﬁrst investment). The estimates
do not appear to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by endogeneity. For example, the statistical
signiﬁcance of the common equity variable in relation to IPO exits does not deviate from
the 5% level of signiﬁcance in Panels D to F, and the economic signiﬁcance continues to
remain at around the same level as in Panels A to C. The economic signiﬁcance of the relation
between common equity and IPOs is 3.7% in Panel D, 3.4% in Panel E and 4.4% in Panel F
(and it was 5.0%.in Panel C, 2.5% in Panel B and 2.2% in Panel A).
We do not ﬁnd evidence of a relation between convertible securities and diﬀerent exit
outcomes. As such, while the data do support Hypothesis 9, the data do not support
Hypothesis 10.
Finally, note that many control variables are signiﬁcant in the way that we would
expect. The data provide support for the view that exit outcomes over the 1991 to 2004
period are aﬀected by economic conditions. For example, in Panel A, IPOs are 4.9% more
likely in 1999 and 2.8% more likely in 2000. Acquisitions are 35.8% more likely in 1999.
Write-oﬀs are also 29.0% more likely in 2000 (the date of the Internet bubble crash was 14
April 2000, and we may infer that the write-oﬀs were likely in the latter part of 2000). The
MSCI index variables are less informative than the Internet bubble dummy variables. The
controls for regional diﬀerences, particularly for ON and QC, show some diﬀerences in
that acquisitions are 30.9% less likely and buybacks 21.9% more likely in QC, while
secondary sales are 11.2% less likely in ON.
Overall, the speciﬁcation in Panel A of Table 4 provides a reasonable ﬁt for the data
with a pseudo R2 of 23.5%. We also provide additional speciﬁcations in Panels B to F as
robustness checks, as described above. The pseudo R2 values for the robustness checks
range from a low of 12.3% in Panel F (with the smallest subsample of the data) to 26.2%
in Panel B.
4.1.

Additional robustness checks

The regression results are in the main very robust to alternative speciﬁcations, with a few
exceptions that were explicitly noted above. Alternative speciﬁcations not explicitly
presented are available upon request. For instance, we dropped all turnaround and buyout
transactions to see if the results were robust. Turnarounds and buyouts comprise 61 of the
518 exits in the sample. Dropping those observations did not materially aﬀect the reported
results.
Also, we had considered speciﬁcations that considered non-exited investments as well
(e.g. to capture potentially ‘living dead’ investments that have not yet been written-oﬀ; see
Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean (1992)), but this did not materially aﬀect the results
(Cumming, Fleming, and Schwienbacher (2006) adopt a similar procedure in estimates of
the eﬀect of legality on exit outcomes). The data are very comprehensive for the VC
market in Canada, and comprise unique details regarding security design by VCs,
among other things described herein. Further research may consider other transaction and
ﬁrm-speciﬁc details by hand-collecting information that is not in the Macdonald and
Associates data, although this issue is beyond the scope of this paper.

Conclusion

This paper presented hypotheses based on the central theme that conditions of
information asymmetries and agency costs are central to VC exit outcomes. Where VCs
are able to mitigate information asymmetries faced by the new owner(s) of the ﬁrm, and
mitigate agency costs associated with entrepreneurial investment, better exit outcomes
result. To this end, we conjectured IPOs and acquisitions would be more often associated
with limited partnership VCs, corporate VCs would be more often associated with
acquisitions, and government VCs more often associated with inferior exits (secondary
sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs). We further conjectured that common equity investments
which allocate relatively greater control rights to entrepreneurs would be more often
associated with IPO exits, and developed other hypotheses pertaining to information
asymmetries and agency costs.
We tested these hypotheses in this paper with a comprehensive dataset comprising all
VC-backed IPOs, acquisitions, secondary sales, buybacks and write-oﬀs in Canada over
the period 1991 to 2004. We found evidence that VC-backed IPOs are statistically
associated with larger deal sizes and high-tech and life sciences ﬁrms, and investments
structured with the use of common equity. The signiﬁcant and robust relation between
common equity and IPOs highlights the importance of contractual corporate governance
in facilitating exit outcomes, consistent with our theoretical expectations described in
subsection 2.3 of this paper. Acquisitions are more likely for corporate VCs, life science
and other high-tech ﬁrms. This evidence is consistent with prior work indicating that
corporate VCs are unique with their strategic incentives for investment and not merely
ﬁnancial incentives. The data also indicate that write-oﬀs are more likely for smaller
investments.
Importantly, the data show a strong inﬂuence of government-subsidized LSVCCs on
exit outcomes in Canada. As at 2004, LSVCCs comprise approximately 50% of capital
under management in Canada, and are an inferior government-sponsored organizational
structure with ineﬃcient statutory contractual corporate governance covenants. As
summarized in this paper, VCs in Canada have had less success in achieving IPOs than
VCs in Australasia, Europe and the US. The Canadian data introduced in this paper are
consistent with the view that the dominant presence of LSVCCs in Canada has given rise
to a high proportion of less successful exits by means of buybacks and secondary sales.
The data in this paper suggest that the policy objective associated with LSVCCs in terms
of creating sustainable ﬁrms that will enhance entrepreneurial ﬁrm outcomes does not
appear to have been successful.
Further research in the future could explore the role of governance structures and
diﬀerent types of VCs in other countries, as well as IPO performance. Exiting investments
is a central part of the VC investment process, and rich detailed data on exits can always
further our understanding of how VC investments are harvested.

D. Cumming and S. Johan
This area has been a focus in the entrepreneurship literature. See Lockett and Wright (2001),
Wright and Lockett (2003), Manigart et al. (2000a, 2000b), Mason and Harrison (2002),
Sapienza (1992), Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir (1996).
Cumming and MacIntosh (2003a,b) survey a variety of other factors, including the ability of
new owners to monitor and discipline the managers and add value to the venture, the growth of
the entrepreneurial ﬁrm and the demand for funds, the transaction costs of eﬀecting a sale, ﬁrm
size, the ongoing costs of operating as a public versus a private ﬁrm including the reporting
requirements and public proﬁle of a ﬁrm that goes public, the liquidity of the investment to the
buyer, the liquidity of exit to the seller, insider ownership and managerial incentives post-exit,
transaction synergies, and the cyclicality of valuations in IPO markets. On this latter point,
market timing matters to a signiﬁcant degree; see Ritter (1984), Barry et al. (1990), Megginson
and Weiss (1991), Lerner (1994), Brav and Gompers (1997, 2003) and Gompers and Lerner
(1999).
See also Santhanakrishnan (2005) and Riyanto and Schwienbacher (2006) for more detailed
theory and evidence on corporate VCs. In our empirical tests, other control variables related
to VC characteristics and various interaction terms were considered but did not materially
aﬀect the variables of interest. The disaggregated Canadian VC data (described below) do not
have complete details regarding capital under management for each VC. Portfolio size per VC
manager is highly correlated with the type of VC in Canada: LSVCCs have substantially larger
portfolio sizes per VC manager. This is consistent with Keuschnigg (2004) (see also Keuschnigg
2003; Keuschnigg and Nielsen 2001, 2003a, 2003b, 2004). Given the high correlation, we do not
simultaneously include this control variable, but rather simply control for the type of VC.
Location choice is not random. For example, Sorenson and Stuart (2001) show the likelihood
of a venture capitalist investing in an entrepreneurial ﬁrm increases the greater the degree of
proximity between the investor and entrepreneur. Location is therefore not completely
exogenous to exit outcomes. We consider endogeneity for this variable, among others, in the
empirical assessment in section 4 of this paper.
For related work, see Cressy, Malipiero, and Munari (2007) and Nikoskelainen and Wright
(2007) on the relation between governance mechanisms and performance of buyouts in
European contexts.
In the presence of entrepreneurial moral hazard (entrepreneur qua agent, VC(s) qua principal),
and in the absence of bilateral moral hazard, it is eﬃcient for the residual claim to be in the
hands of the entrepreneur (i.e. straight debt or straight preferred equity) to get the maximum
work from the entrepreneur. If the eﬀort of the VC(s) also matters to the success of the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm (that is, there is bilateral moral hazard), the investor will be eﬃciently
allocated a residual claim (e.g. possibly in the form of common equity, mixes of debt and
common equity, and especially option contracts such as convertible preferred equity, etc.).
Trilateral moral hazard refers to situations in which, in order to lower the cost of capital, an
entrepreneur may give up control of the ﬁrm to an outside third party after the original VC
provides capital. This entrepreneurial incentive is particularly pronounced around times of
bankruptcy. An eﬃcient solution to this problem is the use of convertible preferred equity or
convertible debt (Berglöf 1994), since it provides a state-contingent allocation of control rights.
The VC has control in bad states where the entrepreneur may otherwise want to give up control
to an outside third investor, but exchanges control for upside potential in good states of nature.
The signalling conjecture is consistent with Garmaise (2000), which is an exact reversal of
Myers and Majluf (1984) (see also Leland and Pyle 1977). Garmaise’s result that common
equity signals high quality is attributable to the VCs being more skilled and informed than the
entrepreneur about the market value of the technology being ﬁnanced, while in Myers and
Majluf’s model the investors are not as well informed as the entrepreneur.
Predictions in respect of signalling are conditional on observable quality. Even if a signalling
model would predict that common equity is correlated with favourable information about a
ﬁrm, this does not necessarily imply that we expect to see common equity correlated with better
outcomes unconditionally. If signalling is costly, it might be used among ﬁrms where
uncertainty regarding the true type is more of a concern, which may well be among the ﬁrms in
the lowest observable quality distribution (but in such cases, common equity would be much
less attractive for the VC investor).
It is also important to note that there is potential endogeneity of contract choices to expected
exit outcomes, as well as changes in contracts at diﬀerent rounds of VC investment, and

diﬀerent contracts held by diﬀerent syndicated VCs. Regarding potential endogeneity, we
provide three robustness checks in the regression analyses below that exclude investments in the
data for which investment duration from ﬁrst investment to exit is less than two, three and four
years. The greater the time to exit from ﬁrst investment, the less likely that initial contracts are
endogenous to exit outcomes. Also note that our analyses focus on the ﬁnancing terms at the
ﬁrst round investment and how the initial investment terms aﬀect eventual exit. Initial
investment terms dictate the trajectory in which the venture progresses towards exit. In some
cases there are changes in contract terms and/or diﬀerent terms used by follow-on VCs at later
ﬁnancing rounds, but those changes are more likely to be endogenous to expected exit
outcomes. Our empirical strategy relates initial deal terms to exit outcomes in order to mitigate
endogeneity and focus on how deal origination inﬂuences the trajectory towards exit. We did
consider the form of ﬁnance used in later ﬁnancing rounds. Our empirical ﬁndings are quite
robust to either speciﬁcation as discussed further below in Section 4. Alternative speciﬁcations
are available upon request.
We do not have details on these speciﬁc rights in this dataset. Nevertheless, prior work is
consistent with this view. Cestone (2002) argues that common equity with strong investor veto
and control rights would give the investor too great an incentive to intervene in the
entrepreneurial ﬁrm. Casamatta (2003) argues that common equity is used to encourage advice,
whereas convertible claims and contractual control rights tend to be used to facilitate
monitoring. Cumming (2006) ﬁnds evidence consistent with this theoretical work that common
equity is associated with fewer VC control rights.
The low number of IPOs is not related to listing standards; IPO listing standards in Canada are
much lower than those for NASDAQ and the NYSE. See Harris (2006).
Some of the western European countries in the 1990 to 2005 period also experienced periods
with a signiﬁcant increase in the extent of government participation in VC funds; see the EVCA
yearbooks (www.evca.com) as well as Armour and Cumming (2006).
Additional robustness checks with diﬀerent explanatory variables and diﬀerently deﬁned
samples (excluding bubble periods, including non-exits, excluding diﬀerent types of investors,
etc.) are available upon request. A wide variety of alternative speciﬁcations (not presented for
reasons of conciseness) were considered and yielded similar results.
Note however that evidence from the US shows a stronger connection between geographic
proximity and performance (Cumming and Dai 2007), regardless of the diﬀerent control.
It is noteworthy that similar evidence of a correspondence between common equity and IPOs
has been reported in the European VC market (Cumming 2006). Given that similar results are
observed in diﬀerent institutional settings, this provides strong support for Hypothesis 9.
