esearch on the creation of new high-technology companies has typically focused
either on industry-level factors such as market structure and technology regime or
on individual-level factors such as the work experience of entrepreneurs. This study complements these approaches by examining the effect of technological opportunities on ﬁrm
formation. In particular, the study shows that the probability that an invention will be commercialized through ﬁrm formation is inﬂuenced by its importance, radicalness, and patent
scope.
(Entrepreneurship; Patents; Technology Opportunities)

The creation of new ﬁrms is an important mechanism
through which entrepreneurs use technology to bring
new products, processes, and ways of organizing
into existence (Schumpeter 1934). Moreover, recent
research has shown that the rate at which new ﬁrms
are created is increasing in the U.S. economy (Gartner
and Shane 1995), and that the pace of technological
change inﬂuences the rate of ﬁrm formation (Shane
1996). However, inventors do not always start ﬁrms to
exploit technological opportunities. Sometimes they
sell these opportunities (Audretsch 1995); other times
they simply abandon them prior to exploitation
(Roberts 1991). The fact that opportunity discovery
does not correlate perfectly with ﬁrm creation raises
the question of when new ﬁrms are created to commercialize new technological opportunities.
Previous research has provided two categories of
explanations for the creation of new technology ﬁrms.
The ﬁrst is that ﬁrm formation depends on industrylevel factors, such as market structure (Audretsch
1995) or technology regime (Winter 1984). Industrylevel arguments hold that when industries are young,
unconcentrated, composed of small ﬁrms, have limited requirements for complementary assets, have
access to capital, and are not R&D intensive, people
tend to form new ﬁrms to exploit opportunities
0025-1909/01/4702/0205$5.00
1526-5501 electronic ISSN

(Audretsch 1995). The second explanation is that ﬁrm
formation depends on individual-level factors, such
as the psychology of entrepreneurs (Roberts 1991)
or their career experience (Carroll and Mosakowski
1987). Individual-level arguments hold that when
the individuals who discover opportunities are more
experienced in ﬁrm creation (Carroll and Mosakowski
1987), more creative (Schumpeter 1934), more imaginative (Shackle 1979), more risk tolerant (Khilstrom
and Laffont 1979), higher in need for achievement
(Roberts 1991) or more tolerant of ambiguity (Begley
and Boyd 1987), they tend to form new ﬁrms to
exploit opportunities.
Unfortunately, empirical tests to predict the creation
of new ﬁrms on the basis of the characteristics of individuals (see Low and MacMillan 1988, Busenitz and
Barney 1997) or industry (see Geroski 1995, Cohen
and Levin 1989) have provided limited explanatory
power. One reason for these weak empirical results
is that industry and individual-based explanations
fail to consider the nature of the opportunity discovered. Technological opportunities differ from each
other on several dimensions, which inﬂuence the decision to found a new ﬁrm. Using a unique dataset
of 1,397 inventions patented by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology over the 1980–1996 period,

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation

I examine the effect of three dimensions of technological opportunities—importance, radicalness, and
patent scope—on the probability that they will be
commercialized through ﬁrm formation.
This paper makes three contributions to our understanding of high-technology entrepreneurship. First,
it provides an empirical test of the effect of technological opportunity on the decision to establish a
new ﬁrm. Such a test complements existing explanations of new ﬁrm formation that examine only
industry or individual-level factors. Second, the study
disentangles the behaviour of established ﬁrms entering new markets from the behaviour of independent entrepreneurs. Although previous research has
shown that new entrants are more likely to adopt
certain technologies than are incumbent ﬁrms, this
research has confounded established ﬁrms entering
new markets with independent entrepreneurs. This
study shows that independent entrepreneurs make
similar exploitation decisions to those of new entrants
in general. Third, this study controls for individuallevel factors in the examination of ﬁrm formation.
Most studies of ﬁrm formation in high-technology
settings assume away learning curves and individuallevel variation in preferences for ﬁrm creation, and
treat all potential entrants as equally willing and
able to exploit an opportunity by founding a company (Audretsch 1995, Caves 1998). However, extensive research shows that entrepreneurship involves a
signiﬁcant component of learning-by-doing (Carroll
and Mosakowski 1987). This ﬁnding means that whoever obtains decision rights over a new technology
can inﬂuence the mode of commercialization. This
study improves upon prior examination of the ﬁrmformation decision in technology settings by controlling for the attributes of the individuals making the
commercialization decision.
I have divided the paper into three sections. In
the next section, I explain why dimensions of technology opportunity should inﬂuence the decision to
found a ﬁrm. In the third section, I describe the
dataset and the methods used for analysis. In the ﬁnal
section, I summarize the ﬁndings and discuss their
implications for future research and the practice of
entrepreneurship.

Theoretical Development

The linkage between technological change and ﬁrm
formation is one of the oldest relationships in the
study of business organization. Schumpeter (1934)
argued that the creation of new technology ﬁrms that
displace incumbent ﬁrms through a process of creative destruction is a major source of innovation in
a capitalist system. In particular, Schumpeter argued
that the process by which independent entrepreneurs
use exogenously created inventions to produce new
goods, services, raw materials, and organizing methods is central to understanding business organization,
the process of technical change, and economic growth.
Subsequent research in the Schumpeterian tradition has expanded the complexity of this framework
by incorporating the possibility that entrepreneurial
opportunities will be sold in markets (Casson 1982)
or abandoned prior to exploitation (Roberts 1991).
Consideration of multiple phases in the invention-toﬁrm creation process has led researchers to propose
three categories of factors that inﬂuence the decision to exploit an invention through ﬁrm creation:
the nature of the individual making the decision
(Roberts 1991), the nature of the industry in which
the opportunity would be exploited (Audretsch 1995),
and the nature of the opportunity itself (Henderson
1993). In the decades since Schumpeter’s seminal
work, economists of technical change have tested
the effects of numerous industry characteristics on
ﬁrm formation (Audretsch 1995). Similarly, applied
entrepreneurship researchers have tested the effects
of a variety of individual attributes on ﬁrm formation
(Roberts 1991). To date, however, researchers have not
directly examined the effect of the attributes of new
technologies themselves on ﬁrm formation.
Nevertheless, researchers working in the related
area of technological innovation and industry entry
(e.g., Christiansen and Bower 1996, Lerner 1994,
Audretsch 1995) have proposed several attributes of
technological opportunities that could inﬂuence the
probability that new ﬁrms will be created to exploit
them. This paper explores three of these attributes:
importance, radicalness, and patent scope.1

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation

Importance measures the magnitude of the economic value of an invention. Radicalness measures
the degree to which an invention, however large or
small in economic value, differs from previous inventions in the ﬁeld. Patent scope measures the breadth
of intellectual property protection for the invention,
however large or small its economic value, and however similar or different the invention is to previous
inventions in the ﬁeld.
Both prior research and ﬁeld interviews conducted
with MIT inventors indicate that each of these
attributes captures a different dimension of technological opportunity, that entrepreneurs see these
dimensions as conceptually distinct, and that these
dimensions increase the probability of ﬁrm formation.
In the subsections below, I argue why these dimensions of opportunity should inﬂuence the decision to
create a new ﬁrm.
Importance. The importance of an invention
should increase the likelihood that a new ﬁrm will be
founded to commercialize it because more important
inventions have higher economic value (Harhoff et al.
1999)2 and, therefore, provide a larger potential payoff to ﬁrm formation. In explaining the decision of a
person to start a ﬁrm, Knight (1921, p. 273) argued
that “the laborer asks what he thinks the entrepreneur
will be able to pay, and in any case, will not accept
less than he can get from some other entrepreneur,
or by turning entrepreneur himself.” For a person
to “turn entrepreneur,” he or she must expect an
entrepreneurial proﬁt which exceeds (a) the opportunity cost of not engaging in other activities (Amit et al.
1995), (b) a premium for the illiquidity that results
from the investment of ﬁnancial resources in a form
that cannot be easily turned into cash (Venkataraman
1997), and (c) a premium for bearing uncertainty
(Khilstrom and Laffont 1979).
Technological change is an uncertain process, in
which developments are sometimes small and other
investigation described here because the paper does not posit a
fully speciﬁed model of the relationship between technological
opportunity and ﬁrm formation.
2

Some inventions may be more important than others because they
have great social value, even if they have little economic value. This
study does not consider the social dimension of importance.

Management Science/Vol. 47, No. 2, February 2001

times large. As a result, the potential economic value
created by technological advances is highly varied
(Trajtenberg 1990). Empirical evidence of the skewness of the distribution of patent value (Pakes 1986)
indicates that most patents have no commercial value
and a few have a large value (Trajtenberg et al.
1997). Consequently, “a great majority of patents are
never exploited commercially, and only a very few are
associated with major technological improvements”
(Cohen and Levin 1989, p. 1063).
Given the skewness in their commercial value, most
inventions do not provide sufﬁcient potential to justify the investment of time and money in the uncertain process of creating a new ﬁrm. Field interviews
with MIT inventors conﬁrmed the effect of this process on inventors’ decision making. When individuals
make what they believe to be important technological discoveries, they anticipate greater economic value
than when they make minor discoveries. Moreover,
inventors point out that the importance of technological discoveries increases their willingness to incur the
opportunity cost of not undertaking other activities,
making illiquid investments in new ﬁrms, and bearing the technical, market, competitive, and ﬁnancial
uncertainty of establishing a new company. Consequently, both the prior theoretical literature and ﬁnegrained case information from inventors suggests that
the more important the inventors’ technical discoveries, the greater their impetus to create new ﬁrms. This
argument leads to the ﬁrst hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1. The more important the invention, the
higher the probability that it will be commercialized
through the establishment of a new ﬁrm.
Radicalness. One of the central concepts in the literature on technological change is that reﬁning and
improving an existing technology (an incremental
improvement) and introducing a new approach to
technical practice (a radical improvement) are fundamentally different things (Reinganum 1983). In
particular, an incremental improvement reinforces
the activities of established ﬁrms, while a radical improvement may undermine those activities
(Tushman and Anderson 1986).
Researchers have argued that independent
entrepreneurs, rather than managers in established

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation

ﬁrms, will be the ones most likely to introduce radical technological developments. Three separate arguments have been put forth for why this should be
the case. First, radical technologies destroy the capabilities of existing ﬁrms because they draw on new
technical skills. Since organizational capabilities are
difﬁcult and costly to create (Nelson and Winter 1982,
Hannan and Freeman 1984), established ﬁrms are
organized to exploit established technologies. Firms
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to change their activities to exploit
technologies based on different technical skills. Therefore, established ﬁrms often choose not to pursue
radical opportunities, leaving them to independent
entrepreneurs. Second, established ﬁrms have less
incentive to invest in the development of technologies that undermine the value of the assets that they
already possess. The desire not to cannibalize existing assets leads established ﬁrms to underinvest in
the development of new technologies (Arrow 1962).
Independent entrepreneurs, with no existing assets
to protect, do not face this resistance to invest, and
are more likely to be the ones to pursue these opportunities. Third, ﬁrms develop routines for ﬁltering
information based on what is likely to be valuable
for what they are doing currently (Henderson 1993).
These routines limit the search process to those technologies which are conceptually close to the technologies with which ﬁrms are currently working
(Podolny and Stuart 1995). Knowledge transfer from
outside is impeded when new information is not the
logical extension of existing knowledge possessed by
the organization. Since radical inventions are often
based on things that are not the logical extension
of the ﬁrm’s internal information, they are difﬁcult
for established ﬁrms to understand and evaluate
(Rosenbloom and Christiansen 1994). Consequently,
established ﬁrms often ﬁlter out information about
radical technologies in situations in which independent entrepreneurs do not.
Field interviews with ﬁfty MIT inventors support
the arguments of the previous theoretical literature.
These inventors explained that the technical skills
upon which an invention draws inﬂuence their decisions to start companies. In particular, these inventors
identiﬁed the problem of market failure in ﬁnding
208

established companies interested in their technological developments when those developments draw
on technologies unfamiliar to established companies.
Moreover, these inventors also pointed out the relative ease of obtaining venture capital funding for
technologies that did not ﬁt with the activities of
established companies, particularly those that had
the potential for generating new industries. Consequently, both the prior theoretical literature and ﬁnegrained case information from inventors suggests that
the more radical the inventors’ technical discoveries,
the greater their impetus to create new ﬁrms. This
argument leads to the second hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2. The more radical the invention, the
higher the probability that it will be commercialized
through the establishment of a new ﬁrm.
Patent Scope. Technological opportunities with
broader intellectual property protection are more
likely to be commercialized through ﬁrm creation.
When an entrepreneur decides to start a new ﬁrm
in response to the invention of a new technology, he
or she typically does not yet possess complementary
assets, like a distribution system, which might provide a competitive advantage in the industry in which
the technology would be exploited (Teece 1986). The
more effectively an opportunity can be protected
against appropriation by competitors, the more likely
the entrepreneur will be to obtain necessary complementary assets before the competitive advantage of
its new technology has dissipated.
Broad patents enhance the probability that the
entrepreneur can protect the technology against
appropriation. Patents provide a legal right to prevent
others from imitating a particular technological development in areas delineated by the patent claims. The
scope of the patent is important because “the broader
the scope, the larger number of competing products
and processes that will infringe the patent” (Merges
and Nelson 1990, p. 839). When a patent is narrow in
scope, the holder of the patent will have less incentive to develop the technology through the creation
of a new ﬁrm because it will have a smaller space of
technology that is protected against imitation by other
ﬁrms (Merges and Nelson 1990).

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation

Although established ﬁrms might also be more
likely to commercialize broad patents, they are
disproportionately
important
to
independent
entrepreneurs who lack complementary assets. “For
small, start-up ventures, patents may be a relatively
effective means of appropriating R&D returns, in
part because some other means, such as investment
in complementary sales and service efforts may not
be feasible. The patents held by a small, technologically oriented ﬁrm may be its most marketable asset”
(Levin et al. 1987, p. 797).
Potential entrepreneurs and their investors appear
to respond to the inﬂuence of patent scope in the ﬁrmformation decision process. Field interviews with ﬁfty
MIT inventors revealed that many of them ask patent
attorneys for a judgement as to the scope of patent
protection before they decide to start new ﬁrms to
exploit their inventions. Moreover, they report that
their investors are concerned with the breadth of
the protection of the technology against appropriability and prefer broader patents in the decision of
whether or not to fund a new venture. Lerner (1994)
also provides large-sample statistical evidence for this
investor effect. He found that patent scope has a
substantive and signiﬁcant impact on the valuation
of venture capital ﬁnanced biotechnology start-ups.
Consequently, both the prior theoretical literature and
ﬁne-grained case information from inventors suggest that the broader the scope of patent protection, the greater the impetus to create new ﬁrms to
exploit inventions. This argument leads to the third
hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3. The broader the scope of the patent, the
higher the probability that the invention will be commercialized through the establishment of a new ﬁrm.

Methodology
Sample
This study examines the population of 1,397 patents
assigned to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) between 1980 and 1996. This population
includes all inventions made by faculty, staff, or students of the university that made material use of MIT
property during the course of their development.
Management Science/Vol. 47, No. 2, February 2001

I focus on patented inventions rather than other
entrepreneurial opportunities in this study for several
reasons. First, by looking at patents, I can examine
the decision to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities
in a setting in which I have information both about
who discovered the opportunity and the discovery
itself. Second, the population of patented inventions
is recorded, mitigating selection biases that plague
much of the survey and case study work on the
commercialization of new technologies, particularly
in the context of ﬁrm formation. Third, patents have
been studied in many contexts other than ﬁrm creation, providing comparability of the results to ﬁndings about other aspects of technological change.
I examine MIT’s inventions from the 1980–1996
period for several reasons: First, universities are not in
the business of manufacturing products or providing
services (other than education). They do not refrain
from patenting to protect new knowledge through
trade secrets, refrain from licensing for competitive
purposes, collect patents, or cross-license (Henderson
et al. 1998). Therefore, one can examine the process
of ﬁrm creation in response to technical discoveries
by universities absent the biases that would occur
from the examination of patents belonging to companies. Second, university research is an important
source of new knowledge (Winter 1984) that is particularly relevant to economic growth (Caballero and
Jaffe 1993, Romer 1990). Therefore, the study of ﬁrm
creation to exploit university inventions is important
in its own right, even if results cannot be generalized to other settings. Third, the post-1980 period follows a change in federal law granting universities the
property rights to federally funded inventions. Since
federally funded inventions account for roughly 70
percent of all university inventions, this change provided a strong incentive to universities to commercialize their inventions (Henderson et al. 1998). Therefore,
the post-1980 period is an important one in which to
understand university ﬁrm-formation activity.3
Analysis
I use event history analysis to examine the probability that each patent results in the formation of a

new ﬁrm. When a patent is issued, a spell begins.4
The spell continues until a ﬁrm is formed. If a patent
does not result in ﬁrm formation, it is treated as censored. Because each patent is observed until a ﬁrm is
formed or until the observation period ends, the 1,397
patents generate 9,002 case-year observations. I use
Cox regression to analyze the data because I make no
claims about the functional form of time dependence.
The analysis incorporates both time-varying and timeinvariant covariates, which are speciﬁed below.
Dependent Variable: Firm Formation
I used the MIT Technology Licensing Ofﬁce records of
its licensees to construct the dependent variable. The
MIT records indicate the legal status of the licensee,
and therefore the ability to identify its year of incorporation. The dependent variable was coded 1 in the
year that the patent was ﬁrst licensed if the patent
was licensed to an (unincorporated) individual or was
licensed to a ﬁrm that was incorporated after the
patent application was submitted. If these conditions
were not met in a given year, the patent was coded
as 0 in that year.5
This coding scheme allowed two types of licensees
to be coded as new ﬁrms. The ﬁrst type was an
(unincorporated) individual who licensed the patent.
The second type was a new ﬁrm incorporated to
commercialize the MIT invention. Under this coding
arrangement, two types of patents are treated as censored: patents granted to MIT, but never licensed,
and patents licensed to an already incorporated company (e.g., Sony). Twenty-six percent of the patents
were licensed to “new ﬁrms” during the period of
investigation.
Predictor Variables
Radicalness. Following Rosenkopf and Nerkar
(1999), I measure the radicalness of the patent as
a time-invariant count of the number of three-digit
patent classes in which previous patents cited by the

Since MIT has no records of ﬁrm formation for patents that were

given patent are found, but the patent itself is not
classiﬁed. Citations inﬂuence the legal boundaries of
the property rights to an invention (Jaffe et al. 1993).
Patents are divided into approximately 100,000 ninedigit patent classes, which aggregate to approximately
600 three-digit classes, and which represent distinct
technical areas (Jaffe et al. 1997). The assignment of
a patent to a particular patent class represents the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce’s (USPTO’s) assessment that the patent belongs in a particular technical
ﬁeld. Patent examiners also determine what previous inventions must be cited in a patent by searching prior patents. Because patents belong to technical
classes and because they cite previous patents, citations to patents in particular technical ﬁelds represent
the USPTO’s assessment that a particular invention
builds upon (cites) knowledge in that technical ﬁeld.
When a patent cites previous patents in classes other
than the ones it is in, that pattern suggests that the
invention builds upon different technical paradigms
from the one in which it is applied.
Importance. Following Henderson et al. (1998),
I measure the importance of a patent as a timeinvariant measure of the total number of citations
that the given patent received from subsequent patents
from patent issue until 1997. The use of a timeinvariant measure of citations provides both advantages and disadvantages in the examination of the
economic value of patents. A time-invariant measure of citations captures the idea that inventions
have a distribution of underlying economic value at
the time of invention. It is this underlying economic
value to which people respond in making the decision
whether or not to found a ﬁrm. A time-varying measure of citations would fail to capture this underlying
economic value because it would consider all patents
as having the same importance (zero) at the time of
invention.
However, a time-invariant measure of citations
does not treat all patents equally. A patient issued
in 1996 has had only one year to be cited, whereas
a patent granted in 1980 has had seventeen years to
be cited. Although controlling for the technical ﬁeld
and the year of patent ﬁling (or issue) incorporates
the effect of time and technology into the measure of

importance, these controls do not allow the researcher
to directly measure the relative importance of one
patent as compared to another. Therefore, I also examine an alternative speciﬁcation of importance: the total
number of citations that the given patent received
from subsequent patents from patent issue until 1997,
divided by the number of citations received by an
average university patent of that age and in that technology ﬁeld.
Research conﬁrms the construct validity of the
importance measures. Patent citations are signiﬁcantly correlated with the economic value of inventions. Harhoff et al. (1999) found that the higher the
estimated private value of an invention, the more the
patent was cited by later patents. Hall et al. (1998)
found that companies with highly cited patents have
higher stock market values, all other things being
equal.
Researchers familiar with the journal review process might question the use of citations on the
grounds that inventors might cite friends to help them
or enemies to describe their work as inadequate or
trivial. However, this problem is unlikely to occur
with patent citations. Jaffe et al. (1993) explain that
gratuitous citations in patent applications are costly to
inventors. Patent citations determine the scope of the
inventor’s monopoly and unnecessary citations limit
what the inventor can claim as his or her monopoly
right. Moreover, even if the inventor were to include
these citations, the patent examiner’s job requires the
correct citation of previous patents. Hence, the examiner (unlike the editor of an academic journal) has a
sworn duty to remove gratuitous citations from the
patent before it issues.
Scope. Following Lerner (1994), I measure patent
scope as a time-invariant count of the number of international patent classes into which the USPTO assigns
a patent. Lerner (1994) explained that because international patent classes are nested, the more classes
to which a patent is assigned, the broader is its
intellectual property protection. Lerner (1994) provided construct validity for this measure by showing that venture-capital-backed-biotechnology ﬁrms
with broader patents, as measured by a count of
Management Science/Vol. 47, No. 2, February 2001

four-digit international patent classes, received higher
valuations.6
Control Variables
Firm-Founding Experience. I measure ﬁrm-founding experience as a time-invariant estimate of the log
of the average number of prior MIT ﬁrm-founding
inventions across the set of inventors on the patent.
I control for founding experience because several
researchers have demonstrated that the probability of
starting a ﬁrm increases with entrepreneurial experience (e.g., Evans and Leighton 1989, Carroll and
Mosakowski 1987). Prior experience provides knowledge about resources that help to start new ﬁrms,
entrepreneurial skills, and reputations that help to
inﬂuence the reallocation of resources to the new
venture (Shane and Khurana 1999). This knowledge
inﬂuences the propensity to found ﬁrms because it
increases the expectation of the value that would be
gained from ﬁrm formation.
Patenting Experience. To control for patenting
propensity in the examination of the effect of prior
ﬁrm-founding experience, I also include a timeinvariant measure of the log of the average number
of prior MIT inventions across the set of inventors on
the patent.
Age of the Technology Class. I measure the age of
the technology class as the number of years since the
three-digit patent class was established by the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce. Research has shown
that people are more likely to start new ﬁrms to
exploit a new technology when the technical ﬁeld is
young (Utterback and Abernathy 1975) because the
markets for new technologies are often too small to
interest established ﬁrms, because established ﬁrms
possess learning-curve advantages in mature technologies (Nelson 1995), and because the maturation
of technology makes capital-intensity, the reduction
of production costs, and scale economies important
(Pavitt and Wald 1971).
6
I construct the radicalness measure on the basis of three-digit U.S.
patent classes and the patent scope measure on the basis of international patent classes to make the measures comparable to the measures developed by previous authors (e.g., Rosenkopf and Nerkar

R&D Intensity. I measured R&D intensity in an
industry as a time-varying estimate of research and
development expenditures as a percentage of the
value-added of industry shipments in the three-digit
SIC code, using the research and development expenditures obtained from various years of Science and
Engineering Indicators.7 Previous researchers have
argued that entrepreneurs will be less likely to establish new companies to exploit inventions in R&D
intensive industries (Audretsch 1995) because small
ﬁrms face a scale disadvantage in research and development (Mansﬁeld 1981, Kamien and Schwartz 1975).
Manufacturing Value-Added. I measured the importance of complementary assets in manufacturing
by calculating a time-varying estimate of the valueadded by manufacture in the industry year, using
data from various years of the Census of Manufacturers. Teece (1987, p. 191) explained that “the successful commercialization of an innovation requires that
the know-how in question be utilized in conjunction
with other capabilities or assets    such as marketing, competitive manufacturing, and after-sales support.” Where complementary assets are important in
an industry, entrepreneurs will be less likely to establish ﬁrms to commercialize technology.
Importance of Sales or Service. Another measure
of the importance of complementary assets in an
industry is the importance of superior sales or service
as a competitive advantage. I measured the importance of sales or service in the industry as a timeinvariant industry average score for the Levin et al.
(1987)8 survey item: “In this line of business superior
sales or service efforts are very effective measures of
capturing and protecting the competitive advantages
of new or improved production processes.”

The USPTO does not assign patents to SIC codes. However, the
USPTO has developed a concordance which allows the assignment
of patents to three-digit SIC codes by reference to the patent’s sixdigit technology classiﬁcation. To assign the correct industry variables to the patents, I used the USPTO concordance to identify the
SIC code.
8

Levin et al. (1987) generated line-of-business measures of innovation and appropriability from a survey of R&D managers.

212

Incumbent Innovation. Some industries have
lower rates of new ﬁrm formation than others because
established ﬁrms are the major innovators of new
products and processes in those industries (Acs and
Audretsch 1990). I measured the rate of incumbent
innovation as a time-invariant industry average score
for the Levin et al. (1987) survey item: “Firms within
this business have been a very important source of
contribution to technological progress in this line of
business since 1970.”
Market Segmentation. New ﬁrms often successfully enter markets with new technologies by targeting the niche customers, because large ﬁrms allocate
resources for innovation to satisfy the demands of
their major customers (Christiansen and Bower 1996).
Therefore, the ability of new ﬁrms to enter industries
depends, in part, upon the degree to which markets
in those industries are segmented. Using data from
the Levin et al. (1987) survey of research and development managers, I measured market segmentation as
a time-invariant industry average score for the Levin
et al. (1987) survey item: “designing markets for speciﬁc market segments” is a very important technological activity for the line of business.
Capital Availability. An important source of capital to start new technology companies is venture
capital. To measure the availability of venture capital across industries, I included a time-varying estimate of the amount of venture capital funding as a
percentage of industry shipments in the three-digit
SIC code, using data obtained from Securities Data
Corporation’s venture capital database and the Commerce Department’s Survey of Manufacturers. I used
Securities Data Corporation’s concordance between
its proprietary industry scheme and SIC codes to map
the data by SIC code. I include this control because
entrepreneurship is less likely to take the form of new
ﬁrms when capital market imperfections make it difﬁcult for independent entrepreneurs to secure ﬁnancing (Cohen and Levin 1989).
Concentration. I measured industry concentration
as a time-varying estimate of the market share of
the four largest companies in the industry, using

data from the Census of Manufacturers: Concentration Ratios. Since values were available only for 2digit and 4-digit SIC codes, values for three-digit SIC
codes were estimated by taking an average of the
relevant 4-digit SIC codes. A straight-line interpolation was used to determine the values for noncensus years. High levels of concentration in an industry
discourage people from creating new ﬁrms because
concentration enhances the power of incumbents to
attack new entrants and to collude (Geroski 1995).
Firm Size. I measured the size of the ﬁrms in
the industry as a time-varying estimate of the average number of employees per ﬁrm, using data from
the Census of Manufacturers. High levels of minimum efﬁcient scale discourage entrepreneurs from
creating ﬁrms because they raise the cost of entry
(Audretsch 1995). Because new ﬁrms that enter a market at below minimum efﬁcient scale must operate
at a cost disadvantage vis-a-vis established ﬁrms, the
greater the amount of production that is necessary
before a ﬁrm reaches minimum efﬁcient scale, the less
likely entrepreneurs should be to enter that market
(Weiss 1976).
Technical Fields. The patents examined in this
study had their primary U.S. patent classiﬁcation in
188 different three-digit patent classes. Since attempts
to control for such a large number of classes creates incidental parameter bias, I control for technical
ﬁeld using the modiﬁed version of Scherer’s (1965)
classiﬁcation scheme common in many patent studies (Cohen and Levin 1989). I include dummy variables for mechanical inventions, electrical inventions,
chemical inventions, and drugs (the other is the omitted ﬁeld). I include these variables because citation
patterns vary across technologies, necessitating the
controls to measure importance correctly (Henderson
et al. 1998). Moreover, ﬁrm-formation rates vary substantially by type of technology.
Time. I control for the year of patent application. Since citation patents vary over time, this control is necessary to measure importance accurately
(Henderson et al. 1998). Moreover, changes in federal
law and MIT policy have changed the incentives for
ﬁrm formation over time.
Management Science/Vol. 47, No. 2, February 2001

Results

The descriptive statistics are reported in Table 1.
Table 2 provides the distribution of ﬁrm-formation
patents by year of patent issue. This table demonstrates a clear trend towards an increase in ﬁrmformation patents over time.
Table 3 provides the correlation matrix. It shows
that the highest correlation between any two of the
independent variables is r = 056 between previous
patents and previous start-ups. This level of correlation indicates that problems of multicollinearity are
unlikely to be manifest in the data. Moreover, the
table also indicates a low correlation between the radicalness, importance, and patent scope measures. This
low level of correlation provides support for the argument that these three measures capture independent
dimensions of technological opportunity.
Table 4 reports the effects of technology attributes
on the likelihood of ﬁrm formation. I provide six
models. Model 1 predicts the likelihood of ﬁrm
formation on the basis of technical ﬁeld and year
of patent ﬁling. Overall, this model is signiﬁcant (Chi-square = 11204 p < 00001). As Model 1
shows, the technical ﬁeld and year of issue have
strong effects on the probability of ﬁrm formation.
Relative to other technologies, chemical technologies ExpB = 059 p < 0001, electrical technologies
ExpB = 040 p < 00001, and mechanical technologies ExpB = 056 p < 005 are less likely to lead
to ﬁrm formation, and drug technologies ExpB =
138 p < 005 are more likely to lead to ﬁrm formation. (However, the effects for mechanical technologies and drug technologies are not robust to the
inclusion of other variables in the regression equations). Moreover, the year of patent ﬁling ExpB =
108 p < 00001 shows a signiﬁcant and robust pattern of increasing probability of ﬁrm formation over
time.
Model 2 adds the industry-level control variables. Overall, this model is signiﬁcant (Chi-square =
13540 p < 00001). As Model 2 shows, two dimensions of industry have a signiﬁcant effect on the
probability of ﬁrm formation. First, the greater the
importance of designing for speciﬁc market segments,
the greater the probability of new ﬁrm formation
ExpB = 160 p < 001. This result is consistent with

prior research which argues that new entrants displace incumbent ﬁrms by entering market segments
with radical technologies and then expanding to the
mainstream once they have established a foothold
(Christiansen and Bower 1996). (However, the effect
for market segmentation is not robust to the inclusion of other variables in the regression equations).9
Second, the greater the average ﬁrm size in the
The lack of robust effects for several industry variables should
be interpreted with caution. First, to create industry variables, the
USPTO patent concordance was applied. Since the concordance
is inexact, the lack of effects could result from inexact classiﬁcation of patents to industry. Second, the construction of the industry variables required some averaging of data across ﬁelds and
years which might have mitigated the industry effects. Third, the
industry variables are measured at a relatively high level of aggregation. Fourth, the technology ﬁeld dummy variables may be capturing industry effects.

industry, the greater the probability of ﬁrm formation ExpB = 099 p < 005. This result is counter to
expectations from prior research, which suggests that
new ﬁrm formation should be more likely in industries in which the average size of ﬁrms is smaller.

attributes on ﬁrm formation requires controlling for
inventor attributes.
Model 4 adds the three predictor variables to the
regression equation. Overall, this model is signiﬁcant (Chi-square = 33016 p < 00001). Speciﬁcally, the
results show strong support for the three hypotheses.
More important inventions ExpB = 102 p < 00001
are more likely to be commercialized through the
creation of new ﬁrms (Hypothesis 1). More radical
patents ExpB = 103 p < 001 are more likely to
be commercialized through the creation of new ﬁrms
(Hypothesis 2). Patents with broader scope ExpB =
118 p < 005 are more likely to be commercialized
through the creation of new ﬁrms (Hypothesis 3).
Model 5 tests the alternative speciﬁcation of
the importance measure. It examines the relative
importance of the patent—the deviation from the
average for university patents in the same technological ﬁeld and of the same age.10 Overall, this model
is signiﬁcant (Chi-square = 25191 p < 00001). Moreover, the effect of the relative importance measure is
10

The number of case-years for this regression is 8,420 because
the relative importance measure cannot be calculated for all of the
patents.

Management Science/Vol. 47, No. 2, February 2001

substantively the same as that of the original importance measure ExpB = 103 p < 00001, indicating that the original importance measure is robust.
Finally, the use of the relative importance measure
does not change the signiﬁcance or magnitude of the
coefﬁcients for radicalness ExpB = 104 p < 001 or
patent scope ExpB = 126 p < 005 in any substantive way.
Model 6 predicts ﬁrm formation on the basis of
technological opportunity alone, without controlling
for the time-varying covariates that measure industry characteristics. Since this model predicts ﬁrm
formation on the basis of time-invariant measures
only, I examine a time-invariant Cox regression, with
1,397 spells—one for each of the patents. Overall, this
model is signiﬁcant (Chi-square = 43617 p < 00001).
Moreover, the results are substantively the same as
the results for the time-varying Cox regressions that
control for industry attributes. Patent importance
ExpB = 102 p < 00001, patent scope ExpB =
116 p < 005, and radicalness ExpB = 103 p <
001 all increase the likelihood of ﬁrm formation.
Some researchers might argue that the radicalness
of an invention should have a curvilinear relationship with the probability of ﬁrm formation. Initially,
the argument goes, the probability that an invention will be commercialized through ﬁrm formation
increases as radicalness rises, but beyond a certain
level, it decreases. In unreported regressions, I tested
for this curvilinear relationship. However, the results
supported the linear relationship reported here.
Researchers might also argue that people will be
more likely to forms ﬁrms to exploit radical patents
only if the inventions have signiﬁcant economic value.
In unreported regressions, I also tested the interaction between radicalness and importance. However,
the results did not support the interaction hypothesis.
Finally, researchers might argue that the correct
measure of time to predict ﬁrm formation is the year
of patent issue rather than the year of patent ﬁling
because patents are granted to new companies only
after issue. I tested this alternative speciﬁcation of
time. I found substantively the same results as I found
for the date of patent ﬁling, indicating that the time
measure is robust.

Discussion

This article examined the effect of technological
opportunities on the probability that they would be
commercialized through the creation of new ﬁrms.
Using a unique dataset which examines the population of inventions assigned to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during the 1980–1996 period,
I have shown that three dimensions of technological opportunity inﬂuence the probability of ﬁrm formation. Controlling for who invented the technology,
the characteristics of the industry, the time period
when the technological development took place, and
the nature of the technology, more important inventions, more radical inventions, and inventions with a
broader scope of patent protection were more likely to
be commercialized through the creation of new ﬁrms.

Second, the results of this study may not be generalizable outside the context of university inventions.
While I have no a priori reason to expect that the
results here would fail to apply to other settings,
the empirical examination looked only at one setting.
Consequently, future research is necessary to demonstrate the generalizability of the results.
Third, sampling solely from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology during the 1980–1996 period
might generate results that cannot be generalized to
other universities at other points in time. Location
advantages, ties to the venture capital community,
and intellectual leadership in many technical ﬁelds
might enhance the rate at which MIT inventions lead
to ﬁrm formation.11 Therefore, the results of this study
11

Limitations
This study is not without limitations. First, it uses
proxy variables to measure several of the constructs.
Although previous research and ﬁeld interviews supported the construct validity of the measures used,
future research could corroborate the ﬁndings of this
study by demonstrating similar results through the
use of alternative measures.
216

However, some rough estimates suggest that the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology is representative of the population of universities in terms of start-up activity. The USPTO calculates that
between 1980 and 1996, U.S. colleges and universities were issued
17,647 patents, of which MIT received 1,397, or 7.92 percent. The
Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM 1996) estimates that between 1980 and 1996, 1,444 new companies were
founded to exploit patented inventions to which U.S. universities and colleges were assignees. During that same period, MIT
reported to AUTM that 105 new companies were founded to exploit
patented inventions to which MIT was the assignee. Thus, MIT

should not be generalized to other universities until
future research shows their validity in other university settings.
Fourth, this study cannot determine if the inventions were developed to allow inventors to found
ﬁrms or the founding of ﬁrms resulted from the
development of the inventions. Therefore, the ﬁndings presented here cannot resolve the debate over
whether the existence of technological opportunities
leads to ﬁrm creation or the need to create ﬁrms leads
to the creation of technological opportunities.

represents 7.29 percent of the new companies founded to exploit
inventions to which U.S. universities and colleges were assignees,
in line with its proportion of university inventions.

Implications for Research
The major implication of this study is straightforward.
The probability that an invention will be commercialized through the creation of a new ﬁrm varies
with the nature of the technological opportunity discovered. This ﬁnding enhances the literature on ﬁrm
formation by adding the nature of the technological discovery to previous ﬁndings about the effect of
industry and individual attributes.
The speciﬁc ﬁndings also have implications for
related and future research. This study provides
empirical evidence that technologically more important inventions are more likely to be commercialized
through the creation of new ﬁrms. This ﬁnding is
important because previous research has shown that
patent importance inﬂuences several aspects of technology commercialization and economic growth, but

has not considered the possibility that patent importance would also inﬂuence the decision to establish a new company. In particular, previous research
has explored the relationship between patent importance and knowledge spillovers (Jaffe et al. 1993)
and between knowledge spillovers and economic
growth (Romer 1990). The fact that more important technological discoveries are more likely to be
exploited through the creation of new ﬁrms suggests
that students of technological change should examine the relationship between ﬁrm creation, knowledge
spillovers, and economic growth. While this relationship is precisely the core of Schumpeter’s (1934)
explanation for a capitalist system, the subsequent
empirical and theoretical literature is resoundingly
silent on this central question.
In addition, inventions are more likely to be commercialized through the creation of new organizations
when the scope of patent rights is broader, enabling
the inventor to protect the development against imitation from a broader range of competing technologies.
This result demonstrates that inventors are inﬂuenced
by the breadth of intellectual property protection in
making the decision of whether or not to start a
ﬁrm to commercialize their inventions. This ﬁnding
is important because it extends research about the
effect of patent scope (Lerner 1994) to a broader
context than biotechnology and to broader questions about ﬁrm formation than just venture capital
ﬁnancing.
Finally, the ﬁnding that inventions are more likely
to be commercialized through the creation of new
ﬁrms when the inventions are technologically more
radical extends the work of strategic management
researchers (Tushman and Anderson 1986) and students of technological change (Henderson 1993).
These researchers have argued that new entrants are
more likely than incumbents to commercialize radical
technologies. This study shows that the radicalness of
technology also inﬂuences the decisions of independent entrepreneurs to create new companies. While
previous research suggested the plausibility of this
argument, this study provides the ﬁrst empirical evidence to support it.
The results also provide support for the position
of applied entrepreneurship researchers, who have
218

argued that ﬁrm formation from technlogical change
cannot be accurately explained without consideration
of the individuals who possess decision rights over
inventions (Roberts 1991). These researchers have
argued that one of the reasons for poor results for
theories of new ﬁrm entry has been the failure to
incorporate individual-level heterogenity into theories of technological change and industry entry. The
results of this study provide support for a recent
strand of individual-level research on entrepreneurship. Career experience inﬂuences the propensity to
use ﬁrm formation as a mechanism to commercialize
a new technology (Shane and Khurana 1999, Carroll
and Mosakowski 1987). These results suggest that
future empirical research on technical change should
incorporate the role of the entrepreneur.
Normative Implications
This study examined ﬁrm formation in the context
of university technologies and provides some useful implications for the management of that process.
First, universities earn revenues from the commercialization of technology and therefore adopt policies to
enhance it. Many university policies regarding startup organizations differ from those regarding established organizations. For example, some universities
are willing to take equity positions in start-up organizations to commercialize university inventions; and
licensing ofﬁcers play an important role in brokering
relationships between faculty entrepreneurs and the
venture capital community (Shane and Cable 1998).
Consequently, knowledge of which inventions are
more likely to be commercialized through the creation
of new organizations may prove useful in determining university policies toward ﬁrm formation.
Second, from a management science perspective,
an understanding of which inventions are commercialized through the creation of new ﬁrms is also
important to potential entrepreneurs. The creation of a
new ﬁrm to commercialize a university invention is a
costly exercise that requires signiﬁcant investment of
time and capital. Consequently, an understanding of
which technology opportunities are most often commercialized through ﬁrm creation is useful to university researchers who have to make a decision about
how to commercialize their inventions.

Technological Opportunities and New Firm Creation

Conclusion
This paper showed that three attributes of
technology—importance, radicalness, and patent
scope—inﬂuence the probability that an invention
will be exploited through the creation of a new ﬁrm.
This ﬁnding generates several important implications
for development of theory about, and the practice of,
entrepreneurship. Hopefully, future researchers will
consider the attributes of technological opportunities
presented here to generate a robust explanation for
technology entrepreneurship.
