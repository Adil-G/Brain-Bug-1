Venture capitalists have traditionally heavily weighted the previous experience, especially entrepreneurialexperience, of the lead entrepreneur
in their evaluation of the attractiveness of new ventures. This study quantitatively measures the relative early peeomnce impactof this experience
factor as well as the impact of several other experience and Jinn characteristics. Measurements were obtained on the environment, strategy,
type of organization, entrepreneur’spersonal@ and attitude, and various measurementson the experience of entrepreneurand the team. The data were obtained in personal interviews with the chief
executivesof 52 new technical ventures in the New York/NewEngland area.
The entrepreneurialexperience, namely the numberof previous new venture involvementsand
the level of the managementrole played in such ventures was by far the most signi@cantfactor. Other
experiencefactors such as age, years of business, management, and technical experience, various
dimensionsof the entrepreneurialteam’sexperience,etc., were not signijfcantlyrelated to performance.
Interestingly,advanced education beyond the bachelor’s &gree did not help but was negatively
related to pet$ormance. The best way to learn about making a company successfulis to work in, or
better to run a new firm.Time spent in new ventures is dramatically more valuable than time spent
in school or large firms. Thereforeventure capitalists are correct in emphasizingprevious entrepreneurialexperiencein their evaluation. On the other hand, general business, management,or technical
experiencemay be over-emphasizedin a venture capitalist’s evaluations. Also those considering an
entrepreneurialcareer would be wise to seek involvementor employmentin new or newly established
firms.
Although the average personality of the entrepreneurs was similar to that observed by other
researchers,personality was not a factor in Jirm peflormance. Certain personal@ types might tend

INTRODUCTION
The overall purposeof this researchwas to continuethe search for answersto the question:
whatare the factorsthat contributeto successin new technicalventures?Thereis considerable
interestin new ventures, especiallytechnical ventures, because of the role they play in job
creationandeconomicgrowth.The uniqueproblemsof newventurecreationare compounded
by the complexity,dynamism, and demandingrequirementsof the technologyand of those
who produceand use it.
This research is similar to our prior work (Stuart and Abetti, 1985, 1987), but the
researchframeworkhas been broadenedand refined by using a contingencymodel similar
to that of Miller(1986),who suggesteda numberof gestaltsor patternsof strategic,structural,
and leadershipconfigurationsappropriate to different environmental situations. It is hypothesizedthat these configurationslead to successfulenvironmentaladaptationwhich, in
turn, leads to economicsuccess. A review of contingencyresearch suggestedthat the most
importantdomainswere: 1) environment,2) strategy, 3) organizationalstructureand characteristics,4) the entrepreneur’spersonalityand experience,and 5) performance.This paper
presentsthe resultson the leadership.The results on strategyand organizationare presented
elsewhere(Stuart and Liefer, 1988;Stuart and Lynch, 1988).
THE ENTREPRENEURMANAGER
The top management’svalues, beliefs, and capabilitieshave been highlightedas a crucial
determinantin the developmentof a firm’s strategy. Miller and co-workers(Miller, Ket de
Vries and Toulouse, 1982; Miller, 1983; Miller and Toulouse, 1986) have included chief
executive personality factors (flexibility, need for achievement, and locus of control) as
variablesin their field studies.
The new ventureliterature, both academicand popular, stressesthe importanceof the
entrepreneur.The research on entrepreneurscan be categorizedin three
entrepreneur’spersonality, 2) the entrepreneur’sbackground,and 3) the
neurial venture.
A numberof authors have reviewedthe psychologicalresearch. Sextonand Bowman
(1986)have been conductingan extensiveseries of studiesusing a variety of psychological
test instrumentsulthrately focusingon the Jackson PersonalityInventory (JPI) and Jackson
PersonalityResearchForm-E (PRI-E). They identifieda set of characteristicsthat seem to
differentiatebetwwn entrepreneursand managers. ‘Weused four of the nine Sexton and
Bowmancharacteristics:energy, risk taking, autonomy, and social adroitness.
In additionto the psychologicalcharacteristics,numerousresearchershave investigated
the backgroundof the entrepreneur.Items such as the existenceof role models, age, some

form of displacement,and significanteducation(master’slevel for technical enmprenem)
have been identifiedas factors. The entrepreneur’sexperiencehas also been found to be an
importantfactor. Sykes (1986), in a sample of 37 internal ventures, found a very strong
correlationbetweenfinancialsuccessand both managementand sales experience.Stuart and
Abetti(1987)found that experiencematch was stronglyrelated to initial successin a sample
of 24 new technical ventures.
In addition to the psychologicalcharacteristicsand backgroundresearch, anotherinterestingapproachis representedby the work of Smith (1967). He proposeda classification
of entrepreneursas “craftsmanor opportunist,”dependingon whethertheir backgroundand
orientationwere more restrictedor expansive and future oriented.
Karl Vesper (1980) also analyzed success factors beyond those discussedearlier. Not
only experience,but a variety of experience in different functional areas and prior entrepreneurialexperience-even failures-was an indicatorof better petformance.Team building, eitherwithinthe new ventureor throughbuildinga networkof advisersand connections
was a desirablecharacteristic.
Sandbergand Hofer (1982, 1986) have extensivelyinvestigatednew ventures with a
heavy focus on the strategic dimensions. Their preliminary study of eight new ventures
showedthat ventures were more successful in industries with 1) more heterogeneousor
differentiatedproducts, 2) barriers to subsequententry, and 3) evidenceof disequilibrium.
The continuationof the work built upon some of the previously publishedstudies through
interviews of venture capitalists to highlight the importanceof the venture’s strategy and
the industrystructure as importantinvestmentcriteria.
MacMillan,Siegel, and Narasimha(1985) surveyed 100 venture capitalistsand identified the more important investmentdecision criteria. When they examinedthe characteristics, which, if lacking, would lead to rejection of a potential investment,they found that
five of the ten essential factors had to do with entrepreneursthemselves.Thus, they demonstratedthe venture capitalist’s strong dependenceon the entrepreneur’spersonality and
experienceand lesser dependenceon the market, product, and strategy.
The variablesused in this study, as a resultof the reviewof prior research,are presented
in Table 1. In addition, a number of dimensionscharacterizingexperiencewere derived

METHODOLOGY
The basic researchtechniqueused was a cross-sectionalanalysisof a sampleof new technical
ventures. Data were gatheredprimarilyby personal interview with the chief executives of
the new venturesusing a questionnairedeveloped largely based on variablesand individual
items used by priorresearchersworking in similar or relatedfields. Most of the items used
a 7-point Likert-likescale.

Sample
Thesamplewas largelydrawnfrom the newly publishe_aJ
CorpTechdata base, compiled ad
published by Corporate
TechnologyInformationServices, Inc. of WellesleyHills, Massachusetts. The database has informationon over 12,000 public and private technical hs
in the UnitedStates and is updated on an annual basis. All of the fkms are technically
oriented.
A sampleof approximately150firmswas selectedfrom the data base. Due to logistical
reasons,only companiesin the New England-NewYork area were used in this study. Firms
werefirstcategorizedby year and then randomly selected within each year. The resulting
sample then was checked to see that there was a reasonable number of fhms within an
industryortechnology.Becauseabouthalfthefirmsin the CorpTechdata base are computeroriented,they were the largest number in the sample, and other industries were scantily
represented.
Therefore,additionalnoncomputer-based
companieswereselectedon a random
basis. The samplethen was checkedto see that there was a good distributionby age of firm,
industry, firm employment,and firm sales level. The distributionappearedreasonable.
The executiveswere asked to disqualify themselvesif they did not meet the criteria,
i.e., a technicalfirm, with threeor more employees,foundedin 1982or later. A considerable
number of firms were apparently out of business or perhaps never really got started,as
evidencedby returned mail and/or disconnectedtelephones. Also a reasonablenumber of
firmsdisqualifiedthemselvesas too small or too old. Of the qualifiedfirms determinedto
still exist, 45% agreed to participatein the study. Of those that declinedto participate, !.,e
large majority indicatedtheir reason was lack of time.
Fifty-two qualified firms participated in the study and provided the necessary information.The distributionof characteristicsof participatingfirmswas similarto the distribution
of the solicited firms, leading us to conclude that the participatingfirms are representative
of the firm population. However, as noted, this populationdoes have a New Englandand
GreaterBoston bias.

performance) were not used. The measured values were comparable to previously reported
values. There was a reasonable variation in the measurements as well. See the Appendix
for a tabulation of the characteristics of the variable measurements.

Based on their measured characteristics, the organizations were classified into categories of
“simple ))) “organic,” and “formal” [similar to Mintzberg’s (1979) categories of simple,
adhocracy, and bureaucracy.] The patterns of organizational characteristics were, in fact,
largely similar to those predicted by Mintzberg and others. There were significant performance differences between the firms with different organizational types, as noted in Table
3. The formal firms were doing better, the simple firms worse, and organic firms were
performing close to the mean. For further discussion of the organizational .findings, see
Stuart and Liefer (1988).
The performance variable reported is QPRQGS (quantified performance), which reports
the performance of each firm versus the total group on a standardized scale, (0 +. 1). This
variable is an average of 1) growth in revenues, 2) growth in performance, 3) profitability,
and 4) productivity (revenues per employee), all on a standardized basis. A factor analysis
of this variable showed that it could be decomposed into two factors, which explained 83%
of the variance. Factor rotation showed that the two variables were 1) a growth factor (sales
and employment growth) and 2) a profit factor (profit and productivity). The factors and
item loadings were comparable, suggesting that a simple average of the two factors (or four
variables) was a satisfactory representation of a composite ‘“growthand profit” performance
measure.
stra&?gic cla$&&ation
The firm’s strategy was classified based on their measured emphasis on innovation, marketing, or cost. The innovation variable is a reflection of the emphasis on innovation, product
leadership, and expenditures on R&D, thus reflecting a technical differentiation strategy.
Innovation was split into three ranges which were expected to have approximately equal
numbers with separation points at: 1) the mean value plus one half a standard deviation,
and 2) the mean minus one half a standard deviation. Similarly, the market differentiation,
cost, and breadth variables were trichotomized at the mean & one half a standard deviation.
The firm’s strategic emphasis was then determined based on their relative scores on one or
more strategic measures with the results noted in Table 4. The various combinations
of strategy types and organizational types also showed differing levels of performance
(Table 5).

Envimnmentd Effi
It was observed that the product life cycle stage was the most significant environmental
factor. An innovation strategy was successful in the introduction stage but not later. Marketing
was not a successful strategy during the introduction stage but was more successful later.
Surprisingly, a cost-oriented strategy was successful in all stages.
Barriers to entry were associated with better performance. Most entrepreneurs viewed
themselves as insiders, due to previous experience in their industry, and thus considered
barriers as protective devices. These and other environmental factors will be reported and
discussed elsewhere.

Chamcteristics of the Entrepreneur
The intent of this paper was to explore more fully the characteristics of the entrepreneur
and also the management team. Table 6 presents a listing of the average values of the
measurements on the leader and the team. In general, the &ms in the sample were started
by mature, experienced individuals, supported by experienced teams.
There were a number of measurements obtained on the characteristics of the entrepreneur. Most significant was the entrepreneurial experie
variable (Enterex) composed
of: 1) involvement in previous ventures, 2) number of ventures started, 3) number of
successful ventures, and 4) the role played in such ventures. Also an opportunistkraftsman
entrepreneurial attitude (Cooper and Dunkelberg, 1986) was determined by adding up the
number of opportunist goals and attitudes ranked high from a mixed list and subtracting the
number of craftsman goals and attitudes selected. If an entrepreneur’s opportunist orientation
was more than one half standard deviation below the mean, he or she was classified as a
craftsman (n = 16). The rest were classified as opportunists (n = 36).

(XI= 36).
A personality measure was determined as a composite of responses to the personality
measurements of Risk Tolerance, Need for Autonomy, Energy Level, and Social Adroitness.
Individual measures were standardized against the managrientrepreneur values observed by
Sexton and Bowman (1986). Following the technique of Drazin and Van De Ven (1985),
a statistical distance from the entrepreneurial typology of Sexton and Bowman was calculated
(square root of the sum of the squared individual distances). Basically this measurement
(PDIS2), if small, indicates that the entrepreneur’s personality profile was close to the
personality profiles of the entrepreneur’s in Sexton and Bowman’s sample. Table 7 compares
the mean values of the personality measurements of this sample versus the managers and
entrepreneurs in Sexton and Bowman’s sample. The mean values of the personality measures
in this sample were reasonably close to the earlier sample.

performance

Interestingly,the educationallevel of the entrepreneurwas negativelyrelated to performance(p = -0.32, p = 0.02). However, this sample was quite well educatedwith all
having at least some college, 15 had master’s degrees and 7 had PhDs.
A rotatedfactor analysis of the experiencevariableswas conducted.A first factor was
composedof the team’s general, management,and technical experienceplus the entrepreneur’s age and general experience.The second factor reflectedthe entrepreneur’sentrepreneurialexperienceand managementlevel. Financialexperience(whichwas usually resident
in the entrepreneur)also loadedon this factor. The third factor was primarilypersonalityrelated, the fourthwas education,and the fifth, an attitudinalfactor (craftsman/opportunist).A
correlationanalysisshowedthat Factor 2 (entrepreneurialexperience,managementlevel and
financialexperience)was relatedto performance,andthe relationshipwasquitesignificant.(p
= 0.005). Factor4, education,wasnegativelycorrelatedwithperformance,but as mentioned,
this wasconsideredto be less significantbecauseall of the entrepreneur’swerewell educated.
A generallinear modelthen was developedto explorethe relative impactof the experienceand managementvariablesversusthe strategyand organizationvariableswhich, as noted
earlier, had been shownto relate significantlyto performance.Becauseentrepreneurialexperience and managementlevel were related to each other, the two significantrotated factors
previouslydescribedwere used. The F values and significancelevels are notedin Table 8. As
expected,factor2, whichrelatedto entrepreneurialexperienceand managementlevel, stm@y
enteredthe relationship.Factor4, education,was also significant.

As noted earlier, the personalityprofile of the entrepreneursin the samplewas reasonably
close to the profile found by Sexton and Bowman.However,the PDIS2measurementsthat
reflect the extent to which individualentrepreneursdiffered fkomthe profile were not significant. We believe that this means that certain personality types are likely to start new
ventures. However, the extent to which entrepreneursmatch or deviate from this profile
does not affect performance.
The opportunist/craftsmendimension was very weakly correlated with performance
(p = 0.21). We had expectedthat an opportunistorientationwould favorbetter performance

<-----Page 9----->160

R.W. STUART AND P.A. ABE’ITI

as hadbeen observedby others. However, we had also speculatedthata craftsmanorientation
would favor better performance in firms pursuing an innovation strategy. That is, if a firm
was trying to succeed through an emphasis on new technical products, the product rather
than people orientation of craftsmen would support such a strategy. However, our speculation
was incorrect. The craftsman orientation was not favored under any set of conditions.
In a similar vein, the simple organizational form, which reflected low delegation,
formalization, and controls was also not effective. We interpret this as indicating that lack
of team building and organizational development was related to poorer levels of performance.
There was another variable that was explored unsuccessfully, i.e., experience match.
It was observed during the interviews that the questions weren’t efffective in getting serious
meaningful answers. Analysis of the relationship between performance and match variables
showed no significant relationship, which we ascribe to a measurement deficiency.

DISCUSSION
Inthis
study petiormance was shown to vary significantly with a number of variables
including certain environmental factors, the strategic orientation, the organizationalform,
and characteristics of the entrepreneur. The discussion emphasis will be on the leader’s
characteristics. Discussion of organizational and strategic findings are presented elsewhere.
(Stuart and Liefer, 1988; Stuart and Lynch, 19gS).
By far the most significant variable in this study was the entrepreneurial experience
of the leader. This variable reflected the number of previous ventures and the role played
in such ventures. We were not able to identify a differential impact of successful versus
unsuccessful prior ventures because the entrepreneurs claimed that the large majority of
previous ventures were at least marginally successful. A related measurement, the previous
level of managerial experience, similarly showed high correlation with performance. However, this variable was also correlated with entrepreneurial experience and therefore does
not reflect an independent effect. It appears that the high levels of managerial experience
were obtained in entrepreneurial activities, and therefore we are looking at two measurements
of the common factor, upper management experience in entrepreneurial ventures.
It is not surprising that this factor was shown to be related to success. Obviously expe
rience in starting previous ventures provides knowledge on what’s important, how to do things,
contacts, etc. The interesting point is that entrepreneurial experience was the most significant
single variablemore important than any other dimension of the firm or environment.
Somewhat surprising was the lack of correlation of performance with the various
experience measurements. The general level of experience of the entrepreneur, and also
general and particular types of experience of the entrepreneurial team were not significant
with respect to performance. Thus, it is not the amount of experience but the type of
experience that is important. In a similar fashion, the age of the entrepreneur had no
relationship either with performance or with entrepreneurial experience. In this sample of
entrepreneurs, at least, years spent working at nonentrepreneurial tasks were not important
contributors to improved company performance.
The orientation of the entrepreneur (craftsman-opportunist) entered the relationship at
a marginallevel of significance (p = 0.21). This suggests that the craftsman-opportunist
classificationdoes have some use, but that it is less of a determinantof success than other
variablesin the complex equation of new venture performance.
With respect to personality, we observed that our sample, on average, did appear to
have a reasonably close approximation to an “entrepreneurial personality.” In that sense,
this study supports numerous other studies that have measured the personality of entrepre-

<-----Page 10----->IMPACT OF EXPERIENCEON EARLY PERFORMANCE

161

neurs. The interesting finding is that this “entrepreneurial personality” did not appear to be
an important contributor to better performance. Entrepreneurs exhibiting this average profile
did not better thau those who differed. The ability to start a company does not necessarily
lead to success. Perhaps studies of entrepreneurial personalities could be split into two
questions: 1) What does it take to start a new venture? and 2) What does it take to manage
a new company to successful petiormance?
One of the personality measures, Social Adroitness, was negatively correlated with
success. Perhaps the fact that the sample was composed of technical firms might offer an
explanation. Are technical people more responsive to the facts, the realities of a situation,
and less influenced by a manager’s social skills?
It is difficult to explain the negative relationship of education with performance. It
was not that he PhDs were doing poorly. What was interesting was that those with limited
education were doing well. Also education was negatively correlated with entrepreneurial
experience (p = 0.02). Therefore, those who went out and started companies, rather than
going on for advanced education, did better. Experience is the best teacher.
Consideration of the various factors and relationships with performance by organizational type and strategic type did not reveal any important differences. One observation
was that for firms pursuing an innovation strategy, performance was positively related to
general and functional experience level of the teams, as well as to the entrepreneurial and
management level variables. However, the entrepreneurial factor was still more significant.
Otherwise there did not appear to be major differences between the various classes of firms.
Therefore, the conclusion seems to be that, regardless of the strategy or the organizational
approach, previous entrepreneurial experience is still the most important indicator of success
potential in new technical ventures.
