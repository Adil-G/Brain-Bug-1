The internecine war over the relative importance of persons and situations, triggered 40 years ago by
Walter Mischel’s Personality and Assessment, is largely over, so it is time for researchers to develop an
agenda for personality psychology in the postwar era. The possibilities include a return to the status
quo ante characterized by questionnaire-based research, focusing on narrower trait constructs than the
‘‘global” traits that have undergone so much criticism, and concentrating upon within-person variance
(as well as or even instead of between person variance) in behavior. Each of these possibilities offers some
promise but also hazards that may be under-appreciated. The present article suggests that personality
theory and research be re-organized in terms of the personality triad of persons, behaviors, and situations.
A precondition for understanding the elements of this triad is better conceptualization and measurement
of behavior and, especially, situations. While the interactions among these elements may turn out to be
important, a ﬁrst order of business is to understand the main effects of each element, a formidable but
exciting research agenda that will entail a turn to broadly descriptive research rather than the testing
of narrow, isolated hypotheses. Looking further ahead, a post-interactionist personality psychology
may someday recognize that personality is a latent construct only indirectly indicated through behavior,
and the ultimate understanding of that construct will be empirically tested by the ability to predict
behavior in new and unique situations.

1. Introduction
The ‘‘person–situation debate” triggered by the 1968 publication of Mischel’s Personality and Assessment ended as a serious scientiﬁc conversation decades ago (Kenrick & Funder, 1988).
Personality traits are real and important. The days are long past
when anybody who followed the literature could seriously entertain arguments that they exist only in the eye of the beholder,
are mere social constructions, or have relations with behavior that
are too small to matter.
One of the most signiﬁcant passages in Mischel’s book introduced a memorable term:
‘‘. . .the phrase ‘personality coefﬁcient’ might be coined to
describe the correlation between .20 and .30 which is found
persistently when virtually any personality dimension inferred
from a questionnaire is related to almost any conceivable external criterion involving responses sampled in a different medium
– that is, not by another questionnaire.” (Mischel, 1968, p. 78,

The .30 correlation described as an upper limit later was raised
to .40 (Nisbett, 1980), and is better understood than it used to be.
Correlations in this range are now acknowledged to be comparable
to the size of the effects of some of the major demonstrations of the
power of the situation in the social psychological literature (Funder
& Ozer, 1983; Richard, Bond, & Stokes-Zoota, 2003), about the maximum that could be theoretically obtained if behavior has multiple
determinants (Ahadi & Diener, 1989), and enough to yield correct
dichotomous predictions 65–70% of the time (Rosenthal & Rubin,
1982). Even more to the point, measurements of personality –
especially but not limited to measurements of ﬁve key traits of personality – can predict not only speciﬁc behaviors in the lab but also
long-term, important life outcomes (Ozer & Benet-Martínez, 2006;
Roberts, Kuncel, Shiner, Caspi, & Goldberg, 2007).
These important insights might not have been achieved without
the stimulus of Mischel’s controversial phrase. The ‘‘personality
coefﬁcient” was ahead of its time because its coining anticipated
and perhaps helped to instigate the increasing emphasis, in modern research, on effect sizes over signiﬁcance levels (American Psychological Association, 2001, p. 25; Wilkinson & the Task Force on
Statistical Inference, 1999). By reframing the evaluation of consistency of personality in terms of correlation coefﬁcients and the
goal of personality as the prediction of important behavioral

<-----Page 1----->D.C. Funder / Journal of Research in Personality 43 (2009) 120–126

outcomes, Mischel’s book opened to the door to a clearer and more
realistic appreciation of the limits, accomplishments, and opportunities for personality assessment.
While the debate is over, some of its less pleasant residue remains. The (oversimpliﬁed) bottom line of Personality and Assessment was transformed by some into a putative central theme of
social psychology that placed it into opposition with personality
(Ross & Nisbett, 1991). For example, a major introductory psychology textbook tells students that ‘‘one of the most important lessons
of social psychology is that people consistently underestimate the
power of situations in affecting human behavior. . . [the tendency]
to overemphasize the importance of personality traits and underestimate the importance of [the] situation. . . is so pervasive that
it has been called the fundamental attribution error” (Gazzaniga &
Heatherton, 2006, pp. 608–609, emphasis in the original). This passage is not an isolated instance. The exposition of the fundamental
attribution error in almost every introductory textbook enshrines
it as an established piece of the conventional wisdom.
However, there are good reasons to doubt that attributions are
uniformly biased in the direction posited by the fundamental attribution error (Funder & Fast, in press). If we always underestimated
the effect of situations, would not we be shocked by how easy it is
to change others’ behaviors just by adjusting the situation a little?
Would not we be surprised – albeit pleasantly so – by how even
small changes in the household environment can change the
behavior of our children or spouses in the direction we desire, by
how even minor alterations in the classroom situation can improve
students’ study behavior, or by how simple it is to design effective
means to change opinions, lessen crime and promote healthy
behavior? And last, but for a psychologist not least, would not
we be surprised (and delighted) by how consistently our experimental manipulations produce the hypothesized behavioral effects
in our research participants? Instead, of course, we are more often
surprised when massive efforts to affect the behaviors of others –
ranging from personal interventions to government programs to
experimental designs – have disappointingly weak effects. I would
not argue here that the error really runs the other direction, that
personality is more powerful than we think.1 But I will observe –
as anyone can – that while situations are sometimes surprisingly
powerful, sometimes too they are weaker than we might expect or
even wish them to be.
Perhaps the fundamental attribution error will be knocked off it
its high perch only when it becomes so widely accepted (as it
nearly is) that it will be counterintuitive to argue that the error lays
the other way. In the meantime, the most constructive path lies in
another direction. Since the real argument is over, let us unstick
ourselves from the residue of the person–situation debate and
try to imagine what direction personality psychology will and
should take in a postwar environment where it can reunite with
rather than continue to be seen at odds with its historic partner,
social psychology.
2. Restoration of questionnaire research
One possibility for the future of personality psychology is a partial or complete return to the status quo ante, as research was practiced in 1965 or so. The most powerful critique Mischel’s book
offered of personality research as it then existed was that it was
overwhelmingly dominated by questionnaire methods. Mischel
was on to something when he deﬁned the personality coefﬁcient
as a limit on correlations among non-questionnaire measures (he
1
I resist such temptation because an even deeper ﬂaw in the logic of a
‘‘fundamental attribution error,” in either direction, is the mistaken assumption that
persons and situations compete for psychological importance in a zero-sum game
(see Funder, 2006; Funder & Fast, in press).

121

acknowledged that correlations among questionnaire scores are often much higher), and observed how little data were available to
test his claim. But with the battle over the existence of personality
won, some personality psychologists apparently concluded that
they could simply go back to what they were doing before they
were so rudely interrupted.
In some cases, this has meant a return to the potentially fascinating, often sophisticated, analytically rich yet empirically cheap
and relatively easy world of research on questionnaires. With such
data in hand, the analytic possibilities are seemingly endless,
including no end of factor analyses, structural equation models,
and item response curves. Even without these kinds of sophisticated analysis, many researchers have found it temptingly easy –
and in fairness sometimes quite interesting – to hand out a
questionnaire measure of aggressive tendencies (say), and a measure of self-esteem (say), calculate the correlation, and then write
about how much self-esteem attenuates (or enhances) aggression.
Even studies of the ‘‘behavioral correlates” of personality often
turn out, on close inspection, to be studies of behavioral questionnaire correlates (Baumeister, Vohs, & Funder, 2007).
The succumbing to the temptation to gather data that are cheap
and easy is not limited to personality psychologists. Social psychologists too – including some who would view themselves as anything
but trait researchers – surprisingly often conﬁne their ‘‘behavioral”
measurements to check marks on a page or, increasingly in the modern age, clicks on a computer screen. If a researcher is extra ambitious he or she might also measure reaction time, but notice that
this precisely measured number becomes of interest only with the
added assumption that it reﬂects a process that has implications
for real – i.e., potentially consequential – behavior, mostly involving
the larger skeletal muscles and not just the foreﬁngers of each hand.
To be sure, questionnaire data (such as ‘‘S-data,” see Block &
Block, 1980 and Funder, 2007, chap. 2) can shed useful and important light on personality and behavior. In some cases questionnaire
data is necessary and it many cases it is all that is possible (see
Baumeister et al., 2007, for a full discussion), and as part of a research program that uses multiple methods to approach complex
psychological constructs such data can make an important contribution. But, in the end, it is not questionnaire responses or reaction
times that anyone really cares about, and the relevance of these
measures for consequential social behavior will have to be demonstrated rather than assumed. In other words, on its current path,
much of personality and social psychology may be setting itself
up, slowly but surely, for the assault of a second Mischel.

3. Narrower trait constructs
One of the many interpretations I and perhaps others have
heard of the message of Personality and Assessment is that it is a critique not of trait constructs per se, but speciﬁcally of global traits.
To the extent that this interpretation is correct, then Mischel was
part of a movement from the general to the speciﬁc that can also
be seen, for example, in the evolution of Social Learning Theory
from Julian Rotter to Albert Bandura. Whereas Rotter (e.g., 1954)
was interested in Generalized Expectancies, the degree to which
a person might expect to have an impact on any area of his or
her life, Bandura (e.g., 1971) was more prone to focus on whether
someone had the expectancy that he or she could perform some
speciﬁc action, such as stick to a diet or (classically) enter the same
room as a snake. In the realm of trait psychology, the distinction is
between measuring something like sociability, compared to social
skill, compared to social skill at leading a business meeting. As the
predictor becomes closer and closer to being as speciﬁc as the criterion, the predictive validity can conﬁdently (and almost by deﬁnition) be expected to increase.

<-----Page 2----->122

Something about the term ‘‘global trait” does sound unsophisticated and old-fashioned, and narrower constructs certainly appear
more precise, focused, and contextualized. Rather than viewing a
trait as something that affects an individual’s behavior across
many of the contexts of his or her life, it becomes something more
ﬁne grained that depends upon the speciﬁcs of a situation to be
evoked. Mary is dominant, but only at work, not at home. So we
oversimplify if we say she is ‘‘dominant”; rather we should view
her in terms of (at least) two traits, dominant-at-work, and notdominant-at-home. And maybe at home she accedes to her husband’s decisions on what to have for dinner, but not how to spend
money. So now she’s dominant-in-spending-decisions-at-home,
but not-dominant-in-dining-decisions-at-home. Our understanding of Mary is increasing by leaps and bounds, it would seem.
Indeed, this kind of ever-increasing speciﬁcity and precision is
attractive. For that reason some writers have described narrower
trait constructs as an important improvement and advance in
sophistication over their broader, cruder cousins (see Funder,
1991). However, this ever-increasing precision has some costs. As
Albert Bandura once wrote, in a slightly different context:
‘‘Once one starts fractionating the self, where does one stop?
For example, an athletic self can be split into an envisioned tennis self and a golﬁng self. These separable selves would, in turn,
have their subselves. Thus, a golﬁng self can be subdivided into
different facets of the athletic ability to include a driving self, a
fairway self, a sand-trapped self, and a putting self. How does
one decide where to stop fractionating selves?” (Bandura,
1999, p. 194).
Substitute the word ‘‘personality” for the word ‘‘self” in the paragraph above,2 and one problem with having constructs become
narrower and narrower becomes vividly apparent. You can always
get narrower, and narrower is always more precise, so where do
you stop?
But that is not even the worst problem with ever-more-speciﬁc
constructs. The narrower a construct becomes, the less explanation
it offers (Wood, 2007). The increasing ﬁdelity of prediction comes
at the cost of narrowing bandwidth, potentially to the point of circularity. As I have observed elsewhere (Funder, 1991), it seems ironic that global traits are sometimes accused of offering circular
explanations for behavior when really it is narrow constructs that
manifest this vice. If one observes that someone has many friends
and therefore infers that he or she is high on extraversion, then this
may lead to a prediction (via the inference of a global trait) that he
or she will be high on energy and positive affect and will prefer
music to be turned up loud. This prediction might well be wrong,
which is precisely what makes it non-circular and interesting. On
the other hand, if one observes that someone is dominant in business meetings and concludes that this is because the person has
the tendency to be dominant in business meetings, but eschews
further inference, then this conclusion has added little to psychological understanding.
4. Focusing on within-person variance
People are different from each other, but they also differ with
themselves, in the sense that every individual varies how he or
she acts and feels, to some degree, depending upon the situations
in his or her life. A new direction that has been prominently suggested for the future of personality psychology is to alter the traditional focus on between person variance to yield a sharper view of
within-person variance.

2

This substitution is often useful when reading the psychological literature.

This shift in focus is the basic contribution of Mischel and Shoda’s (1995; see also Mischel, 1999) ‘‘if. . .then” conceptualization, in
which each individual is described in terms of the speciﬁc behaviors he or she does under certain circumstances. For example,
someone might be described as being unsociable ‘‘if” in a work situation, but highly sociable ‘‘if” in the home context. In a similar
vein, Fleeson (2001) describes a reconceptualization of personality
traits in terms of frequency distributions of states, so that a sociable person would be described in terms not only of his or her
mean level of sociability, but also the size (standard deviation)
and shape (skew) or his or her distribution of sociable states across
occasions. Recently, Fournier, Moskowitz, and Zuroff (2008) contributed an analysis of how the behaviors of individuals across
the contexts of their lives can be characterized both in terms of
general dispositions and idiosyncratic but stable ‘‘signatures.”
It is obviously true that every individual does vary in what he or
she does and feels depending upon the situation he or she is in, and
equally obviously true that every individual’s exact pattern is unique. The traditional approach to personality traits tends to gloss
over these facts by characterizing people in terms of their average
behaviors across the situations of their lives. Much of the appeal of
Personality and Assessment and of latter-day approaches such as
those by Mischel, Fleeson, and Fournier is that they pay attention
to this facet of behavioral variance that trait approaches ignore
(although Allport, 1937, considered the issue at length). Personality psychology should strive to account for within-person variation
in behavior as well as between person variation, and the approaches just listed, and others, perform a valuable service in
reminding us of this goal (Roberts, 2007).
However, a tight focus on the pattern of behavior within each
individual opens some pitfalls of its own. First of all, some within-person variation is simply error variance. The detection of reliable and therefore meaningful patterns of within-person variance
is statistically handicapped because it depends upon the measurement of a residual, the behavioral variance that remains after general dispositions have had their say. This is probably why, as
Chaplin (1991) noted years ago, robust and replicable person–situation interactions are so difﬁcult to ﬁnd. To be sure, the studies by
Mischel and Shoda, by Fleeson, and by Fournier and his colleagues
all showed some degree of stability to the idiosyncratic behavioral
patterns that individuals manifested over and above their consistent trait levels. But in an informative analysis, Fournier et al.
(2008) noted that while the ‘‘stability estimates [of behavioral dispositions] for all dimensions of behavior hovered around .80” (p.
539), the stability of behavioral signatures was approximately .30
– a number that might sound familiar.
A focus on within-person variance raises other issues, including
questions as to whether it in some respects amounts to a reinvention of Watson’s S-R behaviorist view of personality, or leads inevitably to replacing dispositional constructs with types (Funder,
2006, 2008). However, the most important question facing research on within-person variance is whether it can be shown to
be interesting or useful. It is one thing to identify within-person
patterns that have some degree of stability, as we have seen. It is
quite another to show that these patterns are psychologically
meaningful. Historically, the traditional trait concepts of personality psychology have earned their keep by showing implications in
two directions: the past and the future. One fruitful line of research
concerns the origins of traits, in the interactions between genetics
and environments (e.g., Caspi, Roberts, & Shiner, 2005). The other,
even more implicative, concerns the important patterns of behavior and life outcomes associated with traits (e.g., Ozer & BenetMartínez, 2006, Roberts, et al., 2007). To the extent that stable
patterns of within-person variance can be detected, and that remains
to be seen, the next order of business will be to ask two questions:
Where do these patterns come from? How are they important?

5. The personality triad
One potential way to organize the future agenda of personality
research, including the issues summarized above, might be in
terms of what I have called the personality triad: persons, situations
and behaviors (Funder, 2006, 2008). These are the three terms in
the famous equation proposed by Lewin (1951), B = f (P, S), behavior is a function of the person and the situation. While this equation has sometimes been oversimpliﬁed and misused (e.g., in
attempts to use the analysis of variance to see whether persons
or situations are more powerful), the basic conceptual idea is interesting and important. It implies, in brief, that the best way to
understand a behavior is in terms of who performs it, and the circumstances under which they do so. If we want to understand
aggressive behavior, or altruistic behavior, for example, a promising route is in terms of who acts aggressively or altruistically,
and under what circumstances. Lewin’s formula provides a way
to give both persons and situations their due while avoiding fruitless arguments over which one matters more.
Further, it can be an interesting exercise to arrange the terms in
Lewin’s equation to see if insights into the other two elements of
the triad arise. One rearrangement, P = f (B, S) implies that a good
way to describe a person psychologically might be in terms of
the behaviors he or she performs and the situations in which he
or she performs them. This interaction is consistent with the conceptualization of the person represented by Watsonian behaviorism as well the more recent if. . .then description of personality
and some of the other approaches focusing on within-person variance, discussed earlier.
The other rearrangement, S = f (B, P), suggests that a situation
can be thought about and described in terms of the behaviors
that different people perform within it. This might be the least
immediately obvious of the three interlocking interactions of
the personality triad. But it is not a new idea, having been the
basis of the ‘‘template-matching technique” introduced by Daryl
Bem and myself (when I was a graduate student) in 1978. To use
an example from that paper, the differing environments of two
colleges might be usefully described in terms of the different
kinds of student who tend to do well in each of them. Workplaces or jobs might be described in terms of the people who are the
best ‘‘ﬁt” to them. And particular social situations ranging from
parties to congested freeways could be psychologically characterized by descriptions of the people most likely to enjoy or become frustrated by them.

6. Assessing the elements of the personality triad
To move these conceptions of the personality triad beyond the
level of abstract speculation, some way must be found to operationalize each of its elements for empirical research. This observation draws attention to the fact that while methods for assessing
dimensions of individual differences across persons abound, equivalently-sophisticated, parallel methods for assessing behaviors or
situations are painfully lacking.
The inclusion of behavior in psychological research in social as
well as personality psychology is less common than one might expect (Baumeister et al., 2007), and when it is included the behavioral measure is typically an ad hoc observation of a response or
two particular to the speciﬁc topic under investigation. Even
‘‘behaviorism,” which by its name might lead to an expectation
of a focus on behavior, tended to regard all behaviors as functionally equivalent – salivating was treated much the same as bar
pressing – and did not yield a taxonomy. But not all behaviors
are the same and humans yield a rich variety of them (Furr &
Funder, 2007).

123

The plight may be even worse for situations. While Personality
and Assessment and the conversation it initiated often spoke of
the power of the situation to affect behavior, its magnitude was
typically demonstrated through subtraction. Writers would observe that one or another personality variable failed to account
for all the variance in a particular behavior, and simply assign
the remainder to the situation. As a result, the psychologically active ingredients of situational effects on behavior never received
much speciﬁc attention within personality psychology, not even
from those writers who wished to emphasize how important they
are.
Instead, the psychology of situations, such as it exists, developed within experimental social psychology. A large variety of creative studies manipulated speciﬁc aspects of situations as
experimental independent variables. These variables included such
interesting properties of situations as incentive, experimenter
proximity, and the degree to which someone is in a hurry (see Funder & Ozer, 1983 for a calculation of the size of the effect of these
variables in classic experimental studies). But the psychology of
situations as represented by experimental social psychology remains unorganized. The particular independent variable manipulated in a given study is determined by the content area and
speciﬁc hypothesis that study is designed to address. Across thousands of such studies, no larger scheme organizes the many aspects
of situations that have been demonstrated to be important
(Wagerman & Funder, in press).
It was in an attempt to begin to be part of the solution to these
problems that our lab developed two new Q-sort assessment tools.
Both were inspired and to some degree based upon the California
Adult Q-sort (CAQ) for the description of personality developed
by Block (2008). This instrument includes 100 items such as ‘‘is
critical, skeptical, not easily impressed” and ‘‘has a wide range of
interests,” which clinical experts or lay raters can use to describe
an individual by sorting the items into a forced, symmetric, ninecategory distribution ranging from ‘‘not at all characteristic” to
‘‘highly characteristic.” The CAQ was painstakingly developed over
a period of decades, offers probably the most comprehensive tool
for describing personality that is available, and has an impressive
record of conceptual and empirical success in relation to a wide
range of behaviors in children, adolescents and adults (for several
examples, see Funder, 2007, pp. 187–198).
With this Q-sort as a model, some years ago we developed the
Riverside Behavioral Q-sort (RBQ; Funder, Furr, & Colvin, 2000),
which in its most recent revision (see http://rap.ucr.edu/qsorter/
rbq3.htm) offers 67 variables for the description of social behavior.
The items describe behavior at a level of generality meant to be
intuitively meaningful and intrinsically important, yet also speciﬁc
enough to allow for reliable rating. For example, the items include
‘‘acts irritated” (item 31) and ‘‘behaves in a fearful or timid manner” (item 36). In one study of particular interest, the RBQ was
used to demonstrate the ways in which the behavior changed
across different situations at the same time that the cross-situational consistency of behavior across those same two situations –
as indexed by the maintenance of individual differences – remained high (Funder & Colvin, 1991; see also Funder, 2006).
Originally designed for the description of social behaviors in
two-person interactions in the laboratory, it has recently been
expanded and rewritten in an attempt to make it more broadly
useful.
More recently, we have begun development of the Riverside Situational Q-sort (RSQ, see Wagerman & Funder, in press). The current version includes 81 items meant to describe psychologically
salient elements of a wide if probably not exhaustive range of social situations, including ‘‘situation is uncertain or complex” (item
8) and ‘‘a job needs to be done” (item 23; the complete set of items
can be seen at http://rap.ucr.edu/qsorter/). The intention is for

<-----Page 4----->124

D.C. Funder / Journal of Research in Personality 43 (2009) 120–126

people who have participated in, experienced, or observed a psychological situation to be able to translate their subjective impressions into an empirically usable format with a common vocabulary
– the exact purpose of Q-sort methodology in general (see Block,
2008). The hope is that these descriptions will provide a ﬁrm foundation for subsequent empirical study of the interactions between
persons, behaviors and situations.
A further hope is that this instrument will help to reunite the
complementary methods of social and personality psychology. Social psychological research typically manipulates speciﬁc aspects
of experimental situations, and the difference between the two situations provides the study with its independent variable. Personality research generally uses correlational methods to assess
personality traits and other stable individual differences. The RSQ
provides a potential means to assess the situations that people
experience in real life as well as speciﬁc experimental contexts,
using the same variables. A typical college-student participant
who one day enters a psychological laboratory may be moving
from a classroom environment in the previous ‘‘real life” hour to
a contrived social interaction during the experimental hour, but
from his or her point of view they are just two different situations
each of which can, in principle, be described along common dimensions. It is the goal of the RSQ to provide progress towards understanding what these dimensions are.
7. Agenda for research on the personality triad: three main
effects
Each element of the personality triad interacts with the other
two, producing three unique interactions. But before plunging into
attempts to detect and understand these interactions, with all the
entailed difﬁculties discussed earlier in this article, it might be easier and more fruitful to pause for a bit, and learn more about the
associated three main effects. These three main effects are the relations between persons and behaviors, between situations and
behaviors, and between persons and situations.
P ? B3: What do certain people – meaning (unless one prefers
typologies) what do people with certain levels of particular traits –
generally tend to do? The connection illustrated by the arrow in this
formula refers to the relationship between the assessed level of a
personality construct – which might be based on self-report, peer report, expert judgment and other sources of data – and behaviors that
a person has been observed to perform at particular times and in
particular places. By necessity, establishing this connection will require averaging behaviors across situations, a practice lamented in
the pages of Personality and Assessment. But a personality construct
worthy of the name requires precisely this kind of averaging, to allow the effect of the person on behavior to emerge from and be analytically separated from the effects of particular situations (e.g.,
Funder, 2006, 2008). They can always be recombined later, if analytic
strategy or theoretical purpose so dictates. But as Mischel observed
in 1968, and as remains true today, behavior is surprisingly seldom
directly observed in psychological research (Baumeister et al., 2007),
despite the fact that questionnaires such as those measuring the ‘‘Big
Five” (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008) or the Act Frequency Approach
(e.g., Buss & Craik, 1983) often deﬁne traits in terms of self-reported
behaviors. Using techniques such as the RBQ, an important task for
the immediate future of personality psychology is to begin the
long-overdue task of descriptively mapping the terrain of relation-

3
The arrows in this section should technically be double-headed because the
associated research is correlational. However, there is some usefulness in thinking
about how persons affect behaviors, how situations affect behaviors, and how persons
affect situations, even though instances might be conceivable where the causality
runs the other direction.

ships between personality and behaviors that have actually been observed and, ideally, videotaped. For every trait deemed important or
interesting, we should – but do not – have a list of the behaviors with
which it, on average, across situations, tends to be associated.4
S ? B: The second main effect lies at the core of the ‘‘situationist” view of behavior, which concerns the way in which situations
affect what people do. During the person–situation war, probably
too much attention was given to the question of ‘‘how much” situations affect behavior, and not enough to the question of ‘‘how.” It
is high time to address the latter question. This enterprise requires
variables for the assessment of both situations and behaviors. Candidates for these two roles include the Riverside Situational Q-sort
(RSQ, Wagerman & Funder, in press), and the Riverside Behavioral
Q-sort (RBQ, Funder et al., 2000) described earlier. Preliminary research using these two instruments has found, for example, that
situations that afford the opportunity to be talkative evoke behavior that is not only talkative, as might be expected, but also behaviors that can be described as agreeable, intimate, and socially
skilled.
Much more remains to be done and other, different instruments
could and should be developed to capture the essential elements of
both situations and behaviors. It should be emphasized, again, that
the real situationist agenda is barely begun. Speciﬁcally: which elements of psychological situations affect which behaviors, how, and
why?
P ? S: In what kinds of situations do different kinds of people
tend to ﬁnd themselves or even tend to create? While past writers
have occasionally written about how people differentially sort
themselves into and affect the situations of their lives, little empirical work has followed on this insight, probably because of a lack of
an adequate conceptualization or assessment tool for situations.
The RSQ and other methods may offer a way to make these kinds
of person–situation interactions concrete at last. If we had measures of a sample of individuals’ personalities on the one hand,
and measures of situations that they (on average) experience in a
day, week, month or year on the other hand, we could begin to
map out how the terrain of individuals’ social environments differ
as a function of their personalities, and vice versa. For example, our
own preliminary research using the RSQ suggests that people high
on the trait of Neuroticism are more likely to ﬁnd themselves in
situations that are evocative of rebelliousness, frustration, and hostility. But again, much more remains to be done, including the
development of alternative instruments for exploring the relationship between persons and situations.

8. First things ﬁrst
The research agenda mapped out above will need to overcome
some formidable obstacles. Despite the rise (and partial fall) of
behaviorism, and despite the many odes written to the power of
the situation, psychology is still in the early stages of developing
conceptualizations of behavior that recognize not all behavior is
the same, and that seek to identify the psychologically active ingredients of situations. The translation of these developing conceptualizations into tools for assessing behavior and situations (such as
the RBQ and the RSQ) is also a task still in its early days and much
remains to be done, both to further reﬁne these instruments and to
develop serious alternatives (and hopefully competitors) to them
(Furr & Funder, 2007; Wagerman & Funder, in press).
A massive empirical effort will be required, requiring studies in
which individuals are each placed into or observed in each of a
4
The assembly of such a catalog was at one time proposed as a long-term goal of
the Act Frequency Approach (Buss & Craik, 1983, pp. 199–120), but the project was
never completed.

range of different situations, and their behavior in them observed
and measured directly.5 Studies that do this are almost unknown
in the literature, not really because psychologists do not grasp the
need for them, but because they are so difﬁcult and expensive to
conduct.6 A study of children at a summer camp by Hartshorne
and May (1928), in which the behavior of each child was measured
in a variety of situations, continued to garner an astonishing number
of citations for more than half a century precisely because nobody
had the resources (or perhaps sufﬁcient ambition) to do a study like
that again (for exceptions see Funder & Colvin, 1991 and Shoda, Mischel, & Wright, 1993). But that is precisely the kind of work that is
desperately needed.
And the operational difﬁculties may not even present the most
daunting obstacle. Even if we had adequate conceptualizations and
useful assessment tools for behavior and situations ready to go, today, and the kind of ambitious design and resources for the complex studies needed to empirically assess the relations among the
elements of the personality triad, one more problem would remain.
The research that needs to be done is descriptive. There is nary a
hypothesis to be seen. How are person variables interconnected
to situational variables and behaviors? The hypothetico-deductive
method psychologists were all taught to revere, and that granting
agencies and journal reviewers so often require, is a poor ﬁt to
what needs to be done.
Paul Rozin has written compellingly about this problem. The socalled ‘‘more developed” sciences of physics and, especially, biology, rely heavily on descriptive research. The structure of DNA
was probably the major discovery in the history of biology and
its research – and current mapping of the human genome – is
not hypothesis-driven. In personality psychology, as well, we have
some basic mapping to do. Hypotheses concerning speciﬁc relations among persons, situations and behaviors could be formulated
or, frankly, made up, but at this point they would be premature at
best and artiﬁcial at worst and, in the words of Solomon Asch, ‘‘one
does not advance time by moving the hands of the clock” (Asch,
1952, cited in Rozin, 2001, p. 2; see also Kagan, 2007).
Studies that test hypotheses about how one individual difference variable interacts with experimental manipulation of one situational variable to affect one behavioral outcome can be
interesting, valuable, and for the most part represent the current
state of the art. But we need a map of the broader terrain. What
do self-conscious people, happy people, or those who are attributionally complex actually do, and under what circumstances do
they do it (e.g., Creed & Funder, 1998; Fast, Reimer, & Funder,
2008; Nave, Sherman, & Funder, 2008)? To allow that map to be
made, granting agencies need to be willing to fund descriptive
studies, and journals need to publish them. Speciﬁc hypotheses
can come later. First thing ﬁrst.
9. Post-interactionism
The goal of developing a thorough understanding of the interconnections among persons, situations and behaviors presents an
exciting and challenging agenda that could keep personality
psychology busy for many years. But I would like to conclude by
taking an even longer view. A complete analysis of person–
5
The classic studies of social psychology placed subjects into evocative situations
(e.g., Milgram’s obedience experiment, the Zimbardo prison study), but almost never,
if ever, placed the same participant into more than one situation so that consistent
patterns of behavior and associated traits could be detected.
6
One often-overlooked consideration is that while questionnaires typically have
dozens or even hundreds of items, behavioral studies have just one or at best a few.
Until and unless the resources can be found to conduct behavioral measurement of
individuals on a scale not yet attempted, we may have to adjust our benchmarks for
what counts as a large or important effect (see Roberts, 2007), especially when
comparing the results of questionnaire studies with results of behavioral ones.

situation-behavior main effects and interactions is not an end in itself. Rather, it is a means towards understanding something deeper
and more mysterious: the nature and workings of personality.
What I mean is not the group of traits (or set of types) with which
personality is usually described or through which it is usually assessed, but the mysterious entity within the mind which is the
source of all the behaviors and feelings that make up psychological
life. The reason we put so much effort into puzzling through all of
our data and the complex interactions among persons, situations
and behaviors is to move, ever-so-gradually, towards an understanding of this underlying entity.
Imagine that tomorrow you ﬁnd yourself halfway up climbing
Mt. Everest, or undergoing enemy ﬁre, or being handed a check
for one hundred million dollars from the California Lottery. How
will you react? How could you possibly know? Presumably, you
have never previously experienced anything remotely comparable.
Yet the answer to this question lies within you, in your personality
as it exists right now. In principle, it ought to someday be possible to
understand an individual’s personality so thoroughly as to be able
to anticipate what he or she would do in completely new and unique situations. That entity – personality itself – is a latent construct in more than a statistical sense, and is at best only
indirectly suggested through its behavioral manifestations. That
is what Freud believed, and I do too.
