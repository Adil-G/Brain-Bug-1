This study examines three trust-building processes and
outcomes in sales manager–salesperson relationships.
This study, based on a sample of more than 400 businessto-business salespeople from a variety of industries, shows
two trust-building processes (predictive and identification) to be significantly related to salesperson trust in the
sales manager. Interpersonal trust was found to be most
strongly related to shared values and respect. Trust was directly related to job satisfaction and relationalism, and indirectly related to organizational commitment and
turnover intention.

The development and maintenance of marketing relationships has been the focus of extensive conceptual and
empirical work, and trust has been established as a key
component in the development of buyer-seller relationships. While the domain of trust and relationship marketing pertains to internal and external relationships (Morgan
and Hunt 1994), most research has focused on external

relationships. Noticeably, less research has studied internal relationships such as that between a sales manager and
a salesperson. This internal relationship is important
because it affects various salesperson work attitudes and
outcomes such as role ambiguity and job satisfaction
(Lagace 1991), internal cooperation (Yilmaz and Hunt
2001), and turnover (Hay Group 1999). An employee’s
trust in the manager and organization has been linked to
leadership behavior (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Moorman,
and Fetter 1990), climate (Strutton, Pelton, and Lumpkin
1993), levels of personal contact (McNeilly and Lawson
1999), and role modeling (Rich 1997).
In a nonsales context, Wells and Kipnis (2001) examined the impact of different influence tactics and interaction on subordinate trust in their managers. Distrust was
found to be associated with the use of strong methods of
influence, less interaction, and fewer attempts to influence. The reasons for distrust were related to personality/
character defects such as the manager being seen as “cold”
and “secretive.” Cunningham and MacGregor (2000)
examined the impact of employee trust in their supervisor
on such outcome variables as satisfaction, intention to
quit, and performance. They did not, however, investigate
the antecedents of trust. In a sales context, Strutton et al.
(1993), McNeilly and Lawson (1999), and Rich (1997)
examined the sales manager’s role in trust development.
Research findings generally indicate that trust is a key

component in maintaining individual and organizational
effectiveness (McAllister 1995; Rich 1997).
The purpose of this article is to extend the study of relationship marketing by developing and testing a theoretical
model of interpersonal trust in the salesperson–sales manager context. It also provides a more detailed look at managerial behaviors that may affect trust by examining three
key trust-building elements—opportunism, shared values,
and respect. These behaviors are representative of three
trust-building processes—calculative, predictive, and
identification. We also evaluate a proposed hierarchy of
trust-building processes in sales manager–salesperson
(interpersonal) relationships. In addition, the study contributes to the literature by testing direct and indirect relationships between trust and work-related attitudes, including turnover intention, satisfaction, relationalism, and
commitment.

the “boss determines an employee’s salary, job assignment
or promotion” (p. 425), integrity, concern, and benevolence are key qualities of trust. Recently, Jap (1999) captured interpersonal trustworthiness with elements of reliability and honesty, but excluded elements of competence.
Ramaswami (1996) indicated that a sales manager or
supervisor with low knowledge or competence would be
difficult to trust, thus competence may be a necessary condition for trust. Cunningham and MacGregor (2000)
defined competence as a component of leader-member
exchange quality, a construct that they consider separate
from trust. Madhavan and Grover (1998), in a study of
group effectiveness, included both an interpersonal component—resulting from relationship conditions such as
rich interpersonal interaction—and information. Consistent with the conceptualization used in both marketing and
management, we define trust in the interpersonal context
of salesperson–sales manager relationships as the salesperson’s degree of confidence that his or her manager is
both benevolent and honest. When reviewing the findings
of this study, the fact that competence is not included as a
dimension of trust should be considered.
The theoretical model shown in Figure 1 contains some
possible influences on, and consequences of, salesperson
trust in his or her manager. We first draw on a multidisciplinary literature base to develop antecedents based
on various processes of trust development. Next, we present
various possible sales force outcomes. We reexamine several of the hypothesized links that have been examined
previously for two reasons. Research replications have
value by confirming or calling into question previous
work, and these linkages help form a nomological network
around the constructs of interest (Cook and Campbell
1979).

A MODEL OF INTERPERSONAL TRUST
Trust has been conceptualized in many ways.
Podsakoff et al. (1990) noted the lack of a “clear consensus” as to the most appropriate conceptualization or measurement. Previous unidimensional conceptualizations
include conceptualizations of trust as reliability
(Garbarino and Johnson 1999), competence (Cook and
Wall 1980), benevolence (Anderson and Weitz 1989), and
integrity or honesty (Jap 1999). Other marketing researchers have adopted a multidimensional conceptualization
(Doney and Cannon 1997). Smith and Barclay (1997)
included various behaviors to assess trustworthiness,
whereas Ganesan (1994) focused on two key dimensions:
benevolence and credibility. Kumar, Scheer, and Steenkamp (1995) included benevolence but have a restricted
view of credibility. Benevolence is the trustor’s expectation that a trustee’s actions will be in the best interest of a
trustor (Kumar et al. 1995). It is based on qualities, intentions, and characteristics of the trustee, not specific behavior (Rempel, Holmes, and Zanna 1985).
Credibility may be viewed from two perspectives—
competence-based credibility and honesty-based credibility. Competence arises from the trustor’s confidence in the
trustee’s knowledge and skill related to a specific task, the
trustee’s ability, and the expectation that the trustee is
capable of performing and will perform as expected (Cook
and Wall 1980). This element is important in an exchange
where a partner is relied on to perform specific tasks.
Honesty (or integrity) is the ability to rely on another’s
word (Linksold 1978), the keeping of one’s word, and fulfilling obligations (Kumar et al. 1995). The honesty view
of credibility is more applicable in an interpersonal context involving deep dependence or unequal power as in the
case of “authority relations” (e.g., manager-subordinate)
(Sheppard and Sherman 1998). In such situations as where

TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES
Three trust-building processes have developed in the
literature: calculative processes, predictive processes, and
identification processes (Lewicki and Bunker 1995). The
calculative perspective of trust was developed in economics (Williamson 1993) and sociology (Coleman 1990). It
focuses on a process where costs and benefits of behavior
are rationally compared. Trust emerges when a salesperson (trustor) perceives that a sales manager’s (trustee’s)
costs of cheating or engaging in opportunistic behavior are
greater than the benefits of such actions (Doney and Cannon 1997). In the context of this study, managerial opportunism is defined as behavior that is deceit oriented and
violates expectations about appropriate sales manager role
behaviors (John 1984; Morgan and Hunt 1994). Recent research suggests that opportunism is inversely related to
trust—where opportunistic behavior reduces the level of
trust (Yilmaz and Hunt 2001). Managers who place their

interests above those of employees run the risk of being
perceived as opportunistic and less reliable than is expected for the role they fill in the organization. Thus, we
predict the following:
Hypothesis 1: Perceived managerial opportunism will be
related negatively to salesperson trust.
The predictive basis of trust development involves the
ability of individuals to predict the actions of others
(Deutsch 1960). This ability to predict behavior comes
from interaction with, and observation of, the other party
(Lewicki and Bunker 1995). For example, McNeilly and
Lawson (1999) found that the number of joint sales calls
was significantly related to a salesperson’s trust in his or
her manager. This form of sales manager–salesperson interaction allows the salesperson to observe the sales manager over time and provides a basis for predicting future
behavior. The findings of Strutton et al. (1993), related to
the influence of psychological climate on trust development, support this concept. The influence of interaction on
trust development tends to be based on relational factors
that develop from interactions where respect and concern
are clearly demonstrated (Whitner, Brodt, Korsgaard, and
Werner 1998). Podsakoff et al. (1990) reported that individualized support or “behavior on the part of the leader indicating that he or she respects followers and is concerned
about their personal feelings and needs” (p. 112) is a significant predictor of trust.
Tyler (1989) found that three key factors are positively
related to the perceptions of fairness in interactions with
authorities. One of these factors, “standing,” forms the basis for what we term managerial respect, which refers to
“the treatment accorded to people by group authorities . . .
issues of politeness, respect for rights and treatment

with dignity” (Tyler 1994:853). Thus, we hypothesize the
following:
Hypothesis 2: Perceptions of managerial respect will be
related positively to salesperson trust.
Trust emerges in those relationships where one party
identifies with the other party’s desires and intentions.
Lewicki and Stevenson (1997) cited three factors related
to the development of identification-based trust: (1) similar interests, (2) similar goals or objectives, and (3) common values and/or principles. Similarity of values is a
good way to assess the fit or cultural blending of alliance
partners (Das and Teng 1998), while value congruence is a
central concern in gaining a successful fit between individuals and organizations (Chatman 1991).
Morgan and Hunt (1994) found that shared ethical values are positively related to trust in marketing relationships. Yilmaz and Hunt (2001) also found that in sales
force peer relationships, shared values are positively related to trust. In an alternative operationalization, dissimilarity of values and goals has been found to have a negative
effect on trust development (Anderson and Weitz 1989)
and trustworthiness (Smith and Barclay 1997). These findings indicate that shared values, reflecting the degree that a
salesperson’s values are similar to those of the sales manager (Netemeyer, Boles, McKee, and McMurrian 1997),
are related to trust as described in the identification process. We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 3: Shared values will be related positively to
salesperson trust.
The different contexts (interpersonal versus interfirm)
involve different types of activities and distinct levels of
interactions that may make certain bases of trust less appli-

cable (Hagen and Choe 1998). Different contexts, interactions, and relational forms have different types of risk and
require distinct mechanisms to reduce risk (Sheppard and
Sherman 1998). We propose that bases of trust will have
differing effects specific to the context or form of relationship under inquiry.
Extant literature distinguishes between various bases
for trust (calculative, predictive, and identification), which
occur from different types of interaction (Lewicki and
Stevenson 1997). With regard to distinct contexts, Koehn
(1997) suggested that calculative trust development processes should be the main sources of trust in commercial
exchanges. In channel relationships, opportunism may be
the most important predictor of trust (Morgan and Hunt
1994).
Koehn (1997) indicated that predictive bases of trust involve more familiarity among the parties and can be tied to
the development of interpersonal relationships. The findings of Mackenzie, Podsakoff, and Rich (2001) observing
leader behavior over time suggest that such behavior influences the development of trust. Likewise, the identification basis of trust appears to be more applicable to
individuals and is “most proper” to study in interpersonal
relationships. Morgan and Hunt (1994) found that communications (predictive) and shared values (identification) were significant predictors of trust but accounted for
less than 10 percent of the variance. Doney and Cannon
(1997) found that the strongest predictor of trust in a firmsalesperson context was salesperson influence (transference) and that the predictive base of trust (influence) accounted for the second largest portion of variance. They
reported that calculative and identification bases, respectively, were also significant in the firm-salesperson context. On the basis of theory, previous findings, and the
specific interpersonal context of this study, we hypothesize the following:

key link to the organization and a major influence on a
salesperson’s job perceptions (Ingram and Bellenger
1983; Kohli 1989). Supervisor behaviors such as consideration (Teas 1983), role clarification (Johnston,
Parasuraman, Futrell, and Black 1990), closeness of
supervisor, and communication (Churchill et al. 1974) are
related to job satisfaction. Meta-analytic results confirm
the strength of these positive relationships, with corrected
correlations of .45 between closeness of supervision and
job satisfaction (Brown and Peterson 1993).

Hypothesis 4: In an interpersonal context, the process related most strongly to trust will be the identification
process (shared values), followed by the predictive
process (managerial respect) and then the calculative process (managerial opportunism).

Links between trust and satisfaction have typically
been tested in marketing contexts other than sales. Anderson and Narus (1990) found that trust in one’s exchange
partner reduces negative conflict and increases exchange
satisfaction. High levels of trustworthiness and trusting
behaviors are positively related to the degree of mutual
trust in selling partnerships (Smith and Barclay 1997). In a
sales management context, trust in the sales manager appears to be related to salesperson job satisfaction (Lagace
1991; Rich 1997). This has also been supported in a
nonsales context (Cunningham and MacGregor 2000). We
hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 5: Salesperson trust will be related positively
to job satisfaction.
Relationalism
Relationalism refers to the expectations that exchange
partners or individuals have, such as long-term interaction,
a sharing of benefits, and an expectation that the relationship is more important than any one encounter or exchange. Relationalism (social norms of exchange) has
been studied primarily in interfirm contexts, but frameworks used to explore relational exchanges are based on
interpersonal relationships (Dwyer, Schurr, and Oh 1987).
Trust is a primary component or basis for the development
of norms of exchange (Macneil 1980) and thus relationalism. As such, trust is essential for the development of
relationalism. We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 6: Salesperson trust will be related positively
to relationalism.

TRUST AND SALESPERSON ATTITUDES
Satisfaction and Organizational Commitment
Job Satisfaction
Churchill, Ford, and Walker (1974) conceptualized job
satisfaction as those characteristics pertaining to the job
and work environment “which salespeople find rewarding,
fulfilling, and satisfying, or frustrating and unsatisfying”
(p. 255). In this study, job satisfaction represents an overall
global state pertaining to the personal selling position
(Netemeyer et al. 1997). A sales manager is a salesperson’s

Organizational commitment refers to an individual’s
attachment to, or identification with, an organization and
willingness to exert additional effort to maintain organizational goals and values (Porter, Steer, Mowday, and
Boulian 1974). The nature of the relationship between job
satisfaction and commitment has been debated (Brown
and Peterson 1993). Consistent with the majority of findings, we have modeled satisfaction as an antecedent to

<-----Page 4----->Brashear et al. / TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES

commitment (Brown and Peterson 1993; Johnston et al.
1990). Thus, we hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 7: Job satisfaction will be related positively
to organizational commitment.
Relationalism and Organizational Commitment
The nature of relationalism is that of an enduring and
ongoing relationship where the parties maintain high levels of interaction and consistency in behavior. Gundlach,
Achrol, and Mentzer (1995) found that the existence of social norms (relationalism) increases commitment. Managerial actions such as leadership behaviors are also
positively related to organizational commitment (Johnston
et al. 1990). We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 8: Relationalism will be related positively to
organizational commitment.
Organizational Commitment
and Turnover Intention
Turnover or turnover intention, which involves an individual’s intention to leave the firm (Netemeyer et al.
1996), is commonly modeled as an ultimate outcome in
studies of human behavior in organizations (e.g.,
Chandrashekaran, McNeilly, Russ, and Marinova 2000).
The relationship between organizational commitment and
turnover has previously been explored in sales force settings (Johnston et al. 1990). Previous research confirms
the negative relationship of organizational commitment
with turnover intention and turnover (Brown and Peterson
1993). Findings indicate that commitment mediates the
job satisfaction–turnover intention/turnover relationship
(Johnston et al. 1990). Consistent with these findings,
commitment is modeled as a mediator of the relationship
between satisfaction and turnover intention. We hypothesize the following:
Hypothesis 9: Organizational commitment will be related negatively to turnover intention.
METHOD
Sample
The sample in this study consisted of 402 business-tobusiness salespeople in the northeastern United States. A
list of salespeople was generated through the use of the
Internet and industry directories. Respondents came from
a wide range of industries and sold approximately 50 different types of products. Through phone contact, we qualified salespeople for the study, and they were required to be
full-time salespeople working in business-to-business

193

markets, with a minimum of 6 months tenure working with
an identifiable manager. Surveys were distributed to 621
salespeople who were qualified and agreed to participate.
During an 8-week period, 408 surveys were received, and
6 surveys were eliminated due to missing data.
The mean age of the respondents was 37 years. Sixtyfour percent were married, and 78 percent were male.
Sixty-eight percent had a bachelor’s degree or higher. The
average number of years of sales experience with their
present company was 7.2 (SD = 6.52), and they had an
average of 11.92 years (SD = 8.93) of total sales experience. To test for nonresponse bias, early and late respondents were compared according to Armstrong and
Overton (1977), with no differences found with regard to
age, gender, income, years with company, time with manager, or the constructs of interest. Additional tests indicate
no differences between early or late respondents with
regard to type of product or service, consumer or industrial, or in the 24 different product or service categories.
Also, to avoid any confound based on length of employment or length of the sales manager–sales person relationship, we ran simple regressions using these two “time”
variables as predictors of the key constructs. There were
no significant effects.
Measures and Analysis
The constructs were measured using multi-item scales
adapted from the literature. A complete list of the items,
their sources, psychometric properties, factor loadings,
and z scores are presented in the appendix. For each measure, respondents were asked to state their agreement or
disagreement on a 7-point scale anchored by strongly disagree (coded 1) and strongly agree (coded 7). Unidimensionality, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of
the measures were assessed according to procedures suggested by Anderson and Gerbing (1988).
Following the multifaceted definition of trust, we modeled the construct as a second-order factor with two firstorder factors of benevolence and honesty. The secondorder measurement is consistent with previous work in
multifaceted constructs (Singh and Rhoads 1991). Items
for the two facets are based on scales by Kumar et al.
(1995). The two dimensions, benevolence and honesty,
were assessed with two four-item scales.
The measurement and structural models were tested
using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural
equation modeling with LISREL 8.30 (Jöreskog and
Sörbom 1993). The measurement model tested all constructs simultaneously, including the second-order trust
construct, due to the identification issues related to trust.
The two first-order constructs representing trust were
overidentified, but the second-order construct would be
underidentified unless combined with other constructs in
the measurement model. The benevolence and honesty

factors were uncorrelated with the other constructs, which
allows all covariance to flow through the higher order
trust.
Study results indicate convergent and discriminant
validity. All items loaded on their specified construct with
loadings 17 to 23 times higher than their standard errors.
Discriminant validity was found for all pairs of constructs
by comparing the average variance extracted for each construct to the square of the correlation (Φ) between each
pair of constructs (Fornell and Larcker 1981). The chisquare fit statistic for the measurement model was 1,908
with 830 degrees of freedom (p < .001). Table 1 provides
descriptive statistics and the correlations among constructs. Although the chi-square fit statistic is significant,
it has been noted that this statistic is sensitive to small discrepancies in model fit with large samples (Bentler and

Bonett 1980). The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and
Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) were both above recommended
levels at .93, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) was acceptable at .06. Overall, the measurement model evidenced acceptable fit. Structural
model results presented in Table 2 indicate adequate fit.
The chi-square was 2,039 with 847 degrees of freedom
(p < .001). The CFI and TLI were both .92. The RMSEA
was within the acceptable range at .06.
To evaluate the effects of a common methods bias, we
included a method factor following the procedures
described by Podsakoff et al. (1990). The results find that a
common source factor is evident with a significant change
in the overall model fit, ∆χ2 (dfs) = 303 (44), but the existence of the factor does not affect the magnitude or significance of the findings.

<-----Page 6----->Brashear et al. / TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES

FINDINGS
Findings indicate that seven of the eight hypothesized
paths were significant (p < .05). The path from opportunism to trust (Hypothesis 1) was not significant (γ11 = –.07,
t = –1.70). Respect was positively related to trust, supporting Hypothesis 2 (γ13 = .37, t = 5.85). The relationship
between trust and shared values (Hypothesis 3) also
received support (γ12 = .55, t = 7.32). When managers and
salespeople hold similar values, trust is more likely to
develop.
Hypotheses for the proposed consequences of trust are
presented in Table 2. Trust was positively related to job satisfaction, as predicted in Hypothesis 5 (β21 = .68, t = 8.99).
Hypothesis 6 examined the influence of trust on relationalism. This path was significant (β31 = .85, t = 8.97).
Job satisfaction (β42 = .44, t = 9.26) and relationalism (β43 =
.52, t = 9.76) were both positively related to commitment,
supporting Hypotheses 7 and 8. Hypothesis 9, predicting a
negative relationship between commitment and turnover
intention, was supported (β54 = –.70, t = –11.84).
The ability of the model to explain the endogenous variables was reasonably strong. The squared multiple correlations (SMCs) for the endogenous variables were .46 for
job satisfaction and .84 for trust. The SMCs for relationalism and organizational commitment were .73 and
.49 for turnover intention. Honesty and benevolence each
had an SMC of .72.
Comparison of Predictors
To test Hypothesis 4, a series of five models were compared, with each of the models being nested with regard to
the theoretical model including the methods factor. The
first comparison equates the variance of the three predictors to allow a comparison of the completely standardized
loadings. The chi-square of this model is unchanged from
the original model, and the path coefficients are equivalent
to the original findings, with the path from shared values to
trust being the strongest (γ12 = –.53), followed by respect
(γ13 = –.43) and finally opportunism (γ11 = –.05). This test
supports Hypothesis 4. In addition, four other models were
tested, beginning with a model specifying that all path
coefficients are equal. This model shows a deterioration of
fit, with a ∆χ2 (dfs) = 50 (2). This reflects that the paths are
not all equal.
Three additional models alternated the pattern of equivalent paths by setting only two of the three to be equal at a
time. These models show that when equating the path leading from opportunism with the paths from shared values,
∆χ2 (dfs) = 303 (44) or respect, ∆χ2 (dfs) = 303 (44), the fit
of the model deteriorates. When the shared-values and
respect paths are equated, the model does not deteriorate
but marginally improves, ∆χ2 (dfs) = –1 (1), although not
significantly. We conclude that there are differential

195

effects from our three predictors, as shared values and
respect are better predictors than opportunism. Shared values has a larger path estimate to trust than respect, but the
nested-models comparison finds no statistically significant difference.
DISCUSSION
The identification process, which is based on shared
values, was the most important trust-building process in
our model. This is not consistent with the findings of Morgan and Hunt (1994), who found that opportunism had the
strongest relationship (negative) with trust. The difference
is both interesting and telling regarding the relationship
between trust-developing processes and the context of
trust relationships. The primary distinction lies in the contexts of the studies. Morgan and Hunt (1994) examined
interfirm relationships in a channel-of-distribution context, while the current study examined specific interpersonal relationships between salespeople and sales managers. Differences in findings may reflect context-specific
trust-building processes. Note also that given the interpersonal context of this study, we chose not to include competence as a dimension of trust. This fact should be considered when comparing our results with those of other
studies.
The predictive basis of trust building, as tested through
the perception of respect, was also significantly related to
perceptions of trust. This supports the contention that it is
not necessarily the amount of interaction but the quality of
that interaction that is important. The calculative process
involving opportunism was not significantly related to
higher order trust. Although a relationship was predicted,
the nonsignificant finding lends support to the hypothesis
regarding the relative effect of opportunism in interpersonal relationships. In addition, opportunism has the lowest correlation of the three antecedents with the first-order
trust elements of honesty and benevolence. One likely
explanation may be found in the length of the relationship
between the managers and salespeople. Opportunism or
calculative trust tends to be more important in early relationships (Lewicki and Bunker 1995), and the salesperson–
sales manager relationships we examined had been in
place at least 6 months.
In the trust literature, there appears to be an emerging
hierarchy of bases of trust (Sheppard and Sherman 1998).
Calculative-based trust is the least stable form, followed
by predictive-based trust and then identification-based
trust (Lewicki and Bunker 1995; Sheppard and Sherman
1998). In the current study, interpersonal trust was based
more on the higher bases of prediction and identification,
suggesting that interpersonal trust between salespeople
and sales managers is more representative of interdependence and shared values.

Trust was significantly related to salesperson job satisfaction. Salespeople who trust their managers are more
satisfied with their jobs. Also, as this study and many previous studies have shown, job satisfaction acts as a mediator between many characteristics of the job and other
work-related attitudes such as organizational commitment. Trust, operating through satisfaction, is indirectly
related to organizational commitment. We also found a
significant link between trust and relationalism. This finding is important since it indicates that trust is a key element
in developing behavioral norms between individuals
(Macneil 1980).

hiring and training new salespeople. The selection and
training processes also need to emphasize the values of the
firm and the importance of those values in operating a successful business. Including these issues in the hiring and
training procedures may be an important first step in the
development of trust between new salespeople and their
sales managers.

Managerial Implications
This research found that shared values is the strongest
factor in building trust between salespeople and their
managers. Thus, the selection process may be the first, and
possibly most important step, in ensuring that salespeople are
satisfied and committed to the organization. Newly hired
employees come to the organization with a set of personal
values. When recruiting, firms should seek out individuals
whose values reflect those of the organization. For example,
a sales force organized to grow revenue from a stable customer base may not be the best organization for a salesperson who does not like spending a great deal of time with any
one account. The question of organizational fit is central to
this selection process. Does the potential hire have similar
values to those espoused by the company and sales managers? If not, then he or she may find it difficult to develop trust
in the manager since they will not share the same values.
Hiring salespeople whose values are congruent to those
of the organization may be a much simpler and effective
approach to having a satisfied sales force than trying to
indoctrinate employees who do not hold similar values
into a firm’s culture (Dubinsky, Howell, Ingram, and
Bellenger 1986). Salespeople with values congruent with
those of the organization also may be more likely to have a
higher internal work motivation because they place high
value on the same things that their company and manager
value highly. This assures that the company and manager
will reward the things they value most, whether that is service, growth, teamwork, or some other factor. In addition,
the lack of congruence between a manager and salesperson could be interpreted by the salesperson as a lack of
respect. Showing concern about their personal feelings
and needs implies that the manager understands and perhaps acknowledges the salesperson’s value system. Our
results relating to trust indicate that the Dubinsky et al.
(1986) suggestion that “sales recruits with personal needs
and skills that are compatible with the sales job should be
hired” (p. 203) remains a good hiring rule.
Sales managers must be rewarded for behaviors that are
consistent with the firm’s values, including their work in

Future Research and Limitations
The findings of this study suggest other areas of
research concerning the study of interpersonal trust in
sales management. One area of future research involves
refining measurement scales. This is not a simple task
given the variety of definitions and forms of trust that are
being studied. Lewicki and Stevenson (1997) presented
items for measuring calculative, knowledge (predictive),
and identification-based trust. Measure refinement
appears to be a key area for future research. A second area
for further research concerns the processes or bases of trust
development. We used three processes found in the literature, but other bases of trust also are of interest. In the comparison of our results with other work, we found that there
may be differences in the bases of trust across contexts.
This suggests that future research should attempt to determine a priori the appropriate bases of trust to investigate by
evaluating the levels of risk and dependence or interdependence among the actors (Sheppard and Sherman 1998).
There may be various personal traits that “predispose” a
salesperson to trust. These traits could include an individual’s trust in humanity, propensity for risk, and cultural
factors. The saliency of such traits in the development of
salesperson–sales manager trust should be examined.
In the area of sales management, control is an important
issue (Cravens, Ingram, Laforge, and Young 1993). Control has negative connotations or a negative perception
among those on whom the control mechanisms are applied
(Ramaswami 1996). However, trust is a form of social control (Shapiro 1987) and is effective since it allows one to
“forestall monitoring” (Das and Teng 1998). The use of
trust in combination with other forms of control may provide a more palatable and effective overall governance
system. Research into the efficacy of governance systems
combining trust and traditional controls merits being
studied.
Future research may be conducted with limitations of
this study in mind. First, it was conducted with salespeople
from a variety of companies. Although our preliminary
analysis found no differences between firms, there is no
clear direction in the literature regarding the use of a single
sales force versus multiple sales forces with diverse products (Cravens et al. 1993; Dubinsky et al. 1986). The
results must be viewed in light of the fact that we limited
the sample to business-to-business salespeople.

<-----Page 8----->Brashear et al. / TRUST-BUILDING PROCESSES

A second limitation is the problem of testing a causal
model with cross-sectional data. Models based on such
data are limited in their ability to show causation.
Although we found no evidence that length of time with
the manager significantly affected the key constructs, we
limited our sample to salespeople with a minimum of 6
months of service with their manager, and this lower
boundary may restrict the range of variance. The influence
of interpersonal trust development early in salesperson–
sales manager relationships should be investigated. Third,
we employed a conceptualization and measure of trust that
omitted competence. This is consistent with other interpersonal trust research that involves unequal power balance; however, other broader conceptualizations of trust
should be examined, and an overall stronger measurement
system for trust would enhance research in the area. Finally,
our model is limited to single constructs to represent the
three trust-building processes, and given the existing literature, our model may be limited by potential model misspecification. Likewise, as seen in various meta-analyses,
there is an extensive list of predictors or covariates of satisfaction (Brown and Peterson 1993) and commitment
(Mathieu and Zajac 1990) that were not included in the
theoretical model. We also used a global measure of job

197

satisfaction. Some facets of job satisfaction may be more
related to trust than others. These constructs were not
included because they were not the central focus of this
study and also due to the complexities in testing large
structural models (Bollen 1989).
CONCLUSION
This research extends the study of relationship marketing by developing and testing a model of trust development in a salesperson–sales manager context. Shared values and managerial respect were positively related to the
level of trust, with shared values having the strongest
influence on trust. The implication is that shared values
should be a key focus of trust building in this context.
Opportunism was not significantly related to trust. In addition, hypotheses were supported regarding the relationships between trust, job satisfaction, and relationalism.
Trust was positively related to both constructs. Trust was
also indirectly related to organizational commitment (positively) and turnover intention (negatively). This study
emphasizes the role trust plays in the salesperson–sales
manager relationship.
