This study aims to provide a better understanding of the effect of social networks on innovation
through the analysis of territorial agglomerations of firms. Critical voices argue that the same
mechanisms that form the basis of efficient, continuous improvements of clustered firms can also
be considered as limitations. We suggest that the impact of social capital decreases beyond a
certain point of development. In fact, the effect of social interactions and trust on firm value
creation can be described as an inverted U-shaped curve. The study is based on a sample of 154
firms in the Valencia region of Spain. Implications of the study have relevant prescriptions for
regional planners and individual entrepreneurs. Copyright  2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Recently, authors have devoted a great deal of
attention to the effects of social capital on organizations (e.g., Koka and Prescott, 2002; Blyler and
Coff, 2003; Starley and Tempest, 2004). It is frequently argued that cohesive strong-tied networks
provide substantial benefits for the firms involved.
On the other hand, contexts of geographical proximity such as those defined as an industrial cluster
or district (Becattini, 1990; Porter, 2000) include a
wide range of experiences in different industries,

countries, and technological levels (e.g., Tallman
et al., 2004; Inkpen and Tsang, 2005). In general,
researchers have focused on the richness of the
knowledge transmitted, as well as on the existence
of certain norms or values to be used as a mechanism with which to control internal exchanges
(Uzzi, 1996). However, limitations have been analyzed to a lesser extent (Glasmeier, 1991).
The expected contribution of our research is
based on the two perspectives, social capital and
territorial agglomerations. Much work has already
been published on them separately, and some
authors have already pointed out the dark side or
the limitations of social capital (Luhmann, 1979;
Uzzi, 1997), while others have described a contingent view of the benefits of social components
(Ahuja, 2000; Gargiulo and Benassi, 2000; Rowley, Behrens, and Krackhardt, 2000). These latter

authors suggested that different characteristics of
this social capital are suitable for different organizational purposes. On the other hand, the literature
on clusters has focused on the benefits of density
and proximity in accessing and exploiting sources
of knowledge through the social capital that is
developed internally. By integrating the previous
ideas, we attempt to propose a particular shape of
the relationships between representative variables
of the social capital and innovation within the context of an industrial cluster or district.
We argue that beyond a certain point, further
increases in the intensity of social capital produce
no additional benefits, or even decrease returns
in terms of innovation and value creation for the
firms involved. We have used social interactions
and trust as indicators of social capital, and we
have analyzed their impact on the innovation of
firms that belong to a territorial cluster. Finally,
we discuss some possible alternative courses of
political action to improve this restriction.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
The body of research on social capital includes
a huge number of perspectives with many criteria to be classified. Comprehensive reviews of
previous research on social capital (e.g., Nahapiet
and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998; Tsai,
2000; Koka and Prescott, 2002) have considered
it to be a multidimensional construct that yields
distinctly different information benefits and can
contribute in many ways to the creation of new
value for an organization. Based on Nahapiet
and Ghoshal (1998), we use the organizational
level of analysis and we focus on two particular dimensions in social networks; one refers to
the structure, and the other to the nature of the
relations (ties).1 Bolino, Turnley, and Bloodgood
(2002) pointed out that, while the structural dimension describes the mere existence of connections
between employees of the organizations, the relational dimension describes the extent to which
there is an affective quality to these connections.
We have chosen social interactions and trust as
respective representative factors of the two main
dimensions of social capital.

We have not considered a third cognitive dimension of social
capital used by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998).

On the other hand, clusters are defined by Porter
(2000) as ‘a geographically proximate group of
interconnected companies and associated institutions in a particular field linked by commonalities and complementarities’ (Porter, 2000: 16).
Researchers have provided convincing evidence
for the existence of clusters (or districts) in a
wide variety of industries and have found the
successful grouping of firms to be important for
understanding patterns of competitive success in
many industries (Tallman et al., 2004; Inkpen and
Tsang, 2005). Most of the literature reports a
positive effect on firm innovation. However, as
recent research has proposed, clustered firms need
to combine close and intense relationships with
distant or arm’s-length relations to be able to
access international sources of resources (Corò and
Grandinetti, 2001).
In our case we argue that social capital has
a positive effect on innovation by means of the
increased exchanges and combinations of resources
(Kogut and Zander, 1992). Beyond a certain point,
however, additional increases become detrimental
for firms (over-embeddedness effect). We attempt
to associate structure and strength of the ties of
the organizations with innovation in the particular context of territorial agglomerations, where
geographical proximity conditions, or even determines, social network architecture. A curvilinear relationship facilitates the understanding of
the problem as well as the search for possible
solutions.
The paradox literature (Denison, Hooijberg, and
Quinn, 1995) provided a conceptual background
for a complex effect of social capital. Some authors
(e.g. Lewicki, McAllister, and Bies, 1998; Lado,
Dant, and Tekleab, 2008) proposed considering
both trust and distrust (or opportunism) simultaneously with relationships—a suggestion that was
grounded in assumptions of multidimensionality
and the inherent tensions of relationships. On the
other hand, after considering the potential benefit
of embedded relationships, Uzzi (1997) discussed
some negative effects affecting the organization’s
stability.
Our argumentation has a certain parallelism with
other curvilinear relations found in recent literature. For example, Stock, Greis, and Fischer (2001)
focused on the effects of absorptive capacity on
innovation; Berman, Down, and Hill (2002) looked
at how shared experience affected performance,
and McFadyen and Cannella (2004) examined the

influence of the number of exchange partners on
the amount of knowledge that a person creates.
Social interactions and innovation
Social interactions are manifestations of the structural dimension of social capital (Sparrowe et al.,
2001). Among the fundamental explanatory tenets
of the social network perspective is the idea that
the structure of social interactions enhances or constrains access to valued resources (Brass, 1984;
Ibarra, 1993). Resource exchanges through informal networks include work-related resources, such
as task advice and strategic information, but informal networks also transmit social identity (norms)
and social support (Podolny and Baron, 1997).
Social interaction relations, often established for
other purposes, constitute information channels
that reduce the amount of time and investment
required to gather information. The benefits of
social interactions can be conceptualized using
Burt’s (1992) three forms: access, timing, and
referral advantages (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998).
Innovation (defined as new or significant
changes in products, processes, or services) can
result from new combinations of knowledge and
other resources (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Kogut
and Zander, 1992). Through interactions with others, firms obtain access to external knowledge and
can combine it with existing knowledge. Such
interactions create a context within which new
knowledge can be applied and exploited. Finally,
through close social interaction, firms are able
to increase the depth, breadth, and efficiency of
mutual knowledge exchanges (Lane and Lubatkin,
1998).
Some authors have argued for a direct positive
association between social interaction and innovation. Some researchers have empirically supported the idea that social interaction may facilitate
learning by fostering close, intensive information
exchange (Yli-Renko, Autio, and Sapienza, 2001);
others have also documented the importance of
social interactions for the creation and diffusion
of innovation (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998; Tsai and
Ghoshal, 1998).
The positive association between social interactions and knowledge acquisition is consistent
with the assumptions that learning, particularly that
involving difficult-to-transfer information, is aided
by intensive, repeated interactions. Thus, social
interactions exert an influence on the capabilities

1015

of firms and, hence, constitute a factor explaining
their innovation.
In contrast to the arguments presented above,
a theory positing a curvilinear relationship has
also been developed. This theory recognized that
increased social capital (social interactions) may
not be associated with parallel increases in outcomes. Social interactions involve both the costs
associated with maintaining ongoing relationships
and the norms and costs associated with maintaining slack resources. People in a firm need to
spend time cultivating relationships by frequent
visits and meetings with other firms, and processing their incoming information from direct contacts. Because of these costs, firms can rarely
afford to maintain relations with many other firms,
let alone maintain strong ties. A firm might be
better off establishing other ties to nonredundant actors rather than investing the time and
resources required to form and maintain strong
ties (Lane and Lubatkin, 1998). In consequence,
the time and effort invested in social interactions may not be cost-efficient in certain situations or at certain levels (Adler and Kwon,
2002).
More specifically, McEvily and Zaheer (1999)
found that the interfirm information networks of
enterprises in geographical clusters with greater
redundancy tend to acquire fewer competitive
capabilities. This dysfunctional effect of this
dimension arises when firms get locked into their
current networks, thus inhibiting their flexibility
in creating new ties. In particular, such networks
could have an adverse effect on the firm when
the environment changes, as they may not have
the capabilities or the information necessary to
compete in the new environment (Pouder and
St. John, 1996). In conclusion, initially, newly
formed contacts or lower-intensity contacts are
expected to benefit from significant effects in
a linear form, although diminishing returns are
also expected later. Ultimately, these diminishing
returns could become negative returns (Berman
et al., 2002).
Consequently, we predict a positive relationship
between intensity in relationships and innovation
that declines as social interactions increase, eventually becoming negative. The nonlinear inverted
U-shaped relationship is the one that best captures
expectations based on the argument. We formulate
this argumentation as follows:

Hypothesis 1: The intensity in social interactions
that a clustered firm maintains has a quadratic
(inverted U-shaped) relationship with innovation creation.
Trust and innovation
One of the best-known definitions of trust was the
one proposed by Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman
(1995: 712). Authors have characterized trust with
the notions of ability, benevolence, and integrity.
They are perceptions associated to being fair, being
consistent, telling the truth, and so forth. Moreover,
trust presents a distinct construct according to
whether it is considered on the interpersonal or
interorganizational level (McEvily, Perrone, and
Zaheer, 2003).
Trust is a manifestation of the relational dimension of social capital and a governance structure that is based on social relationships between
and among individuals (and organizations). In this
sense, trust is fundamentally a social process, since
these mechanisms and expectations are emergent
features of a social structure that creates and reproduces them in the course of time.
Previous researchers have argued that trust in
interorganizational settings may foster innovation,
since it is important for the firm to enjoy opportunities and access to resources. First, trust, both
within and between organizations, has been found
to be important to innovation since it lessens the
need for rigid control systems (Quinn, 1979). Freedom from strict rules enhances creative thinking, while rigid monitoring and control mechanisms reduce the potential generation of new
ideas.
As a control mechanism, trust facilitates highquality information and tacit knowledge, both of
which are critical sources of innovation (Uzzi,
1996). A high level of trust between organizations
facilitates the exchange of confidential information
by diminishing the risk of one of the parts’ acting
opportunistically (Dakhli and De Clercq, 2004). It
also facilitates social exchange by reducing the
need for time-consuming and costly monitoring,
and therefore makes it possible for people and
organizations to devote additional time to beneficial actions and endeavors. Since trust induces
joint efforts (Ring and Van de Ven, 1994), one
actor can probably obtain the help needed to attain
goals from other actors to a degree that is not
possible in a situation where trust does not exist.

Moreover, trust also promotes the exchange of a
range of resources that are difficult to put a price
on, but which enrich an organization’s ability to
compete and solve problems.
The literature on innovation has emphasized
that the development and adoption of new products and processes is the result of the interaction
between capabilities that are specific to each firm
and industry (Dosi, 1988). Moreover, the capacity to maintain a continuous flow of innovation
with other organizations therefore depends on the
ability to disseminate basic knowledge to organizations that interact, for example, in research and
development and production activities. In contrast
to the arguments presented above, in this case it is
also possible to develop a theory positing a curvilinear relationship. Organizations with high levels
of trust will probably have less new talent, which
is accompanied by new ideas. For instance, since
trust takes time to develop, such organizations are
more likely to have fewer new employees. The
players are less likely to be willing to experiment
with new ways of playing, as they rely more and
more on their customary routines. The obligations,
for instance reciprocity, lead organizations to prefer players and routines already known rather than
to experiment with new ones.
The individual efficiency of the players may
decline as they become complacent with their roles
in the network (Berman et al., 2002). Too much
time and effort devoted to maintaining trusting
relationships can affect the firm in a negative manner. The higher the level of trust is, the more likely
there is to be a boomerang effect for the local firm.
Moreover, in highly trusting relationships, members of an organization will be more reluctant to
monitor the relationship. In combination with other
factors and under certain circumstances, insufficient monitoring could lead to lower performance,
in spite of trust (Langfred, 2004). Particularly in
the case of industrial clusters, proximity facilitates
trust in the internal relations and, at the same time,
hinders access to external sources of knowledge
resources. An overreliance on trust can be a factor inhibiting access to diverse external sources of
resources.
Because of associated costs and other undesirable effects, high levels of trust suggest that the linear relationship one might expect between trust and
innovation is not going to occur. Rather, the relationship will have a nonlinear inverted U-shape.

We formulate the following hypothesis in order to
capture the relationship argued above.
Hypothesis 2: The effect exerted by obligations resulting from common norms and values,
such as trust in firms, will have a quadratic
(inverted U-shaped) relationship with innovation creation.

METHODS
The empirical setting
The empirical research drew upon a sample of
Spanish clustered industrial firms located along
the east coast of the country (Valencia region),
in which there is a predominance of small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) in the industrial structure.2 We used firms from eight different industrial segments or Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes (food, textile, furniture, ceramic,
leather, chemical products, machinery, and paper)
and, in order to define the sample, we employed a
random stratified process to select firms with proportional assignation according to size and product
segments. We fixed a population of 400 firms as
being representative of the manufacturing firms
in the region. From this population we collected
154 firms, which represented a response rate of
38.5 percent of the total. The fieldwork was carried
out during fall and winter of 2003. We checked for
possible bias between sample and nonrespondent
firms and no significant differences were observed
in terms of size and age. Data were collected from
the ARDAN3 database.
2
Manufacturing firms are basically SMEs; in fact, according to
official statistics, 48 percent of the firms had fewer than six
employees and only one percent of the firms employed more
than 100 workers. The basic tool for promoting innovation in
the Valencia region is the Instituto de la Mediana y Pequeña
Industria Valenciana (IMPIVA), which depends on the regional
government and is responsible for developing the innovation
policy in the region by focusing on SMEs. The IMPIVA offers
a variety of services and organizes action programs aimed at
supporting industrial SMEs, while at the same time fostering
a network of technological infrastructures to lend support to
innovations. This activity is manifested in two networks, namely,
technological institutes and a network of European business and
innovation centers.
3
The ARDAN is a public database published by the IMPIVA, a
regional industrial policy agency, and it provides productive and
financial information about all manufacturing firms except those
that have an annual revenue below 240,000 euros (previously,
40 million pesetas).

Data were collected using a questionnaire distributed among firms. Respondents were expected
to be knowledgeable on a broad variety of aspects
about the company concerning things like external
relationships with customers, suppliers, institutions, and also about the firm’s outcomes, innovations, and so forth. The key informants were the
general managers of the companies (or whomever
he or she had appointed on his or her behalf). For
the sake of simplicity, we employed a five-point
Likert scale.
We ran some controls to assess survey validity.
First, we included Cronbach’s alpha as a test of the
reliability of the measurement. Second, we added
the correlation matrix to control for discriminant
validity. Finally, in order to prevent possible bias
and problems derived from the use of one unique
and subjective source of data for most of the variables, we carried out some specific additional controls. On the one hand, we used ARDAN (2000)
data to check some of the information provided by
the respondents. In fact, whenever some relevant
discrepancy or incoherency occurred, we deleted
the case. Moreover, personal interviews provided
us with additional explanations about the meaning of the items and improved the quality of the
responses. On the other hand, we also evaluated
the validity of answers using data gathered from
a second knowledgeable respondent who was able
to provide an accurate report (Marsden, 1993). We
checked our respondents’ answers by asking the
same questions to a second respondent from the
firm. This study surveyed the contacts of 25 randomly selected second respondents. Drawing on
these analyses it is reasonable to conclude that the
validity of the measures is acceptable, since no
significant mean differences were found.

RESEARCH DESIGN
Variables
Independent variables
Social interactions. To operationalize this variable, we based our method on prior research, in
particular Tsai and Ghoshal (1998), taking the frequency and intimacy of contact as a reference
(Marsden and Campbell, 1984). We also incorporated other items in accordance with the territorial
context of our sample (see Appendix).

DOI: 10.1002/smj

<-----Page 5----->1018

Trust. To operationalize this variable, we based
ourselves on prior research, combining indicators
used in Tsai and Ghoshal (1998); Blumberg (2001)
or Dakhli and De Clercq (2004), as well as incorporating other items in accordance with the territorial context of our sample (see Appendix).
Dependent variable
Innovation. This refers to the conversion of
knowledge into new products, services, or processes to be introduced on the market (or the
introduction of significant changes into existing
ones). We use only one dimension due to the particular incremental innovations that are common
in the specific context of our sample firms. It is
difficult to use conventional indicators of innovation. Indicators such as patents, copyrights, other
forms of legal protection or scientific publications,
achievements by individual researchers, and so on,
are not common practices for these firms. Prior
research has measured innovation by combining
several items related to the level of technology
activities and output generated in a given firm, and
self-reported data has been suggested as one of the
valid indicators (Keeble, 1997). Our measurement
of innovation is based on Tsai and Ghoshal (1998),
Meeus, Oerlemans, and Hage (2001) and Deroı̈an
(2002) (see Appendix).
Control variables
Size. We assumed that the size of the firm can
affect its capacity for innovation, thus allowing us
to control for economies and diseconomies of scale
at firm level (Grant, Jammine, and Thomas, 1988;
Hitt, Hoskisson, and Kim, 1997). Large organizations tend to have more resources with which to
enhance their innovation and performance (Tsai,
2001). They are also usually more powerful than
small ones and have some advantages when it
comes to gaining support for their business operations and innovation activities from other organizations (public institutions). Size was operationalized
as the number of employees using a conventional
classification (see Appendix).
Industry. In addition, industry was a necessary
control variable, given the systematic differences
between innovation factors, and it was controlled
by assigning different scores to firms. We used
firms from eight different industrial segments or
Copyright  2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

SIC codes and, in order to define the sample,
we employed a random stratified process to select
firms with proportional assignation according to
size and product segments (see Appendix).
Age. Finally, age was also included, since some
authors have suggested that in industrial districts
temporary evolution affects performance (Glasmeier, 1991; Pouder and St. John, 1996) (see
Appendix).
Analysis techniques
First, we calculated descriptive statistics, then we
calculated Cronbach’s alpha for all multiple-item
variables in order to validate the reliability of
the scale items. Additionally, Pearson’s correlation
matrix was also used to analyze the correlation of
all pairs of variables. Second, we ran a transformation of the dependent variable, innovation, by
applying a logarithm to correct the heteroskedasticity of residuals (Hair et al., 1998). Then, we ran
a nonlinear (inverted U-shaped [quadratic]) regression analysis for each independent variable against
the dependent variable, including previous control
variables.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s
alpha for the multiple-item variables, and Pearson’s correlation for all pairs of variables. The only
outstanding point to be dealt with is the expected
association between the variables social interactions and trust, and innovation. Since the social
interactions and trust variables are significantly
related, there might be an interactive effect. This
result can indeed be expected since they are different aspects of the same social capital.
Table 1 also shows that neither size nor industry
is significantly associated with innovation, or the
independent variables.
Table 2 shows the results of a nonlinear (inverted
U-shaped) regression analysis carried out to determine the effect of overembeddedness. First, the
control variables were not significant, and therefore were not factors that could explain innovation for the district firms. On the other hand,
although the quadratic term for social interactions
was nonsignificant in the regression equation, the
model did fit significantly, so we can consider

factors affect positively up to a certain point, where
the positive effect is then not only reduced, but in
fact becomes negative. Thus, the positive effect of
the social capital factors was eroded by making
intensive use of them.

CONCLUSIONS
The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding of the effect of social networks on innovation through the analysis of territorial agglomerations of firms. Undoubtedly the idea of a curvilinear relation is not at all new (Palich, Cardenal, and
Miller, 2000; Stock et al., 2001; Langfred, 2004).
However, in this particular case (social capital factors applied to clustered firms), as far as we know,
this form of relation has never been used. It is relevant for many reasons, such as the very importance
of the phenomenon of industrial clusters and districts, the dominant focus of previous research, and
the current challenges facing territorial agglomerations. Curvilinear relations can be understood
as a possible reason for this limitation and consequently indicate actions firms should undertake.
Clusters are trapped in their own net. The same
factors that once explained success can today be
the main threat and restraint for them. What we
observed was that firms that overinvest are less
innovative than the others.
It must be mentioned that whereas Hypothesis
2 was supported, Hypothesis 1 was not confirmed.
We must be cautious in interpreting the findings.
The specific conditions developed inside the district were probably acting as a moderator of the
curvilinear effect. In our understanding, and in
contrast to what happens with the costs associated to trust, the (physical and cognitive) proximity
between firms in clusters may reduce the costs of
maintaining highly intense social interactions. The
weight of nonbusiness relationships can be relevant
in a close relational context.
The finding that social capital factors can lead to
innovation loss contrasts with the way they have

traditionally been regarded as a benefit to organizations. An established stream of research such as
McEvily and Zaheer (1999) or Capello (1999) contains a number of examples worth mentioning. In
both studies, social or relational capital is analyzed
as a factor to create innovative capacity in firms.
The findings are, however, particularly important
to existing literature because negative effects of
specific social capital factors have not previously
been explored empirically, even though several
researchers have suggested that some dimensions
of social capital could have a downside.
As a matter for further discussion, we suggest
that, in order to access external sources of new
and exclusive knowledge, firms in districts can use
indirect rather then direct ties by means of intermediary agents (Molina-Morales and Martı́nezFernández, 2004). In particular, local institutions
are relevant actors in territorial networks that provide specific knowledge as a consequence of their
position as intermediaries.
The practical implication of our findings is not
that interactions and trust should be avoided in
clustered firms; rather, it is whether an organization
can find the optimal level of these social dimensions. These findings also emphasize the importance of exploring moderators in social capital
research, particularly in clustered firms. They also
define some important boundary conditions for the
benefits of interactions and trust. The joint effect of
different aspects of social capital on outputs (e.g.,
innovation) might be one of the priorities in future
research.
The following points can be viewed as possible
future avenues of research for the development of
this study. The fine-grained process through which
network structure is created or modified is an
interesting and important area for future research.
It is critical to know to what extent firms are
externally conditioned or, on the contrary, they
have a degree of freedom to decide the structure
and strength of the network of ties. Another fruitful
area of inquiry is the dynamics of how firms’
networks evolve and change in response to external
challenges and opportunities.

APPENDIX: OPERATIONALIZATION
OF VARIABLES
Social interactions∗ : (1) People from your company spend a considerable amount of time on
social occasions with people from other firms;
(2) People from your company spend a considerable amount of time on social events organized
by the local community; (3) A local origin and
common academic background of the employees
at local firms allow social interactions to take
place; (4) There is an informal network among
customers, suppliers and competitors; (5) You talk
to an external contact person very often (more than
once per week); and (6) You feel comfortable talking to the contact person responsible for getting
you the information that allowed your company’s
performance to be improved.
Trust∗ : (1) Other firms can rely on your company without any fear that you will take advantage of them, even if the opportunity arises to
do so; (2) In general, your company will always
keep the promises it makes to others; (3) Suppose
your company is seeking to be a business partner in a joint project. You are confident that you
will do what is required in the agreement (i.e.,
what partners believe you should do) even without a written contract that clearly specifies your
obligations; (4) You consider that other firms feel
a special duty to stand behind you in times of
trouble, so you consider it only fair that your
company should also give support to other firms;
(5) Generally speaking, there is a trusting climate
among suppliers and customers in the local area,
a feeling that most people can be trusted, or that
you can deal with people easily; and (6) You have
confidence in a variety of organizations or institutions, such as the legal system, the government, or
major companies.

(∗ ) Responses were scored on a five-point Likert
scale where 1 = fully disagree and 5 = fully agree.
We included the expression other firms to refer to
all the firms in contact with one individual firm
including, for instance, customers, competitors, or
suppliers. To measure the variable, we obtained
an average of all the items for each firm and
Cronbach’s alpha was run to validate the reliability
of scale items.
Innovation: (1) Number of developments or
introductions of new materials; (2) Number of
developments or introductions of new intermediate
products; (3) Number of developments or introductions of new components; (4) Number of developments or introductions of new attributes of the
products; (5) New developments or introductions
of new equipment; (6) Improvements in the level
of automation; (7) Number of new organizational
methods of productive activities; and (8) Use of
new energy sources. To measure the variable, we
added up the number of innovations reported for
each item over the last three years and Cronbach’s
alpha was run to validate the reliability of scale of
items.
Size: Size was operationalized as the number of
employees (1 = 11–50 employees; 2 = 51–250
employees; 3 = +250 employees). While we lost
information turning the item regarding the number
of employees into a scale interval; it is also true
that we have normalized the variable, which was
useful for our analysis.
Industry: We used firms from eight different industrial segments or SIC codes (food, textile, furniture, ceramic, leather, chemical products,
machinery, and paper) and, in order to define
the sample, we employed a random stratified process to select firms with proportional assignation
according to size and product segments.
Age: We used the year 2003 as a reference.
