Editorial
An overview of informal venture capital research
Introduction
Informal venture capital-equity investments and non-collateral forms of
lending made by private individuals (termed business angels) using their
own money, directly in unquoted companies in which they have no
family connection, plays a key role in the financing of emergent
businesses. First, it occupies a critical position in the growth firm
financing spectrum, filling the gap between founders, family and friends
and institutional venture capital funds which, because of their high
transactions costs, normally do not make small investments. Second,
the informal venture capital market is substantially larger than the
institutional venture capital market, in terms of both the amounts
invested in businesses at their start-up and early growth stage and the
number of such deals made. Third, business angels are ‘hands on’
investors, contributing their skills, expertise, knowledge and contacts in
a variety of informal and formal roles in their investee businesses:
because of their entrepreneurial background, business angels therefore
contribute more to a business than just money (Sohl, this issue).
Research into informal venture capital has expanded rapidly in recent
years, from ‘first generation’ (or market profile, largely descriptive) to
‘second generation’ (more analytical and policy oriented) studies, and a
range of issues which will form the basis of a third generation of
research in the field have been identified (Mason and Harrison in
press).
First generation studies
Research on the informal venture capital market was pioneered by
William E. Wetzel Jr in the early 1980s in the USA (Wetzel 1981). The
context for this study was the widely held perception that technologybased ventures encountered a ‘finance gap’ when seeking to raise small
amounts of early stage risk capital, although this ran counter to anecdotal
evidence that business angels played a key role in filling this gap.
However, little was known about their characteristics, the amount of
capital available, what they look for in an investment proposal and how
entrepreneurs could find them. Wetzel’s motivation was therefore to ‘put
some boundaries on our ignorance’. Emerging directly out of this study
was a public policy proposal to mobilise ‘angel money’ by establishing
regional referral networks to enable investors to examine a broader range

of investment opportunities. This provided a means of overcoming the
absence of efficient channels of communication between entrepreneurs
and investors which were impeding the efficient functioning of the
market.
Subsequent studies of informal venture capital in other parts of the
USA in the 1980s replicated and refined Wetzel’s pioneering study and
continued the focus on describing the attitudes, behaviour and characteristics of angels. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the international
diffusion of research on informal venture capital. Detailed studies of the
informal venture capital market have now been undertaken in Canada, the
United Kingdom, Sweden, The Netherlands and Finland. More recently,
studies have also been undertaken in Australia (Hindle and Wenban, this
issue) and Japan (Tashiro in press) and research is in progress in a number
of other countries, including Denmark, Norway, Germany, Singapore and
Saudi Arabia. The main focus of these studies is comparative, replicating
earlier US and UK studies, with a similar emphasis on market and investor
characteristics. In short, the objective in these studies has continued to be
to ‘put boundaries on our ignorance’ but in new geographical contexts.
What emerges from these studies is a high degree of similarity in the main
characteristics of business angels and their investment activity across
countries: business angels in different countries have many more common
features than differences, with only Japanese business angels deviating
significantly.
Second generation studies
‘Second generation’ studies of the informal venture capital market can be
grouped into three categories: studies which have addressed a range of new
topics; studies which have focused on policy issues; and studies which have
introduced a theoretical perspective. These studies reflect a growing
sophistication in the analysis of the informal venture capital market and
draw their inspiration more specifically from research in entrepreneurship
and institutional venture capital.
Research on new topics
The 1990s has seen research on a growing range of new topics, with
research on the institutional venture capital industry often providing the
inspiration. Three themes in particular have emerged. First, the investment
decision-making process has been analysed in terms of a stage model of the
informal venture capital investment decision–making process which is
similar, although not identical, to that of institutional venture capital
(Feeney et al. this issue). Second, a number of studies have investigated the
post-investment relationship, that is, the nature, extent and impact of the
contribution made by informal venture capital investors in their investee
business. Third, there have been attempts to analyse angels’ returns
achieved, the time to exit and the method of exit.

Applied studies
Wetzel’s pioneering research in the early 1980s made the original case for
policy intervention in the informal venture capital market to address
market inefficiency issues, and much of the subsequent research in this area
has focussed on the development of business angel networks, or business
introduction services, as a means of promoting informal venture capital
activity (Aernoudt, this issue). Most assessments of the effectiveness of
business angel networks are favourable, although there is increasing
concern amongst business angels about the poor quality of investment
opportunities that they see.
Theoretical approaches
Theoretical approaches to the analysis of the informal venture capital
market are the most recent and least extensive strand of research in the
field. Indeed, research on informal venture capital has not been
characterised to date by a high level of theoretical sophistication. However,
for both the informal venture capital market and the private equity market
more generally substantial progress in the application and development of
finance theory to the informal venture capital market is hindered by the
virtual absence of large-scale data sets. This special issue includes two
papers which seek to extend the conceptual basis of research in the field:
Feeney et al. apply elements of decision theory to the informal investor’s
decision-making processes, and Steier and Greenwood adopt a social
network model of organisation formation to analyse the evolution of
informal investor-firm relationships.
Informal venture capital research: prospects
Informal venture capital research remains a relatively small and immature
field of academic enquiry. Although the first studies were undertaken in the
early 1980s, it is only during the 1990s that researchers outside North
America have begun to focus on this topic. The research agenda for a ‘third
generation’ of research studies encompasses methodological, analytical,
theoretical and policy issues (Mason and Harrison in press).
Methodological issues
The single most important methodological problem in undertaking research
on the informal venture capital market arises from great difficulty in finding
business angels, who are both unwilling to identify themselves (as a result
there are no directories of business angels) and may be unwilling to respond
to research surveys. This has two consequences for researchers. First, the
size and characteristics of the population of business angels is unknown, and
unknowable. Second, research on the informal venture capital market has,

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded By: [Canadian Research Knowledge Network] At: 01:17 20 April 2008

Editorial

of necessity, been based on ‘samples of convenience’ whose representativeness can never be verified. Business angel research has tended to be heavily
reliant on large scale postal questionnaire surveys. While this methodological approach was appropriate when the emphasis was on descriptive
research, it is less suited to answering questions about how the market
actually operates. Thus, further studies of the informal venture capital
market need to consider alternative research designs, such as focusing on
particular types of business angel, using case studies to explore particular
aspects of the informal venture capital market (as in Steier and Greenwood’s
paper, this issue), establishing longitudinal tracking of panels of investors to
incorporate the time dimension, adopting critical incident analysis to resolve
the present impasse in studies which seek to assess the value-added impact
of hands on investors, the use of verbal protocol analysis to explore the way
in which business angels undertake their initial screening of investment
opportunities, and applications of conjoint analysis and qualitative
approaches such as focus groups to add new perspectives to our understanding of how the informal venture capital market operates.
Analytical issues
There are many issues where Wetzel’s call for research which can ‘put
boundaries on our ignorance’ remains valid. Seven issues in particular are
priorities for researchers to address. First, more sophisticated estimates of
the size of the informal venture capital market are required. Existing
estimates–based on extrapolation of fragmentary data–are extremely crude
and make no allowance for business angels’ investment allocation decisions
among assest classes, nor do they identify either trends in informal
investment activity over time, whether cyclical or secular, or the macroeconomic influences on the supply of informal venture capital. Second,
although the business angel population is heterogeneous, only a handful of
studies have actually developed angel typologies or studied particular subsets of business angels. However, the classifications are eclectic, and the
methodologies used are unsophisticated. Third, the organisation of the
market place warrants attention from researchers, in a shift from studies of
the actors in the market (firms, entrepreneurs, investors) to studies of the
market itself. Although business angels do invest alone, a majority of
informal venture capital investments take the form of business angels
investing as part of a syndicate. These can take various forms, and a high
priority for researchers is to ‘map’ this growing organisational diversity in
the informal investment market place and explore the differences in the
investment behaviour and activity of the various segments.
Fourth, informal venture capital should be examined from a geographical perspective. From a regional development perspective, the high degree of
localism in the informal venture capital market makes it a mechanism for
retaining and recycling wealth within the regions in which it was created.
However, there has been no attempt to identify whether there are spatial
variations in informal venture capital investment activity, nor has the
considerable debate about the significance of distance in the business angel’s

investment decision been resolved in terms of the proportion of total
investment activity accounted for by long distance investments, the
circumstances under which long distance investments are made, and the
significance of the characteristics and motivation of the investor relative to
the characteristics of the investment opportunity. Fifth, although the
number of national studies of informal venture capital has increased, our
existing knowledge remains heavily circumscribed geographically, with
much of the existing research comprising North American and North West
European studies. Although international comparisons have highlighted
surprisingly few differences between countries in the characteristics of
informal venture capital activity, it is nevertheless vital for research to be
undertaken in continental Europe (West and East) and in Latin America,
Africa and South and East Asia where cultural differences from the AngloSaxon model might be expected to be reflected in differences in informal
venture capital activity. Sixth, the role of business angels in the
development of technology-based firms is becoming an increasingly
important focus of research and policy, given that the lack of patient capital
is widely believed to be one of the key barriers to the emergence and growth
of technology-based firms. Finally, most informal venture capital research
has focused on the supply side of the market, and the demand for finance has
been largely ignored. Thus, there is a need for research which explores
informal venture capital from an entrepreneur’s perspective. Furthermore,
there is growing evidence that a major constraint on informal venture capital
investment activity is that many of the SMEs which seek such finance are
not ‘investment ready’, in terms of the ability of an entrepreneur to
articulate the opportunity to potential investors, the preparedness of an
entrepreneur to achieve the growth opportunity that has been identified,
and the willingness of the entrepreneur to trade some ownership and
independence in exchange for finance.
Theoretical development
There is a need for further development of theoretically-grounded research
into the informal venture capital market. Although a number of such studies
have been undertaken they are few in number and have produced conflicting
results which, in the case of agency theory, question the extent to which
finance theory is relevant to this market: with the development of venture
capital and private equity finance as major outlets for equity investment by
individual, institutional and corporate investors, so these mechanisms
provide a rich milieu within which to develop and test theories of the firm
and of interactions between the entrepreneur and the financier. The need, in
developing and applying these theoretical perspectives, is not simply to
replicate received finance theory but to extend and adapt it to the closely-held,
privately financed, entrepreneurial, emerging growth company. Furthermore, the scope for theoretical development is not restricted to finance and
economic theory, and there is potential for developing and applying theories
which address the non-financial dimensions of the investment process and
draw on other academic disciplines, such as social psychology and sociology.

Policy issues
Policy development has been the focus for much of the informal venture
capital literature. Further policy-oriented research continues to be
appropriate, both to assess the need for initiatives to stimulate informal
venture capital activity, and also to evaluate those initiatives that have been
introduced by policy-makers in various countries and at various levels of
government in response to the recognition that the informal venture capital
market plays an important role in underpinning wider initiatives to
promote entrepreneurial activity. Three areas in particular are relevant: the
assessment of tax incentives, the evaluation of the operation, impact and
scale of business angel networks, and the assessment of investment
readiness of businesses. As Aernoudt (this issue) points out, the case for
government intervention and regulation (beyond the ‘permissive’ or passive
intervention to ensure a level playing field) is not proven.
Conclusion
The informal venture capital market has become a growing focus of
research interest as a consequence of the increased recognition of its
significance in the financing of the entrepreneurial start-up and growth
business. Despite the difficulties created by the invisibility of investors in
this market, we now know a considerable amount about what has been
referred to as the attitudes, behaviours and characteristics of business
angels in a number of national and regional contexts. However, there
remains much that is unknown or inadequately understood about this
market place, in terms of both empirical research and the application of
theoretical frameworks. An enormous amount of research remains to be
undertaken in order to understand more fully how the informal venture
capital market operates as a key element in the emergence and growth of
entrepreneurial companies. The papers selected for this special issue make
a contribution to this challenge.
