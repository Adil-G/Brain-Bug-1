Factors for Success in R&D Projects and New
Product Innovation: A Contextual Framework
R. Balachandra, Member, IEEE, and John H. Friar

Abstract— There have been many attempts over the last 30
years to discover the critical factors that can indicate the success
or failure of R&D projects and new product introductions.
Because of the large number of studies that currently exist, the
authors undertook an extensive review of the germane literature
to find whether a general agreement exists about the factors
leading to success or failure in new product development and
R&D projects.
The review shows first that even with a conservative approach
to listing significant factors, the list is very long. Second, comparing the factors across studies demonstrates that different authors
have found that the magnitude of significance and the direction
of influence vary. Third, given the differences in context, the
meaning of similar factors may also vary.
The contradictory findings lead us to propose a contingency
framework for the new product and R&D project models. This
framework consists of a contingency cube with three contextual dimensions. Based on this framework, we propose a set of
propositions. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the
implications of a contingent approach for both researchers and
managers in the area of management of new products and R&D
projects.
Index Terms— Contextual variables, contingency model, new
product development, R&D projects, success factors for new
products.

I. INTRODUCTION

RINGING NEW products successfully to market is the
lifeblood for most organizations, but it is also a complex and difficult task. Of the nearly 16 000 new products
introduced in 1991, almost 90% did not reach their business
objectives [73]. It is hard to predict why some new products
succeed while most fail. Because the task is so difficult,
much has been written from a variety of research streams and
disciplines attempting to identify factors leading to successful
new products.
A precursor to a new product in a majority of the cases
is the R&D project needed to produce it. As in the case
of a new product, it is hard to predict why some commercial R&D projects succeed while most fail. Though the
two—new product development (NPD) and commercial R&D
projects—appear to be different at the outset, there is a
great deal of similarity between them. They are projects
undertaken by the firm to increase the product line and the
firm’s competitiveness in the market. In both cases, there is

uncertainty about the market, the technology, the costs of
production, and the process of development itself.
Many research studies have attempted to discover the critical factors that can indicate the success or failure of R&D
projects and new product introductions. Some have looked at
success factors in new product introduction, some have looked
at factors causing failure, and still others have looked at both
sets of factors. The studies show that there are a large number
of factors influencing the success of a new product or an R&D
project (aimed at developing a new product). Some of them
are controllable from within the organization but others are
external and uncontrollable.
All of these studies have several things in common: they
identify a number of factors, based on the literature or on
common sense, that have been surmised to have some influence on the success of projects; they select a sample of
projects and evaluate the factors for these projects; and they
perform statistical analysis to identify the significant factors.
While some studies collect data from actual projects, others ask
executives to rate the contribution and importance of factors
for the success of projects of which the executives have some
personal understanding.
Even though successful outcomes of a new product or
commercial R&D project are hard to predict, the research to
date has attempted to derive a comprehensive model of what
leads to success or failure. A comprehensive model usually
lists a number of factors contributing to the success or failure
of a new product or an R&D project. Even from a cursory
review of the literature in these areas (NPD and R&D project
success), one comes away with the conclusion that there is a
plethora of factors deemed critical for success or failure.
To study this issue in greater depth, we undertook a review
of the literature of R&D project management and NPD. The
areas of R&D project management (especially in the commercial sector, where projects are taken up with a commercial
motive) and new product management deal essentially with
the common problems of linking technology and development
efforts to manufacturing and marketing, albeit with differing
emphasis.
We also looked at the literatures of related fields to which
the factors pointed, e.g., for market variables, we looked at
marketing literature. We wanted to investigate further if what
the factors found in these studies agreed with the findings
of the specific field. We therefore reviewed over 60 articles
in the literature of the related fields to find whether there
existed general agreement about the factors leading to success
or failure in NPD and R&D projects.

Our analysis shows that the conclusions from the studies are
nonuniform, and in some cases, they are even contradictory.
Even though our review has led us to conclude that there are
a number of well-known methodological weaknesses in the
studies and models, we argue that several of the critical factors
identified by these studies are contextual. The contexts determine the appearance or nonappearance of some critical factors.
Varying contexts also cause the somewhat contradictory nature
of some of the factors.
This review illustrates some of the major contradictions
regarding the effects of some factors on the outcome of an
NPD or commercial R&D project. Because of the differences
in such factors as approaches, methodologies, definitions,
and benchmarks, we created a structure by which we could
compare what the various studies concluded for the many
variables that were considered.
To test whether the conclusions were an artifact resulting
from looking across different fields, we undertook an in-depth
analysis of 19 studies from only the two narrowly defined
fields—R&D projects and NPD. The results of this detailed
analysis confirm the overall results.
We then analyzed the characteristics of the studies and
identified the set of significant factors in NPD and R&D
projects. The list of factors identified by these studies is
very large (72). The analysis also highlights some important
differences between new product studies and R&D project
studies.
The conclusions from the detailed review and analysis lead
us to propose a contextual model for the NPD and R&D
project models. This preliminary contextual model consists
of a contingency cube with three contextual dimensions.
We propose a set of propositions based on this model and
framework. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the
implications of a contingent approach for both researchers and
managers in the area of management of new products and
R&D projects.

II. REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON SUCCESS/FAILURE
FACTORS FOR R&D PROJECTS AND NEW PRODUCTS
The literature discussing success in product innovation and
R&D projects is vast. We examined over 60 papers in these
fields. Success in product innovation or in R&D projects is
hard to define, for it is a composite of a number of measures.
There is also a time gap between a product’s introduction
or the completion of a R&D project and it’s being deemed
a success. Cooper and Kleinschmidt [21] identify three factors that are themselves composites—financial performance,
opportunity window, and market share. These measures are
usually available after a considerable interval. A recent study
by Griffin et al. [34] illustrates the divergence of views about
and the complexity of the definition of success in NPD. Since
there is no one common measure of success, and success is a
composite of a number of subjective and objective measures,
we have used success as defined by the individual authors of
the studies.
To provide a better understanding of the phenomenon, we
categorized the large number of factors that determine success

277

using a variant of the method used in marketing strategy
studies to structure information [1]—market, technology, environment, or organization. The following review of the relevant
literature is ordered into these four major categories.
A. Market
In both new product introduction and R&D projects, market
is an important category. There is universal agreement that
there should be a strong market for the new product under
consideration or for the outcome of the R&D project. The
pioneering SAPPHO study [65] and Cooper [13], [14] gave
high importance to “strength of market” based on an analysis
of the potential size of the market, the expected market
share, and the profitability of the new product. Cochran [11],
Cooper [15], and Rubenstein et al. [66] also supported good
market analysis without specifically getting into the strength
aspect. Mansfield and Wagner [53] went a step further and
suggested that the market analysis should be done early.
Other authors, however, have noted that market analysis
tends to direct projects toward existing markets with small,
incremental advances rather than to undeveloped markets with
major innovations [31], [35], [55], [74]. Too much market
analysis can drive out innovation, so a careful balance must
be maintained.
Though market analysis will prepare the organization to plan
product development better, one wonders whether accurate
information on market needs can be obtained. Gaynor [32] suggested that a new product should meet customer needs/wants
and that there should be a good understanding of the market.
Many authors have analyzed the difficulty of getting good
information on customer needs for innovative products in
potential markets because customer preferences may not be
known by the customers themselves [43], [67], [72]. Existing
market-assessment tools are inadequate for highly innovative
products, and organizational boundaries inhibit needs assessment [27], [43].
Some authors have argued beyond the expectation of a
strong market and have instead concluded that the market
must already exist instead of being potential. The need for the
existence of a strong market was supported by Balachandra
[6], Balachandra and Raelin [5], Hopkins [38], Carter [10],
and Islei et al. [39]. An existing market lessens the difficulties
in customer research and forecasting but again raises the
issue that the ability to do good market analysis may drive
companies to small, incremental advances.
The expected growth rate of the market for the product is
an important factor for the decision to pursue the new product.
Merrifield [56] cited this factor as important in evaluating the
business side of the new product decision. Balachandra [7]
suggested the growth phase in the life cycle of the product as
a strong positive factor. Utterback [71], Rubenstein et al. [66],
and Cooper [15] also indicated that a new product introduced
in response to a growing market has a greater chance of
success. Yoon and Lilien [75], however, found higher success
rates when products were introduced into markets with slow
growth.
Maidique and Zirger [49] considered coming into a market
early as a strong factor in the success of the new product.

<-----Page 2----->278

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, VOL. 44, NO. 3, AUGUST 1997

Nevens et al. [60] reinforced this idea by suggesting the
potential losses a company incurs by delaying the introduction
of the product. On the other hand, Yoon and Lilien [75],
Freeman [28], and Porter [64] found that coming into a market
later may be more advantageous in some cases.
Then there is competition. Though we have considered this
to be a part of market analysis, some researchers include this in
the environmental factors group, especially when the product
is completely new with no known competition. One may have
to consider competition likely to arise from completely unknown sources. Merrifield [56] looked at competitive analysis
as a major factor, while Carter [10] called it competitive
environment.
The rate of new product introduction in the product category
was considered an important factor by Balachandra [7] and
Islei et al. [39]. To an extent, this reflects the stage of life cycle
of the product category. Higher rate of introduction implies the
growth stage, which in turn implies a better chance of success
for the new product. Other studies have found that a higher rate
of introduction implies greater intensity of competition and is
therefore a strong negative factor for commercial success [11],
[15], [49], [75].
From this brief discussion, we see that though market
strength is a composite factor, its estimation is contextual,
because some components for estimating market strength may
contribute positively in some situations but negatively in
others. The main contextual feature is whether the new product
is entering an established market or is an innovative product
for which there is no established market.
B. Technology
The next major category is technology. Many studies [11],
[13], [47], [49] found an innovative product to have a greater
chance of success in the market, while some found otherwise
[54], [65]. Others, like Freeman [28] and Mansfield [51], have
found that innovative products are much more likely than
less innovative products to fail. The degree of innovativeness,
therefore, is an important consideration. Kleinschmidt and
Cooper [41] recently found that the relationship between
innovativeness and commercial success is not linear but rather
U-shaped. A single relationship between innovativeness and
commercial success, therefore, is still uncertain.
Many studies [13], [46], [49], [50], [66] identified “perceived value of the product” as an important factor. This
factor was expressed in a number of different ways, chief
among them being “high performance to cost.” Friar [30],
however, suggested that customers may have difficulty in actually differentiating performance among competing alternatives
in technologically sophisticated areas, and it may take years
for the market to sort out the differences.
Some studies included patentability of the product or at least
a strong technology in the product as an important factor for
success [10], [55], [66], [70]. Technology push, though, was
not considered as strong a factor as demand pull by a number
of studies [51], [54], [65], [71], although in a review of this
literature [58], the definitions were found to be so broad as
to be meaningless. Further, studies have shown that in many

TABLE I

industries where NPD is important, companies do not even
bother to patent their advances [44], [49], [52].
It is apparent that the influence of technology factors on the
success of the new product is dependent on other contextual
factors, mainly the innovativeness of the technology.
C. Environment
A product cannot succeed if the environment in which it
is introduced is not supportive. The environment consists of a
number of different aspects, such as political and social factors,
public interest in the product, and social acceptability of the
product. The environmental factors analyzed in the studies
(except for one) were unique to each study. Four studies [5],
[10], [39], [56] included assured availability of raw materials
as a critical factor. Though in ordinary times this is not so
important, it can become critical in times of hostilities and
market-induced shortages.
Researchers, therefore, have yet to agree on which factors
to analyze, much less on which factors are significant. Cooper
[12], moreover, found the environmental factors to be unimportant. By default, so did the authors of the other studies in
new product management, as they did not find any significant
factors in this area (Table III, factors 1–7). The authors of
R&D project studies looked for and found significant factors
in the environment but just could not agree on which ones.
D. Organization
Whatever the technological, market, and environmental factors may be, if the organization is not capable of getting
the new product into the market, then the product will fail.
All studies in this review have focused on some issues of
organization.
Many authors have suggested that the organization should
receive strong support from the marketing function for the
new product (for example, Maidique and Zirger [50], SAPPHO
[65], Marquis [54], Cochran [11], Cooper [14], and Link [47]).
However, what does strong support mean in this context?
Many studies assumed that this aspect is self-evident, and
in the questionnaires used by these studies, the executives
were asked to evaluate a question such as, “Did the new

<-----Page 3----->BALACHANDRA AND FRIAR: R&D PROJECTS AND NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION

279

TABLE II
STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS

product receive strong support from marketing?” But studies
by Snow and Hrebiniak [68] and Hitt et al. [36] have shown
that companies with strengths in the R&D function often have
weak or no marketing skills. Frohman [31], moreover, found
that help from the marketing function was a hindrance rather
than an aid.
Planning and scheduling the process of new product introduction or an R&D project was considered very important
by a number of studies [11], [15], [31], [49], [65], [66], [70].
Using quantitative techniques for project selection was deemed
important by Liberatore and Titus [45], and their study found
that firms using such techniques had better results. Others [53],
[55], however, found that quantitative project selection was
negatively correlated to economic success.
The source of a new product idea has received some
attention from researchers. It is suggested by some researchers
that the organizational source of a new product idea can
generate interest and motivate the technical personnel to
devote their energies to making the new product idea work.
Some authors recommend that new product ideas be generated
from the marketing department, as it is close to customers’
needs [13], [53], [65]. This is disputed by others [31], [36],
[67], who suggest that ideas from the marketing department
generally lead to incremental products, which may not generate
much enthusiasm from the technical staff. They further suggest
that the really innovative ideas come from the technical staff.
We have presented here a brief review of the relevant
literature and highlighted the conflicting nature of some of
the conclusions. The set of factors considered important is
different in different studies, and even when the factors are
similar, their definitions and measurement are different. Even
the effect on success is sometimes contradictory. The contradictory nature of these results is presented in Table I, which
clearly illustrates our contention.

III. AN ANALYSIS OF SELECTED
STUDIES AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES
The contradictory nature of the conclusions from the studies
is itself very interesting. To test whether the contradictory
conclusions are a result of looking at studies in diverse fields,
we performed a detailed and in-depth analysis of studies from
the two fields of commercial R&D projects and NPD. Since
there are a large number of studies in these fields, we focused
our attention on a limited number by selecting studies based
on the following criteria.
1) The study should have some empirical support, regardless of the methodology used.
2) The study should identify a specific set of factors as
being important for success or failure.
3) Only one major study from an author or team should be
considered.
Nineteen studies met these criteria. The first criterion filtered out a large number of articles that were based on the
experiences of an individual. The second criterion excluded
those studies whose main focus was not success/failure of new
products or R&D projects but that had peripheral references
to these issues (including some of the articles cited in Table
I). Third, some authors have published numerous studies in
this area. They are usually for different samples—industries,
countries, etc. From such authors, we selected one study that
we considered the most representative, as we found a high
degree of consistency in the factors that specific authors found
in their studies over time.
These criteria reduced the number of studies selected for
detailed analysis from a large list to 19 studies. Table II shows
the studies and their important features.
From these 19 studies, we extracted the factors identified
as significant. The authors use a variety of techniques to

<-----Page 4----->280

TABLE III
FACTORS IDENTIFIED BY THE STUDIES

derive the significant factors. Typically, they start with a long
list of factors (some studies started with a list of over 120
factors) based on earlier studies, the researchers’ personal
experiences, and discussions with managers and academics.
Then the authors collect data for these factors from actual
projects from the executives of the firm (in many cases) or for
hypothetical projects from executives attending a conference.
The data for the large number of factors are then clustered into
a smaller number using statistical techniques such as factor
analysis. The derived factors are then used in a classification
technique—either discriminant analysis or, in some cases,
regression analysis—to identify the most significant factors.
Because of the steps involved, the possible variations in
each of the steps, and the absence of a universal set of initial
factors for which to collect data, the number of significant
factors identified by the studies range from a low of three
to a high of 16. We used only the final factors the authors
put forward in their studies and not all the significant ones
found. Even though we used this conservative approach, we
ended with 72 factors. We then designed a matrix showing the
factors and the studies that identified them.
While generating this matrix, we examined the definitions
of each factor as described by the authors and grouped
them according to their descriptions. Some of the factors are
common to a number of studies, while others are unique to
specific studies. We assigned to each factor in the matrix an
identification letter—M(arket), T(echnology), E(nvironment),
or O(rganization)—to designate the category to which it be-

longs. We agreed on 92% of the codings. Where disagreement
occurred and could not be reconciled, the factor was jointly
coded. The results of such codings are shown in Table III.
We also examined whether the factor was influencing the
success of the R&D project/new product in a positive or
negative manner. We marked those factors providing a positive
and those providing a negative influence
influence with a
. The factors whose influence was either positive
with a
or negative were marked with an [*]. We coded the factors
individually.
Studying a complex phenomenon like product innovation
or an R&D project to glean the factors leading to success
is made more difficult by the quality of data available to
researchers. As we reviewed the studies, we categorized the
methodological issues. We found four major areas of weakness
in the studies: quality of data, definition of new product,
factor selection and definitions, and measurement of factors.
We do not want to restate what is well known; several
authors in the studies discussed some of the methodological
issues themselves (Cooper [13], Maidique and Zirger [49],
and Rubenstein et al. [66]). We want to suggest, however,
that because of the methodological issues, great care must be
taken in comparing what was concluded in one study with the
results of another. A brief discussion of the methodological
issues is presented in the Appendix.
There are some interesting conclusions from this detailed
study. Though the total list of significant factors identified by
the studies is very long (72), half of them are unique to specific

<-----Page 5----->BALACHANDRA AND FRIAR: R&D PROJECTS AND NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION

281

FACTORS IDENTIFIED BY THE STUDIES

studies. About 75% of the final factors were identified in just
one or two studies. Table IV shows the average number of
different types of factors in the two types of studies.
Two differences between R&D studies and new product
studies are immediately apparent from Table IV. The first

is the smaller average number of significant factors found
in the NPD studies versus the R&D project studies—about
half. The other, somewhat surprising, result is that studies
by researchers with a marketing orientation appear to have
put more emphasis on internal factors that are organization

related, especially the launching and marketing activities, (see
for example Calantone and di Benedetto [9]), while researchers
with a technical orientation have put more emphasis on the
external factors that are market and environment related, as
seen by the relative percentage of each group of factors.
Technology factors were considered about evenly. This would
appear to be counterintuitive in that one would assume that
project management by definition is organization related and
new product management is market and environment related.
The small value for the average number of final factors
in the new product management studies is due to many
researchers’ having started with a large number of significant
variables and then reduced them to a more compact list using
factor analysis (Table III). This is more common in the NPD
studies (60% versus 0%) and so, as seen in Table IV, the
average number of factors in these studies is much smaller
than in R&D project studies.
In trying to understand the counterintuitive second finding,
we analyzed the factors that more than three studies agreed
upon. As the results in Table V show, there were 14 such
factors. Of them, only three were evenly agreed upon by both
literatures, and 9 came from studies predominantly of one kind
or the other. The other two factors were cited by three studies
of one kind or the other. From this list, it becomes apparent
that the R&D project studies more readily agreed on project
and technology issues—probability of technical success, need
to lower cost, availability of raw materials, timing, and wellplanned R&D process—while the new product studies agreed

on marketing and competition factors—emphasize marketing,
see marketing and technology as strengths, and recognize the
competitive environment. The latter are aggregates, moreover,
which are composites of several additional factors.
If we were to classify these factors as internal and external
depending on the amount of influence the firm can exert on
them, the R&D project studies found more significant factors
that are external, while the NPD studies agreed more on
factors that are internal. A possible reason for this result is
that the two types of studies have traditionally looked at the
process at different stages. The R&D project studies have
looked at the development stage of a new product, where
the technology and a number of other external factors can
affect the outcome significantly. The NPD studies, on the other
hand, have looked at situations where the idea for the product
is at a well-advanced stage in development, its technology
has been fairly well developed, but the actual launching and
marketing remains. Naturally, the emphasis is then on the
internal activities.
This discussion confirms our conjecture that there are many
contradictions in the effect of different factors on the success of
NPD or R&D projects. It further leads to a suspicion that there
is no one universal model encompassing the success/failure of
either new products or R&D projects.
Based on this review and analysis of the selected studies and
the larger field, we propose that the success/failure factors are
related to the context. This is not a novel idea. Other branches
of management—organization theory, strategy, marketing, and
international business—have moved toward contingency theories [1], [25], [33], [42], [57], [64]. In Section IV, we propose
a set of propositions relating the context of the NPD or R&D
project to its success or failure.
IV. A CONTEXTUAL STRUCTURE
NPD AND R&D PROJECT MODELS

FOR

A number of different models have been proposed for
NPD (see for example [9], [15], and [46]). Some focus on
the process [17], while others focus on the outcomes [9].
Mahajan and Wind [47] have suggested the role of models
in supporting and improving the NPD process. Most of these
are conceptual. We use parts of these models in developing a
conceptual model based on contingencies. Contextual models
have started appearing for explaining different aspects of NPD.
Two recent studies are worth mentioning: Olson et al. [61]
look at the relationship between product innovativeness and
organizing for NPD, while Ali [2] develops a contingency
model involving numerous hypotheses for the type of NPD
undertaken by a firm and a number of contextual variables.
Tables I, III, and IV and the discussion in the foregoing
section lead one to suspect that there may be only a few
universal factors to help identify successful new products or
R&D projects. We have shown that several important factors
deemed significant for successful product innovation can vary
not only in magnitude but also in direction depending on the
context. It appears that a factor may be helpful in leading
to success in some contexts but may lead to failure or be
unimportant in a different context.

<-----Page 7----->BALACHANDRA AND FRIAR: R&D PROJECTS AND NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION

Given the importance of contextual variables, we argue
that frameworks or models should take into account these
contingencies. Models that do not take these contextual issues
into account may lead to erroneous conclusions. Based on the
review and analysis discussed above, we propose and identify
the underlying parameters causing the contingencies.
We suggest that there are three major groups of contextual
variables for successful new product innovation and R&D
projects:
• nature of the innovation;
• nature of the market;
• nature of the technology.
We could consider a fourth group—nature of the industry.
There is not enough evidence in the literature to develop any
hypotheses for this group, although some recent studies have
started looking at different industrial segments (for example,
Islei et al. [39] and de Brentani [24]). One could argue,
however, that even in different industries, what really affects
the outcome of an R&D or NPD project is dictated by the
above three contextual groups.
Each of these groups has been individually described in
some of the studies we reviewed, but no study has explored
all of them together. Also, the general argument used by the
authors when contextual differences have been found is that
the magnitude of the effect of the factor on success or failure
of a new product differs, but not the direction. By looking
across different studies, however, we see that not only can the
magnitude vary but also the direction (Table I). Each of these
contextual groups will be described briefly in the following
paragraphs. We also propose a number of propositions based
on the contextual structure and the discussion that follows.
These propositions can then be tested with suitable empirical
research.
A. Nature of the Innovation
The level of “newness” in a product innovation can vary
broadly. Although Wheelwright and Clark [74] identified
three classes of innovation in new products—incremental, new
generation, and radically new—the studies that considered the
type of innovation in R&D or NPD projects looked at the poles
of incremental and radical innovation. Three studies ([3], [41],
and [75]) found differences in factors depending on whether
the innovation was pioneering (radical) or incremental.
The level of innovation for a new product or an R&D project
ranges over a wide spectrum. As a first cut, we will consider two levels of innovation—incremental and radical. An
incremental innovation is one where the basic technology and
product configuration remains essentially the same and only
minor modifications are made to the performance, flexibility,
appearance, and other characteristics. A radical innovation is
one where the technology is considerably different from the
earlier product.
The incremental innovation is usually attempted in a wellestablished market [2]. For example, Sony’s Walkman came
out with a number of incremental innovations in the 1980’s,
but the market was well established and the customer was

283

well identified. The market analysis in such cases can be very
thorough.
In the case of radical innovation, the market may not exist
at all. The product design in such cases may be based solely
on the creative instincts of the designer by understanding user
needs through empathy with the user world—what LeonardBarton calls empathic design [43]. The market uncertainty is
usually very high. Performing a detailed market analysis may
be impossible and fruitless in such cases.
The nature of the innovation has different effects on market
and organization factors affecting the success of the new
product or R&D project. In the case of a radical innovation
it is much harder, if not impossible, to forecast and perform
early analyses on customer needs, market size, market growth,
and competition. Consequently, using formal market analysis
is relatively less important. On the other hand, an incremental
innovation requires a thorough market analysis of an existing
market.
In organizational factors, source of ideas and use of quantitative techniques are prime examples of factors that will
vary depending on the level of innovation. Likewise, how
companies organize for radical innovation has been shown
to differ from how they organize for incremental innovation
[40], [69], [70].
B. Nature of the Market
The nature of the market for a new product can be categorized into two types—existing and new. Whether a company
is innovating in an existing market or trying to create a
completely new market will cause differences in factors. In
the former case, the new product meets an existing need but
with some improvements, and therefore the market uncertainty
is relatively low. In the latter case, it meets a latent need, and
the uncertainty of the market can therefore be very high. The
market analyses for the two types are completely different [67].
Likewise, the quality of the information one can discover
about the market and customers will differ so that the meaning
of some factors will change. As Maidique and Zirger [50]
found, market understanding for existing markets came from
proactive approaches, but in new markets it came from passive
understanding of user needs because of gut feel or experience.
C. Nature of the Technology
Although classifying technology is hard, one useful classification is high tech versus low tech. The uncertainties in
market and technology are different for the two groups. Link
[47] found differences in factors depending on whether the
setting was high tech. In the high-tech field, the technology
is developing very rapidly, and so new product introductions
come quickly. The applications and customers may not yet be
determined if the technologies are still emerging. This turbulence would have an impact on the marketing and technology
factors. The perceived value of any given advance can get
lost in the large number of advances. Because standards for
the products and their performance are not set, early market
entrants can be hurt by later developments.

TABLE VI
A SUGGESTED SCHEME OF RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT EVALUATION FACTORS FOR COMBINATIONS OF CONTEXTUAL VARIABLES*

In low tech, the areas are well defined. The new products
have to conform to many of the well-established standards
and practices and so have to provide an advantage within this
structure. One of the axioms of technology is that what is high
tech today will be low tech tomorrow.
Using this structure, we propose a contingency framework
for NPD and R&D project success. This structure can provide
a better understanding of the factors that influence success in
these areas. The framework comprises a contingency cube with
two levels for each of the three contextual variables. Fig. 1
shows this structure.
There are a total of eight blocks in this cube corresponding
to the different possible combinations of levels and dimensions. Depending upon the specific combination of the three
contextual variables, the emphasis to be placed on different
sets of success factors is different. For example, if an NPD
project is in a block with the characteristics of an incremental
innovation with low technology for an existing market, the
market factors are very important, implying careful market
analysis. It also suggests that the technology factors are not
that important. On the other hand, the organizational factors
are very important. This means that in studies focusing on
such cases, technology factors may not be found, or even if
found may receive a low importance.
Based on this categorization of the contextual factors relevant in NPD and R&D projects, we propose the set of hypotheses pertaining to the relative importance of the three types of
factors—market, technological, and organizational—as shown
in Table VI. We have not included environmental factors, as
our review of the literature and analysis has shown that they
are not important.
These hypotheses suggest that even if there were a universal
set of factors for predicting the success of a new product or
an R&D project, the relative importance for the factors would
be different depending on the contextual nature of the project.
One may not even have to consider some factors in some situations, while some factors have to be very carefully evaluated
because of their high importance for a given combination of
contextual factors.
The relative importance of the three types of factors for
the eight contexts (one for each combination of contextual
variables) can be tested through empirical studies with methodologies similar to those that have been used in the NPD and

Fig. 1. The contingency cube for new product development and R&D
projects.

R&D project success/failure studies. The only additional step
will be in classifying the sample projects into one of the eight
groups depending upon their characteristics. The importance
of the factors is usually measured by the value of either the
discriminant function or regression coefficient (depending on
the nature of the analysis).
V. CONCLUSION
Successful product innovation is an important yet complex
and difficult undertaking. Research in the area has attempted
to specify those factors that can increase the number of
project successes. After many studies, the notion of finding
a single set of universal factors is now considered naive [70].
Studies have moved instead to discover the set of factors
that influence product success. These studies have attacked
the issue from several different approaches and settings. This
has been considered as positive by Maidique and Zirger
[49] because the use of complementing methodologies and
settings is essential for optimum triangulation on describing
the “proverbial elephant.”
From our structured review of the literature, however, one
may conclude that we are not attempting to describe the

<-----Page 9----->BALACHANDRA AND FRIAR: R&D PROJECTS AND NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION

elephant but rather a menagerie: the set of universal factors
instead appears to be contextually based. The review has
shown first that even with a conservative approach to listing
significant factors, the list is very long. Second, comparing
the factors across studies demonstrates that different authors
have found that the magnitude of significance and the direction
of influence can vary so that the factors are contingent.
Third, given the differences in context, the meaning of similar
factors may vary, such as understanding the market. For
example, do we “know” the market from proactive searches
for information or from intuitive gut feel? What these studies
have been describing, then, are different animals and not
one.
By comparing studies from two different but related fields
whose final aim—successful product innovation—is the same,
we have found that the already complex task of understanding
the factors leading to success cannot be totally explained by
one set of factors for all situations. Instead, depending on
the situation, different factors become more or less important,
and some may actually begin to hinder rather than aid in the
already difficult task of NPD.
A move to contingency-based theory in factors for successful products would be consistent with the directions other areas
of business research have taken. Several authors in product
innovation have taken the next step from describing the factors
to creating models that explain the relationships between the
factors [9], [12], [22], [75], [76]. These models, however, are
based on single sets of factors that each author found in earlier
work. Such model building should incorporate a contingency
element to improve explanatory power.
More research is required to understand the contextual nature of the factors. By saying that product success is contingent
on contextual variables, we do not mean to imply what Cooper
[13] posed long ago: “Perhaps the problem is so complex,
and each case so unique, that attempts to develop generalized
solutions are in vain.” We believe instead that there are only
a few contextual variables that are relevant. Our analysis suggests that the three contextual variables—nature of innovation,
nature of market, and nature of technology—can encompass
the range of pertinent contexts to be explored. Though these
contextual variables have a continuous spread, we suggest two
levels for each to provide a parsimonious model.
The framework and the propositions developed here can
be tested with methodologies similar to those that have been
used in the NPD and R&D project success/failure studies, with
some modifications.
The findings have a number of implications for practicing managers. Depending on the set of contextual variables,
management can save much effort by minimizing the effort
on factors that are not very important for that configuration
of variables (for example, by deemphasizing market research
efforts for a high-technology, radical innovation product where
there is not going to be much reliable data). Using this
structure, management can direct the appropriate source for
generating new product ideas—whether it is for a highly
innovative product to be introduced into a not yet existing
market or for an incremental innovation in an existing market.

APPENDIX
METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES IN THE STUDIES ON NEW
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND R&D PROJECT SUCCESS
There are four major areas of weakness in the studies on
success or failure factors in NPD and R&D projects:
1) quality of data;
2) definition of new product;
3) factor selection and definition;
4) measurement of factors.
A. Quality of Data
Four common characteristics of the data contributed to
the general weakness of the studies: timing of the studies,
case selection, number of company respondents, and industry
specificity.
1) Timing of the Studies: In most cases, the evaluations
were done as postmortems, which could possibly lead to some
coloring of the evaluations based on hindsight. Very rarely
were the data collected during a project’s life.
2) Case Selection: There were more cases of success in the
samples even though in actuality, there are more failures than
successes [6], [73]. Researchers indicate that it is difficult to
get data about failures. Some researchers say that they are
fortunate to get even as many examples of failed projects as
they have.
3) Number of Company Respondents: Most studies generally had only one respondent in each company providing data
through completing the questionnaires. Whether this person
can provide an objective evaluation of the factors depends on
the extent of the person’s involvement.
4) Industry Specificity: Researchers usually focused on
some specific industries and highlighted the factors perceived
to be important for those industries (for example, Baker et al.
[4] for the agricultural products industry and Islei et al. [39]
for the pharmaceutical industry).
Even studies that attempted to obtain a cross section of
industries did not get many different industries in their samples. We found on average five industries surveyed, when
such information was given. Whether the results found in
one industry, moreover, can be generalized to all industries
has been questioned. Damanpour [25], Miller [57], and Friar
[29] have found that strategic success is industry specific,
so the reliability of pooling industries is questionable; so is
generalizing from industry-specific studies.
B. Definition of New Product
The definition of a new product poses some problems.
The studies generally did not make any distinction between
different types of new products—a new product is usually
anything that is introduced into the market by the firm,
regardless of the extent and type of newness. The newness
could be in the technology, market, application, or even just a
minor modification or extension of the existing product. This
issue recently has been addressed by Leonard-Barton [43] and
Ali [2]. They both indicate that there are vast differences in
managing different types of new product introduction.

<-----Page 10----->286

IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT, VOL. 44, NO. 3, AUGUST 1997

C. Factor Selection and Definition

[14]

The areas of R&D project management (especially in the
commercial sector, where projects are taken up with a final
commercial motive) and new product management deal essentially with the common problems of linking technology and
development efforts to manufacturing and marketing, albeit
with differing emphasis. The emphasis is different as the two
correspond to different stages in the product’s development,
leading to some difference in the factors and variables used.
The problem in comparing aggregate variables is that the
underlying factors are often different. Therefore, even though
the aggregate terms may be similar, the underlying meanings
can be very different. Also, about half of the factors are unique
to each study.
Different sets of factors are used in the studies depending
on the area of the study, the researcher’s orientation, and the
sample of projects. Table IV shows the average number of
different types of factors in the two types of studies.
There is further confusion in terminology and in definitions
of factors. For example, what does “emphasize marketing”
mean? Does it imply that management provides the resources
asked for by marketing? Or does the marketing group get
special attention from management? In several cases, the
factors are considered self-evident, so that no clear definitions
were given even though a term may have many different
meanings; for example, “support of top management” may
take many different forms.

[15]

[23]

D. Measurement of Factors

[31]

Very few studies provided any benchmarking for the ratings
of the factors. It is usually assumed that the factor descriptions
and the scales are self-evident. Many of the qualitative factors
are rated on a Likert-type scale.
