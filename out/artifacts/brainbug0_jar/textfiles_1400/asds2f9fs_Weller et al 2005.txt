ABSTRACT—Do decisions about potential gains and potential losses require different neural structures for advantageous choices? In a lesion study, we used a new measure of
adaptive decision making under risk to examine whether
damage to neural structures subserving emotion affects an
individual’s ability to make adaptive decisions differentially for gains and losses. We found that individuals with
lesions to the amygdala, an area responsible for processing
emotional responses, displayed impaired decision making
when considering potential gains, but not when considering
potential losses. In contrast, patients with damage to the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area responsible for
integrating cognitive and emotional information, showed
deﬁcits in both domains. We argue that this dissociation
provides evidence that adaptive decision making for risks
involving potential losses may be more difﬁcult to disrupt
than adaptive decision making for risks involving potential
gains. This research further demonstrates the role of
emotion in decision competence.

Throughout life, every individual is confronted with decisions
that bear a certain degree of risk. Despite its ubiquity, many
individuals approach risk with trepidation, as the term risk
itself often brings to mind thoughts of potential peril and danger.
In fact, the dictionary deﬁnition of the term is ‘‘the possibility
of suffering harm or loss’’ (American Heritage Dictionary of
the English Language, Fourth Edition, cited by Dictionary.com,
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/risk). It follows that the

ability to make advantageous choices in the face of risk, especially when undesired consequences may result from an imprudent choice, is an essential aspect of human survival.
Given the potentially detrimental consequences that an illconsidered choice may bring, it is important to understand the
underlying psychological mechanisms that help people arrive at
advantageous decisions. Emotions may be one such substrate.
Indeed, research from a wide range of disciplines suggests that
emotions play a critical role in decision making under uncertainty (e.g., A.R. Damasio, 1994; Hsu, Bhatt, Adolphs, Tranel, &
Camerer, 2005; Huettel, Stowe, Gordon, Warner, & Platt, 2006;
Kuhnen & Knutson, 2005; Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, & Welch,
2001; Mellers, Schwartz, & Ritov, 1999; Peters & Slovic, 2000;
Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003; Schwarz &
Clore, 1983; Shiv, Loewenstein, Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio,
2005). Further, damage to neural structures that subserve
emotion can impair an individual’s decision-making capabilities (e.g., Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1997; Bechara,
Damasio, Damasio, & Lee, 1999). Although this research has
provided valuable insights into the role emotion plays in the
decision process, one question that has not been clearly answered is whether damage to the brain’s emotional circuitry
differentially impairs decision making as a function of whether
the risk is presented in terms of potential gains or potential
losses. In the lesion study reported here, we used a novel riskydecision task that separates these two decision domains in order
to test whether damage to neural structures subserving emotion
would differentially affect the ability to make adaptive decisions
in these two domains. The speciﬁc brain regions we examined
were the amygdala, an area responsible for processing emotional
responses to environmental stimuli, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), an area responsible for integrating cognitive and emotional information.

AFFECT AND DECISION MAKING: A NEURAL
PERSPECTIVE

According to affect-as-information theories of decision making
(e.g., Loewenstein et al., 2001; Schwarz & Clore, 1983), affect
that is experienced as reactions to an impending judgment may
guide decisions via a ‘‘how do I feel about it?’’ strategy. Research
suggests that in risky decision making, an ‘‘affect heuristic’’
(Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000; Slovic, Finucane, Peters, & MacGregor, 2002) directs judgments of risks
and beneﬁts. For example, Alhakami and Slovic (1994) found
that when making judgments involving perceived beneﬁts
and risks of an activity or a technology, people are inﬂuenced
not only by cognitive information, but also by the strength
of positive or negative affect associated with that activity or
technology.
Taking a neuroscience perspective, we propose a model that is
consistent with affect-as-information models of decision making under uncertainty. According to this model, risky decision
making is guided by two separate neurological processes, both
generating emotion. The ﬁrst process generates an automatic
judgment and is focused on immediate outcomes. This judgment
arises from the processing of a primary inducer, a stimulus in the
environment (i.e., risk) that evokes an emotional response.
Primary induction, the process of coupling stimulus features
with affective value, is believed to be mediated by the amygdala
(e.g., LeDoux, 2000; Malkova, Gaffan, & Murray, 1997).
Such amygdala-generated responses are rapid, automatic
emotional responses to stimuli; they are short-lived and habituate quickly (Bechara, 2005). Moreover, in a lesion study, Bechara et al. (1999) found that individuals with bilateral damage
to the amygdala performed poorly on the Iowa gambling task
(IGT). The authors proposed that amygdala patients’ poor performance resulted from the inability to generate physiological
responses to experienced rewarding and punishing consequences of their behavior (Bechara et al., 1999). In other words, the
inability to generate a primary response to experienced punishments precluded any opportunity to effectively utilize such
responses in a prospective manner.
A second process that guides risky decision making is
more deliberative and focuses more on emotional responses
associated with anticipated outcomes. In this conceptualization,
amygdala-generated responses trigger the VMPC, a structure
believed to mediate decision making by linking together
working memory and emotional systems (A.R. Damasio, 1994).
The VMPC subsequently prompts a more careful, deliberative
analysis of the decision, an analysis that is believed to trigger
secondary emotional responses generated from thoughts about
the risky decision. These emotional responses are believed to be
essential for advantageous prospective decision making. Individuals with VMPC damage (but with an intact amygdala) are
unable to generate anticipatory emotional responses—which
may provide an early-detection system that warns of future pun-

Volume 18—Number 11

ishments—even though these patients generate emotional responses to experienced punishments and rewards (Bechara
et al., 1997).
This framework suggests that both the amygdala and the
VMPC are vital to risky decision making. We propose that for
adaptive decision making to occur when an individual approaches a risky decision, the amygdala must ﬁrst process an
instinctive, automatic response to the risk or uncertainty. This
response then engages the VMPC, which conducts a more
deliberative evaluation of the risk and evokes a secondary
emotional response that helps guide decision making. If the
amygdala does not evoke a primary response, the VMPC will not
engage as it does in normal individuals. In other words, an
amygdala response is a necessary ﬁrst step for engaging the
VMPC. However, even if the amygdala responds to risk, decision making is ultimately dependent on the integrity of the
VMPC.
Accordingly, this model suggests that if the integrity of these
structures is compromised, decision-making deﬁcits will occur.
Indeed, previous research using lesion patients supports this
theory (Bechara et al., 1997, 1999). However, because previous
investigations have employed tasks like the IGT, which involve
‘‘mixed’’ gambles (i.e., risky decisions that involve elements of
both potential gains and potential losses), it is difﬁcult to tease
out whether these structures are vital to adaptive decision
making both when people make choices to achieve gains and
when people are faced with choices involving potential losses.
Although a mixed-gambles task can provide valuable insights
about decision-making behavior, there is strong reason to believe that individuals approach gain- and loss-related decisions
differently. For instance, behavioral research suggests that the
psychological impact of potential losses is stronger than
the psychological impact of potential gains (e.g., Baumeister,
Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001), perhaps because
realized losses may carry harsher implications for survival.
Moreover, prospect theory’s value function, which is concave for
potential gains and convex (and steeper) for potential losses,
predicts that when a decision is framed in terms of losses, individuals will seek risk, but when a decision is framed in terms
of gains, individuals will be risk averse (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979). Thus, preference for risk differs between these two decision domains (Levin, Schneider, & Gaeth, 1998).
In the current study, we used a new methodology that allowed
us to analyze adaptive decision making separately for decisions
involving potential gains and decisions involving potential
losses. Speciﬁcally, we assessed subjects’ capacity to adjust
choices on the basis of differences in the choice options’ expected value (EV), comparing performance of two groups of
lesion patients with performance of a healthy comparison group.
Thus, we tested directly whether damage to the amygdala or the
VMPC is sufﬁcient to disrupt decision making, regardless of
whether the decision is presented in terms of potential gains or
potential losses.

METHOD

Subjects
Patients
Subjects with brain lesions were selected from the patient registry
of the University of Iowa’s Division of Cognitive Neuroscience.
Basic neuropsychological and neuroanatomical characteristics of
these patients were evaluated according to the standard protocols
of the Benton Neuropsychology Laboratory (Tranel, 1996) and
the Laboratory of Neuroimaging and Human Neuroanatomy
(H. Damasio, 1995; H. Damasio & Frank, 1992). Clinical interviews indicated that none of the subjects had a history of mental
retardation, psychiatric disorder, substance abuse, learning disability, or systemic disease that would affect the central nervous
system. All data were collected when the subjects were in the
chronic phase of recovery (i.e., at least 3 months after lesion onset).
The amygdala patients (n 5 16; 6 males, 10 females) had
either unilateral (6 left, 7 right) or bilateral (n 5 3) damage in an
anterior temporal region including the amygdala. The degree of
damage in adjacent and surrounding hippocampal and temporal
cortices varied. For the VMPC group (n 5 7; 5 males, 2 females),
the damage included the ventral and low mesial sectors of the
frontal lobe in both the right and left hemispheres (i.e., bilateral
damage). In all subjects, the dorsolateral sectors of the prefrontal cortex were intact.
Nonpatient Comparison Subjects
Thirty individuals were recruited as nonpatient comparison
subjects (11 males, 19 females). These subjects were recruited
through advertisements in local newspapers and were compensated for their time. They were screened for history of neurological or psychiatric disease.
Procedure
To assess individuals’ decision propensities under risk, we used
a modiﬁed, computerized version of Levin and Hart’s (2003;
Levin, Weller, Pederson, & Harshman, 2007) cups task. This
task was originally designed to provide a simple way of showing
subjects the probability of an outcome (by depicting a particular
number of cups from which to choose) in a risky choice. In our
modiﬁcation, we added a within-subjects manipulation of the
relative EV of the risky and riskless options; with this manipulation, we were able to assess decision makers’ sensitivity and
adaptability to contingencies that make a risky choice advantageous or disadvantageous.
In the current version of the cups task, subjects made choices
with real monetary outcomes. The independent variables were
domain (gain or loss), probability of a nonzero outcome if the
risky option was selected (.20, .33, or .50), and outcome magnitude for the risky option (two, three, or ﬁve quarters vs. one
quarter for the riskless option). Subjects received three trials of
each combination of probability level and outcome level, for a

960

total of 54 trials. Some combinations of probability and magnitude created equal EV for the risky and riskless options: This
was the case for .20 chance of ﬁve quarters, .33 chance of three
quarters, and .50 chance of two quarters, on both gain and loss
trials. Other combinations were risk advantageous (i.e., the EV
was more favorable for the risky than for the riskless option):
This was the case for .33 chance of ﬁve quarters, .50 chance of
three quarters, and .50 chance of ﬁve quarters on gain trials, and
for .20 chance of two quarters, .20 chance of three quarters, and
.33 chance of two quarters on loss trials. Finally, still other
combinations were risk disadvantageous (i.e., the EV was more
favorable for the riskless than for the risky option): This was the
case for .20 chance of two quarters, .20 chance of three quarters,
and .33 chance of two quarters on gain trials, and for .33 chance
of ﬁve quarters, .50 chance of three quarters, and .50 chance of
ﬁve quarters on loss trials. Gain and loss trials were presented as
separate blocks, with order counterbalanced across subjects in
each group. Within a block, combinations of probability and
outcome were presented in random order.
Gain trials involved the choice between an option that offered a
sure gain of one quarter and an option that offered a designated
probability of winning multiple quarters. Loss trials involved the
choice between a sure loss of one quarter and a designated
probability of losing multiple quarters. On each trial, an array of
two, three, or ﬁve cups was shown on each side of the screen. One
array was identiﬁed as the certain side: If any cup on this side was
selected, one quarter was gained or lost, depending on the domain
for that trial. The other array was identiﬁed as the risky side:
Selection of one cup on this side led to a designated number of
quarters being gained or lost, and selection of the other cups led
to no gain or loss. At the bottom of the screen was a depiction of a
bank; coins were added to or subtracted from this bank according
to a trial’s outcome. At the start of each loss trial, the bank contained the maximum number of quarters that could be lost on that
trial. The outcome on each trial depended on which side was
selected and, if it was the risky side, the choice of one cup. For a
risky choice, whether the cup selected led to a nonzero outcome
was determined by a random process with p equal to 1 divided by
the number of cups. When a subject completed all 54 trials, the
total amount he or she had won appeared on the screen. Subjects
were compensated with the amount that they had won on the task.

Dependent Variables
To assess decision making under risk, we calculated overall risk
taking in both the gain and the loss domains. We also measured
how subjects adapted to differences in EV between the riskless
and risky options, by calculating the proportion of risky choices
for trials at each of three EV levels: risk-advantageous trials (the
EV of the risky choice was more favorable than that of the
riskless choice), equal-EV trials (the EVs for the riskless and
risky options were equal), and risk-disadvantageous trials (the
EV was more favorable for the riskless option than for the risky

option). These proportions were computed separately for the
gain and loss domains.
RESULTS

Demographic Statistics
The ages of the amygdala patients (M 5 40.56, SD 5 14.89),
VMPC patients (M 5 45.86, SD 5 24.14), and comparison
group (M 5 39.37, SD 5 12.69) did not differ signiﬁcantly. The
comparison group had signiﬁcantly more years of education
(M 5 16.10, SD 5 2.42) than the amygdala patients (M 5 14.13,
SD 5 2.42) and the VMPC patients (M 5 11.43, SD 5 2.94),
F(2, 52) 5 11.20, p < .01, but this difference did not have a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on our results.1
Preference Shifts in Risky Decision Making Involving
Gains Versus Losses
To test for evidence of preference shifts in risky decision making
(i.e., greater risk taking in the loss domain than in the gain domain), we conducted three repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs), with overall risk taking in each domain (gain,
loss) as the dependent variable. Although the comparison group
demonstrated the predicted preference shift, F(1, 30) 5 9.07,
p < .01, Z2 5 .24, neither amygdala nor VMPC patients were
signiﬁcantly more risk seeking in the loss domain than in the gain
domain (Fs < 1.0). These ﬁndings suggest an altered response
pattern for lesion patients compared with healthy adults.
Adaptive Decision Making
Figure 1 plots the proportion of risky choices for each group as a
function of EV level, separately for gain and loss trials. Inspection of the ﬁgure reveals several group differences. Regardless of decision domain, VMPC patients not only made more
risky choices than the other groups, but also displayed insensitivity to differences in EV between choice options. In contrast,
the amygdala patients’ performance differed across domains.
Their responses to loss trials were indistinguishable from those
of the healthy comparison group in terms of both overall level of
risk taking and sensitivity to EV differences between choice
options. However, like VMPC patients, amygdala patients displayed elevated levels of risk-seeking behavior and impaired
adaptive decision making in the gain domain.
We conducted a 3 (EV level)  2 (domain)  3 (group:
amygdala,2 VMPC, healthy) ANOVA to compare the groups’ risk

For all subsequent analyses, we conducted multiple regression analyses that
tested whether education was a signiﬁcant predictor of the dependent measures.
The results of these analyses did not differ from those presented, and therefore
are not discussed further.

Because there were differences in the location of the amygdala lesion (i.e.,
bilateral, left, and right), it was possible that this variation affected the results.
To test this possibility, we conducted one-way ANOVAs comparing the amygdala lesion subgroups (i.e., bilateral, left, and right) for all dependent variables
reported in this study. There were no signiﬁcant differences among these
subgroups for any variable of interest. Thus, we collapsed the data for all
amygdala subgroups into a unitary amygdala group.

taking as a function of EV differences between choice options in
each domain. As expected, we found a main effect for group, F(2,
52) 5 4.96, p 5 .01, Z2 5 .17, in that lesion patients, regardless
of lesion type, showed more overall risk taking than healthy
adults. As Figure 1 suggests, group differences in risk taking
were especially apparent on the risk-disadvantageous trials. To
test the simple effects, we conducted parallel t tests comparing
each lesion group with the comparison group on these trials, in
both domains. We found that compared with healthy adults, both
VMPC and amygdala patients displayed elevated risk taking
on risk-disadvantageous gain trials, t(35) 5 4.53, p < .01, d 5
1.73, and t(44) 5 4.39, p < .01, d 5 1.32, respectively. In
the loss domain, VMPC patients were more risk taking on

risk-disadvantageous trials than were both the healthy subjects,
t(35) 5 2.97, p < .01, d 5 1.42, and amygdala patients, t(21) 5
2.19, p < .05, d 5 1.06. However, amygdala patients did not
differ signiﬁcantly from the comparison group on these trials,
t(44) 5 1.12, n.s., d 5 0.35.
Because our focus was on comparing risk-advantageous with
risk-disadvantageous trials, we used a linear contrast between
these two levels as a more powerful test of the effects of EV level.
As expected, we found a main effect: The proportion of risky
choices was greater on the former trials (i.e., when the EV was
more favorable for the risky option than for the riskless option),
F(1, 52) 5 45.10, p < .01, Z2 5 .37. We also found an EV Level 
Group interaction, F(2, 52) 5 12.70, p < .01, Z2 5 .21; the level of
risk taking among lesion patients, compared with healthy subjects,
was particularly elevated when the EV for the risky choice was less
favorable than the EV for the riskless option. Furthermore, we
found a three-way Domain  EV Level  Group interaction, F(2,
52) 5 3.25, p < .01, Z2 5 .11; the VMPC group was insensitive to
EV level in both domains, but the amygdala group demonstrated a
comparable insensitivity only in the gain domain.
DISCUSSION

Our results strongly reinforce previous research and theory indicating that decision making is not mediated solely by cold
cognitive processes (e.g., A.R. Damasio, 1994), and that arriving
at an advantageous decision also requires affective information.
VMPC-generated emotions appear to play a vital role in individuals’ ability to make adaptive decisions in the face of risk,
regardless of whether the goal of the decision is to achieve a gain
or avoid a loss. VMPC patients displayed elevated risk-seeking
behavior regardless of both EV considerations and domain. This
deﬁcit was especially visible in VMPC patients’ propensity to
take risks even when the odds of success were small. These
ﬁndings add to a growing literature that implicates the VMPC in
decision making under uncertainty (Bechara et al., 1997; Bechara et al., 1999). Notably, however, Leland and Grafman
(2005) found that patients with VMPC lesions did not differ from
healthy subjects on a variety of hypothetical scenario-based
decision tasks in which the consequences of choices were not
realized. In contrast, our task involved immediately realized
consequences for choices. We believe that our results differ from
those of Leland and Grafman (2005) because of increased
emotional responses resulting from the temporal proximity between choice and outcome (e.g., Loewenstein, 1987).
The most intriguing ﬁnding of our study, though, is the dissociation in risky decision making between VMPC and amygdala patients across decision domains. Whereas VMPC patients
exhibited a cross-domain deﬁcit, amygdala patients did not.
Instead, they showed elevated risk taking and insensitivity to
differences in EV between choice options in the gain domain,
but a pattern of decision making strikingly similar to that of
healthy individuals in the loss domain (i.e., taking more risks

962

when it was advantageous to do so and fewer risks when it was
disadvantageous to do so).
These results accentuate the importance of distinguishing
between gain- and loss-related decision making under uncertainty. We found that amygdala damage was associated with
suboptimal decision making in the gain domain for the cups
task, a result consistent with the ﬁndings of Bechara et al.
(1999), who reported that amygdala damage is associated with
impairment on the IGT. However, the absence of decision deﬁcits in the loss domain represents a unique dissociation. One
plausible reason for the apparent inconsistency between this
previous study and our results for the loss domain lies in the
decision tasks utilized in these two studies. Although the IGT
can detect decision-making deﬁcits within clinical populations,
it is a complex task that blends many distinct components, including a mixture of rewards and punishments, and risk and
ambiguity. Moreover, Bechara et al. found that amygdala patients demonstrated low reactivity to punishments and rewards.
Yet the physiological responses they reported for punishments
were not pure punishment responses. That is, they were responses to a reward followed by a punishment (e.g., ‘‘you won x
amount, but you lost y amount’’). For these reasons, it is difﬁcult
to interpret studies using the IGT in terms of decision deﬁcits
within speciﬁc domains. In contrast, the cups task was designed
to separate decision domains, and this allowed us to delineate
clearly whether damage to particular brain areas differentially
inﬂuenced risk taking.
Additionally, our ﬁndings provide partial support for recent
functional imaging studies that have found amygdala involvement in decision making (DeMartino, Kumaran, Seymour, &
Dolan, 2006; Coricelli et al., 2005). It is of particular interest that
DeMartino et al. found that bilateral amygdala activation was
associated with risk-avoidant choice behavior in the gain domain,
but with risk-seeking behavior in the loss domain. Extrapolating
from DeMartino et al., one might predict that amygdala damage
would result in risk-seeking behavior for gains and risk-averse
choices for losses. Although our ﬁndings are consistent with this
prediction for the gain domain, they are not consistent with this
prediction for the loss domain.
One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that our study
included patients with unilateral amygdala damage. However,
this explanation seems unlikely to be correct because the patients
with bilateral amygdala lesions did not differ signiﬁcantly from
the comparison group in their risk-seeking behavior in the loss
domain, even on the most risk-disadvantageous trials. Nonetheless, future research should investigate and reconcile differences
in results obtained by lesion and functional imaging studies
whenever these results are conﬂicting, as in the case of our study
and that of DeMartino et al. (2006).
To account for our data, we propose expanding the amygdalaVMPC neural model of decision making to accommodate the
possibility of redundant neural systems that may process emotional information when a potential loss is at stake (see Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Illustration of the expanded neural model of decision making
under uncertainty. Processing of primary inducers, mediated by the
amygdala, triggers the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC) system,
which, in turn, conducts a more deliberative analysis of uncertainty.
However, decisions involving potential losses may trigger redundant
neural responding from structures such as the insula (anterior, posterior,
or both) and the adjacent primary and secondary somatosensory cortices
(SI and SII), which are independent of the amygdala; these backup
processes are represented here by dotted lines. Thus, the VMPC system
can still be engaged when the amygdala is damaged.

Although the amygdala may indeed be important for processing
initial responses that are vital in decision making concerning
potential losses (DeMartino et al., 2006; Coricelli et al., 2005),
other structures, such as the anterior insula, may produce
similar responses (Paulus & Stein, 2006) and thus render
adaptive decision making involving potential losses more
difﬁcult to disrupt than adaptive decision making involving
potential gains. Such redundancy may provide backup mechanisms in the event that one area, such as the amygdala, becomes
damaged or dysfunctional. Future research is needed to test this
proposition.
In sum, these results reveal that decision making under risk
may depend on partially separate neural systems for dealing
with potential losses and potential gains. These ﬁndings are
important from the perspectives of both economics and neuroscience. In economics, researchers have long suggested that
losses loom larger than gains (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
Humans may have adapted to survival pressures by utilizing
multiple neural systems to make decisions involving the loss of
property, food, and other valuables. Therefore, exploring the
neural correlates of risky decisions, as they relate to the domains
of gains versus losses, will enrich scientiﬁc knowledge of the
neural foundations of economic and social decisions. On the
neuroscience front, elucidating the neural processes underlying
different types of decisions will advance understanding of the
neural ‘‘road map’’ for the physiological processes intervening
between knowledge and behavior, and of the potential interruptions that lead to a disconnect between what one knows and
what one does.
