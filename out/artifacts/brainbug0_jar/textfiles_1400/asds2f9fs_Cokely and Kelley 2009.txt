Abstract
Individual differences in cognitive abilities and skills can predict normatively superior and logically consistent judgments and decisions. The current experiment investigates the processes that mediate individual differences in risky
choices. We assessed working memory span, numeracy, and cognitive impulsivity and conducted a protocol analysis to
trace variations in conscious deliberative processes. People higher in cognitive abilities made more choices consistent
with expected values; however, expected-value choices rarely resulted from expected-value calculations. Instead, the
cognitive ability and choice relationship was mediated by the number of simple considerations made during decision
making — e.g., transforming probabilities and considering the relative size of gains. Results imply that, even in simple
lotteries, superior risky decisions associated with cognitive abilities and controlled cognition can reflect metacognitive
dynamics and elaborative heuristic search processes, rather than normative calculations. Modes of cognitive control
(e.g., dual process dynamics) and implications for process models of risky decision-making (e.g., priority heuristic) are
discussed.

Introduction

2008). A variety of theories, such as dual-process theories, attribute the individual differences to deliberative
processes (Baron, 1985; De Neys, 2006; Evans, 2008;
Frederick, 2005; Kahneman, 2003; Kahneman & Frederick, 2007; Sloman, 1996; Stanovich & West, 1998;
2000); however, the link between decision processes and
abilities is largely uninvestigated. What are the cognitive
processes that give rise to the relationship between cognitive abilities and superior decision making under risk?
Previous research has examined individual differences
in decision making under risk in lotteries with known
probabilities. For low stakes lotteries normative expected utility processes are assumed to be approximated
with calculations that multiply probabilities by potential
gains/losses, i.e., expected-value calculations (Frederick,
2005; Payne, Samper, Bettman, & Luce, 2008). Frederick has demonstrated that expected-value choices are
associated with scores on the cognitive reflection test,
which is designed to measure one’s reliance on more consciously controlled processes rather than automatic first
impressions (e.g., Stanovich and West’s, 2000, deliberative System 2 rather than intuitive System 1). The threeproblem cognitive reflection test, which is known to correlate with other general cognitive ability measures, consists of mathematical problems for which an immediate
intuitive response is incorrect. Frederick demonstrated

Human decision-making is constrained by its bounded rationality and does not always follow normative prescriptions (Gigerenzer, Todd, & the ABC Research Group,
1999; Kahneman, 2003; Payne, Bettman, & Johnson,
1993; Simon 1990). Nevertheless, individual differences
in cognitive abilities and skills predict normatively superior judgment and decision-making (Frederick, 2005; Peters & Levin, 2008; Peters, Vastfjall, Slovic, Mertz, Mazzocco, & Dickert, 2006; Stanovich & West, 1998; 2000;

that higher scoring individuals did not exhibit the clear
non-normative risk asymmetry for gains and losses predicted by prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
When given a choice between a gain of $100 versus a
75% chance of a $200 gain, prospect theory predicted risk
aversion and the selection of the certain $100.1 However,
people with higher cognitive reflection scores more often selected options with the higher expected values (i.e.,
the probability multiplied by the potential risky gain —
$150) as compared to lower scoring individuals.
There are several candidate mechanisms that may account for the link between cognitive abilities and superior decision making under risk. For example, one can
make expected-value choices by performing expectedvalue calculations. Frederick (2005) suggests that computation of expected values may play a role, although
he notes that it is not likely the only factor. More generally, Stanovich and West (2000) suggest that individual differences in normative judgments and decisions often arise from working memory capacity limitations on
computation, implying that high ability individuals may
make expected-value choices via expected-value calculations.2 Other research indicates that individual differences in risky decision making may also arise from variations in one’s general knowledge and understanding of
probabilities — i.e., one’s numeracy (Peters & Levin,
2008; Peters et al., 2006). People high in numeracy, particularly the ability to comprehend and transform probabilities, are less affected by attribute framing because
they can readily transform items such as 74% correct into
26% incorrect and translate percentages to frequencies
and vice versa. Thus, numeracy may allow better risky
choices as a result of a more accurate subjective sense of
the size of gains and losses or other probability related
trade-offs.

1.1

Process models of risky choice

Theories describing the actual cognitive processes commonly used for decision making under risk tend to be
imprecise (Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006;
2008; Johnson, et al. 2008; Payne et al., 1993; Payne &
Braunstein, 1978; Selart et al., 2006). Risky choice models are typically as-if models, as in the case of prospect
theory, which does not describe the exact cognitive operations of choice but holds only that people act as-if they
evaluate losses with a steeper utility curve (Johnson et
al., 2008). One exception to as-if modeling is the priority
heuristic which is a parameter free choice-outcome and
cognitive process model (Brandstätter et al., 2006). Ac1 The

exact predictions of prospect theory depend on the model parameters used.
2 Stanovich and West (1998) have also shown that metacognitive factors account for unique variance in judgment and decision performance.

Cognitive abilities and superior risky choice

21

cording to the priority heuristic, decisions between sure
versus risky options are the result of considering simple
reasons for a decision in a fixed order, until a stopping
rule is met. First, people consider minimum gains. If
the minimum gains differ by 1/10 or more of the maximum gain (1/10 of the maximum gain rounded to the
closest prominent number) consideration stops and people choose the option with the higher minimum gain. If
necessary, they consider a second reason, the probability of the minimum gain. If the probabilities of the two
options differ by 1/10 or more of the probability scale,
consideration stops and people choose the option with the
higher probability minimum gain. If necessary, they will
consider a third reason and choose the option with the
higher maximum gain. A similar set of reasons and stopping rules occur for choices between losses.
The priority heuristic has accurately described majority choice-outcomes in several theoretically important
datasets (but for critical reviews see Birnbaum, 2008;
Hilbig, 2008; Johnson et al., 2008). Some evidence also
supports the priority heuristic process model as latencies to choose between two options have been greater for
choices that require three considerations compared to one
consideration (Brandstätter et al., 2006). However, the
priority heuristic is silent on the potential cognitive processes that may mediate the relationship between cognitive abilities and superior decision-making. Given that
the priority heuristic is designed to predict potentially
non-normative majority choices we hypothesized that it
may predict many participants’ choices and choice processes, although it would be unlikely to predict behavior
of high ability individuals.

1.2 Heuristic search
Heuristics and simple considerations are common and often effective bases for judgment and choice (Gigerenzer
et al., 1999; Payne, Bettman, Coupey, & Johnson, 1992;
Payne et al., 1993; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). We hypothesized that the relationship between cognitive abilities and decision-making under risk would not necessarily arise from expected-value calculations, but could result from simple considerations of reasons as in the priority heuristic, and simple transformations of probability
information as in the research by Peters et al. (2006; Peters & Levin, 2008). Theory suggests that variation in
superior decision making does not necessarily need to
rely on the exact use of calculations based on normative models but can result from greater reflectiveness or
thoroughness in decision making (Baron, 1985; 1990).
Variation in risky choice performance has been linked to
differences in duration and type of information search
(Mann & Ball, 1994; Payne & Braunstein, 1978; Selart et al., 2006). Working memory measures are also

Kelley, & Gilchrist, 2006; Guida, Tardieu, & Nicolas,
2008; McNamara & Scott, 2001) and differences in the
number of hypotheses generated during probability judgment (Dougherty & Hunter, 2003; Thomas, Dougherty,
Sprenger, & Harbison, 2008). Therefore, we hypothesized that elaborative heuristic search — i.e., more thorough exploration and representation of the problem space
— would often be positively related to superior risky decision making. To test the elaborative heuristic search hypothesis and to more precisely trace cognitive processes,
we conducted a protocol analysis.

Experiment

Our experiment was designed to examine individual differences in decision processes. Process tracing was performed with retrospective verbal reports (Ericsson & Simon, 1980) in which participants verbally reported the
exact thoughts they remembered in the order in which
they occurred, immediately following their choices.
When people consciously and deliberately consider information, such as comparing minimum gains or transforming information into different probabilities, these
processes should be observable in participants’ protocols
(Evans, 2008; Sloman, 1996). Verbal reports have previously been effectively used in related studies of choice
(Rettinger & Hastie, 2003; Payne 1976; but for poten-

tial limitations see De Neys & Glumicic, 2008; Reisen,
Hoffrage, & Mast, 2008). To illustrate this methodology, both an expected-value calculation and the priority
heuristic process predict that participants should consider
distinct types of information when making their choices.
Verbalization of an expected value or an attempt to estimate one (e.g., “75% of $200 is definitely more than
$100”) would provide evidence of expected-value type
processes. Similarly, the priority heuristic makes predictions about what information will and won’t be considered for different lotteries, and in what order (Brandstätter et al., 2006) (Table 1). These predictions allowed
us to develop a coding system to quantify the types and
amounts of considerations that were consistent and inconsistent with processing products predicted by the priority heuristic and expected-value calculations. Protocol
analysis codes were also derived from previous research
(Rettinger & Hastie, 2001; 2003) and a pilot study (Table
2).
We hypothesized that protocol analysis would reveal a positive relationship between expected-value type
choices and elaborative heuristic search (Baron, 1985;
Payne, 1976; Selart et al., 2006; Simon, 1990), operationalized as the total number of different types of simple considerations verbalized (excluding expected-value
calculations and ambiguous codes), regardless of output
order (Table 2).3 We also hypothesized that elaborative

heuristic search would at least partially mediate the relationship between cognitive abilities and superior decisions.4 More elaborative and thorough search processes
were expected to include variations in the number of considerations (e.g., consider maximum gains and probabilities versus considering only maximum gains) as well as
explorations of different aspects of problems (e.g., interpret the large difference between potential gains as a potential loss). Such variations could help some participants
avoid overlooking valuable information or oppose the influence of framing effects (Peters et al, 2006).

Participants

Eighty undergraduate students from introductory psychology courses at Florida State University participated
in partial fulfillment of course requirements and were
tested individually. Four cognitive reflection scores were
excluded as participants had seen the test in another experiment. Four working memory scores and two verbal
the ordering of cognitive events (Ericsson & Simon, 1980). Therefore,
we used a conservative data analysis approach focusing only on the type
and number of considerations verbalized, but not the order of output.
The verbalized content of interest is likely to be at least moderately reliable as verbal protocols immediately followed decision making (which
lasted only a few seconds) and the number of verbalized considerations
was found to correlate with participants’ overall decision latencies (see
results).
4 In a pilot study, as part of the first author’s doctoral dissertation,
we found that the majority of participants did not have sufficient math
skills to calculate expected values when explicitly instructed to do so.
Nonetheless, many of these participants still made many choices consistent with expected-value predictions.

reports were lost because of equipment failure. Seven
participants did not receive numeracy scores due to a procedural error.

2.2 Materials
Ability measures included: (1) the operation span —
a working memory capacity task that partially mediates
relationships predicted by traditional intelligence instruments (Turner & Engle, 1989); (2) the cognitive reflection test (CRT) which assesses differences in cognitive
impulsivity (System 1) versus more deliberative thinking
(System 2) (Frederick, 2005); (3) a numeracy scale measuring understanding of numerical probabilities (Lipkus,
Samsa, & Rimer, 2001; see Peters and Levin, 2008 for
the 11 item scale).

2.3 Decision making under risk
The stimuli included 40 choice problems with hypothetical gains/losses presented in US dollars. Each choice
consisted of one certain option and one risky option,
balanced such that expected value and priority heuristic
models made unique predictions on exactly half of the
trials. Expected-value ratios of lotteries were on average
near the indifference point (M = 2.07, range = .15 to 5.3,
relative to the certain option) a range in which the priority
heuristic is expected to predict choices (for discussion see
Brandstätter et al., 2006; 2008). Expected-value calculations predicted equal numbers of risky choices for gains

<-----Page 4----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 4, No. 1, February 2009

and losses; priority-heuristic predictions were asymmetric favoring risky choices for losses, but not gains. Priority heuristic also predicted that 60% of choices would
involve less search (i.e., a single consideration of the minimum possible gains/losses relative to 10% of the maximum gain/losses) while the other 40% of choices required the maximum number of considerations (i.e., all
possible steps of the priority heuristic). Risky option
probabilities ranged from 1%-80% (Appendix).

2.4

Procedure

Participants were tested individually. Responses were
recorded by a head-mounted microphone. Verbal report
instructions and warm up think-aloud problems were provided by an experimenter seated behind the participant.
The experiment began with the cognitive reflection task
followed by an example lottery. Participants were told
that the experiment involved 40 such choices, all of which
were presented in the same randomized order. Choices
were presented from the top to the bottom of the screen
with the first option (e.g., “A. gain $50”) displayed for
two seconds before the second option appeared (e.g., “B.
50% to gain $400”). Choices remained on the screen until the participant made a selection and was prompted for
a retrospective report. Lastly, participants completed the
working memory span and numeracy measures, and were
debriefed.

Results

Following Brandstätter et al. (2006), a model competition
was conducted. This analysis assessed the frequency with
which each model predicted majority choices, across all
choices. Binomial analysis indicated that expected-value
calculations predicted majority choices significantly better than chance (M = .83, p = .001). A non-parametric
test of equal proportions indicated that expected value
also significantly outperformed the priority heuristic, χ2
= 12.17, p = .001, d = 1.3, which predicted at chance
levels (M = .45, p > .5). A variety of subsequent analyses of the priority heuristic converged to suggest that in
the current task environment the priority heuristic was an
inaccurate process and choice-outcome model (see also
Birnbaum, 2008; Hilbig, 2008; Johnson et al., 2008).5
5 Additional individual model-prediction-accuracy scores (i.e., analyses comparing the proportion of priority heuristic consistent choices
averaged across all choices for each individual) indicated that priority
heuristic was less accurate (M = .42, SD = .09) compared to chance,
t (79) = -7.40, p = .001, d = .9, or as compared to expected value, F
(1, 79) = 428.95, p < .001, η p 2 = .84. A univariate ANOVA indicated
a significant search difference (one reason, three reasons) in reaction
times, F (1, 3151) = 19.63, p = .001. However, this difference was in
the opposite direction of that predicted by the priority heuristic. Onereason choices tended to take longer (M = 13.3sec, SD = 9.82sec) than

Because abilities are known to influence choice, and
given evidence on the limits of majority choice aggregation analyses (Regenwetter, Grofman, Popova, Messner,
Davis-Stober, & Cavagnaro, 2008), we examined individual model-prediction-accuracy scores. Subsequent analyses compared the proportion of expected value consistent
choices averaged across all choices for each individual.
A one sample t test indicated that expected-value calculations strongly predicted participant choices (M = .72,
SD = .12) above chance levels, t (79) = 16.02, p = .001,
d = 1.9. The proportion of choices consistent with expected value was significantly related to CRT, r (74) =
.27, p = .02, and numeracy, r (71) = .28, p = .02 (Table
6). A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
risk type (certain, risky) by choice type (gain, loss) by
working memory span quartile (low, high) also indicated
that working memory was associated with differences in
choices, F (1, 36) = 7.70, p = .01, d = .8. High working memory span participants made significantly more
expected-value type choices (M = .79, SD = .13) as compared to low span participants (M = .70, SD = .10).

3.1 Protocol analysis
Verbal reports were analyzed by two raters blind to
model and judgment performance (Table 2). A randomlyselected subset of verbal reports (13%) were scored by
both raters and indicated high inter-rater agreement on the
number of considerations, r (8) = .97, p = .01, and substantial agreement on specific consideration codes (kappa
= .63). The total number of considerations verbalized was
also related to the mean choice reaction time, r (67) = .46,
p = .001,6 indicating that individuals who retrospectively
verbalized more considerations also took longer to make
their judgments. Unless otherwise noted, seven participants were excluded from subsequent analysis because
more than 50% of their verbal protocols were unrevealing (e.g., “A is better; I like B”).7
Three individuals verbalized expected-value calculations (or estimations) nearly exclusively (95–100% of all
three-reason choices (M = 11.79sec, SD = 9.16sec). Protocol analysis
also revealed that key comparisons (i.e., considering the difference in
minimum gains relative to the maximum gain) predicted on 100% of
all trials were reported on fewer than 1% of trials, whereas processes
that were never predicted were among the most frequent verbalizations
(e.g., recoding probabilities, considering probabilities low or high; see
Table 2). Priority heuristic choices were unrelated to all cognitive ability measures (p > .20).
6 Reaction time was related to number of verbalized considerations;
however, latencies showed only an unreliable trend in the expected direction with decision performance, F (1, 3151) = 3.11, p = .08. Nonexpected-value choice latencies (M = 12.53 sec, SD = 9.16 sec) were
similar to expected-value choice latencies (M = 13.20 sec., SD = 9.85
sec.).
7 Inclusion of these data in additional hierarchical regressions did not
significantly change results.

trials; see Table 3 for examples). The frequency of verbalized expected-value calculations was significantly related to expected-value type choices, r (69) = .25, p =
.03; however, expected-value calculations were unrelated
to cognitive ability variables (Table 6). The remaining
participants exhibited a clear relationship between the
number of considerations verbalized and expected-value
choices excluding any ambiguous or expected-value verbalizations, β = .60, t = 15.90, p = .001, R2 = .36 (Figure 1).8 Individuals who made the most expected-value
choices (top quartile) verbalized about twice as many
considerations per trial (M = 1.78, SD = .52) as did
those who made fewer (bottom quartile) expected-value
choices (M = .94, SD = .35). Across all participants,
the number of considerations verbalized was also significantly related to CRT, r (72) = .23, p = .05; numeracy,
r (69) = .36, p = .01; and working memory span, r (72)
= .25, p = .04 (see Tables 4 and 5 for examples of verbal protocols; see Tables 6 and 8 for intercorrelations
among variables).9 For example, across 40 trials, excluding expected-value or ambiguous verbalizations, individuals with higher working memory span scores (top
quartile) verbalized significantly more considerations (M
= 60.8, SD = 20.8) as compared to those with lower (bot8 Verbalizations of expected-value calculations are never included in

tom quartile) working memory scores (M = 47.1, SD =
14.5), F (1, 30) = 4.51, p = .04, d = .08.
We next constructed a series of hierarchical linear regression models (Table 7) with the most complex (full)
model using three predictors including (1) expected-value
verbalizations; (2) all three ability measures; and (3)
number of verbalized considerations. The full model was
a strong predictor of expected-value choices, F (5, 53) =
22.23, p = .001, R2 = .44. The number of verbalized considerations accounted for a moderate amount of unique
variance, F (1, 53) = 8.15, p = .001, R2 change = .24. The
number of verbalized considerations also fully mediated
the relationships between all three cognitive ability measures and expected-value choices (ts < 1, see Table 7).
To what extent might these results reflect the influence
of particular choices, such as choices on gains rather than
losses or choices involving high versus lower monetary
values? To assess independent relationships controlling
for these potentially influential factors we conducted a
multilevel analysis. First, we constructed independent regression equations for each participant, predicting each
participant’s responses across all 40 choice trails. Individual level regression equation coefficients (i.e., unstandardized β coefficients) were computed for each of the
following variables (1) expected-value model choice predictions; (2) priority heuristic model choice predictions;
(3) gain versus loss trails (to assess and control for potential asymmetries in responding); and (4) the highest absolute monetary value for each choice (to assess and control for potentially non-uniform influences of declining
marginal utility).10 Next, we examined the intercorrelations between the individual level regression coefficients,
all cognitive abilities, and the number of verbalized considerations (Table 8).11
As expected, results revealed reliable relationships between the expected-value choice coefficients and all cognitive ability measures including the cognitive reflection
test, r (66) = .29, p = .02; numeracy, r (62) = .29, p =
.02; and working memory span, r (66) = .27, p = .03.
The number of verbalized considerations was also significantly related to the expected-value choice factor, r
(69) = .45, p = .001. Lastly, a hierarchical linear regression was constructed, following the previous analyses but predicting the expected-value individual level coefficients with (1) expected-value verbalizations, (2) all
three ability measures, and (3) number of verbalized considerations. The full model was again a strong and significant predictor, F (5, 53) = 4.22, p = .003, R2 = .29.
10 Unreported analyses also investigated the influence of a fifth factor,
an interaction between (3) & (4), which was found to be trivial and unrelated to all other variables including abilities and elaborative heuristic
search.
11 Each individual level regression coefficient factor represents the estimated unique influence of that variable controlling for variance attributable to all other individual level coefficient variables.

5% times $4000 is $200 certain loss or is it $20. No $200 which is more than $40
certain loss.
10% chance of 900 is $90 which is $180. $180 or $275, $275 is more so yeah.
275 certain gain is more than 20% of 900 which is $180 gain.
uhh crap 5% chance- .05 times 1600 is pretty sure $30 or $300. uhh its $30 so
$120 is more than $300, no, whatever, so $300 is more.
My first thought, 3% of 5600 would be more than A
20% okay 50% of 900 is 450, 900 times .20 is $180. $275 certain loss is more
than $180 certain loss.
Yeah its b. $150 is not or 30% of 1080 is more than $100
10% of 3000 is 300. 200 certain loss is way more than 1% of $3000 and that’s
how I came about that.
uhh that’s easy 50% of- $200 is more than $50 certain loss.
My first thought, 5% of 4000 is more than B.

The number of verbalized considerations also accounted
for unique variance beyond other variables, F (1, 53) =
10.06, p = .003, R2 change = .14, and again fully mediated
the influence of all three cognitive abilities (ts < 1).

Discussion

A very small minority of our sample (about 5%) consistently verbalized expected-value processes during decision making (Payne & Braunstein, 1978). The vast majority of expected-value choices were instead associated
with simple heuristic-type decision processes. These decision processes were similar to the component considerations in the priority heuristic (see Table 2), although
the priority heuristic was otherwise an inaccurate process
and choice-outcome model. Consistent with the elaborative heuristic search hypothesis we found a relationship between the number of considerations verbalized
and expected-value choices. Elaborative heuristic search
also mediated the relationships between cognitive abilities and expected-value choices.12 These results demonstrate that neither deliberative thinking nor cognitive abilities are necessarily associated with normative calcula12 One reviewer suggested a potential concern that completing the
CRT before making choices might influence choice processes and outcomes (cf. Hsee & Rottenstreich, 2004). Although we suspect this is
unlikely the presence of this type of effect cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, such an effect would not undercut the theoretical implications linking abilities, performance, and elaborative heuristic search process.

tions, even when associated with normatively superior
decision performance.

4.1 Dual-process models and modes of cognitive control
The elaborative heuristic search captured by protocol
analysis in the current experiment may, in part, result
from differences in top-down, early selection cognitive
control mechanisms used during the task (Jacoby, Kelley, & McElree, 1999). The prevailing theoretical framework emphasizes a late correction cognitive control interpretation of dual process dynamics. That is, when
controlled processes (System 2) do not compute an answer they are assumed to primarily operate by monitoring
and correcting the output of automatic processes (Kahneman, 2003). In contrast, early selection cognitive control uses controlled processing (System 2) to generate
goals, strategies, and mental contexts that qualitatively
alter the output of automatic processes (System 1) before critical impressions are yielded (Jacoby, Shimizu,
Daniels, & Rhodes, 2005). For example, if some participants approached the task with the mindset of playing a game (e.g., “I feel lucky”) they would likely generate different search processes as compared to those construing choices in terms of their actual spending power
(e.g., “the probability is low but I don’t even have $7000
dollars”). Spending-power type considerations (i.e., considering values small or large) were found to be signifi-

cant predictors of expected-value choices [r (76) = .41, r
(76) = .36, respectively] and were also strongly related
to the overall number of considerations [r (76) = .62,
and r (76) = .68, respectively]. Moreover, related research indicates that other judgment and decision biases
— e.g., the endowment effect and non-rational discounting in intertemporal choice — can be accounted for by
one’s initial memory query and the resulting constraints
on memory search and accessibility (see query theory and
the preferences-as-memory framework; Johnson, Haubl,
& Keinan, 2007; Weber, Johnson, Milch, Chang, Brodscholl, & Goldstein, 2007).
A common assumption of dual process theories is that
controlled cognition (System 2) reflects more rule-based,
abstract and decontextualized reasoning whereas more
automatic and impulsive cognition (System 1) is driven
by associations, personal relevance, and situationalcontextual information (cf. fundamental computational
bias, Stanovich & West, 2000; but see also Evans,
2008).13 Interestingly, in the current experiment more deliberation was associated with more personalization and
13 Evans

notes that “the notion that System 2 is in some sense rulebased is compatible with the proposals of most dual process theorists”
(p. 261, Evans 2008). However, Evans’ modification for a general dual
system theory (i.e., a dual type theoretical framework) notes that even if
abstract reasoning requires the use of System 2 it would be a mistake to
assume that concrete contexts preclude its application, as is apparent in
the current protocol data.

contextualization during reasoning — as opposed to abstract rule based expected-value calculations — which
was evidenced by more elaborative heuristic search and
consideration of more concrete real world implications
of choices (for other links between context, abilities, and
performance see Delaney & Sahakyan, 2007; Morsanyi
& Handley, 2008). Given that elaborative heuristic search
accounted for unique variance beyond cognitive abilities,
beneficial elaborative search processes may not require
an exceptional cognitive capacity or skill. Instead, superior risky decision performance may partially reflect a
cognitive style that is typical of (but not necessarily limited to) individuals with higher working memory span.
Such a metacognitive style could generally bring more
world knowledge to bear on many problems and thus
may be less prone to compartmentalization and impulsive
choice (Baron, 1985; Stanovich and West, 2000). Additionally or alternatively, these cognitive style factors may
be driven by more crystallized knowledge or skill mechanisms. For example, more numerate individuals could
derive more affective meaning from the consideration of
probabilities and the comparison of options (Peters et al.,
2006, Experiment 4), which could motivate more elaborative search.
Broadly, our results are consistent with general notions
of reflectiveness suggesting that cognitive abilities are
associated with more careful, thorough, and elaborative

low), but you never know. That’s why I chose B because 5600 dollars is a lot of
money (value high).

small compared to 4000 (max difference) and you have a 5% chance which is

more than if you take 50.
— but not necessarily normative — cognition (Baron,
1985). Our results further suggest that early selection
cognitive control mechanisms may play a role in reflectiveness and superior task performance. Indeed, individuals who score higher on cognitive ability measures are
known to spend more time preparing for tasks (Sternberg,
1977) and also more elaborately and strategically encode
information, deliberatively building cognitive representations that better support subsequent task performance
(Baron, 1978; Cokely et al., 2006; Ericsson & Kintsch,
1995; Hertzog & Robinson, 2005; McNamara & Scott,
2001; Vigneau, Caissie, & Bors, 2005). However, we
caution against an interpretation that higher performing
individuals (or better decision processes) always search
or reflect more (for a discussion of “less is more” in decision making see Gigerenzer et al., 1999). Research unam-

biguously demonstrates that abilities and expertise are associated with adaptive cognition, such that superior performers will tend to rely on less elaborative search when
it is advantageous (Bröder, 2003; Ericsson, Prietula, &
Cokely, 2007; Fasolo, Misuraca, & McCelland, 2003,
Mata, Schooler, & Rieskamp, 2007; Shanteau, 1992).

4.2 Models of risky choice
Expected value was a reliable as-if choice outcome
model. Yet process data indicated that even in highly simplified lotteries expected value was only an as-if model,
which showed little relation to actual cognitive processes
(Payne & Braunstein, 1978). The priority heuristic also
proved to be an inaccurate process (and choice-outcome)
model. This limitation may reflect the large individual

differences in elaborative search elicited by the current
task environment. These data provide further evidence
on the limitations and boundary conditions of the priority
heuristic (Birnbaum, 2008; Hilbig, 2008; Johnson et al.,
2008). It should be noted that this limitation is apparent
only because the priority heuristic makes very exact predictions at both the cognitive process and choice-outcome
levels, which is a useful and unique feature among risky
choice models. Results indicate that more precise process modeling of risky choices with the priority heuristic or another computational model would require at least
one parameter that creates variation in search and stopping rules. However, accurate modeling of psychologically plausible mechanisms for the regulation of heuristic
search will require greater specification and research at
the intersection of task environments and cognitive capacities (Bröder, 2003; Gaissmaier & Schooler, 2008;
Gaissmaier, Schooler, & Rieskamp, 2006; Gaissmaier,

Schooler, & Mata, 2008; Schooler & Hertwig, 2005).

5 Conclusions
People higher in working memory span, cognitive reflectiveness, and those with greater skill in comprehending
and transforming probabilities often made choices consistent with expected value; however, protocol analyses revealed that they did not commonly use expectedvalue calculations to arrive at those choices (Payne &
Braunstein, 1978; Payne et al., 1993). Instead, cognitive
abilities were related to relatively simple yet elaborative
heuristic search processes. The results accord with examples showing that good decisions can be made with simple processes (Gigerenzer & Goldstein, 1996; Gigerenzer
et al., 1999), although results also provide additional evidence that even heuristic search processes can require

conscious, deliberative efforts (Simon, 1990). The current results serve as a reminder that individual differences
cannot be ignored by judgment and decision researchers
as majority choice does not necessarily reflect a single decision process that can be accurately assessed or modeled
at the level of group means (Cokely & Feltz, 2009; Feltz
& Cokely, 2008; Regenwetter et al, 2008).
Theoretically, our results indicate that the relationship
between cognitive abilities and superior risky choices
can reflect differences in relatively simple yet elaborative
heuristic-type processes. Nevertheless, the cognitive and
metacognitive dynamics that regulate search and stopping
are not well understood. The current data provide some
indication that these dynamics are likely to be complex
and multiply determined, potentially reflecting the influence of early selection cognitive control processes. Further research is needed to identify the variety of mechanisms that give rise to individual differences in decision
performance. Critically, a higher fidelity understanding
of these mechanisms will require theoretical models to
address the interplay of (1) individual differences (e.g.,
abilities, traits, motivation, expertise), (2) cognitive processes, and (3) the environmental factors that shape strategy selection and efficacy (Alter, Oppenheimer, Epley,
& Eyre, 2007; Botella, Pena, Contreras, Shih, & Santacreu, 2009; Galesic, Garcia-Retamero, & Gigerenzer,
2008; Karlsson, Juslin, & Olsson, 2008; Payne et al,
1993; Reiskamp & Otto, 2006; Rieskamp & Hoffrage,
2008; Simon, 1990).
