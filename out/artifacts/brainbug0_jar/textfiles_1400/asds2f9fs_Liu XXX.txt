Abstract. Exponential, simple inhibited, logistic, and second-order growth
models are often used for describing real world processes. The equations of
these four models are varied and do not demonstrate the relationship between
them. This paper presents symmetric autonomous differential equations and
similarly symmetric implicit solutions to these models, demonstrating their relationship to one another and revealing a deeper significance to the logistic and
second-order growth models. Additionally, this paper explores the relationship
between the logistic equation and the hyperbolic tangent and cotangent functions, and how to convert to and from both forms of the logistic equation
easily.

1. Introduction
This paper presents the study of four types of differential equations that are frequently used for modeling real world growth processes. These are:
(1)
(2)
(3)
(4)

Exponential growth and decay
Simple inhibited growth
Logistic growth
Second order chemical reaction

The last model name, second order chemical reaction, is not as common as the
other three names. The paper adopts it because the model is mostly used in the
description of such chemical reaction processes.
The paper shows that the four model equations can be all written in implicit,
highly symmetric forms. It is the first time such efforts are made to derive a unified
expression for these model equations despite their apparent differences in conventional formulas. The implicit solution forms can also facilitate the development of
certain model parameter expressions. Derivations of the implicit forms are based
on the simple method of variable substitution. The paper also uses function curve
translation to prove that the logistic solution is just another form of the hyperbolic
tangent and cotangent functions.
The contents of the paper are organized as the following. The first section describes the four models and their main applications, introduces the model equations
and their explicit solutions. The second section derives the implicit model equations and explains the significance and benefits of such equation forms. The third
section describes the relationship between the logistic solution and the hyperbolic
tangent and cotangent functions. The derived model equations are summarized in
the tables at the end of the paper.

2. Growth Modeling Equations
2.1. Exponential Growth and Decay. Exponential growth and decay can be
represented by one of the basic forms of separable differential equations:
dP
= rP
dt
Equation 2.1 states that quantity P varies at a rate directly proportional to the
value of P . In the equation r is the rate constant. When r > 0, the equation
represents exponential growth; when r < 0, it represents exponential decay. Equation 2.1 can be easily solved by separation of variables. Assuming that the initial
condition P0 occurs at t = 0, then the solution is:

(2.1)

(2.2)

P = P0 ert

Exponential growth and decay are most commonly used to model the change of
a population, as the rate of population growth or decay is usually proportional to
the population itself. For example, as a bacteria population increases, there are
more individuals capable of reproduction so the rate of increase also increases. The
decay of a radioactive substance also follows this law. As the amount of substance
decreases, the rate of decay also decreases. Exponential growth and decay can
also be used to model an investment with interest compounded continuously, the
processes of a solution being diluted by fresh water, a capacitor being discharged,
and many other cases.
2.2. Simple Inhibited Growth. Simple inhibited growth assumes that a natural
maximum exists such that the growth of a quantity cannot occur beyond it. The
equation of simple inhibited growth states that quantity P varies at a rate directly
proportional to the difference between this maximum amount, K, and P itself:
dP
= r (K − P )
dt
From equation 2.3 it can be seen that the rate of growth of P is limited by constant
K, which is assumed to be positive in this paper. If P starts less than K, the
growth of P is positive (assuming r > 0) until P is equal to K, at which point
the growth of P diminishes to 0. If P is greater than K, then the growth of P
is negative, which means P will decrease until it reaches K. Therefore K is often
called the carrying capacity or equilibrium value of the model. Equation 2.3
can also be solved by separation of variables. With the same initial condition as
above, the solution is:
(2.3)

(2.4)

P = K − (K − P0 ) e−rt

Simple inhibited growth can model the sales of a newly advertised product, in
which case there exists a maximum limit of the product sales. It can also model
the processes of an object cooling down to a certain temperature or being dropped
from a certain height with air resistance. Other cases include the processes of
a solution being diluted by another of different concentration, a capacitor being
charged, and certain learning patterns.

2.3. Logistic Growth. The previous two models either assume that quantity P
varies at a rate directly proportional to itself (P ), or to its remaining room for
growth (K − P ). Logistic growth assumes that the growth rate of P is directly
proportional to both of these quantities:

(2.5)

dP
= r0 P (K − P )
dt

Here r0 is used because the logistic equation is more commonly written in this form:

(2.6)

dP
= rP
dt


1−

P
K



where r = r0 K. In the above equation, K is the same carrying capacity for P as
described before. The constant r is called intrinsic growth rate, or the growth
rate in the absence of any limiting factors. Equation 2.6 shows that if P is small
relative to the carrying capacity K, the rate of its growth will be close to the
constant rate r of the exponential growth model. As P nears K, the rate will
shrink toward 0, resulting in an S-shaped curve. According to this model, when
P reaches K, the growth rate is 0, and the population will be stable. If P were
to somehow exceed K, the rate would become negative and the population would
decrease toward K.
Equation 2.6 is usually solved by separation of variables with partial fraction,
and the solution, with the same initial condition as before, is:

(2.7)

P =

KP0
P0 + (K − P0 ) e−rt

The logistic equation is mostly used to provide a more realistic model for population growth. It is also frequently used for describing the spreading of diseases or
rumors, the autocatalytic chemical reactions, and other processes.
2.4. Second Order Chemical Reaction. The second order chemical reaction
studied in this paper is represented by the following equation:

(2.8)

dP
= r (a − P ) (b − P )
dt

(a 6= b)

The model assumes that the rate of change of quantity P is directly proportional
to its remaining room for growth within the limits of a and b. From equation 2.8
it can be seen that if r > 0, P will increase as long as it is less than both a and b.
As P approaches the smaller of a and b, its rate of change will approach 0 and its
growth diminishes. In the case of second order chemical reaction, quantity P is the
amount of a product generated from two reactants A and B having different initial
quantities a and b, respectively. The reaction rate, dP
dt , is directly proportional to
the remaining quantities of A and B.
Although slightly complicated, Equation 2.8 can also be solved by separation of
variables with partial fraction and the solution is:

3. Implicit Equation Forms
3.1. Derivation of Implicit Forms. The four types of growth modeling equations
listed in the previous section can be written in implicit, highly symmetric forms 1
for easy memorization and comparison. Derivations of the implicit equation forms
are all based on the technique of variable substitution which is commonly used in
solving differential equations.
The implicit model equations are similar in format to the exponential growth
and decay equation and its solution:
(3.1)

dP
= rP
dt

(3.2)

P = P0 ert

To convert the simple inhibited growth equation and its solution into implicit
dP
forms, make the substitution Z = K − P , then dZ
dt = − dt . Equation 2.3 becomes
dZ
dt = −rZ. This new equation of Z resembles the form of equation 2.1 except for
the rate constant being −r. Therefore Z can be directly solved by using equation
2.2:
Z = Z0 e−rt
where Z = K − P and Z0 = K − P0 . Substituting these into the above equations
of Z to get:
(3.3)

d (K − P )
= −r (K − P )
dt

(3.4)

K − P = (K − P0 ) e−rt

For the logistic growth equation and its solution, make the substitution Z =
K
K dP
dP
P 2 dZ
, then P = Z+1
, and also dZ
dt = − P 2 dt or dt = − K dt . Substitute these
into equation 2.6 and rearrange:

growth equations into implicit forms. A portion of this section is adapted from his lecture notes.

Again, the solution of Z can be directly obtained as:
Z = Z0 e−rt

3.2. Significance of Implicit Forms. The development of the implicit forms
is the first such attempt to systematically derive a common expression for these
four types of diversified model equations. The method used in the derivations is
conventional - the commonly used substitution of variables in solving differential
equations, no special skills required. The implicit forms clearly demonstrate the
nature of these models. For example, when r > 0, the simple inhibited growth is
an exponential decay of the (K − P ) quantity, the logistic growth is an exponential decay of the K−P
quantity, and the second order chemical reaction is an
P
b−P
exponential growth of the a−P
quantity if b > a, or exponential decay if b < a.
The implicit equation forms are simple and highly symmetric. They can be easily
compared and memorized. The implicit forms can often provide a quicker way to
solve the more complicated logistic equation problems, as demonstrated by Example
3.1 below. The implicit model equations can also facilitate the development of
expressions of certain model parameters that are difficult to obtain from the explicit
formulas. This is evidenced by following Examples 3.2 and 3.3.
Example 3.2. A contagious disease is spreading in a town of 6000 people. Initially,
three people are infected; 3 days later it spreads to 300 people. Suppose the disease
spreads at a rate proportional to both the infected people and the unaffected people.
Find the number of days for the disease to spread to 50% of the population.
a) Use explicit solution 2.7 to solve for e−r with the known information P0 = 3,
K = 6000 and P (3) = 300.
300 =

t0 = 0, t1 = 1, t2 = 2 and the unknown is K. The method is to derive a general
expression for K first, then plug in the known numbers to calculate its value.

Example 3.4. The census taken in 1990 and 1994 of a city’s population showed
that it had 2.48 million and 2.67 million residents, respectively. Assume that the
maximum capacity of the city is 3.20 million and the population increases logistically. Estimate the city’s population in 1978.
In this problem the known conditions are P1 = 2.48, P2 = 2.67, t1 = 12, t2 = 16,
K = 3.20, and the unknown is P0 . The same method is used to derive a general
solution of P0 first, then to plug in the known number to solve for its value. From
the previous example:
