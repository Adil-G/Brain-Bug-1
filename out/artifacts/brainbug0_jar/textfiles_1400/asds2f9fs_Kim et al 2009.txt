THE REPAIR OF TRUST: A DYNAMIC
BILATERAL PERSPECTIVE AND MULTILEVEL
CONCEPTUALIZATION

We investigate the repair of trust by examining the cognitive and interpersonal
processes through which people resolve differences in their interpersonal beliefs. We
begin by discussing the phenomenon of trust, the ease with which trust can be
violated, and the challenge of trust repair. We then draw from an array of literature to
develop a multilevel conceptualization of how trust repair may be pursued. Finally,
we integrate these insights to identify three overarching implications for research.

Rousseau, 1994), revenge and other deviant behaviors that stem from broken relationships
(Aquino, Tripp, & Bies, 2001; Bies & Tripp, 1996),
and noncooperative behavior in mixed-motive
contexts (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan,
2002). These studies have identified significant
economic, emotional, and social costs involved
in such situations. Thus, a clear implication of
this work is the need to understand how trust
might be repaired after such violations have
occurred.
Scientific studies, however, have only begun
to give the matter of trust repair much attention.
A small but growing body of work has directly
examined this issue (Ferrin, Kim, Cooper, &
Dirks, 2007; Kim, Dirks, Cooper, & Ferrin, 2006;
Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, & Dirks, 2004; Nakayachi &
Watabe, 2005; Schweitzer, Hershey, & Bradlow,
2006; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). And other research has
addressed a number of closely related topics,
such as the interpersonal and structural factors
that promote forgiveness (Aquino, Tripp, & Bies,
2006; McCullough, Worthington, & Rachal, 1997),
responses mistrusted parties can provide to facilitate reconciliation and the restoration of cooperation (Bottom et al., 2002; Tomlinson,
Dineen, & Lewicki, 2004), and the use of verbal
accounts to mitigate the negative consequences
of a violation (Ohbuchi, Kameda, & Agarie, 1989;
Riordan, Marlin, & Kellogg, 1983; Sigal, Hsu,
Foodim, & Betman, 1988). Despite this initial

We all rely on beliefs about ourselves, those
around us, and the likely course of our interactions to navigate our social worlds. Of these
beliefs, perhaps few are as central as those
guiding our decisions to trust. Trust, which we
define as a psychological state comprising the
intention to accept vulnerability based on positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of
another (e.g., Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998), has been found to offer numerous benefits
for individuals, groups, and organizations (see
Dirks & Ferrin, 2002, for a meta-analytic review).
However, these positive expectations often can
be violated, resulting in reduced trust and the
need to repair trust.
Research across a variety of literature in organizational behavior has focused on the ways
in which trust violations occur and the host of
problems that result from these transgressions.
Relevant inquiries include efforts to understand
the nature of trust violations and the dynamics
of distrust within and between organizations
(Elangovan & Shapiro, 1998; Lewicki, McAllister,
& Bies, 1998; Robinson, 1996; Zaheer, Lofstrom, &
George, 2002), violations of psychological contracts (Morrison & Robinson, 1997; Robinson &

progress, this body of research continues to suffer from three critical limitations that, if not addressed, are likely to hinder further advancements in the field.
First, although this literature has identified a
number of different strategies for repairing trust,
there remains a notable lack of conceptual coherence to the existing research. For example,
studies have investigated an assortment of tactics that can be used following a violation, including apologies (e.g., Kim et al., 2006; Tomlinson et al., 2004), denials (e.g., Kim et al., 2006;
Sigal et al., 1988), promises (Schweitzer et al.,
2006), excuses (Shapiro, 1991; Tomlinson et al.,
2004), reparations (Bottom et al., 2002), legalistic
remedies (Sitkin & Roth, 1993), hostage posting
(Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005), and even no response at all (Ferrin et al., 2007). However, each
of these studies has focused on just a single or
handful of specific tactics, with no comprehensive theoretical account of how various tactics
relate to one another or where other as yet unexamined tactics might belong.
Second, virtually all of the studies in the trust
repair literature have focused on the actions
that the mistrusted party (i.e., the trustee) might
take to repair trust while portraying the trustor
as a relatively passive observer. For example,
Tomlinson et al. (2004) studied a number of trust
repair tactics trustees might initiate while portraying trustors as recipients who simply evaluate these trust repair efforts. By doing so, this
study, as well as the others, largely failed to
recognize that the trustor often plays an active
role in the trust repair process. Not only is the
trustor’s willingness to accept the mistrusted
party’s efforts of great importance for determining the likelihood of trust repair (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996) but so too are the actions trustors
themselves undertake to influence this outcome.
Thus, some conceptual basis is needed to address the complex issue of how these various
trustee and trustor efforts interact with one another to determine whether, and the extent to
which, the repair of trust occurs.
Third, perhaps in large part because of the
aforementioned limitations, the trust repair literature lacks consensus regarding what kinds of
efforts are effective at repairing trust, and it has, at
times, even reached contradictory conclusions.
For example, some studies have suggested that
trust may be repaired more successfully if mistrusted parties identify, acknowledge, and as-

July

sume responsibility for the offense (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Ohbuchi et al., 1989), whereas others
have suggested that an apology will fail to ameliorate the negative consequences of a trust violation because it involves an acknowledgment of
guilt (Riordan et al., 1983; Schlenker, 1980; Sigal et
al., 1988). Indeed, this situation may be likened to
John Godfrey Saxe’s poem about six blind men
trying to describe an elephant, who end up arriving at different conclusions and failing to understand the whole because they came into contact
with different parts (“Though each was partly in
the right, and all were in the wrong!”).
The purpose of this paper is to address these
limitations by establishing a research program
(Lakatos, 1978) on trust repair that considers the
cognitive and interpersonal processes through
which people may resolve differences in their
interpersonal beliefs. We begin by discussing
the phenomenon of trust, the ease with which
trust can be violated, and the particular challenge of trust repair. Next, we discuss the central ideas that represent the hard core of this
research program. We then draw on these foundations to develop more specific elements of our
theory, including a progressive bilateral model
of how the repair of trust may occur. Finally, we
integrate these insights to consider their implications for future research.
TRUST FORMATION, VIOLATION, AND REPAIR
Trust is a complex and multifaceted construct.
Scholars have discussed both “trusting intentions”—that is, a willingness to make oneself
vulnerable to another in the presence of risk—
and “trusting beliefs”—that is, the perceived
trust-relevant qualities of the trustee, such as
competence, integrity, or benevolence (McKnight, Cummings, & Chervany, 1998). Building
on these notions, as well as supporting evidence
by Kim et al. (2004), we presume that trust is
composed of both trusting beliefs and trusting
intentions and that the latter are influenced via
the former. Trust violations, in turn, concern incidents that lower these trusting beliefs in and
trusting intentions toward a trustee (e.g., owing
to trustors’ initial assumptions about their trustees’ guilt, degree of responsibility, future behavior, and type of transgression). Finally, trust repair concerns improving the trusting beliefs and
trusting intentions that have been lowered by
the trust violation (typically, by addressing

<-----Page 2----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

these initial trustor assumptions). For clarity,
throughout this paper we use the term trustor to
refer to the individual whose trust has been violated (since he or she is in the position of evaluating the mistrusted party) and the term trustee
to refer to the mistrusted party (since he or she is
the target of the trustor’s trusting beliefs and
trusting intentions).
Dynamics of Trust
It would be one thing if trustworthiness were a
tangible resource that could be expended on
certain occasions and replenished on others. If
that were the case, the repair of trust could simply entail assessing the magnitude of the violation via an objective analysis and meting out
the appropriate restitution. Evidence reveals,
however, that our assessments of trustworthiness are far from systematic; they are susceptible to a host of social cognitive factors.
It is often assumed, for example, that trust in
others develops gradually over time (e.g.,
Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2000). But recent observations suggest that individuals can exhibit surprisingly high levels of trust even without a history of interaction (McKnight et al., 1998;
Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996; Weber, Malhotra, & Murnighan, 2005). These researchers explain that this high initial trust can arise for a
variety of reasons, including an individual’s disposition to trust; feelings of dependence; a belief
that impersonal structures such as regulations
and laws support one’s likelihood of success in
a given situation; and rapid, cognitive cues arising from group membership, reputations, and
stereotypes. These same researchers also note,
however, that such trust can be quite fragile
because of the tentative and assumption-based
nature of these antecedents.
People can often behave in ways that violate
trust, such as by exploiting dependencies or by
neglecting to fulfill expectations. Yet research
suggests that trust can be damaged even when
individuals have not committed such infractions. Numerous studies have shown that people
can be quite willing to believe unsubstantiated
allegations of such acts, despite the difficulties
of determining whether the allegations are accurate (e.g., Bell & Loftus, 1989; Penrod & Cutler,
1995; Ross, Ceci, Dunning, & Toglia, 1994). Evidence from these and other studies (e.g., Kim et
al., 2004) has also shown that trust can be vio-

403

lated even with those who have not been directly harmed by the transgression. Moreover, it
appears that when such violations occur, the
onus is frequently placed on the accused party
to remove the shadow of suspicion (Hendry,
Shaffer, & Peacock, 1989).
Trust Repair
Those who wish to repair trust, however, typically confront a range of complications. First,
since trustworthiness is ultimately in the eye of
the beholder, there may be times when trust has
been violated but the trustee does not realize
that a violation has occurred (e.g., when the
trustee violates trust unknowingly or the trustor
is not visibly harmed by the transgression). In
such cases the trust violation will not necessarily be followed by a trust repair attempt; the
latter may require that the trustee be informed
of this need by the trustor (or third party). Second, trust repair requires more than simply compensating for the negative expectations arising
from a trust violation by improving others (e.g.,
responding to damaged beliefs about the trustee’s integrity by bolstering beliefs about the
trustee’s competence; Baumeister & Jones, 1978).
Such an approach may sometimes encourage
trustors to engage in trust-relevant behaviors,
but it does so by augmenting nonviolated expectations (i.e., trust building) rather than by addressing the salient negative expectations that
have arisen from the violation (i.e., trust repair).
Similarly, although parties may initiate a number of legalistic remedies (e.g., policies, procedures, contracts, monitoring) to promote trustworthy behavior (e.g., Nakayachi & Watabe,
2005; Sitkin, 1995; Sitkin & Roth, 1993), such constraint-oriented remedies may not necessarily
repair trust itself. Rather than addressing the
underlying trustworthiness of the trustee, these
remedies seem more specifically concerned
with enabling desired outcomes by reducing a
trustor’s vulnerability or risk (i.e., by allowing
trustors to act as if trust existed by limiting the
ability of even untrustworthy trustees to commit
a transgression; Das & Teng, 1998).1
1

In fact, evidence reveals that the implementation of such
constraints may even hinder trust, since trustors cannot determine whether the trustee’s subsequent behavior is due to
the trustee’s trustworthiness or the imposed constraint (Malhotra & Murnighan, 2002).

<-----Page 3----->404

Trust repair, therefore, cannot simply focus on
reestablishing seemingly trusting behaviors,
since such behavior can arise for a variety of
reasons (Kee & Knox, 1970; Lewis & Weigert,
1985: 977). Instead, these considerations reveal
that the trust repair process ultimately involves
the interaction of both the trustor and trustee as
they attempt to resolve discrepancies in their
beliefs. Theorizing in this domain must, accordingly, move beyond the nature of the violation,
its cost to the trustor, or the trustee’s responses
in isolation to consider the interplay of these
and other factors that can shape how we construe our social worlds. Thankfully, these complexities of social construal have been the object of research in other fields (e.g., the literature
on identity negotiation, on the fundamental attribution error, and on dispositional attribution),
and this research has established a number of
solid foundations on which we can build. The
following sections, therefore, will draw on this
and other literature to develop a research program that can account for the dynamics of trust
repair, specify a bilateral model of how the repair of trust may occur, and, finally, integrate
these insights into three overarching implications for future research.
RESEARCH PROGRAM
Our paper is based on the philosophical view
that the appropriate unit of scientific growth is
best characterized as a continuous progression
of historically related theories, or “research program” (Lakatos, 1978). This continuity arises
from the nurturing and articulation of a “hard
core” of leading ideas, which gives the research
program its impetus and originality and which
cannot be abandoned without abandoning the
research program altogether. Rather, the hard
core is shielded from falsification by a “protective belt” of auxiliary theories and hypotheses
that are derived from the hard core but can be
adjusted, either because of empirical developments or because of natural next steps in the
refinement of these ideas.
The research program, furthermore, provides
guidance on how to alter this protective belt by
deriving a set of problem-solving techniques
from the program’s inner logic (i.e., its “positive
heuristic”). Thus, a research program may be
buffered from disconfirmation through adjustments to its protective belt as long as each suc-

July

cessive link in the resultant chain of theoretical
models arises from the program’s positive heuristic, rather than ad hoc, and offers greater explanatory power than the one preceding it.2 We
adopt this approach because it permits a conceptualization of trust repair that can grow
along with its nascent literature, allows us to
distinguish the vital elements of our portrayal
(i.e., the hard core) from those we expect to face
the brunt of empirical testing and updating (i.e.,
the protective belt), and sets a rigorous standard
for subsequent theory development.
The Hard Core
The hard core of our research program comprises three basic assumptions about the repair
of trust following a violation. They concern (1)
the notion that trustees want to be considered
trustworthy, (2) the inclination of trustors to believe that greater trust in their trustees is not
deserved, and (3) the efforts of trustors and trustees to resolve these discrepant beliefs.
Trustees. Our analysis of trust repair begins
with the assumption that trustees want to be
considered trustworthy and, hence, will advocate the belief, following a violation, that they
should be trusted. This assumption is based on
two compatible rationales. First, this advocacy
may reflect trustees’ personal beliefs that trust
is truly warranted—for example, if the violation
was the result of a groundless allegation or if
trustees simply construe the transgression differently owing to their personal knowledge of
the incident, self-serving attributions, positive
illusions, or other considerations (e.g., Riess,
Rosenfeld, Melburg, & Tedeschi, 1981; Taylor &
Brown, 1988). Second, this advocacy may arise
when trustees recognize that being perceived as

2
A classic example of such a research program can be
found in Newton’s gravitational theory. This theory posited a
hard core containing three laws of dynamics and his law of
gravitation, as well as a protective belt of theories and
hypotheses that began with a theoretical model for a planetary system with a fixed pointlike sun and one single pointlike planet. Newton then considered a system with more
planets, then worked out the case where the sun and planets
were not mass points but mass balls, and then followed this
by starting work on the implications of spinning balls and
their wobbles, admitting the role of interplanetary forces. He
then started work on perturbations and then considered the
implications of planets that are bulging rather than round
(Lakatos, 1978: 50).

<-----Page 4----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

trustworthy may allow them to obtain desired
resources from trustors, such as esteem, information, assistance, and so on (Dirks & Skarlicki,
2009). Indeed, the latter consideration suggests
that there may be cases where trustees do not
actually believe they are trustworthy but seek to
repair trust anyway (e.g., the case of unwarranted trust repair undertaken by a “con man”).
However, even here our analysis assumes that
trustees will act as if they believe that greater
trust is deserved.
Trustors. In contrast, we assume trustors are
predisposed to believe that greater trust in their
trustees is not deserved. More specifically, once
trust has been violated, conscious concerns
about harm from further transgressions, as well
as less conscious influences such as the confirmation bias (Nickerson, 1998) and aspects of our
evolutionary hardwiring that deter us from tolerating transgressors (de Quervain et al., 2004),
should encourage trustors to maintain that mistrust unless they are given an adequate reason
to update it. Trustees may attempt to offer that
reason with a trust repair attempt, but it is ultimately the trustors who set the threshold (either
consciously or unconsciously) for how adequate
a response is required. Indeed, even in cases
where trustors want to repair their trust in the
trustee themselves (e.g., when trustors are sufficiently motivated to preserve the relationship),
they must strive to do so in ways that are sufficient to overcome the resistance threshold that
they have (again, either consciously or unconsciously) set on their own.
Negotiation of trustworthiness. Finally, our
analysis assumes that these competing efforts
will create a dynamic through which trustees
and trustors attempt to resolve their discrepant
beliefs about the trustees’ trustworthiness. The
identity negotiation literature, which concerns
individuals’ attempts to resolve discrepancies
between how they are viewed by others and
how they view themselves (Swann, 1987), provides a foundation for understanding these interactions. This research indicates that parties’
competing beliefs can be resolved in different
ways—there are times when targets are able to
act in ways that disconfirm perceivers’ beliefs
(Podsakoff & Farh, 1989), occasions when targets
fall prey to the beliefs of perceivers and confirm
them through their actions (Jussim, Soffin,
Brown, Ley, & Kohlhepp, 1992), and other outcomes that fall somewhere in between. This lit-

405

erature has, furthermore, shown that which of
these outcomes occurs depends on the relative
strength of these competing party beliefs (e.g.,
Eisenstadt & Leippe, 1994; Kim, Diekmann, &
Tenbrunsel, 2003; Nease, Mudgett, & Quinones,
1999). Thus, by depicting the trust repair process
as a negotiation of identity between trustors and
trustees—specifically, the resolution of a disagreement over whether the trustees should be
trusted—we can gauge trust repair by assessing the relative success of their efforts. In particular, these notions entail that trust repair
depends on the strength of the trustees’ efforts
to promote the belief that they should be
trusted, outweighing the opposing efforts of
the trustors (see Figure 1). Otherwise, a number of alternative outcomes may arise, as we
discuss later in the paper.
The Protective Belt
The problem of trust repair underscored by
these hard core assumptions thus becomes how
trustees may bolster the strength of their efforts
to be seen as trustworthy relative to the strength
of their trustors’ resistance. To solve it, we require a more specific portrayal of the ways in
which trust repair can occur. Our research program offers such a portrayal through a bilateral
model of trust repair. This model is noteworthy
in that each of its levels represents a distinct yet
cumulative stage in the elaboration of a theory
in a manner that is both consistent with our hard
core assumptions and capable of explaining
more and more of the empirical world. In this
way it exhibits the defining characteristics of a
“progressive theoretical [and empirical] problemshift,” the satisfaction of which provides a
meaningful basis for determining that this research program is worthwhile (Lakatos, 1978:
48 – 49).
Our bilateral model of trust repair involves
several interrelated principles. First, we presume that trustors’ and trustees’ disagreement
about whether the trustees should be trusted can
be resolved on multiple levels. These levels represent a logically derived sequence of questions
about whether a trustee can be trusted following a
violation. Specifically: (1) Is the trustee innocent or
guilty of committing the transgression? (2) If the
trustee is guilty of the transgression, should this
be attributed to the situation or to the person? (3)
If the transgression is attributed at least in part

<-----Page 5----->406

FIGURE 1
Potential Outcomes of Negotiation Efforts by a Trustor and Trustee

to the person, is the personal shortcoming fixable or is it an enduring characteristic of the
trustee? As will become apparent later in the
paper, these levels roughly correspond to different segments of the literature, which have explored particular strategies for repairing relationships following a transgression. We refer to
them as levels because they represent a cascading series of questions that can be ordered by
their scope, with each successive level offering
a less comprehensive means through which
trust may be repaired—for example, Level 1
would be the broadest in scope because it concerns whether the trustee should be completely
exonerated from the alleged transgression (see
Figure 2).
Second, we expect that, all else being equal,
trustees will prefer the broadest level of trust
repair possible (e.g., trustees will prefer to be
found completely innocent [via Level 1] rather
than partially guilty [via Level 2]). This principle
represents a corollary to the hard core assumption that trustees want to be considered trustworthy. It derives from the notion that broaderlevel solutions will prove less onerous for a
trustee than those that are narrower, not only
because of the psychic benefits of being more
completely exonerated but also because broader-

level solutions are likely to impose fewer subsequent burdens on the trustee. Success in convincing trustors of one’s innocence, for example,
will require little in the way of subsequent remedial action, given that the alleged transgression will have been shown to be false, whereas
success in convincing trustors that the transgression was at least partly attributable to the
situation will entail somehow addressing these
concerns (e.g., by mitigating situational influences through new policies or procedures and/or
increasing one’s resistance to those pressures).
Moreover, both of these outcomes should prove
less taxing for the trustee than convincing trustors that although the trustee is fully responsible for the transgression, this deficiency can be
fixed, since the latter may require some of the
most fundamental of changes to the trustee’s
nature (e.g., with concerted efforts to address
these deep-rooted limitations and to show that
they have been corrected).
Third, again all else being equal, we expect
that trustors will resist broader levels of trust
repair more than those that are narrower. This
principle represents a corollary to the hard core
assumption that trustors will be predisposed to
believe that greater trust in their trustees is
not deserved. It derives from the notion that

<-----Page 6----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

407

FIGURE 2
Bilateral Model of Trust Repair

narrower-level solutions are likely to provide
greater reassurance to trustors than those that
are broader, not only by offering greater validation of trustors’ belief that their trustees were
untrustworthy (e.g., that at least some fault lies
with the trustees [Level 2], as opposed to none at
all [Level 1]) but also because of the greater
subsequent burdens that narrower levels of
trust repair will levy on their trustees (as described above). Thus, we presume that trustors
will resist certain types of repair efforts more
than others and that it is through this “differential resistance” that trustors may exert as significant an influence on the repair of trust as their
trustees.
Our fourth principle concerns the resolution of
these competing tendencies. As a corollary to
the hard core assumption that the repair of trust
depends on the relative strength of trustees’ and
trustors’ efforts, we expect that the specific nature of these efforts will reflect the level at
which trust repair is pursued. In particular, for
Level 1, the degree of trust repair will depend on
the extent to which trustees’ efforts to promote

the belief that they are innocent of the transgression outweigh their trustors’ efforts to uphold the belief that the trustees are guilty. For
Level 2, the degree of trust repair will depend on
the extent to which trustees’ efforts to promote
the belief that the transgression should be attributed to the situation outweigh their trustors’
efforts to uphold the belief that the transgression should be attributed to the trustees. And
for Level 3, the degree of trust repair will depend on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to
promote the belief that they will redeem themselves in the future outweigh their trustors’
efforts to uphold the belief that such redemption will not occur.
Finally, the identity negotiation perspective
that helps ground the bilateral trust repair
model underscores the notion that trustors’ and
trustees’ competing beliefs will be resolved
through a dynamic process that can unfold not
only within but also across levels. For example,
although trustees may prefer to be seen as innocent, they may come to discover that their
trustors adamantly believe they are guilty. In

<-----Page 7----->408

Academy of Management Review

such cases trustees may be better off shifting
their efforts to a narrower-scope level of trust
repair (by claiming that they are only partially
responsible or that although they are fully responsible, the deficiency can be fixed) so that at
least some trust repair occurs, despite the added
liabilities the narrower-scope solution entails.
Thus, trustees may engage in one or more “strategic retreats” whereby broader trust repair efforts are abandoned, either immediately or after
a broader-scope attempt has failed, in favor of
narrower-scope efforts that may be more likely
to succeed.3 And, by the same token, trustors
may alter the nature of their own resistance
(e.g., by more adamantly opposing trustees’
claims of innocence than trustees’ efforts to attribute some of the blame to the situation), and
perhaps even signal where that resistance will
be lower (e.g., by asking trustees to explain why
they were untrustworthy), to affect the types of
repair attempts their trustees pursue.
These principles highlight the potential for an
iterative call and response of endeavors, with
trustees and trustors each attempting to promote their competing beliefs, gauging the effectiveness of their efforts, and then engaging in
additional efforts to influence this outcome further. Indeed, the motivation to initiate such additional efforts may be quite common, given the
opposing efforts of trustees and trustors to shift
such beliefs in their favor as they attempt to
converge on a mutually shared appraisal of the
trustees. Thus, for all these reasons, this multilevel conceptualization highlights the dynamic
bilateral process through which the repair of
trust can occur. Below, we elaborate the model
by describing each of its levels and the ways in
which trustees and trustors may affect them.
Level 1: Innocent 7 Guilty
Given that a trust violation is based on the
premise that a trustee has committed some form

3

A well-known example can be found in the shifting response of former President Bill Clinton following the accusation that he had an affair with a White House intern. He
initially denied guilt (Level 1): “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinski.” But when this offering became untenable, he shifted to another tactic (Level 2):
“I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinski that was not
appropriate. . . . I can only tell you I was motivated by many
factors.”

of transgression, perhaps the most comprehensive way in which trust can be repaired is by
affecting the extent to which this premise is
ultimately deemed to be true (i.e., on a continuum ranging from definitely guilty to definitely
innocent). Alleged transgressors who seek trust
repair can challenge trustors’ beliefs that the
trustees had committed the transgression and,
to the extent that they are successful, completely
vanquish the notion that this lack of trust was
deserved. Trustors, in contrast, are likely to resist such innocence-claiming efforts in favor of
maintaining their belief in the trustees’ guilt,
thereby impeding such trust repair.
Studies have revealed a number of ways in
which trustees and trustors may pursue these
opposing efforts. One of the most obvious means
of doing so is to provide tangible evidence concerning a trustee’s innocence or guilt regarding
the alleged transgression. Kim et al. (2004) examined this notion as part of a larger inquiry
and found, in a simulated job interview at an
accounting firm, that candidates who had been
accused of misfiling a tax return with a prior
employer were indeed considered more trustworthy—and were more likely to be hired—after
an investigation revealed they were innocent,
rather than guilty, of this alleged violation.
Research has also revealed that a trustor’s
beliefs about a trustee’s guilt can be influenced
through less tangible means, such as the provision of verbal denials. Sigal et al. (1988), for
example, asked participants to watch a videotape of a simulated debate in which one political candidate was accused of sexual or financial misconduct by the other, and they found
that the accused party received more votes and
was considered to be more honest, ethical, and
trustworthy when that candidate denied culpability rather than apologized for the misconduct.
Similarly, Riordan et al. (1983) used fabricated
reports that a fictitious senator had taken a
bribe and found that subsequent evaluations of
the senator were less negative when the senator
denied rather than admitted responsibility for
the transgression.
A trustee’s verbal denial can be problematic,
however, when it is inconsistent with subsequent evidence regarding the trustee’s innocence/guilt. Indeed, Kim et al. (2004) observed
that information about guilt after a denial indicates that the denial was a lie and, thus, fosters
lower levels of trust than if the trustee had of-

<-----Page 8----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

fered an apology. This finding highlights the
potential for different trust repair efforts to interact, and even to interfere, with one another,
as well as the resultant need to assess their
combined effects on parties’ competing beliefs
to determine whether such efforts will succeed.
This depiction also suggests that trustors are
not simply passive bystanders but, rather, are
actively involved in this negotiation process.
Trustors may therefore be able to impose their
own beliefs in such a way that trustees abandon
their trust repair efforts or even come to believe
that this lack of trust is truly deserved. Research
on the social psychology of false confessions,
for example, has shown that although many of
us may find it hard to believe that anyone would
confess to a crime he or she did not commit
(Kassin & Wrightsman, 1980, 1981), there are numerous instances in which such confessions
have been obtained (Bedau & Radelet, 1987;
Rattner, 1988). Thus, scholars have begun to investigate how interrogators, who earnestly believe in the suspect’s guilt, manage to obtain
such an end (Kassin & McNall, 1991). Although
systematic evidence regarding such techniques
is scarce, these inquiries highlight at least the
possibility that trustors’ beliefs about their trustees’ guilt can affect trustees’ beliefs about themselves.
Therefore, we can observe that both trustors
and trustees can initiate tactics to affect the
likelihood of trust repair. Each of these tactics
can, furthermore, be understood to operate by
affecting the strength of the trustors’ and/or
trustees’ beliefs about the trustees’ innocence/
guilt. Thus far, research pertinent to this strategy has largely focused on the provision of tangible evidence and verbal denials. However, the
aforementioned principles that underlie this approach also suggest that these specific tactics
are likely to represent just a few of the techniques that can be employed. Indeed, trustees
and trustors may each engage in a range of as
yet unexamined efforts to strengthen their own
beliefs and/or to weaken the beliefs of the other.
Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) thus concerns
whether the net effect of such efforts strengthens
the beliefs of trustees and/or trustors, and it
highlights how the degree of trust repair may
depend on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to
promote the belief that they are innocent of the
transgression outweigh trustors’ efforts to uphold the belief that the trustees are guilty.

Yet even if it is clear to all parties that a
trustee is guilty, trust may still be repaired
through other means. To do so, however, the
bilateral trust repair model suggests that the
trustee must narrow the scope of his or her repair efforts in a way that concedes this matter of
guilt but attempts to limit its impact on how the
trustee is viewed. Specifically, in the following
section we consider a whole class of efforts designed not to challenge trustees’ responsibility
for a transgression completely (as described
above) but, rather, to acknowledge having committed it while also deflecting as much of the
blame as possible to the situation.
Level 2: Situation 7 Person
Researchers have observed that when considering the underlying cause of an action, observers attempt to subtract the effect of the situation
and attribute what remains to the actor (Kelley,
1973). The logic that drives this “discounting
principle” is that dispositional and situational
forces operate in a hydraulic fashion so that as
situational forces grow stronger, the role of the
actor grows weaker (McClure, 1998). A problem,
however, is that when making such assessments, observers generally fail to fully appreciate the potential influence of situational forces
and, hence, err on the side of making dispositional attributions—a phenomenon known as
the fundamental attribution error (e.g., Jones &
Harris, 1967; Nisbett, Caputo, Legant, & Maracek,
1973).
The targets of such observations, on the other
hand, generally possess a much greater appreciation of the constraints imposed by the situation than observers (e.g., Jones & Nisbett, 1972;
Nisbett et al., 1973). In some cases such situational attributions arise because these external
forces are more salient to actors than to observers (i.e., an informational mechanism). In other
cases, particularly after a negative event, actors
may be inclined, either consciously or unconsciously, to adopt such situational attributions
in order to preserve their self-esteem—a motivational mechanism (Snyder & Higgins, 1988; Snyder, Higgins, & Stucky, 1983). But regardless of
the underlying mechanism, this research highlights an inherent difference in how actors (e.g.,
trustees) and observers (e.g., trustors) are likely
to interpret behavior, and they show that an
actor’s culpability can depend on the degree to

<-----Page 9----->410

Academy of Management Review

which the actor is able to convince the observer
that the behavior was induced by the situation
(i.e., on a continuum ranging from entirely the
actor to entirely the situation).
One way trustees might seek to mitigate their
blame, and thus facilitate trust repair, is by explaining that their actions were at least partly
caused by external forces (i.e., by providing an
excuse). Indeed, evidence from several studies
indicates that excuses can often prove beneficial for those who have committed a wrong (Snyder & Higgins, 1988) because they reduce the
perceived responsibility of the transgressor
(Riordan et al., 1983). Crant and Bateman (1993),
for example, discovered that when supervisors
in a large accounting firm read scenarios that
described an unsuccessful audit, they blamed
the subordinate less if an external causal account was offered than if such an account was
not offered. Wood and Mitchell (1981) found that
when nurse managers read scenarios depicting
their subordinates erring in patient care, they assigned less responsibility and punished less severely when they were given accounts of external
causes for the poor performance than when they
were given an apology. Moreover, Weiner,
Amirkhan, Folkes, and Verette (1987) found that
external attributions can reduce anger in the victim of a transgression and thereby reduce tension
in potentially inflammatory situations.
Alternatively, trustees may attempt to reframe
the situation in a way that convinces trustors to
reassess the magnitude or nature of the transgression itself (i.e., by providing some form of
justification). Justifications not only involve the
acceptance of responsibility but also point out
that the act in question was appropriate owing
to the nature of the situation (Scott & Lyman,
1968). Thus, in most cases justifications refer the
trustor to a situational factor, such as a norm,
that the trustor may not have recognized but that
when taken into consideration reflects a positive or appropriate motive. Nesdale, Rule, and
McAra (1975), for example, found that observers
were more likely to approve of a harmful action
when the action was explained to be the result
of a good rather than bad motive. Similarly, Shapiro (1991) found that those who were deceived
by their partners were less punitive and less
likely to retaliate if altruistic rather than selfish
reasons were given for the deception. Moreover,
Elsbach’s (1994) study of organizational accounts in the California cattle industry observed

July

that efforts to justify controversial actions by
referencing normative and socially endorsed organizational practices (e.g., federally approved
guidelines) provided an effective means of managing organizational legitimacy.
A thorough assessment of Level 2 (situation 7
person) also moves us beyond the traditional
focus on a trustee’s role in shifting responsibility to the situation by underscoring a competing
force that has received much less attention. Specifically, when trustees attempt to highlight the
influence of the situation with an excuse or justification, trustors may often be inclined to resist
such efforts. Research in the field of evolutionary psychology suggests that people are generally predisposed to infer that some agent, rather
than the situation, is the cause of salient events
(Boyer, 2001: 144 –145). Kim and colleagues (2006)
have also noted that trustors may discount mistrusted parties’ efforts to blame situational influences. Moreover, as with the potential for
“mistrust confirmation” described by Level 1
(innocent 7 guilty), excuses may sometimes
backfire. For example, some evidence suggests
that when individuals offer an excuse for a failure but the excuse is rejected, they are likely to
exhibit performance deficits in the future and in
this way to confirm with their subsequent actions the negative feedback they received
(Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978; Mikulincer & Nizan, 1988).
These considerations underscore the notion
that “every account is a manifestation of the
underlying negotiation of identities” (Scott & Lyman, 1968: 59). Trustees may use excuses, justifications, and perhaps other as yet unexamined
measures to convince trustors (and perhaps even
themselves) that the transgression should be attributed to the situation rather than to the trustees’
inherent lack of trustworthiness, whereas trustors
may implement a range of measures (virtually
none of which have received systematic research
attention) to oppose such claims and attribute the
transgression to trustees’ untrustworthy dispositions. Level 2 (situation 7 person) therefore reveals how the degree of trust repair may depend
on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to promote
the belief that the transgression should be blamed
on the situation outweigh trustors’ efforts to uphold the belief that the transgression should be
blamed on the trustees.
Deflecting blame from a trustee’s disposition
to the situation represents an opportunity to re-

<-----Page 10----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

pair trust even when the trustee has clearly
committed the violation and, hence, finds it infeasible to directly oppose the underlying basis
for the mistrust. With both Levels 1 (guilty 7
innocent) and 2 (situation 7 person), however,
the overriding goal is to reduce the mistrusted
party’s perceived culpability in some way. But
this general approach to repairing trust has
been challenged by a separate set of studies
suggesting that trust repair is more likely to
occur if trustees assume more blame (e.g., with
an apology or an internal attribution) rather
than less (e.g., with a denial or external attribution). The bilateral trust repair model resolves
this apparent contradiction by suggesting that
these other studies represent a trust repair strategy that is even narrower in scope than the prior
two levels. In particular, it suggests that even if
it proves infeasible to oppose all culpability or
even some of it, trust may still be repaired if
trustees can confine blame to the past and make
the case that the problems will be corrected in
the future.
Level 3: Fixable 7 Fixed
The key elaboration posed by this level is that
although all trust repair requires the trustee to
be considered more trustworthy in the future,
this may be accomplished through measures
that are either “retroactively prophylactic” (i.e.,
minimizing the initial taint of untrustworthiness) or “subsequently curative” (i.e., fixing the
problem after it has been found) in nature. Retroactively prophylactic measures, such as those
described by Levels 1 and 2, have the potential
to repair trust more comprehensively than those
that are substantively curative. The former are
designed to reduce concerns about the future by
reducing trustees’ culpability for the past,
whereas the latter are only designed to target
concerns about the future. Nevertheless, the
kinds of subsequently curative methods that we
describe may still repair trust effectively to the
extent that the question of whether these flaws
will persist in the future (i.e., on a continuum
ranging from entirely fixable to entirely fixed)
represents trustors’ paramount concern.
Discussions within the trust repair literature
regarding these more future-oriented concerns
have suggested that they may be alleviated if
mistrusted parties identify, acknowledge, and
assume some responsibility for the trust-

411

damaging events (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). One
way of doing so is by offering an apology, which
is a statement that acknowledges both responsibility and regret for a trust violation (Ferrin et
al., 2007; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2004). Although an apology acknowledges guilt, which
alone should reduce trust, its concomitant expression of regret signals an intention to avoid
similar violations in the future, which should
reduce trustors’ concerns about continued vulnerability and should thereby improve trust.
Thus, we can observe that the effectiveness of
an apology as a response to a trust violation
depends on the notion that this response’s benefits (due to potential redemption) will outweigh
its costs (due to the confirmation of guilt).
This reasoning has been supported by several
empirical studies. Findings indicate that victims
of psychological harm generally have more favorable impressions of the perpetrator, experience more positive affect, and are more likely to
refrain from severe aggression toward the perpetrator when the culprit apologizes for the
wrongdoing than when the culprit does not (Ohbuchi et al., 1989). Experimental studies of impression management reveal that the expression of remorse following a transgression can
reduce punishment (e.g., Schwartz, Kane, Joseph, & Tedeschi, 1978). Moreover, research on
social dilemmas demonstrates that, at least in
short-term interactions, an apology can more effectively reestablish cooperation after an opportunistic act than can a denial (Bottom et al.,
2002).
Additionally, even when an apology is offered, trustees may convey it in a manner that
assumes more blame or less, and at least some
evidence reveals that those who assume full
blame with an internal attribution are seen as
more likely to correct their shortcomings in the
future (i.e., to achieve redemption) than those
who attempt to mitigate their blame with an
external attribution. Tomlinson et al. (2004)
found that victims of a broken promise were
more willing to reconcile a professional relationship when the violator offered an internal
rather than an external attribution. Likewise,
Hodgins and Liebeskind (2003) reported that victims exhibited more positive evaluations and
expectations of future relationships when transgressors assumed more rather than less responsibility for the act in question. Furthermore,
Schlenker, Pontari, and Christopher (2001) noted

<-----Page 11----->412

Academy of Management Review

that excuse makers risk being seen as deceptive, self-absorbed, and ineffectual.
Moving beyond the implications of verbal responses, studies suggest that individuals may
implement a variety of substantive measures to
address concerns about future transgressions.
Bottom et al. (2002) proposed and found supporting evidence for the notion that voluntarily paying a financial penalty following a transgression will substantiate the trustee’s expression of
remorse for his or her behavior and will underscore a commitment to avoid similar transgressions in the future. Similarly, Nakayachi and
Watabe (2005) found across several contexts that
the voluntary implementation of a monitoring
system and sanctions helped to restore trust following a transgression. They suggested that
these voluntary behaviors (i.e., not simply the
imposition of a monitoring system and sanctions) signal positive intentions by the trustee
and, thus, reduce expectations of subsequent
transgressions.
Finally, evidence reveals that the effectiveness of all of these future-oriented responses
will depend on how the transgression has been
framed—specifically, as a matter of competence
or integrity. Competence (i.e., the extent to
which one possesses the technical and interpersonal skills required for a job) and integrity (i.e.,
the extent to which one adheres to a set of principles that a perceiver finds acceptable) deserve
particular attention when considering the challenges of trust repair, for at least three reasons.
First, numerous researchers have observed that
competence and integrity represent two of the
most important qualities for determining trustworthiness (Barber, 1983; Butler & Cantrell, 1984;
Schindler & Thomas, 1993). Second, research has
shown that these dimensions offer important
bases on which individuals evaluate a variety
of targets, including leaders (Pancer, Brown, &
Barr, 1999), job candidates (Cook & Elmer, 1999),
and potential collaborators (Kee & Knox, 1970).
Third, evidence suggests that there may be
some inherent differences in the way people
assess positive versus negative information
about competence versus integrity that may affect how they resolve differences in their interpersonal perceptions (see Snyder & Stukas, 1999,
for a review). In particular, research suggests
that although individuals tend to weigh positive
information about competence more heavily
than negative information about competence,

July

they tend to weigh negative information about
integrity more heavily than positive information
about integrity (Reeder & Brewer, 1979).
These differences in how people assess positive versus negative information about competence and integrity offer a critical foundation for
understanding why trustees may be more or less
capable of repairing trust through claims of future redemption. In particular, the notion that
people tend to weigh positive information about
competence more heavily than negative information about competence suggests that when
trust violations concern matters of competence,
trustees’ signals that their limitations will be
addressed (i.e., positive competence information) may be sufficient to allay concerns about
their guilt (i.e., negative competence information). In contrast, the notion that people weigh
negative information about integrity more
heavily than positive information about integrity suggests that when trust violations concern
matters of integrity, concerns about trustees’
prior guilt (i.e., negative integrity information)
will outweigh trustees’ signals that those limitations will be addressed (i.e., positive integrity
information). Thus, recent studies have shown
that apologies, efforts to assume full blame with
an internal attribution, and voluntary substantive actions such as penance and regulation (all
of which convey positive information that these
problems will be fixed) tend to repair trust more
effectively when the transgression is attributed
to matters of competence rather than integrity
(Dirks, Kim, Cooper, & Ferrin, 2005; Ferrin et al.,
2007; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2004).
These results were also observed despite the
fact that within each study the actual trust violation was the same; each was simply framed as
a competence- or integrity-related matter. This
observation highlights the notion that the underlying bases for trust violations can be ambiguous and possibly even involve elements of both
competence and integrity. Therefore, trustees
and trustors may each attempt to influence this
framing (i.e., with trustees advocating attributions of competence and trustors advocating attributions of integrity) to support their competing views about whether greater trust in the
trustee is deserved.
Overall, then, these findings highlight an opportunity to repair trust through responses that
directly address concerns about the extent to
which the underlying problems may be cor-

<-----Page 12----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

rected in the future. Trustees may apologize and
may do so by making an internal (dispositional)
rather than external (situational) attribution,
may voluntarily institute substantive measures
to address concerns about future transgressions,
may strengthen these efforts by framing the
transgression as a matter of competence, or may
engage in other (as yet unexamined) endeavors
to convince trustors that they will be trustworthy
in the future, whereas trustors may attempt to
frame the transgression as a matter of integrity
or may implement a range of other as yet neglected measures to resist such trustee efforts
and maintain lower expectations of trustee redemption. Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) therefore reveals how the degree of trust repair may depend
on the extent to which trustees’ efforts to promote the belief that they will redeem themselves for the future outweigh their trustors’ efforts to uphold the belief that such redemption
will not occur.
Thus, we can observe that each of these three
levels represents a distinct means of trust repair. Each level identifies a discrete set of opposing forces and provides the basis for a distinct stream of empirical research, yet each also
builds cumulatively on the others. In this way
these levels may be likened to the discrete yet
complementary elements of some of the most
prominent conceptualizations in our field (e.g.,
the outcome value and outcome alternatives dimensions described in power-dependence theory [Emerson, 1962; Kim & Fragale, 2005; Kim,
Pinkley, & Fragale, 2005b] or the integrative and
distributive dimensions that provide the conceptual underpinnings of negotiation research [Kim
et al., 2003; Lax & Sebinius, 1986; Neale & Northcraft, 1991]). As with those other areas of inquiry,
the proposed multilevel conceptualization can
provide the foundation for extensive elaborative
research. Thus, to guide such efforts, we identify
three overarching theoretical implications that
can serve as guiding principles—“positive heuristics” in the terminology of Lakatos (1978)—for
pursuing this future work.
Theoretical Implications
Consolidation and broadening of research on
trust repair tactics. One implication of the
present analysis is that it provides a basis not
only for understanding the implications of previously studied trust repair tactics but also for

413

assessing the potential implications of tactics
that have yet to be explored. These opportunities arise from recognizing that these tactics are
important not in and of themselves but, rather,
because of how they affect the relative strength
of parties’ competing beliefs with regard to the
three levels of the bilateral trust repair model.
Hence, this framework offers the opportunity to
consolidate a wide array of research, account for
how previously studied tactics would relate to
one another (i.e., by classifying them according
to the level at which they would operate and
whether they would bolster the relative strength
of the trustee’s or trustor’s beliefs), and then
explore how a much broader range (and myriad
variations) of such initiatives may achieve similar ends.
What would be the impact on beliefs about
innocence or guilt, for example, of trustees or
trustors soliciting the support of neutral third
parties via direct appeals, publicity, or rumor?
How would variations of different types of apologies (e.g., the different types of apologies described by Schlenker & Darby, 1981) influence
the relative strength of beliefs about whether
the trustees’ personal shortcomings would be
addressed? Could, as Schweitzer et al. (2006)
have speculated, such tactical variations help
explain why apologies have been found to repair trust in some studies but not their own? And
how might such effects also depend on the expression of specific emotions? These sorts of inquiries could contribute not only by revealing
these potential techniques (e.g., verbal, tangible,
cognitive, emotional, individual, collective) but
also by assessing their psychological implications (i.e., the relative impact of each technique on
the focal belief and how this may depend on the
way it is pursued) and, even further, by assessing
their additive and interactive effects (e.g., the effect of an apology on its own compared to an
apology plus substantive repentance).
Indeed, by guiding these efforts, we hope our
analysis will also begin to rectify the conspicuous lack of attention the trust repair literature
has paid to the tactics trustors might employ. As
is the case with trustee tactics, the three levels
of the bilateral trust repair model provide the
basis for understanding what issues need to be
addressed and allow for a broad range of trustor
influences on these considerations. Furthermore, we may help guide the process of identifying these trustor influences by drawing on in-

<-----Page 13----->414

Academy of Management Review

sights from the expectancy literature. This
literature is based on the notion that we can
create our own social reality by influencing the
behaviors we observe in others such that we
may induce them to confirm even our erroneous
expectations if we behave in a manner consistent with those beliefs—a phenomenon commonly known as the self-fulfilling prophecy
(Jones, 1986). Hence, studies in this domain have
identified at least three mechanisms that may
inform research on trustor tactics.
First, research indicates that perceiver expectancies may be confirmed when perceivers act in
ways that reduce targets’ opportunities to exhibit disconfirming behavior (Rothbart, 1981).
This suggests that trustors may impede trust
repair by constraining their trustees in a manner that would restrict trustees’ ability to offer
exculpating evidence (Level 1: innocent 7
guilty), highlight the significance of situational
influences (Level 2: situation 7 person), or demonstrate how their trust-inhibiting limitations
would be fixed (Level 3: fixable 7 fixed)—for
example, by denying trustees the chance to respond to an allegation, giving trustees insufficient time to explain their side of the story, or
cutting off all subsequent contact with trustees.
Second, studies have shown that perceivers
may encode or interpret targets’ behavior in a
way that confirms perceivers’ expectations (Darley & Fazio, 1980; Strenta & Kleck, 1984). Hence,
trustors may maintain their beliefs in their trustees’ untrustworthiness by construing trustees’ repair efforts in a way that would discount information offered to support trustees’ innocence (Level 1:
innocent 7 guilty), the influence of situational
forces (Level 2: situation 7 person), or the possibility that trustees’ limitations would be fixed
(Level 3: fixable 7 fixed)—for example, by ignoring this information, questioning its significance,
or identifying countervailing information.
Third, evidence reveals that perceiver expectations are more likely to be confirmed when
there are greater anticipated costs and/or fewer
anticipated benefits from modifying perceivers’
beliefs (Zanna & Pack, 1975). This finding is consistent with research on false confessions (as
mentioned with regard to Level 1: innocent 7
guilty) in which scholars observed that suspects
were more likely to confess to a crime they did
not commit when they were given offers of sympathy, tolerance, face-saving excuses, and
moral justifications for those alleged offenses

July

(Kassin & McNall, 1991). And, more broadly, it
suggests that trustors may affect trust repair by
altering the balance of costs and benefits trustees associate with attempts to repair trust at
any given level of the bilateral trust repair model—for example, by expressing stronger emotions to bolster the power of their accusation, by
signaling the kinds of responses they would be
more or less willing to accept, or by threatening
greater repercussions if certain points of contention are not confirmed.
Beyond individual tactics: Relational determinants of success. Second, by emphasizing the
active roles that trustees and trustors play in the
trust repair process, the negotiation of identity
that underlies each level of the bilateral trust
repair model can reconcile why even the exact
same trust repair effort may repair trust in some
cases but not others. Closer scrutiny of the identity negotiation perspective suggests that even
if trustees initiate trust repair tactics that exert a
strong influence on a given level of trust repair,
their ultimate implications for trust will depend
on the tactics trustors implement as well. Indeed, this notion may be portrayed via the same
2 (trustee influence: strong versus weak) ⫻ 2
(trustor influence: strong versus weak) matrix,
regardless of the level of trust repair pursued
(see Figure 1).
This depiction reveals that whereas powerful
efforts by the trustee (e.g., a fervent denial) may
achieve some degree of trust repair if the trustor’s efforts are weak (e.g., minimal or no response), these same trustee efforts may do little
to repair trust if the trustor’s efforts are strong
(e.g., a strident accusation), and instead may
produce some form of “forceful confrontation.”
Alternatively, whereas weak trust repair efforts
by the trustee (e.g., a half-hearted denial) and
strong opposing efforts by the trustor (e.g., providing evidence of guilt) may result in a form of
“mistrust confirmation,” whereby trustees come
to believe that they are untrustworthy and even
confirm this expectation with their behavior,
weak efforts by both the trustee and trustor (e.g.,
with neither attempting to assert or substantiate
their beliefs) may result in the persistence of
mistrust through a lower-energy stalemate than
that described by forceful confrontation, an outcome more akin to “avoidance.”
Such interactions highlight the importance of
considering the active role played by the trustor,
in addition to the trustee, in determining the

<-----Page 14----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

likelihood of trust repair (and, by doing so, may
help explain inconsistencies in the efficacy of
any given trust repair tactic). They also reveal
the potential value of investigating factors that
could affect the strength of each party’s efforts
(e.g., whether trustors who are motivated to trust
their trustees [Weber et al., 2005] would exert
weaker efforts to resist trustees’ repair efforts
and become more likely to embrace them than
trustors who lack such motivations). Furthermore, they illustrate the need for research to
move beyond the basic question of whether trust
has been repaired to give the three alternative
outcomes more meaningful attention.
Beyond a silo approach: Multilevel considerations. Finally, this multilevel analysis reveals
how a thorough account of trust repair must do
more than simply focus on one or another of
these levels (i.e., the implicit approach of prior
research), since each provides an incomplete
portrayal of what may ultimately transpire. Instead, the bilateral trust repair model highlights
the need to investigate the various conditions
under which these different levels should be
pursued, and the need to provide an account of
the dynamic process of shifting across levels.
On a practical basis, this recognition may be
crucial to the extent that at least some of each
level’s associated trust repair efforts can affect,
or even preclude, the use of others.4 Moreover,
on a conceptual basis, it allows us to assess how
the interpersonal context may influence the relative effectiveness of these three levels for trust
repair (and, hence, explain why even if a trustee
implements a highly influential tactic, and this
tactic is stronger than that of the trustor, it may
still fail to repair trust if the tactic operates on a
level that, owing to these contextual influences,
becomes less significant than others). Given the
potential range of such contextual influences,
their full account falls beyond the scope of the

4
Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) and Level 2 (situation 7
person), for example, represent mutually exclusive options
in the sense that a trustee cannot logically deny having
committed a transgression and also explain that situational
forces induced that commission. Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) can
operate in an additive manner with Level 2 (situation 7
person)—for example, the trustee can explain that situational forces encouraged the transgression while apologizing for the act. Finally, Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) is incompatible with Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) in the sense that a
trustee cannot logically deny having committed the transgression and also apologize for committing it.

present work. Thus, below we attempt simply to
illustrate such possibilities with an example of
how power, which has been identified as a key
determinant of the negotiation of identities (Snyder & Stukas, 1999), may affect these decisions.
Power has been broadly defined as the probability that a person can carry out his or her own
will despite resistance (Weber, 1947). Research
on power has identified a wide range of factors
that may affect its construal (see Kim et al., 2005,
for a review), including the value of benefits
from a given relationship and the value of alternatives to that relationship (Emerson, 1962), as
well as a party’s expertise, legitimacy, likability, ability to reward or punish (French & Raven,
1959), and even network centrality (Brass, 1992).
However, with regard to the negotiation of identity
underlying trust repair, this illustrative analysis is
concerned with how, after being determined by
such features of the interpersonal context, the
power of one party may affect the other and
through these means influence how the repair of
trust may most effectively be pursued.
One such implication is that as a party’s
power in a relationship grows, so too should its
ability to affect the relationship partner’s perceptions. Less powerful parties have been observed to be more dependent on the benefits
from their relationships than their more powerful counterparts and, hence, more responsive to
their partners’ cues—presumably, to minimize
negative outcomes from those with power over
their fates (Geiss, 1993). Thus, targets have been
found to confirm their perceivers’ perceptions
when these perceivers had the power to control
targets’ outcomes, whereas when targets had
power to control perceivers’ outcomes, such confirmation did not occur (Copeland, 1994). These
considerations, therefore, highlight the potential influence of power on trust repair by suggesting that the extent to which trustees can
directly challenge trustors’ beliefs about the
trustees’ guilt (i.e., through Level 1: innocent 7
guilty) should increase as their power relative to
the power of their trustors grows.
The fundamental nature of power as the probability that a person can carry out his or her own
will despite resistance, however, also suggests
that those possessing it may face difficulty convincing others that their transgressions were
somehow induced by the situation. Evidence reveals that people are generally inclined to ascribe control and responsibility for important

<-----Page 15----->416

Academy of Management Review

but causally indeterminant outcomes to those in
positions of power (Meindl, Ehrlich, & Dukerich,
1985). Hence, perceivers have been found to
place greater blame on their targets, rather than
the situation, when targets’ power is high rather
than low (Overbeck, Tiedens, & Brion, 2006).
Thus, these findings highlight the importance of
power for efforts to repair trust through the mitigation of trustees’ blame by suggesting that the
ability of trustees to do so (i.e., through Level 2:
situation 7 person) should decrease as their
power relative to that of their trustors grows.
Moreover, with such increases in trustee
power, their transgressions may increasingly be
seen by trustors to arise from a lack of integrity
rather than a lack of competence. Lord Acton’s
well-known adage that “power tends to corrupt
and absolute power corrupts absolutely” underscores the widely held suspicion that the powerful are inclined to act in self-serving ways.
And though such tendencies are not without exception (Chen, Lee-Chai, & Bargh, 2001), a substantial body of evidence has supported the propensity of powerholders to further enrich
themselves at the expense of others. Individuals
with a relative advantage in power have been
found, for example, to extract a greater share of
benefits from their interactions than their less
powerful counterparts, to devalue the ability
and worth of the less powerful, and even to view
the less powerful as objects of manipulation
(Georgesen & Harris, 1998; Kim, 1997; Kim & Fragale, 2005; Kipnis, 1972). Thus, to the extent that
trustors are aware of such inclinations, they
should be particularly disposed to attribute the
transgressions of high-power trustees to a lack
of integrity (Fragale, Rosen, Xu, & Merideth,
2009), as opposed to a lack of competence, and
such attributions of low integrity should be particularly difficult to overcome with signals that
their integrity will improve in the future (Ferrin
et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2004).
These notions, accordingly, highlight the importance of power for trustees’ efforts to repair trust
by suggesting that their limitations will be corrected in the future (i.e., through Level 3: fixable 7
fixed), since the efficacy of this approach should
decrease as their power relative to that of their
trustors grows.
Thus, we can observe that the implications of
power for the repair of trust are not necessarily
beneficial. Whereas the viability of trust repair
through Level 1 (innocent 7 guilty) should in-

July

crease, its viability through Level 2 (situation 7
person) and Level 3 (fixable 7 fixed) should
decrease as the power of trustees relative to that
of their trustors grows. We might therefore expect that to the extent trustees possess greater
power than their trustors, the trustees should
repair trust more successfully by directly challenging trustors’ belief that the trustees are
guilty of the transgression than through any of
the other levels of trust repair (i.e., by making
situational attributions or by claiming that
these problems will be fixed). This reasoning
also implies, perhaps counterintuitively, that
since trustees possess less power relative to that
of their trustors, they should have more success
at repairing trust via Levels 2 and 3 but not Level
1. Such possibilities, along with many others
that have yet to be explored, highlight the need
to consider the interpersonal context and its
likely effects on all three levels before we can
determine how the repair of trust would most
likely occur.
CONCLUSION
The purpose of this paper was to elucidate a
research program on trust repair by examining
the cognitive and interpersonal processes
through which people attribute dispositions to
others. Although the matter of trust repair has
drawn increasing scientific attention, the field
has lacked an adequate theoretical account of
why certain repair efforts are more likely to succeed than others. Thus, we have sought to consolidate these prior efforts, reconcile their apparent discrepancies, and provide a rigorous
foundation on which future research could be
based. Through these endeavors we have developed a multilevel model of the dynamic bilateral process through which the repair of trust
may be pursued and then identified several
overarching theoretical implications to guide future research.
The cumulative nature of these levels should
not be overlooked. Although each offers additional explanatory power, this is achieved by
building onto, rather than challenging, the key
insights of the others. Indeed, every one of these
levels can provide the basis for a distinct set of
research questions. Level 1’s depiction of trust
repair as a function of efforts by trustors and
trustees to directly oppose their counterpart’s
beliefs about the trustees’ guilt/innocence sug-

<-----Page 16----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

gests a range of opportunities to investigate
what may affect the relative strength of these
competing forces. Level 2’s elaboration concerning how the repair of trust might unfold not only
through direct opposition but also through deflection (i.e., of the blame that might otherwise
be placed on a trustee) highlights an entirely
distinct set of inquiries researchers might pursue to explore what would facilitate or impair
such deflection efforts. Finally, Level 3⬘s intertemporal elaboration, which reveals how trust
may be repaired by acknowledging one’s blame
but then claiming that these problems can be
corrected, reveals the trade-offs involved in
many trust repair responses (i.e., due to their
focus on one’s prior blame versus potential redemption) and, hence, raises a third set of questions that researchers might explore.
Moreover, we can observe that this multilevel
portrayal offers the basis for addressing several
critical limitations in this field (as described in
the introduction). First, regarding the lack of
conceptual coherence in the trust repair literature, this depiction allows us to consolidate a
wide array of research, account for how previously studied tactics would relate to one another
(i.e., by classifying them according to the level
at which they would operate and whether they
would bolster the relative strength of the trustee’s or trustor’s beliefs; see Figure 2), and then
proceed to explore how a much broader range
(and myriad variations) of such initiatives may
achieve such ends. Second, in response to this
nascent literature’s tendency to treat trustors
simply as passive observers, the present conceptualization highlights the active roles trustors can play in the trust repair process, reveals
how little we know about the specific tactics
these trustors might implement, and underscores how the efforts of both trustees and trustors must be considered to determine whether
(and the extent to which) the repair of trust
would occur (see Figure 1). Finally, this analysis
provides the basis for resolving the troublesome
inconsistencies that have begun to appear in
the literature by revealing how such contradictions can be reconciled by (1) considering the
myriad ways in which these parties might implement a given tactic (see “Consolidation and
broadening of research on trust repair tactics”),
(2) revealing how the exact same tactic can either succeed or fail depending on the strength of
the trustor’s efforts (see Figure 1), and (3) illus-

417

trating the potential for the interpersonal context to affect the relative importance of the model’s levels for trust repair (i.e., such that the
implementation of an otherwise influential tactic may fail to repair trust if it operates on a level
that, because of these contextual influences, becomes less viable than others).
Limitations and Future Directions
Having proposed this research program, we
must also acknowledge that it remains far from
complete. First, although attributions of competence and integrity have been identified as two
of the most important dimensions of trust, researchers have identified benevolence as another important antecedent (e.g., McAllister,
1995). Therefore, it would be useful to consider
whether attributing a trust violation to a lack of
benevolence rather than a lack of competence or
integrity (as discussed with regard to Level 3:
fixable 7 fixed) would produce meaningful differences for trust repair.5 With regard to this
issue, one study suggests that when people
evaluate matters of benevolence, they do not
exhibit the kinds of asymmetries we discussed
with regard to matters of competence or integrity and, hence, neither weigh negative information about benevolence as heavily as negative
information about integrity nor weigh positive
information about benevolence as heavily as
positive information about competence (Trafimow & Trafimow, 1999). If so, we might expect
that benevolence attributions would fall somewhere between those of competence and integrity with regard to determining whether the
trust-inhibiting qualities of the trustee were ultimately deemed to be fixable versus fixed.
Second, it is important to recognize that most
of the trust repair studies reported in this paper

5

The neglect of benevolence attributions in the trust repair literature may be given a number of speculative explanations, including (1) the incipient nature of this literature
(e.g., even research on the implications of competence and
integrity attributions for trust repair has itself only just begun), (2) the literature’s focus thus far on newly formed relationships, which may not offer an optimal context for benevolence attributions to play a role, and (3) the lack of a
substantive theoretical basis for considering how benevolence attributions compare to attributions of competence
and integrity for trust repair (although we attempt to remedy
this issue by leveraging the research of Trafimow and Trafimow [1999]).

<-----Page 17----->418

have focused on newly formed relationships.
Thus, research is needed to assess whether the
present reasoning will generalize to relationships of longer duration. This does not imply
that the present analysis should be dismissed,
since this research program’s various theoretical underpinnings (e.g., identity negotiation, interpersonal perception, and attribution theory)
have, themselves, been validated with longerterm relationships. Moreover, it is essential to
note that our organizational relationships can
often be quite impersonal in nature. Network
research, for example, has repeatedly emphasized that organizational members possess far
more weak ties—that is, with relative strangers—than strong ties—that is, with those with
whom they have close personal relationships
(e.g., Granovetter, 1995). Additionally, research
on fault lines provides the basis for expecting
that it is far more likely that trust will be violated in relationships of shorter rather than
longer duration, because parties in newly
formed relationships are less likely to have had
the opportunity to develop mutual understandings (e.g., Swann, Milton, & Polzer, 2000). Therefore, although the extent to which one can
generalize research on newly formed (or impersonal) relationships to relationships of longer
duration remains a concern, the present conceptualization represents a useful starting point for
research on trust repair that, like many theories
in the organizational sciences, simply requires
further testing and elaboration.
Third, our focus on broader mechanisms has
entailed our overlooking potentially meaningful
individual differences that might provide insight into the likely outcomes of various trust
repair efforts (e.g., whether some of us are simply more willing to accept apologies than others). Moreover, other than noting the need to
explore how different emotions may affect the
strength of trustors’ and trustees’ beliefs, our
cognitive focus has led us to pay little attention
to the potentially critical role that emotions can
play in trust decisions (Dunn & Schweitzer, 2005)
and, hence, the implications of affect for trust
repair. Finally, this analysis has not examined
the influence of a broader array of situational
factors that may affect the importance of these
three levels, such as the nature of parties’ relationships or the effects of national or organizational culture.

Broader Implications
Despite these limitations, we hope this conceptual framework will provide a useful starting
point for pursuing a wide array of new research
questions, practitioner-oriented decisions, and
subsequent conceptual elaborations. One key
implication that has been underscored by this
work is the potential for trustors to play a far
more active role in the trust repair process than
prior research has described. Indeed, the opportunities for trustors not only to respond to their
trustees’ trust repair efforts but also to implement various efforts on their own (to support
their beliefs regarding their trustees’ untrustworthiness, or even dispel them when sufficiently motivated to preserve the relationship)
illustrate the vital need to account for the initiatives of both trustees and trustors in any analysis of trust repair.
A second implication is that by revealing the
potential for the interpersonal context to affect
the viability of its three levels, this framework
highlights the need to broaden our attention beyond the efforts of trustees and trustors to consider
how the larger context may affect the likelihood of
trust repair. Until now, these contextual influences
have been almost entirely ignored by the literature, since it has focused on gauging the effects
of specific trust repair efforts for largely undifferentiated actors. However, to the extent that
various aspects of the context can significantly
bolster, diminish, or even reverse the effects of
such responses, they may ultimately deserve as
much attention as the specific tactics parties
employ.
Third, we must acknowledge the potential for
these insights to be used for both good and ill.
Those who wish to repair trust may certainly
offer the best response at their disposal based
on an honest assessment of the facts. However,
some individuals may choose instead to ignore
the truth in favor of supplying a response based
simply on its efficacy. Thus, we encourage researchers and practitioners alike to explore this
domain with caution, moral fortitude, and sensitivity. Despite this concern, researchers must
recognize that temptations to repair trust inappropriately exist regardless of whether we know
much about the process or not. With such knowledge, each side (both trustor and “potentially”
unethical trustee) should be better able to make
informed decisions in this escalating “arms

<-----Page 18----->2009

Kim, Dirks, and Cooper

race.” Therefore, given the choice, this option of
maximizing knowledge for both sides strikes us
as far more acceptable than that of sticking our
heads in the sand.
A final implication of this work is that it has
allowed us to integrate a seemingly disparate
set of findings from a wide array of literature
and to convey how these findings might form a
cohesive whole. It is in this sense that this research program responds to an often-levied criticism that research in organizational behavior
represents more of a garbage can of findings
than a body of knowledge that in any way
builds. As the present effort reveals, the potential for such accumulation in our field certainly
exists, the pursuit of which can help reconcile a
range of apparent contradictions. Thus, we hope
that future research efforts will take note of such
opportunities and, when possible, strive for such
convergence.
