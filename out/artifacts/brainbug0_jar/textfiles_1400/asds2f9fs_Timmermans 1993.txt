The Impact of Task Complexity on Information
Use in Multi-attribute Decision Making
DANIELLE TIMMERMANS
University ofieiden. The Netherlands

ABSTRACT
This study presents a process analysis of multi-attribute decision making. The
decision problems concerned the selection of the most suitable candidate for a
job opening. The problems varied in terms of complexity, i.e. the number of
candidates and the number of attributes used to describe these alternatives. Results
show that with an increasing number of alternatives, subjects ((V = 48) used fewer
attributes for the evaluation of alternatives, and made, on average, less references
to the alternatives. The type of judgment most often used was absolute dimensional
(comparison of an attribute to an absolute standard) and was used more often
at the beginning than toward the end of the decision process. Overall, judgments
were predominantly positive. The percentage of positive judgments decreased
with increasing complexity, and toward the end of the decision process. Significantly more judgments, particularly positive ones, concerned the finally chosen
alternative as compared to the rest of the alternatives. Finally, analysis of subjects'
usage of decision rules revealed thai increasing the number of alternatives resulted
in an increasing use of elimination strategies. Implications of these findings for
the design of decision aids will be discussed.
KEY WORDS Multi-attribute decisions

Task complexity

Protocol analysis

There is considerable literature on individual multi-attribute decision making (see Ford et ai, 1989
for a review). Most of this research focuses on the effects of task characteristics on multi-attribute
decision making. One of these task characteristics is complexity, often defined in terms of the number
of alternatives and/or the number of attributes on which the alternatives are evaluated. Process-tracing
studies show that increased task complexity generally leads to the use of simplifying, non-compensatory
decision strategies (e.g. Payne, 1976; Payne et ai, 1978; Olshavsky, 1979). People switch from a
one-stage compensatory strategy to a multi-stage strategy involving a non-compensatory screening
stage followed by a compensatory evaluation of the remaining alternatives. In the first stage, people
tend to eliminate alternatives immediately, thereby using only a limited amount of attribute information. Task complexity has also been found to affect the depth of information search and increased
task complexity tends to result in a smaller proportion of available information searched.
Ford et ai (1989) cite eleven studies in which task complexity was manipulated in terms of the
number of alternatives and of attributes. Only four of these studies (Biggs et ai, 1985; Olshavsky,
1979; Onken et ai, 1985; Payne, 1976) used protocol analysis as a process-tracing technique. Svenson
(1974) manipulated the number of alternatives. This study is one of the few in which the type of
judgments people make was analyzed more extensively. He found that the majority of judgments

in multi-attribute decision problems were absolute (i.e. comparisons with a criterion), while only
a third were comparative (i.e. mutual comparisons of two or more alternatives on a particular attribute). This tendency increased toward the end of the protocol. Van Raaij (1977) studied the decision
process of 50 subjects with the information board technique. His findings suggest that more interalternative or comparative evaluations were made in the first part of the decision process, and that
more intra-altemative or absolute evaluations were made in the second part.
In the study to be presented here, subjects were asked to solve a personnel selection problem.
Task complexity is operationalized in terms of the number of choice alternatives and the number
of attributes. The purpose of the process analysis is to investigate (I) how much information decision
makers use in solving decision problems differing in complexity (information selection), (2) how
decision makers use the information (type of judgment and evaluative sign), and (3) what kind of
decision rules are used. The major differences with earlier process-tracing research can be summarized
as follows. First, the way in which information is used and evaluated is analyzed more extensively
by including more coding categories to analyze decision processes. Previous research (e.g. Biggs
et al., 1985; Onken et al., 1985; Olshavsky, 1979; Payne, 1976) focused on depth of search and
decision rule used. In the present study additional categories are: (a) number of attributes used
and references made to each alternative as a function of its position in the final preference order;'
(b) standard of comparison (absolute versus comparative) in order to investigate how people evaluate
alternatives; and (c) evaluative sign of judgment (positive versus negative). Furthermore, the decision
process is divided into four time periods in order to investigate the decision-making process over
time. Finally, task complexity was varied on six levels, while most of the reported studies used
fewer levels.

METHOD
Subjects
Subjects were a subset (A^ = 48) of the subjects who participated in a larger experiment described
in Timmermans and Vlek (1992). All subjects were students at the University of Groningen and
were paid for their participation.

Independent variables and design
Each subject was asked to solve one decision problem. Half of the subjects solved a selection problem
concerning the appointment of an associate professor in finance and the remaining subjects were
asked to select a project manager in a marketing firm. Number of alternatives and number of attributes
were manipulated between subjects, resulting in a 2 (number of attributes) x 3 (number of alternatives)
between-subject design. Subjects solved one of the problems and the remaining decision problem
was solved with a decision aid; these results are reported elsewhere (see Timmermans, 1991; Timmermans and Vlek, in press).

Decision problems and problem complexity
The two personnel selection problems were formally similar. One concerned the selection of a candidate
for a job opening of an associate professor in finance and the other of a project manager in international
' A similar analysis was done by Montgomery and Svenson (1989). However, they did not vary problem complexity and
only used a decision problem consisting offive alternatives.

marketing research. Problem complexity was manipulated in terms of the number of alternatives
and attributes. The number of choice alternatives was three, six or nine and that of attribute was
five or twelve. Attributes used to describe the candidates for the associate professor in finance were:
schooling/education, age, research experience, knowledge of financial software, teaching experience,
consulting experience, flexibility, communicative skills, analytic acumen, organizational skills, social
skills and coping ability with stress. For the project manager the evaluative attributes were: schooling/
education, age, experience as a project manager, knowledge of modern languages, experience in
financial planning, knowledge of marketing research, communicative skills, leadership qualities, analytic acumen, organizational skills, social skills and coping ability with stress. After the experiment
subjects evaluated the problems as realistic (for both problems, means are 5.8 on a 7-point scale
between 'not at all realistic' (1) and 'very realistic' (7)) and as equally difficult (for both problems
means are 4.8 on a 7-point scale ranging from 'very easy' (1) to 'very difficult' (7)). The candidates
were designed in such a way that there were no dominated alternatives. Each decision problem
consisted of a description of a job opening and a short (five attributes) or longer (twelve attributes)
description of each of the three, six or nine candidates.

Procedure
After a brief introduction explaining the purpose of the study, subjects were made familiar with
the think-aloud technique and were given a training session on a decision problem which was formally
similar to those used in the experiment, but which dealt with another issue (choosing a place to
live). Subjects were asked to read the decision problem and to say anything that came to mind
with reference to the decision problem. If a subject was hesitant or if there was a long silence,
the experimenter encouraged him or her to continue ('What are you thinking now?'). If a subject
did not understand the procedure, it was explained again. Once subjects were familiar with the
procedure, they were asked to read the description of the job opening and the candidates. Next,
subjects filled in a questionnaire in which they were asked to indicate their first impression of the
candidates by rating them on a 10-point scale with 10 as the highest score.' Then they were asked
to think aloud while evaluating all the job candidates and selecting the best candidate. Subjects
sat alone in a room while thinking aloud and their responses were recorded. Once during the session,
the experimenter returned to the room to check if the subject was making satisfactory progress.
After subjects had finished their task they were asked to fill in a final questionnaire concerning
the decision process. Results of the questionnaires are reported in Timmermans and Vlek (in press).
Coding the protocol
•:
The responses of the think-aloud procedure were recorded and transcribed. Each protocol was subdivided into segments consisting of one statement about an alternative or an attribute and these
were categorized by two independent judges. The inter-rater agreement was high; overall, 91% of
all codings made by the two coders were identical. The categorization of the responses is based
on earlier research (e.g. Payne 1976; Svenson, 1974). The analyses focus on: (1) the selection of
information, (2) the use of information, and (3) the choice itself. The percentage of the total amount
of available information which is used provides information about the selection of information. For
' Subjects were asked for this first evaluation in order to determine the change of preference as a result of using a decision
aid versus using no decision aid (for results see Timmermans and Vlek, in press). They were also asked if they already
had a clear preference. If they did not, they were not required to specify their preference. Furthermore, subjects were allowed
to give similar ratings to candidates, and were nor asked to give a preference order of candidates. All ratings were based
on the^r5( impression of candidates after reading the decision problem once.

the use of information we distinguished: attribute versus alternative evaluation. In attribute (or dimensional) evaluation, the alternatives are evaluated on specific attributes. In alternative (or holistic)
evaluation, the alternative as a whole is evaluated. A second distinction refers to the standard of
comparison. In absolute judgments the alternative is compared with a criterion, which may be implicit
or explicit. In comparative judgments one or more alternatives are compared with each other. In
addition, the evaluative sign of judgments was coded as positive, negative or neutral. Factual statements were coded as neutral. Summarizing, the following categories were used in the coding of
the protocols:
^., .
• Absolute holistic Judgments: absolute judgments about the alternative as a whole, e.g. 'X is a
very good candidate';
• Absolute dimensional judgments: absolute judgments about an aspect of a candidate, e.g. 'Y's
social skills are not very good';
• Comparative holistic judgments: comparative judgments about candidates as a whole, e.g. 'X
is a better candidate than Y';
• Comparative dimensional judgments: comparative judgments about a specific aspect, e.g. 'X's
work experience is much better than Y's work experience';
• Positive judgments: e.g. ^X is a good candidate', 'Y has a good educational background';
• Negative judgments: e.g. 'Y's social skills are poor';
• Neutral judgments (or factual statements): statements which refer to an alternative or an aspect
of an alternative without an explicit evaluative connotation, e.g. 'Y has worked 10 years as
a project manager'.
For comparative judgments such as 'X has a better education than Y' the coding of the evaluative
sign was positive for the candidate judged as better, and negative for the candidate judged as worse.
The same applies to comparative dimensional and comparative holistic statements. These statements
were also coded for all alternatives to which the comparative statement refers. Each protocol was
divided into four parts containing an equal number of statements in order to study the decision-making
process over time. Thus for each subject the total number of statements was divided in to four
parts each containing one quarter of the total number of statements. The decision strategies subjects
used were coded as follows:
• Additive compensatory rule: each alternative is evaluated on all attributes, each attribute is
weighted, and the overall evaluation of each alternative is calculated by the sum of the weighted
utilities of all attributes. This rule was categorized as such when subjects clearly combined positive
and negative aspects for all candidates and subsequently chose the best candidate without eliminating alternatives during the decision process.
• Lexicographic rule: alternatives are compared in terms of the most important attribute, the alternative with the highest score is selected; when two or more alternatives have equal scores, these
alternatives are evaluated on the second most important attribute, etc. until one alternative
remains. Responses were coded in this category when subjects clearly indicated that the decision
was made by comparing job candidates on the most important attribute: e.g. 'At this moment
. . . I think the fourth candidate's expertise is more extensive than that of the others and for
this reason I think he is the best candidate . . . ' ; ' . . . ! based my choice primarily on . . . '
• Conjunctive rule: the decision maker specifies a cut-off value for each attribute; if an alternative
IS worse than the cut-off value for a specific attribute, the alternative is eliminated; the elimination
of alternatives proceeds until only one alternative remains. Responses were categorized as 'conjunctive' when subjects explicitly eliminated alternatives because of insufficient scores on a specific

attribute. For instance: *Eh . . . candidate 9 drops out, for that matter . . . candidate 5 also drops
out, because he is surly, and has not much to offer ... Eh, let's see ... Candidates 2, 3, 4,
7. All four have a college education ... supervising research . . . Eh, candidate 7 has no experience.
Candidate 7 drops out because of this . . . Candidate 2 drops out . . . That leaves candidates
3 and 4 ... candidate 3 drops o u t . . . that leaves candidate 4.'
• A combination of these rules. The remaining two strategies were a combination of a conjunctive
and an additive-compensatory rule and a conjunctive and a lexicographic rule. 'Candidate 6
... has the right education... I don't know much about... financial experience... Thus, candidate
6 is not suitable... Candidates 5 and 7, they are suitable candidates. They have the right experience,
but I still think candidate 8 is better because of his organizational skills . . . ' (conjunctive and
lexicographic rule).
The coding of decision rules turned out to be more difficult than coding the previously mentioned
categories. More discussion was needed to come to a satisfactory level of agreement. After omitting
two uncodable protocols, interrater agreement was 92%.
For the analysis of the protocols, the categories were summarized on a form consisting of an
alternatives by attributes matrix. On the basis of the coded protocol segments, the two judges were
able to indicate what type of judgment was made about each alternative. For each subject we assessed:
(1) Selection of information:

,

• The average total number of attributes used for evaluating each alternative;
• The average total number of judgments made about each alternative (i.e. the number of times
subjects referred to each alternative); this is considered to be a measure of attention paid to
an alternative;
• The total number of attributes used and references made to an alternative as a function of
its position in the final preference order in order to measure the differences in attention to alternatives;
.i .'..if-

(2) Use of information: type of judgment and evaluative sign:
• The average percentage oi absolute and comparative holistic judgments per alternative as a function
of problem complexity and for each of the four time periods;
• The average percentage of absolute and comparative dimensional judgments per alternative as
a function of problem complexity and for each of the four time periods;
• The average number of absolute and comparative holistic and dimensional judgments about
an alternative as a function of \X.& position in the final preference order,
• The average percentage ot positive, negative and neutral judgments per alternative as a function
of problem complexity in each of the four time periods;
• The average number of positive, negative and neutral judgments about each alternative as a
function of itsposition in the final preference order,
(3) Decision rules used:
These were coded for the protocol as a whole (i.e. not in four segments): the additive compensatory
rule, the lexicographic rule, the conjunctive rule, the conjunctive and additive compensatory rule,
and the conjunctive and lexicographic rule.
Six protocols were incomplete (i.e. evaluations of only the chosen alternative were given) and
were omitted from the protocol analysis. Three of these concerned problems with six alternatives

(two with five attributes and one with twelve attributes) and three protocols were on problems with
nine alternatives (one with five attributes and two with twelve attributes).

RESULTS
Results are presented in three sections in accordance with the three phases in decision making, i.e.
selection of information, use of information and decision rule used. For all categories an analysis
of variance was conducted for number of alternatives and number of attributes as independent variables for 42 subjects.^

Selection of information
Number of attributes
First, the total number of attributes used and the average number of attributes used per alternative
were assessed. An increase in problem complexity was expected to lead to a decrease in attributes
used per alternative.
Results show a main effect for number of alternatives as well as for number of attributes (F(2,39)
= 16.54, ;?< O.OOI and F(l,40) = 10.93, ;7<O.O5, respectively), indicating that more information
was used with an increasing number of alternatives and/or attributes (see Exhibit I).

(orthogonal contrasts).

However, this increase in the amount of information used was smaller than that of the total amount
of available information. An increase in the number of alternatives resulted in a decrease in the
average number of attributes used per alternative (main effect F(2,29) = 3.82, p < 0.05). Means are
5.1, 3.8 and 3.9 for the three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems, respectively (62.5%, 52.1% and
49.6% of the available information).
The overall main effect for number of attributes (/"(1.40) = 17.01, /J < 0.001) indicates that for
the twelve attributes problem more information was used than for the five-attributes problems. This,
however, concerned a smaller percentage of the total available information. Means are 3.4 and 5.2,
respectively (68% and 4 3 % of the available information). The interaction effect is marginally significant
iF(2,39) = 2.50, p<OA), indicating that the decrease in information used as a function of the number
' T h e score distribution of the different types of Judgments approached normal distribution. Hence the use of parametric
statistics.

of alternatives was stronger for the twelve attributes problems. As Exhibit 1 shows, the decrease
in the use of available information occurred for the five-attributes problems when there were more
than six alternatives, and for the twelve-attributes problems when there were more than three alternatives.

Number of references made
Subjects often evaluated alternatives more than once on the same attribute. The number of times
subjects referred to an alternative (i.e. either a dimensional or a holistie judgment) is assumed to
be an indication of the amount of attention paid to that specific alternative. The number of references
made to a specific alternative was expected to decrease as problem complexity increased.
Effects of problem complexity are similar to those of the number of attributes used for evaluation.
This is shown in Exhibit 2. More references in absolute terms were made when the number of alternatives increased (main effect F(2,39) = 5.65, p < 0.01). With an increase in the number of alternatives,
however, the average number of references made to an alternative decreased (for the three-, sixand nine-alternatives problems, means are 11.7, 7.1 and 6.9, respectively), as indicated by a significant
main effect (F(2,39) = 7.13, / J < 0.001). There was a sharp decrease between the three- and sixalternatives problems but there was no significant difference between the five- and twelve-attributes
problems (8.2 versus 9.3).

Further analysis revealed that more attributes were used for the finally chosen alternative as compared
to the remaining alternatives (see Exhibit 3). For the three, six and nine alternatives the differences
are significant: /(15) = 2.53, /(12) = 2.93 and /(12) = 2.01,/?< 0.05, respectively, as indicated by
a pair-wise comparison of the most preferred alternative with the remaining alternatives.
Subjects also referred more often to the most preferred alternative as compared to the rest of
the alternatives (for the three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems: /(15) = 3.35, f(12) = 4.66 and
f(I2) = 4.47. all significant at the 0.01 level). No significant differences were found between the
non-chosen alternatives.
Use of information
The second stage of the decision process concerns the use of information. The following types of
judgments were categorized: (1) absolute and comparative holistic judgments; (2) absolute and comparative dimensional judgments; and (3) positive, negative and neutral judgments. The average total
number of statements per subject was 37 for the three-alternatives problems, 43 for the six-alternatives
problems and 79 for the nine-alternatives problems. On average, 4% of the statements referred to
the importance of an attribute. Overall, only a limited number of statements turned out to be uncodable
(less than 2.5% of the total number of statements). These statements either referred to the decisionmaking process (e.g. a comment like T h e choice between candidate X and candidate Y was extremely
difficult' or 'I think I have already made a selection') or to the information provided (e.g. 'I cannot
find this in the reports', or 'It is not clear to me in what kind of projects he was involved'). The
percentage of each type of judgment was computed for the different levels of problem complexity.
In each analysis the different categories add up to 100%. Results are given for the three, six and
nine-alternatives problems.
Type of judgment
As can be seen in Exhibit 4, the prevailing type of judgment was absolute dimensional. For three-,
six- and nine-alternatives problems the means are 69%, 73.2% and 75.4%, respectively. Differences
with all other categories (comparative dimensional and absolute and comparative holistic judgments)
are significant: ^41) = 8.78,/>< 0.001; /(41) = -14.08,/7< 0.001; t(4\) = -11.10,;? < 0.001. There
are no significant effects of the number of alternatives or the number of attributes. The next most
frequently used type ofjudgment was comparative dimensional. For the three-, six- and nine-alternatives
problems the percentages are 19.2%, 11.5% and 9.9%, respectively. The main effect for number of
alternatives is marginally significant (F(2,39) = 2.62. ;7=0.09), indicating a decrease in comparative
dimensional judgments with an increasing number of alternatives.
Holistic judgments about alternatives as a whole were made relatively infrequently. A total of
6.4% of the judgments were absolute holistic and 7.7% were comparative holistic. The percentage
of absolute holistic judgments increased as the number of alternatives increased, as indicated by
a marginally significant main effect F(2.39) = 2.70, p = 0.08. The test for a quadratic trend is
significant, F(l,40) = 5.09, p < 0.05, indicating a greater increase in the percentage of absolute judgments with increasing complexity. For the three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems the percentages
are 3.4%, 7.2% and 8.1%. The frequency of comparative holistic judgments did not vary as a function
of the number of alternatives. For the three-alternatives problems, more comparative dimensional

' Preference order was determined on the basis of the rating of all alternatives on a 10-point scale with 10 as the highest
score after the choice was made.

judgments were made than comparative holistic judgments (t(2) = - 2.19, /J < 0.05). and more comparative holistic judgments were made than absolute holistic judgments (/(2) = 1.94,/) =0.07).^

Type of judgment over time
Each protocol was divided into four equal parts irrespective of the total duration of the decision
process. As can be seen in Exhibit 4, there were no differences between the four time periods with
respect to the number of absolute holistic and comparative dimensional judgments. For comparative
holistic judgments, there was a significant increase after period 3 (period 3: 3.2% and period 4: 18.9%;
r(2) = 3.40, p<O.Q]), while at the same time the percentage of absolute dimensional judgments
decreased (period 3: 77.1% and period 4: 64.2%; t(2) = 2.27,/J < 0.05).

Type of judgment over time as a function of position inpreference order
In addition, type of judgment was related to the position in the final preference order. For reasons
of clarity, results will be presented for the two most preferred alternatives. As can be seen in Exhibit
5, the temporal changes of type of judgments as a function of position in the preference order is
different for the three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems. For the three-alternatives problems, there
is an increase in the number of absolute dimensional judgments over time for the most preferred
alternative, while at the same time the number of absolute dimensional judgments decreased for
the second most preferred alternative. This results in a marginally significant difference of absolute
dimensional judgments in the fourth period it(l5) = 1.96, p = 0.06; means are 3.0 versus 1.1).
The average number of comparative holistic judgments only increased over time for the most preferred
alternative (a significant difference between period 1 and 4 /(15) = 3.16, /XO.OI, means are 0.1
The relative frequencies of the different categories of judgments might be an artefact, because this could only reflect the
differences in the maximum number of statements possible for the different categories (see also Russo and Johnson, 1980).
For instance, when evaluating six alternatives the maximum number of possible absolute holistic judgments is six. and the
maximum number of possible comparative holistic judgments is fifteen (each alternative can be compared with each of the
other five alternatives). We calculated the maximum number of possible statements for each category as a percentage of
the total number of possible statements. Results show that subjects gave proportionally more absolute dimensional judgments
than could be expected on the basis of the maximum number of possible statements. The opposite is true for comparative
dimensional judgments. Thus, the results support the findings of the relative frequencies of the different categories of judgments.

versus 0.6). Thus, it seems that toward the end of the decision process subjects focused more on
the most preferred alternative, as indicated by the increasing number of absolute dimensional and
comparative holistic judgments. There are no significant differences over time for the absolute holistic
and comparative dimensional judgments.
For the six-alternatives problems the pattern is somewhat different. There was no linear increase
in absolute dimensional judgments over time for the most preferred alternative, and no significant
difference between the most and second most preferred alternative. For the number of absolute holistic
judgments there was a difference in period 4 between the most and second most preferred alternative
(/(14) = 2.45, p < 0.05; means are 0.5 versus 0.07). As was found in the three-alternatives problem,
there is a significant increase of comparative holistic judgments from period 3 to period 4 (means
are 0.08 and 0.46; /(12) = 2.13, p<0.05). Thus, although more attention was given to the most
preferred alternative toward the end of the decision process, this is mainly expressed in the number
of holistic judgments. There are no significant differences over time for the comparative dimensional
judgments.
For the nine-alternative problems, the pattern over time is quite different. In the first and fourth
periods the majority of absolute dimensional judgments concerned the most preferred alternative
(a significant difference with the second most preferred alternative t(\2) = 4.25, p < 0.001, and r(12)
= 2.28, p < 0.05). In the second and third periods significant less attention is given to the most
preferred alternative (a significant decrease after period I /(12) = 2.96, p < 0.05 and a nearly significant
increase after period 3 /(12) = —2.06, p = 0.06). Again, there is an increase in comparative holistic
judgments toward the end of the decision process for the most preferred alternative, resulting in
a nearly significant difference between periods 3 and 4/(12) = —2.36./? = 0.06).
Overall, results show an increase toward the end of comparative holistic judgments for the most
preferred alternative. The number of absolute dimensional judgments also increased toward the end.
but this happened at a later stage for the more complex problems as compared to the three-alternatives
problems.

Evaluative judgments
More than half of the judgments made were positive. As can be seen in Exhibit 6, the average percentages of positive judgments for the three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems are 55.0, 59.3 and
44.8, respectively. Analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect for number of alternatives
(F{2,39) = 3.24, p < 0.05); this is mainly due to the difference between the six- and nine-alternatives
problems. Overall, the percentage of positive judgments was also higher than the percentage of negative
judgments (/(41) = 8.83, p < 0.001) and higher than the percentage of neutral judgments (/(41) =
6.09,/j< 0.001).
Overall, 25% of the judgments were negative. Percentages were 21.0, 21.4 and 31.5 for the three-,
six- and nine-alternatives problems, respectively. There is a marginally significant effect for number
of alternatives (main effect F(2,39) = 2.85. p = 0.07); a test for a quadratic trend shows a significant
main effect F(I,40) = 6.33, p < 0.05), indicating an increasing number of negative judgments with
an increasing number of alternatives. Results indicate a higher percentage of negative judgments
made in the twelve-attributes problems as compared to the five-attribute problems (17.1% versus
32.4%; main effect/•(1,41) = 32.0,/? < 0.001).
Less than 25% of the judgments were neutral. There are no significant differences between the
three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems (means were 24.6%, 19.7% and 23.7%, respectively). There
is a marginally significant main effect for number of attributes (/1(1,41) = 3.16, p = 0.08), showing
that in the twelve-attributes problems fewer neutral judgments were made (28.3% versus 17.8%),
especially for the six- and nine-alternatives problems.

Evaluative judgments over time
The percentages of evaluative judgments over the four time periods were also calculated. As can
be seen in Exhibit 6. there is a decrease in positive judgments after period 3 (a marginally significant
difference between period 1, 58.8%. and 4, 47.3%, f(39) = 1.83. p = 0.07). There are no differences
in the percentages of neutral judgments between the four time periods. Furthermore, results show
an increase in negative judgments after period 1 (a nearly significant difference between period 1,
17.8%, and 2. 24.1%, f(39) = -1.80, /? < 0.08. and a significant difference between periods 1 and

Exhibit 6. Percentages of positive, negative and neutral judgments as a function of problem complexity and
time period.
Evaluative judgments over time as a function ofposition in the preference order
In addition, evaluative judgments were also analyzed over time as a function of position in the
final preference order. For reasons of clarity, results will be presented for the two most preferred
alternatives only. As can be seen in Exhibit 7, the evaluation over time of the most preferred alternatives
differs as a function of problem complexity. For the three-alternatives problems, there was an increase
in the number of/Jo.s//iVe judgments toward the end of the decision process, resulting in a significant
difference with the second most preferred alternative in period 4 (means are 3.0 versus 1.0, t{\5)
= 3.04, p < 0.01). The increase is significant between periods 1 and 4/(15) = 2.23, p < 0.05, means
are 1.7 versus 3.0. For the negative and neutral judgments there are no significant differences, neither
over time nor with the second most preferred alternative.
For the six-alternatives problems the pattern is somewhat different. There was an increase in the
number of poj/V/ve judgments for the most preferred alternative toward the end of the decision process,
resulting in a nearly significant difference with the second most preferred alternative in period 4
(means are 1.6 versus 0.6, /(12) = 1.8, /J = 0.08). In contrast to the three-alternatives problems
there is a difference in the number of negative judgments for the most and second most preferred
alternative in period 2 r(12) = -2.52, p < 0.05. means are 0.0 and 0.46).
For the nine-alternatives problems positive judgments for the most preferred alternative were mostly
given in the first and fourth periods. Results show a significant decrease after period 1, means are
3.3 and 0.7, /(12) = 3.16, p < 0.01. Furthermore, the number of positive judgments increased after
period 3, from 0.7 to 3.1, ^(12) = -2.29, ;? < 0.05. This resulted in a significant difference in the
number of positive judgments between the most and the second most preferred alternative in the
first as well as in the fourth period (/(12) = 3.65, /?< 0.001, and t(l2) 2.99, /XO.OOI). There are
no significant differences in negative and neutral judgments.
Overall, the pattern of evaluative judgments over time suggests that more attention is given to
the most preferred alternative toward the end of the decision process, as indicated by an increase
in thenumber of positive judgments for the most preferred alternative.

Decision rule
The third stage in the analysis of the verbal protocols concerns the way in which subjects came
to a decision, i.e. the kind of decision rule subjects used. The frequencies of the decision rules used
in the three-, six- and nine-alternatives problems are shown in Exhibit 8. In the three-alternatives

problems 79% of the subjects used an additive compensatory strategy and 21% of the subjects used
an elimination strategy (i.e. a conjunctive rule with or without another rule). In the six- and ninealternatives problems 31% and 77% of the subjects, respectively, used an elimination strategy, of
which 23% and 54% used a combination of a conjunctive and an additive-compensatory rule. The
higher percentage of subjects using an elimination strategy with an increasing number of alternatives
explains the lower percentage of information used, as well as the higher percentage of negative judgments. This increase in the use of an elimination strategy reflects the higher reported information
load with an increasing number of alternatives and attributes. Means are 3.4. 3.7 and 4.8 for the
three, six and nine alternatives. There is a main effect for number of alternatives f(2.93) = 13.12,
p < 0.001. indicating more information overload, for especially the nine-alternatives problems.

DISCUSSION
The present study shows that the selection, evaluation and integration of information are clearly
affected by the complexity of the problem. Results concerning information selection show that,
although the total amount of information processed increased with the number of alternatives, the
average number of attributes used per alternative decreased. Analysis of the number of attributes

used revealed a sharp decrease between six and nine alternatives when alternatives were described
on five attributes, and between three and six alternatives when alternatives were described on twelve
attributes. These results are in accordance with Payne's (1976) findings. This sharp decrease in the
number of attributes used with increasing problem complexity suggests information overload and
a change to a non-compensatory but more efficient decision rule. Another finding is that the alternative
which is finally chosen is evaluated more extensively on more attributes than the non-chosen alternatives. In addition, more references were made to the selected alternative as compared to the remaining
alternatives.
Further analysis of the decision process revealed that the evaluation of the information was most
often absolute (i.e. no comparisons were made between alternatives) and usually referred to a specific
aspect of an alternative and not to the alternative as a whole. Less than 15% of the judgments
compared two or more alternatives on a specific aspect. This roughly agrees with the findings obtained
by Svenson (1974). Increasing the number of alternatives reduced the tendency to compare alternatives
on a specific aspect (comparative dimensional judgments) and increased the tendency to evaluate
alternatives as a whole (absolute holistic judgments). This switch to a greater number of absolute
and holistic judgments seems to be an effect of information (over)load. Only toward the end of
the protocol did the subjects compare alternatives as a whole more often (see also Svenson, 1979).
This increase in comparative holistic judgments was most dominant for the most preferred alternative.
Analysis also shows an increase in absolute dimensional judgments toward the end of the decision
process for the most preferred alternative.
It would be interesting to interpret these findings in the context of the taxonomy of knowledge
about alternatives, as suggested by Russo and Johnson (1980). This taxonomy for consumers' knowledge about products uses inferential level as the central classifying concept. Russo and Johnson
described the level of inference as a continuum extending from basic, initial knowledge to the ultimate
goal state, i.e. the choice of the most preferred alternative. Higher-level knowledge needs to be inferred
from information at a lower level. Their taxonomy of statements has five levels from low to higher
levels of knowledge: (1) single-attribute evaluations, (2) single-attribute or alternative pair-wise comparison (or ranking); (3) whole-attribute or alternative evaluation; (4) whole-attribute or alternative
pair-wise comparison (or ranking); (5) statements about the best alternative. This categorization
roughly compares to that used in the present research, and the taxonomy can be interpreted as
follows: level (1), absolute dimensional judgments; level (2), comparative dimensional judgments;
level (3), absolute holistic judgments; level (4), comparative holistic judgments. The increase in the
number of absolute holistic judgments and the decrease of the percentage of comparative dimensional
judgments with increasing problem complexity might be explained by relying more on lower-level

<-----Page 14----->Danielle Timmermans

109

(i.e. absolute) knowledge as complexity increases. The increase in comparative holistic judgments
and the decrease in absolute dimensional judgments toward the end might be interpreted as relying
more on higher-level knowledge (i.e. comparative and holistic knowledge).
With respect to the evaluative sign of judgments, more than half of the judgments were positive
and only a quarter were negative. Other studies (e.g. Skowronski and Carlston, 1989) also found
that subjects generally make more positive judgments. However, the higher percentage of positive
judgments might partly be explained by the higher number of positive characteristics of candidates
as compared with negative characteristics. Candidates were 'constructed' in such a way that there
were no dominated alternatives and all candidates were potentially suitable. Increased complexity
was accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of positive and an increase in the percentage
of negative judgments. This tendency could be related to the use of a different decision rule, i.e.
an elimination strategy to reduce the number of alternatives. Analysis shows a decrease in the number
of positive judgments after the first time period, while at the same time the number of negative
judgments increased.
The analysis of decision rules shows that in the nine-alternatives problems subjects relied more
on an elimination strategy as compared to the three-alternatives problems. This result is in accordance
with the higher percentage of negative judgments mentioned above and the lower number ofattributes
used to evaluate each alternative in the nine-alternatives problems. An alternative is eliminated when
one or more relevant aspects are negatively evaluated and the sooner it is eliminated, the fewer
attributes one needs to consider (see also Payne, 1976). As Paquette and Kida (1988) have shown,
this change of decision rule is a sensible one, because more errors are made when subjects are forced
to use an additive compensatory rule. In their study, the elimination-by-aspects rule was found to
be the most effective strategy for highly complex problems. The elimination stage is the first stage
of a decision strategy and is shown to be more prominent with more complex problems. A screening
or elimination stage is followed by a second, in which the remaining alternatives are more thoroughly
evaluated. Subjects thus adapted their decision strategy to the complexity of the problem and the
phase of the decision process.
As mentioned earlier, the number of attributes used and references made to the most preferred
alternative were significantly higher than for the rest of the alternatives. There may be two reasons
for this. At the end of the decision process many subjects recapitulated their decision by re-evaluating
their chosen alternative, which increased the number of references made. This is supported by the
increase in the number of absolute dimensional judgments in the last period for the most preferred
alternative. It may also be the case that subjects simply used more information for their chosen
alternative (see also Dahlstrand and Montgomery, 1984). Montgomery (1983) suggested that decision
makers attempt to construct a dominance structure. He found that subjects tended to enhance their
attention to and evaluation of the finally chosen alternative long before the actual choice. This
may be the case for the three-alternatives problems. For these problems there is a linear increase
in the number of positive judgments toward the end of the decision process. Note that the dominance
of the most preferred alternative was not achieved by increasing the number of negative judgments
of the second most preferred alternative. Dominance structuring seems to be emphasizing the positive
aspects of the final choice without emphasizing the negative aspects of the non-chosen alternatives.
For the six- and nine-alternatives problems, results did not show a gradual increase in the number
of positive judgments for the most preferred alternative toward the end of the decision process,
but only an increase in the later periods. However, this result suggests that dominance structuring
does not take place throughout the decision process but only after other alternatives are evaluated.
This increase in positive judgments in the later periods might also be interpreted as a re-evaluation
or justification after the choice is made. Overall, results seem to support the adaptive and constructive
nature of decision making as described by Payne et al. (1992). Subjects adapted to the complexity

of the decision problem by relying more often on an elimination strategy and on lower-level information. The constructive nature of decision making is shown in the pattern of type of judgment
over time.
It is interesting to relate these findings to a more applied issue, i.e. the design of decision aids.
The results of this study provide some suggestions for designing more user-friendly, rational decision
aids. Such aids should enable users to tackle problems differing in complexity while using different
strategies depending on the needs and capacities of the user. Process analysis of unaided decision
making may contribute to the development of intelligent, psychologically valid decision aids which
are based not only on the underlying decision model but also on an analysis of the unaided decisionmaking process.
