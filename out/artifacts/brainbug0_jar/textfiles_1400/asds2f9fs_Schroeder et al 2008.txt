Abstract
Six Sigma has been gaining momentum in industry; however, academics have conducted little research on this emerging
phenomenon. Understanding Six Sigma first requires providing a conceptual definition and identifying an underlying theory. In this
paper we use the grounded theory approach and the scant literature available to propose an initial definition and theory of Six Sigma.
Our research argues that although the tools and techniques in Six Sigma are strikingly similar to prior approaches to quality
management, it provides an organizational structure not previously seen. This emergent structure for quality management helps
organizations more rigorously control process improvement activities, while at the same time creating a context that enables
problem exploration between disparate organizational members. Although Six Sigma provides benefits over prior approaches to
quality management, it also creates new challenges for researchers and practitioners.

principles, practices, and tools/techniques (Clifford,
2001). At first glance Six Sigma looks strikingly similar
to prior quality management approaches. However,
leading organizations with a track record in quality have
adopted Six Sigma and claimed that it has transformed
their organization. For example, 3M’s Dental Division
won the Baldrige Award (Aldred, 1998) and then later
adopted Six Sigma to improve performance even further
(McClenahen, 2004). The financial performance of 3M
since Six Sigma adoption has been very impressive
(Fiedler, 2004). Other organizations with a quality track
record, such as Ford, Honeywell, and American
Express, have adopted Six Sigma as a way to further
enhance business performance (Hahn et al., 2000). This
creates a dilemma: on the one hand, skeptics argue that
Six Sigma lacks discriminate validity over prior
approaches to quality management; on the other hand,
quality-mature organizations adopt Six Sigma to
enhance performance.

Scholarly inquiry into this management approach
has been limited. While many books and papers on Six
Sigma have emerged in the practitioner literature
(Breyfogle, 1999; Harry and Schroeder, 2000; Pande
et al., 2000), academic research on Six Sigma is just
beginning to come forward. Scholarly research is
needed to develop an in-depth, scientific understanding
of Six Sigma and separate fact from fiction.
This paper finds that indeed the philosophy and tools/
techniques of Six Sigma are strikingly similar to prior
quality management approaches. However, the way Six
Sigma is practiced represents a new organization
structural approach to improvement. Six Sigma helps
an organization become more ambidextrous by providing a switching structure (Daft, 2001) that allows the
organization to act more organically in coming up with
new improvement ideas and operate more mechanistically when implementing them. Furthermore, the
structure of Six Sigma employs numerous mechanisms
that simultaneously promote the conflicting demands of
exploration and control in the improvement effort. As a
result, what is new in Six Sigma when compared to prior
quality management approaches is more its organizational implementation rather than the underlying
philosophy or the quality tools/techniques employed.
At this early stage in the development of scientific
knowledge about Six Sigma, academic research needs
to address three questions:
1. What is the base definition of Six Sigma and possible
variants?
2. What is the theoretical basis underlying Six Sigma?
3. What is new about Six Sigma relative to the existing
literature?
Our research addresses these questions using a
grounded theory approach. This approach helps develop
an in-depth, relevant understanding of poorly understood phenomena (Eisenhardt, 1989; Meredith, 1998;
Yin, 1994). Since no clear definition or theory has
emerged to explain Six Sigma, conceptual development
can take place by using field observation, the literature,
and/or pure thought. This paper employs all three
approaches to provide a solid basis for the emergent
theory development and subsequent testing.
After discussing the literature in the next section, we
define Six Sigma from our grounded theory research
and propose an underlying theory for Six Sigma. We
then address what is new and propose some future
research directions. The result in a grounded theory that
has potential value for advancing the scientific understanding of Six Sigma.

2. The literature
Motorola originally developed Six Sigma in 1987 and
targeted an aggressive goal of 3.4 ppm defects (Barney,
2002b; Folaron, 2003). In 1994 Larry Bossidy, CEO of
AlliedSignal, introduced Six Sigma as a business
initiative to ‘‘produce high-level results, improve work
processes, expand all employees’ skills and change the
culture’’ (ASQ, 2002, p. 14). This was followed by the
well-publicized implementation of Six Sigma at General
Electric beginning in 1995 (Slater, 1999).
Currently, there are many books and articles on Six
Sigma written by practitioners and consultants and only
a few academic articles published in scholarly journals
(Linderman et al., 2003, 2004). Reviewing the
practitioner literature and these academic articles
provides a starting point for defining Six Sigma.
Six Sigma has been defined in the practitioner
literature in a variety of ways. This disparity leads to
some uncertainty and confusion. Consider some of the
following definitions from the practitioner articles.
Quality Progress called Six Sigma a ‘‘high-performance,
data-driven approach to analyzing the root causes of
business problems and solving them’’ (Blakeslee, 1999,
p. 78). Harry and Schroeder (2000), in their popular book
on Six Sigma, described it as a ‘‘business process that
allows companies to drastically improve their bottom line
by designing and monitoring everyday business activities
in ways that minimize waste and resources while
increasing customer satisfaction’’ (p. vii). Hahn et al.
(2000) described Six Sigma as a disciplined and
statistically based approach for improving product and
process quality. On the other hand, Sanders and Hild
(2000) called it a management strategy that requires a
culture change in the organization. Recognizing the
divergence in definitions, Hahn et al. (1999) noted that
Six Sigma has not been carefully defined in either the
practitioner or academic literature.
Many of the definitions of Six Sigma found in the
literature are very general and do not provide
elements—or factors (variables, constructs, concepts),
as Whetten (1989) described them—to define the
‘‘what’’ of the theory, nor do they describe relationships
among the elements to define the ‘‘how.’’ Therefore, our
data collection focused on obtaining a scientific
definition of Six Sigma and then extracting both the
elements of Six Sigma and their relationships.
3. Field data and analysis
In order to develop a rich understanding of Six Sigma
we selected two corporations that had implemented it,

<-----Page 2----->538

R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

one in manufacturing and the other in service (hereafter
referred to as MFG and SERV, respectively). These two
companies were selected using the idea of theoretical
sampling (Eisenhardt, 1989) to inform the theory we are
developing. They were in two different industries, and
one had just started implementing Six Sigma, while the
other had extensive experience with it. We seek
theoretical sampling in theory building rather than
the generalizability sought in statistical studies, so the
cases were chosen for theoretical rather than statistical
reasons. In some cases, polar opposites are selected to
inform and expand the emergent theory (Eisenhardt,
1989). While the cases we selected were not polar
opposites, they provide enough differences to support
the development of an emergent theory that can
potentially apply across industries and to different
stages of implementation maturity.
Four projects were selected from each company: two
that were representative of the best results obtained and
two that had less successful results. These projects were
not selected randomly; they were selected to help
improve our understanding of Six Sigma. Furthermore,
studying two very different companies and several
projects should improve the richness of our findings.
MFG is a large manufacturing company (with multibillions of dollars in revenue) that produces electronic
components for the computer industry. They have been
using Six Sigma for 3 years and are very advanced in its
application. MFG has almost 3.5% of its professional
workforce (about 350 out of 10,000 full-time employees) working as full-time Black Belt specialists, and
they have completed over 1000 Six Sigma projects.
MFG has documented savings of over $400 million
from its Six Sigma efforts.
SERV is a large (billion-dollar-plus) service company providing computer software services to its
customers. It is a well-established business but has
been implementing Six Sigma at a slow pace. Only a
small number of Black Belts have been trained, and
only a few projects had been completed at the time of
this study.
In each company our research team interviewed
corporate officers in addition to individuals associated
with each of the projects. The corporate officers were
generally in charge of Six Sigma efforts and were at the
vice president or director level. We also interviewed
Black Belt specialists, Green Belts, and Master Black
Belts who had worked on each of the projects and often
reported to Project Champions (operating vice presidents) who were in charge of the particular processes
being studied. We conducted 22 interviews lasting from
1 to 2 hours each.

In each company we asked interviewees a series of
questions. At the corporate level we asked questions
about the history of Six Sigma deployment in the
company, the company’s definition of Six Sigma, the
approach used, what they thought was new about Six
Sigma compared to previous quality approaches, top
management support, and the training and benefits of
Six Sigma. We also asked extensive questions about
knowledge creation, diffusion, and retention as a result
of Six Sigma projects; however, this part of the
interview is outside the scope of the present paper.
The interviews at the project level followed a similar
format, starting with a description of the origin of the
specific project, followed by a description of the project
team and method used, an explanation of benefits and
costs, an update on what is new, and an overview of the
learning that occurred from the project. We also asked
about knowledge created, diffused, and retained from
the project.
All of the interviews were tape recorded with the
permission of the respondent on a confidential basis and
then transcribed after the meeting. The transcriptions
were entered into NUD*IST, a software program that
permits analysis and manipulation of qualitative data
(Gahan and Hannibal, 1998). Each transcript was coded
according to the key issues discussed by the informants.
The codes were subsequently used to extract data and
quotations for analysis.
In an effort to triangulate our research results, as
recommended by Jick (1979), we also collected the
following types of written materials from each
company:





training manuals;
briefings on Six Sigma;
articles written about the company on Six Sigma;
annual reports pertaining to Six Sigma;
reports on financial savings, number of people
trained, etc.;
story boards for individual projects;
minutes of project meetings;
presentations made to management;
other documents describing Six Sigma.

The researchers who conducted the interviews then
analyzed these materials to supplement the responses
obtained from the interviewees. This approach reinforced statements made during the interviews or helped
identify discrepancies that served as a basis for further
inquiry.
In line with qualitative research procedures, the
research team conducted a number of meetings to distill

<-----Page 3----->R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

the important findings and conclusions from the field
data (Eisenhardt, 1989; Miles and Huberman, 1994;
Yin, 1994). Prior to these meetings the researchers read
the transcripts and came prepared to discuss definitions
of Six Sigma, its constructs, relationships and important
research issues that could be developed further. We first
conducted within-case analyses to insure that all
researchers had the same understanding of the interviews and written information. Then we conducted
cross-case analyses to further understand differences
and similarities observed. After these meetings, team
members conducted additional analyses of the transcripts and written documents to support or refute the
tentative conclusions.
4. Definition of Six Sigma
In order to develop a definition of Six Sigma, we
draw upon the field data we collected and then compare
it to the literature. We begin by presenting a number of
definitions offered to us during the interviews. Finally,
we will present an emergent theoretical definition based
on the interviews and the literature.
Note that in each interview the respondent was
specifically asked to provide a definition of Six Sigma,
which was then discussed and clarified with them. For
example, two top executives interviewed at MFG
defined Six Sigma as follows:
For us, you take from among your best people, give
them 4 weeks of problem-solving discipline skills,
you tie them to one of your most leveraged problems
that if you fix this it generates a lot of return, you give
them full time to lead a team to go get this thing
done, and you have active support of senior
management, and that’s what Six Sigma to us is
all about. But, if you boil it down to our view is we
want to improve the pace of improvement so that we
are significantly ahead of our competition, whomever that might be. So if you can learn faster and fix
faster than your competition, then you will be on the
way to long-term health as a company. (Executive 1)
What’s different about six sigma from my perspective is number one you’re taking people out of their
full-time jobs . . . we’re teaching them how to solve a
problem using statistics and methods. And then
they’re [Black Belts] assigned to work with a
Champion, a Champion typically is a vice president,
who ideally or hopefully understands what’s really
impacting the business and will pick a tough problem
for that Black Belt to work on. (Executive 2)

539

These executives viewed Six Sigma in very broad
terms as an approach to running a business that leads to
competitive advantage. These are not efficiencyoriented definitions, although savings are important at
MFG. They also noted the importance of connecting the
Black Belt with a Champion to ensure Six Sigma teams
work on processes important to the business strategy.
This definition refers to how the business is run rather
than process improvement or statistical methods.
A Black Belt in SERV defined Six Sigma as follows:
As far as Six Sigma goes, there’s a couple of different
ways of looking at it from my perspective. One is
more of the technical aspect, where you’re looking at
the first time yield or the defects per million
opportunities. That’s one way of looking at it. The
way I tend to describe it to people that I work with in
business . . . is looking at a situation, identifying if
there’s a problem, and then drilling down into the
root cause. What companies tend to do is they tend to
attack these symptoms and when they attack a
symptom they may fix that little problem but there
are still all these other problems. When you drill
down to the root cause, you not only resolve the
symptom you were originally looking at but
numerous other problems at the same time. . . So
to me it’s a way of improving processes using a very
logical, sound method. It’s the right way to do
business.
This definition emphasizes the idea of getting to the
root cause of problems in order to improve a process.
This is very important because there is a tendency to
jump to conclusions and to attack symptoms rather than
the underlying problems in business.
Another Black Belt in SERV also noted the
importance of the Champion in Six Sigma:
And then besides that, it’s also re-checking now and
then with the project Champion, making sure we’re
on track. Sometimes you’ve got to look at it and say,
‘‘Okay, where are we going? Do we need to refocus
this project a little bit?’’ Just make sure you’re still
going off in the right direction.
Each of these definitions indicates somewhat
different views of Six Sigma. This diversity in emphasis
and points of view exists even within the same company.
From a practitioner’s perspective different definitions may be considered valid, and which one is
preferred may depend on the individual interviewed, the
company, or the author’s prior experience. However,
scholars need to develop rigorous conceptual definitions
that can serve as the basis of theory building (Wacker,

<-----Page 4----->540

R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

2004). Commonly used definitions are insufficient for
scientific investigation (Teas and Palan, 1997). Conceptual definitions should show evidence of inclusivity,
exclusivity, differentiability, clarity, communicability,
consistency, and parsimony (Hempel, 1970, p. 654).
Wacker (2004) developed rules for constructing
conceptual definitions. With those rules in mind, we
propose the following rigorous base definition that
captures the theoretical aspects of Six Sigma from the
case study data and literature:
Six Sigma is an organized, parallel-meso structure to
reduce variation in organizational processes by using
improvement specialists, a structured method, and
performance metrics with the aim of achieving
strategic objectives.
We do not suggest one definition for everyone.
Companies may choose variations of this base definition
when implementing Six Sigma in order to customize it
to their situation. Later, we suggest some possible
variations. Contingency theory implies that the base
definition will not fit every company, but nonetheless it
is a starting point for research and implementation.
5. Elements of the Six Sigma definition
The elements in our base definition of Six Sigma
need further clarification. Our field research (see
Appendix) and literature suggest and inform the
following four relevant constructs or elements (parallel-meso structure, improvement specialists, structured
method, and performance metrics).
5.1. Parallel-meso structure
Parallel structures ‘‘are extra creations that operate
outside of, and do not directly alter, an organization’s
normal way of operating’’ (Lawler, 1996, p. 132). From
this perspective Six Sigma operates as a parallel
structure dedicated to improving the organization (see
Fig. 1). Implementation of Six Sigma at both MFG and
SERV followed the logic of a parallel structure. Both
organizations employed Six Sigma teams led by Black
Belts and supported by Champions who focused on
improving the organization.
However, parallel structures are not new to quality
management. Scholars often cite Quality Circles as an
example of a parallel structure (e.g., Adler et al., 1999;
Lawler, 1996). From this perspective one might argue
that Six Sigma and Quality Circles are isomorphic and
lack discriminate validity. However, Quality Circles have
faced unique challenges in implementation (Lawler and

Fig. 1. Six Sigma parallel-meso structure.

Mohrman, 1987). Lawler (1996) noted that because
‘‘quality circles have relatively little authority and power
to implement their ideas, many of their suggestions are
not implemented. There are other reasons as well,
including resistance from managers who are threatened
by the ideas, lack of funds, and, of course, the fact that
some ideas that sound good are based on incomplete or
inaccurate information’’ (p. 134). Although Quality
Circles allowed employees to explore problems, many
organizations experienced a fundamental failure with
control and authority in implementation. Six Sigma
provides an emergent structural evolution in quality that
can overcome some of these challenges, which can be
described as a parallel-meso structure.
‘‘Meso theory concerns the integration of both the
micro- and macro-levels of analysis. Individuals and
groups affect the organization and the organization in
return affects individuals and groups. To thrive in
organizations, managers and employees need to understand multiple levels simultaneously’’ (Daft, 2001, p.
32). Scholars have recognized Six Sigma as an example
of a meso approach to work design (Sinha and Van de
Ven, 2005). Barney (2002a) described Six Sigma as a
‘‘combination of macro-organizational strategy and
meso and micro-tactics.’’ Six Sigma provides a
hierarchical structure where leaders (Champions)
initiate, support, and review key improvement projects;
Black Belts then serve as project leaders who mentor
Green Belts in problem-solving efforts (Barney, 2002b;
Sinha and Van de Ven, 2005). Both MFG and SERV
support the importance of connecting multiple levels of
the organization together in improvement projects.
Various mechanisms in Six Sigma – such as strategic
project selection and leadership engagement – help
achieve multilevel integration.
5.1.1. Strategic project selection
Six Sigma organizations develop formal mechanisms to select Six Sigma projects. These mechanisms,

<-----Page 5----->R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

sometimes called project hoppers, involve senior
management to filter out Six Sigma projects that do
not have financial or strategic implications (Carnell,
2003; Kelly, 2002; Snee and Hoerl, 2003). From this
perspective the decision rights to initiate a project are
allocated to senior management. In contrast, other
approaches to quality have taken a bottom-up approach
where workers directly involved with the process
initiate improvement projects. Consistent with Six
Sigma, some academic research supports the view that
decision rights to initiate improvement projects
should be allocated to management (Wruck and Jensen,
1994, 1998). Wruck and Jensen (1994) gave an account
of implementing TQM at Sterling Chemicals that
resulted in ‘‘team mania’’ from an inappropriate
allocation of decision rights. Giving management the
decision rights to initiate a project helps ensure that
project selection is based on strategic importance and
not on convenience.
5.1.2. Leadership engagement
Leaders are also involved in the ongoing execution of
Six Sigma projects. Senior executive Champions,
typically vice presidents, perform many functions for
Six Sigma projects, including facilitating project
selection, defining project charters, selecting Black
Belts and other project resources, removing barriers to
project completion, and conducting progress reviews or
tollgate reviews with Black Belts (Gitlow and Levine,
2005; Snee and Hoerl, 2003). Tollgate reviews force
people to look at what they have been doing and serve as
a counterpoint to the freewheeling that can occur in
problem solving (Bastien and Hostager, 1988; Weick,
1993). Both MFG and SERV informants noted the
importance of ongoing senior executive engagement
and support for successful completion of Six Sigma
projects.
5.2. Improvement specialists
Both MFG and SERV used full-time improvement
specialists called Black Belts. Typically, these specialists were trained in the Six Sigma structured method
through 4 weeks of training with hands-on experience in
improving one or more processes. Many organizations
also train most, if not all, employees assigned to
projects in Six Sigma basics. These individuals receive
2 weeks of training and are called Green Belts. There
are also Master Black Belts who receive extensive
training beyond the Black Belt level and whose main
responsibilities are to serve as instructors and to provide
technical assistance and mentoring (Slater, 1999).

541

In MFG and SERV, for each Six Sigma project, an
improvement team was formed, consisting of employees who had substantial knowledge of the process,
served on a part-time basis, and may have had Green
Belt training. The team leader was a full-time Black
Belt specialist. The Black Belt usually reported to the
team’s sponsor, the Champion, a member of senior
management trained in Six Sigma basics. The
Champion provided a holistic view of the organization,
helped establish project buy-in, and insured the
availability of critical resources to the team.
Both MFG and SERV selected Black Belts not only
on the basis of their technical skills but also for their
leadership skills. Black Belts play an essential role in
Six Sigma because they bridge the gap between senior
management and project improvement teams. One can
think of a Black Belt as a ‘‘heavyweight’’ project
manager who reports to higher levels of the organization
(e.g., the Champion). A heavyweight project manager
can help secure resources and break down barriers,
which is critical to a multifunctional team (Clark and
Fujimoto, 1991). Heavyweight project managers also
help maintain discipline and a vision of the big picture
solution as the team explores the problem (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1995). A few organizations (e.g., small
companies) do not use full-time Black Belts and instead
use part-time project leaders. Also, other organizations
use full-time Black Belts but call them by another name,
such as ‘‘continuous improvement specialists’’ or
‘‘coaches.’’
5.3. Structured method
Six Sigma uses a structured method for process
improvement, which is patterned after the PDCA cycle
(Shewhart, 1931, 1939). The improvement method used
at both MFG and SERV was the familiar DMAIC
(define, measure, analyze, improve, and control)
method.1 In both SERV and MFG we found a strong
emphasis on finding the root cause of the problem
through systematic use of the method. The Six Sigma
methodology employs standard quality tools such as
FMEA, cause-effect charts, and statistical process
control (Breyfogle, 1999; Hoerl, 1998; Ishikawa,
1985; Kume, 1985, 1995). These tools include many
of the seven classic tools of quality control and the
seven new tools for problem formulation and diagnosis
(Gitlow et al., 1995; Mizuno, 1988).

1

MFG also used design for Six Sigma (DFSS) for new products, but
that was not part of the data collection reported here.

<-----Page 6----->542

R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

The structured method is related to the theory of
organizational routines. From this perspective the Six
Sigma method is a metaroutine, that is, a routine for
changing established routines or for inventing new
routines. The underlying assumption of metaroutines is
that problem solving can follow predicable steps (e.g.,
DMAIC). The DMAIC method is consistent with the
problem-solving steps of the PDCA model and places
more emphasis on integrating specific tools into each
step of the method.
DMAIC also involves different organizational members at different steps in the method. Champions play an
active role in the Define step but a supporting role in the
remaining steps. On the other hand, Process Owners take
a much more active role in the control step but a
supporting role in the other steps. Green Belts tend to take
a more active role in the measure, analyze, and improve
steps. Finally, Black Belts serve as project leaders and are
active in all steps of the process. Prior approaches to
quality management have not given this much role clarity
to organizational members in each step of the method.
The benefits of the Six Sigma metaroutine go beyond
promoting rational decision-making. As one executive
at MFG noted:
Well, what we thought was important is that it [Six
Sigma] gives us a common methodology throughout
the company. I mean, it’s not just to accomplish good
results but it’s a common methodology for approaching a substantial array of business activities, so on the
one hand it’s a problem-solving mentality, it’s a
common methodology, it’s common language, it’s
raising the performance level of a great number of
individuals. . . And the other part that we liked is that
it could be pervasive, it could be used throughout the
company not just in manufacturing but engineering,
sales, marketing, and administrative functions. The
ability to analyze and solve problems is, of course, an
opportunity anywhere in an organization, not just the
factory.
This executive highlights the importance of establishing a common language through the metaroutine. The
common language serves an integrative function that
facilitates diverse team member interaction in exploring
system-wide problems. However, getting the benefits of
the common language requires institutionalizing the
metaroutine across the organization (Scott, 2001).
5.4. Performance metrics
In MFG and SERV we found that Six Sigma used a
variety of special metrics, including process sigma

measurements, critical-to-quality metrics, financial
measures, and strategic measures. The Six Sigma
performance metrics were employed at multiple levels
of the organization and in service, administrative, and
manufacturing processes. Broadly, the metrics can be
categorized as customer-oriented metrics or financial
metrics.
5.4.1. Customer-oriented metrics
Deming (1986, 1994) and others have stressed the
importance of understanding customers’ present and
future needs when designing new products and services.
Understanding the true customer need is at the root of
Six Sigma. ‘‘A fundamental aspect of Six Sigma
methodology is identification of critical-to-quality
(CTQ) characteristics that are vital to customer
satisfaction’’ (Evans and Lindsay, 2005, p. 184). The
baseline and desired process sigma measure levels are
in fact defined relative to customer requirements. As a
result, customer requirements help establish project
improvement goals and direct improvement efforts of
Six Sigma teams (Linderman et al., 2003). Our
interviewees at MFG and SERV conclusively stated
that determining customer requirements must be part of
the Six Sigma process.
5.4.2. Financial metrics
Six Sigma improvement efforts have measurable
financial returns that are determined by accountants and
financial personnel in the organization. For example,
General Electric estimated that for 1999 the impact on
net income derived from their Six Sigma efforts minus
the implementation costs exceeded $2 billion (General
Electric Company, 1999). Most mature Six Sigma
companies track their financial results and report the
impact to all levels of management on a regular basis.
MFG included a financial analyst on Six Sigma
teams. The financial analyst provides an independent
auditing function to the team and validates the financial
and strategic benefits of the project. The financial
analyst’s role ‘‘is to help translate what the team does
into dollars and cents’’ (Smith et al., 2002, p. 188). The
financial analyst can play a role in each step of the Six
Sigma methodology (Smith et al., 2002). Upon
completion of the project, the financial analyst will
continue to track benefits for up to a year to make sure
the benefits are realized. SERV did not track financial
results as rigorously as MFG, but the company did
recognize the importance of connecting Six Sigma
projects to financial results.
Prior quality management approaches have made
efforts to establish connections between improvement

projects and financial performance. For example, Juran
(1989) advocated the use of cost-of-quality measures to
justify improvement efforts. However, embedding
financial analysts into the improvement process is
new, and Six Sigma provides a level of financial control
not seen in prior quality management approaches.
A measurement orientation at MFG and SERV
helped promote ‘‘fact-based’’ decision-making. This
not only promoted rational decision-making but also
helped encourage problem exploration. One respondent
shared the adage ‘‘In God we trust, all else bring data.’’
This measurement orientation promoted dialog in Six
Sigma teams based on expertise and facts rather than
positional authority and domination (Eisenhardt et al.,
1997). As a result, teams can more effectively explore
problems and identify the ‘‘root cause.’’
Six Sigma metrics also provide a basis for establishing improvement goals (Linderman et al., 2003). Both
MFG and SERV employed improvement goals based on
target defects-per-million-opportunities (DPMO) or
process sigma metrics. Basing goals on Six Sigma
metrics results in specific, challenging goals that can
lead to higher levels of performance than do vague,
nonquantitative goals such as do-best goals (Locke and
Latham, 1990). Clear goals create team alignment, help
measure success, and provide a basis for feedback about
performance (Ivancevich and McMahon, 1982).
While it is important to have a definition of Six
Sigma for future research, there is a belief that
organizational performance will improve if the specific
practices and parallel-meso organization structure
associated with Six Sigma are implemented. Our
definition and its related elements need to be tested
in practice to determine whether Six Sigma has a direct
effect on performance improvement. Toward this end
we offer the following proposition.
Proposition 1. Organizational performance will tend
to improve with the use of a parallel-meso Six Sigma
structure to reduce variation in organization processes

by using improvement specialists, a structured method,
and performance metrics with the aim of achieving
strategic objectives.
These Six Sigma elements can be arranged in a
framework by the proposed mediation model in Fig. 2.
We have shown leadership as a driver of three other
elements, and it is an exogenous variable, as is
commonly proposed in the literature (Anderson et al.,
1994; Kaynak, 2003; National Institute of Standards
and Technology, 2006). Leadership should lead to
strategic project selection and the use of improvement
specialists. These two elements in turn enable the use of
the structured method for process improvement. Finally,
the structured method leads directly to improved
organization performance. From Fig. 2, specific
hypotheses can be empirically tested using structural
equation modeling or path models.
6. Underlying theory of Six Sigma
Organizations have been characterized as either
mechanistic in structure, with high levels of standardization, formalization, specialization, and hierarchical
authority; or organic in structure, with low levels of
standardization, formalization, specialization, and hierarchical authority (Burns and Stalker, 1961; Courtright
et al., 1989; Scott, 2002). Contingency theory argues
that organizations will be more effective if their
structure fits their primary task (Donaldson, 2001).
From this perspective, the mechanistic structure fits
simple and stable tasks and promotes efficiency,
whereas the organic structure fits complex and uncertain
tasks and supports adaptability. The underlying
assumption is that tradeoffs need to be made when
selecting a structure. However, some argue for ‘‘dual
structures’’ from which organizations can realize the
benefits of both efficiency and adaptability (Duncan,
1976); this is often referred to as the ambidextrous
organization (Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996). Six Sigma

can be seen as one way to achieve organizational
ambidexterity.
Some organizational mechanisms to achieve ambidexterity include job enrichment, contextual ambidexterity, partitioning, and switching (McDonough and
Leifer, 1983). Six Sigma can essentially operate as a
switching mechanism. Switching mechanisms ‘‘create
an organic structure when such a structure is needed for
the initiation of new ideas’’ (Daft, 2001, p. 361).
‘‘Switching can be supported by ‘parallel’ organizational structures’’ (Adler et al., 1999, p. 46).
Some scholars argue that in turbulent environments,
organizations need a structure that has both a
controlling and an exploring effect (Eisenhardt and
Tabrizi, 1995). Research in quality management
provides some support for this contention (Douglas
and Judge, 2001; Sitkin et al., 1994). In Table 1 we
propose that Six Sigma can be viewed from two
different structural dimensions: structural control and
structural exploration. Structural control is grounded in
control theory (Eisenhardt, 1985; Ouchi, 1979) and
helps ensure proper execution of Six Sigma. On the
other hand, structural exploration emphasizes boundary-spanning roles (At-Twaijri and Montanari, 1987;
Jemison, 1984; Schwab et al., 1985) and communication (Hill and Levenhagen, 1995; Marschan-Piekkari
et al., 1999).
6.1. Structural control
Control strategies include outcome, behavioral, and
social controls (Eisenhardt, 1985; Ouchi, 1977; Ouchi
and Maguire, 1975). Outcome controls regulate activities
by specifying the outcomes of tasks (Nidumolu and

Subramani, 2003). This requires that the outcomes be
measurable (Eisenhardt, 1985). Extensive use of metrics
and measurements in Six Sigma help ensure that
outcomes are measurable. A number of measures and
metrics based on customer requirements, DPMOs, and
process sigma measures help establish explicit project
goals (Linderman et al., 2003). This creates a ‘‘cybernetic
process for monitoring and rewarding performance’’
(Eisenhardt, 1985, p. 135). The focus on financial and
non-financial results in Six Sigma also promotes outcome
control. For example, on each Six Sigma team MFG
embedded a financial analyst who provided an auditing
function and clarified the performance outcomes. Such
strong measurement and goals employed by Six Sigma
support outcome control.
‘‘Behavioral control processes regulate activities by
clarifying details of specific behaviors involved in task
execution’’ (Nidumolu and Subramani, 2003, p. 162).
These control mechanisms work well when behaviors
can be monitored. In Six Sigma the structured method,
DMAIC, provides a metaroutine that organizational
members follow to solve problems and improve
processes. Following a structured method helps avoid
jumping to conclusions and helps ensure an adequate
search for alternative solutions to a problem. Organizational leaders (Champions) can help monitor and ensure
proper execution of the metaroutine by conducting
tollgate reviews at each step in DMAIC. Other
monitoring mechanisms of the metaroutine can also
be used. MFG introduced a Program Evaluation System
to monitor the metaroutine. This system did a pre- and
postaudit of how the Six Sigma team used the DMAIC
process. Teams were rated on the appropriate use of
tools and steps within the method, which helped ensure
proper execution of the prescribed tools and method.
The metaroutine also helps establish role clarity in the
improvement process. Champions are more directly
involved in the define step, whereas Process Owners
take a more active role in the control step, and Black
Belts and Green Belts are more actively engaged in the
remaining steps. Establishing clear roles and responsibilities helps ensure the execution of the improvement
process and avoids having things fall through the
cracks. Finally, strategic process selection in Six Sigma
allocates decision rights to different organizational
members in the improvement process that promotes
control. Senior managers decide which improvement
projects to select (via the project hopper), whereas
Black Belts and Green Belts decide how to make
improvements.
Finally, social controls, sometimes called ‘‘clan
mechanisms’’ or ‘‘culture control’’ (Ouchi, 1979), can

<-----Page 9----->R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

also provide control when neither outcomes nor
behaviors can be clearly observed. Ouchi (1979) gives
an example of social control in healthcare (a context
where outcome and behavior is difficult to monitor)
where, he observes, practitioners undergo ‘‘a highly
formalized and lengthy period of socialization during
which would-be-doctors are subjected to not only skill
training but also to value training and indoctrination’’
(p. 837). Extensive training of Six Sigma specialists not
only provides organizational members with important
skills but also promotes organizational socialization
(Ashforth, 1997; Bauer et al., 1998). Recall the adage
‘‘In God we trust, all else bring data.’’ Part of the
training in Six Sigma essentially socializes organizational members to the value of fact-based decisionmaking (Detert et al., 2000). Black Belts at both MFG
and SERV demonstrated strong commitment to quality
values. The extensive level of training in Six Sigma
should allow for more socialization in quality values
that was not seen in prior quality management efforts.
6.2. Structural exploration
Structural exploration helps Six Sigma teams be
open to and flexible regarding new and different
perspectives. Traditionally, organizations have maintained buffers or boundaries to separate functional areas
to promote efficiency. GE popularized the boundaryless
organization through its Work-Out program (Ulrich
et al., 2002). Boundary-spanning roles can help break
down barriers that get in the way of problem understanding (Daft, 2001). Research indicates that individuals strongly linked to the external and internal
environment are more effective at boundary spanning
(Druskat and Wheeler, 2003; Tushman and Scanlan,
1981). In Six Sigma the Black Belt serves as a
heavyweight project manager who reports to senior
management. This structure promotes boundary-spanning activities that help employees understand and solve
problems that cut across functional domains. In
contrast, as noted by Lawler (1996), Quality Circles
did not provide this type of support structure.
Communication can also facilitate exploration and
boundary-spanning activities (Manev and Stevenson,
2001). Since Six Sigma employs multifunctional teams,
communication challenges can occur between diverse
organizational members, who may have different
interpretative schemes that can obstruct understanding
(Dougherty, 1992). However, as one executive at MFG
noted, institutionalizing Six Sigma creates a common
language and method for solving problems. This
common language helps overcome barriers created by

545

diverse interpretive schemes. For example, when a
financial analyst and an engineer use the term ‘‘process
sigma’’ they have a common understanding of what this
term means.
Proposition 2. Higher levels of simultaneous structural control and structural exploration in Six Sigma
tend to result in higher organizational performance.
Incorporating structural control with structural
exploration helps resolve some problems with prior
quality management approaches (e.g., Quality Circles
and TQM). Some elements of Six Sigma have features
that support both structural control and structural
exploration. For example, instituting the Six Sigma
metaroutine helps maintain behavioral control while
also establishing a common language. Thus, we believe
that implementing both structural control and structural
exploration will lead to higher performance levels.
7. Discriminating Six Sigma from TQM
Understanding Six Sigma requires identifying what
is new about it, if anything, compared to prior quality
management approaches. Various quality frameworks
and approaches could be used to determine what is new
in Six Sigma, including the Malcolm Baldrige National
Quality Award (NIST, 2006), ISO 9000 (Tsiakals et al.,
2002), TQM (Kaynak, 2003), Deming (1986, 1994),
Juran (1989, 1995), and Crosby (1979), etc. One can
view Six Sigma as an approach that can be used within
the Baldrige framework as one way to proceed (Byrne
and Norris, 2003). However, because the Baldrige
framework is not prescriptive in nature, a Baldrige
comparison would not by itself determine what is new
During the 1990s TQM was the dominant theoretical
and empirical paradigm for quality management
and included many of the elements advocated by
leading quality thinkers such as Deming, Juran, and
Crosby. Therefore, TQM seems to be an appropriate –
though not the only – basis for comparison with Six
Sigma.
Discriminating Six Sigma from TQM has been
widely debated. Some would argue that Six Sigma is the
latest banner of TQM (McManus, 1999). Others claim
that Six Sigma is something new (Pande et al., 2000). In
order to compare Six Sigma to TQM, we must first
establish a baseline definition for TQM.
Many studies have been done on TQM’s definitions
and its links to performance (Douglas and Judge, 2001;
Flynn et al., 1995; Kaynak, 2003). While we cannot
review all of these studies, we will draw on literature
reviews and current studies to define TQM.

<-----Page 10----->546

R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

Recently, Kaynak (2003) compared 18 studies of
TQM definitions and their relationship to performance.
While some of these studies use a single construct
definition of TQM, many of them present TQM as a
multi-dimensional construct. Table 2 shows five
different studies from the Kaynak paper that have
gained wide use in the literature for their definitions of
TQM. In the left column of the table are the dimensions
of TQM that are common to most, if not all, of the five
studies. As can be seen, with the exception of product/
service design that is common to three of the five
studies, the other dimensions are common to four or all
five of the studies. Table 2 also provides a description of
the TQM elements taken from the various studies that
can be used for direct comparison to Six Sigma.
The first element for comparison is product/service
design. While we did not emphasize this element in this
paper, it is an important part of design for Six Sigma
(DFSS). Both TQM and Six Sigma stress the
importance of cross-functional design, customer input,
design for manufacturability, robust design, and quality
function deployment (QFD). What is different is that
DFSS emphasizes following a structured method in
design projects. In MFG this process was being taught
to all design engineers and provided a common
language for both design and certain design tools.
The method MFG used for design was IDOV (identify,
design, optimize, verify), which functions as the method
for product design (similar to DMAIC for process
improvement). Thus, the Six Sigma design process is
more prescriptive in nature than TQM.
In TQM the area of process management stresses
clarity of process ownership, less reliance on inspection,
statistical process control (SPC), total productive
maintenance (TPM), and process definitions (Flynn
et al., 1994). Six Sigma takes a somewhat different
approach by stressing process improvement through the
use of DMAIC or a similar metaroutine for improvement. While SPC and other tools are part of this process,
Six Sigma connects specific tools with specific steps in
the process. Similarities with TQM are Six Sigma’s
process ownership and clear process definitions.
Top management leadership is essential to both
TQM and Six Sigma (Harry and Schroeder, 2000;
Kaynak, 2003). One difference, however, is the welldefined meso structure in Six Sigma that demands more
involvement of leaders on improvement projects. In
addition, Six Sigma engages leaders in the improvement
process on an ongoing basis. Champions, for example,
help direct and support improvement projects.
Training for quality is dramatically different
between TQM and Six Sigma. In TQM, training is

typically provided for all employees in a 1-week TQM
course (Saraph et al., 1989). In both MFG and SERV,
Six Sigma training was provided on an as-needed basis
and differentiated by task. Likewise, a different
approach is used for employee involvement and
participation. In TQM, teams are typically formed
within work groups or sometimes with cross-functional
membership (Flynn et al., 1994). One objective of the
TQM team is to involve all employees, frequently at the
shop-floor level or in the workplace. In Six Sigma,
projects are designated at a strategic level, and teams are
formed along process lines to improve a particular
process. There is no objective of wide team participation. Furthermore, salaried workers are more likely to
be on teams than hourly workers, since many processes
are transactional, administrative, or service in nature, or
they require engineering skills for improvement. Six
Sigma teams are disbanded after the process improvement is implemented, unlike TQM teams, which often
have an ongoing charter for improvement in their work
areas.
Quality data and reporting under TQM is oriented
toward use of cost of quality data, feedback of quality
data to the employees, visual display of quality
information and benchmarking (Ahire et al., 1996).
Six Sigma quality data focuses on customer and
financial performance metrics for each specific project.
In addition, tracking cost savings on a project-byproject basis has replaced the organization-wide ‘‘cost
of quality’’ calculations from TQM approaches.
Supplier management is an important element of
TQM. It is argued that long-term relationships, a
relatively small number of dependable suppliers, and
supplier involvement in design contribute to quality
improvement (Dow et al., 1999). In contrast, the Six
Sigma efforts we studied in MFG and SERV involved
suppliers only if the supplier was a critical part of the
process being studied.
Finally, customer focus from Table 2 can be seen as
an important element of TQM. It is also important in Six
Sigma and is given similar emphasis. In both TQM and
Six Sigma customer input is important at two levels: the
organization and the project level. At the organization
level, customer input is critical in establishing which
processes and products are in need of strategic
improvement. At the project level, customer input is
critical in defining those quality attributes that are
critical-to-quality and therefore constitute a defect.
Several distinctive features of Six Sigma are
illustrated in the above discussion. First, Six Sigma is
not distinctive by insisting on top management leadership or in being customer driven. These elements are

important in every type of quality management
initiative (Juran, 1989, 1995). However, Six Sigma
provides a well-defined organizational structure that
facilitates leadership engagement.
Differences between Six Sigma and TQM can be
succinctly summarized as follows:
1. The focus on financial and business results is to some
extent unique. Deming (1986) warned against
focusing on results and instead preferred a process
focus. On the other hand, the Baldrige Award and
related quality awards around the world have focused
extensively on results (NIST, 2006). The difference is
that Six Sigma usually requires financial returns from
most projects and from each full-time Six Sigma
specialist. Thus the financial focus is at the project
level, in contrast to being on the organizational level
in TQM and the Baldrige award. In addition, results
are tracked on a pre-project and post-project audit
basis by the financial organization. This aggressive
insistence on a financial return from improvement
projects is new to most organizations. However, Six
Sigma recognizes that not all projects produce shortterm financial returns; therefore, projects with purely
strategic value may also be undertaken (Pande et al.,
2000).
Many of our interviewees emphasized that having
strong financial measurement was new compared to
past quality efforts. For example, one executive in
MFG said:
My expectation was that it [Six Sigma] would go
the same path that all the other quality initiatives
have gone down. You really have to have some
ongoing demonstration that it’s making a
difference. . . We are very, very strict in our
interpretation of this tie and this connection. . .
And we are continuing to demonstrate that we can
produce results, which, more than anything else,
the evidence that this program produces results, it
will keep it going.
2. Use of a structured method for process improvement
or new product and service introduction is also not
entirely distinctive. However, the degree of insistence
on following the structured method, the intense
training of the full-time specialists (see Snee and
Hoerl, 2003 for discussion of Six Sigma training),
and the full integration of statistical and nonstatistical
tools are unique. In the past, quality improvement
teams have been formed with minimal training
(perhaps 1 week or less) and set out to improve a
process with less emphasis on the use of data or a

well-structured method (Pande et al., 2000). Often
these teams were formed more for employee
involvement than for improvement. So the intensity
of using the specialized method is worthy of note.
One executive at SERV said:
Six Sigma brings together a very cohesive and
comprehensive approach to problem solving. It
kind of brings together a number of the better
methods and tools that I know and then combines
them in a novel way to look at things.
3. Use of specific metrics is also new with Six Sigma.
Processes have not been measured in terms of their
DPMO, critical-to-quality (CTQ), or process sigma.
The effect of these measures highlights the importance of improvement and encourages difficult but
attainable goals for improvement. Stretch goals
motivate team members to think ‘‘out of the box’’
(Breyfogle, 1999; Hamel, 2000). Six Sigma requires
a disciplined approach toward measurement and
improvement that has not been evident in previous
quality improvement efforts. Six Sigma metrics also
help ensure a customer focus when engaging in
process improvement efforts. As one executive at
SERV noted, ‘‘to actually be able to calculate a sigma
you have to have a very specific focus on the
customer.’’
4. Finally, the use of a significant number of full-time
improvement specialists in Six Sigma is new to many
organizations. In the past, organizations were
reluctant to make the investment in full-time
specialists and often assigned improvement tasks
to already overworked staff on a part-time basis.
Some organizations used full-time specialists but
provided little or no training in structured improvement methods. By contrast, in 1997 GE invested
$250 million in training nearly 4000 Black Belts and
60,000 Green Belts out of a workforce of 220,000
employees (Harry and Schroeder, 2000). This large
investment paid off in 1997 alone by adding $300
million to net income. Since investments are
converted immediately to bottom-line results, management is able to justify the commitment of
extensive training and full-time employees.
Overall, much of what is being done in Six Sigma is
not entirely new with respect to prior quality tools or
principles, but the deployment approach and emergent
structure of Six Sigma are new. Six Sigma has been
attractive to many CEOs and executives precisely
because it is a very disciplined approach with a parallelmeso organization structure that delivers a verified

<-----Page 13----->R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

financial return (e.g., see Slater, 1999). As a result,
organizations may find that Six Sigma fits their
improvement needs better.
This discussion of differences between Six Sigma
and TQM suggests that Six Sigma can be discriminated
from TQM in the critical elements described above.
Furthermore, we expect that these differences will
further improve performance in organizations that have
already implemented TQM.
Proposition 3. Six Sigma will differ from TQM practices as described herein and will tend to provide
incremental benefits in customer service and financial
results for organizations that have already implemented
TQM.
8. Research directions
There are several directions that future research can
take. One of them is testing the above propositions. Also
an important issue is investigating what types of
organizations are likely to successfully adopt Six
Sigma. It seems that there are at least three
contingencies regarding Six Sigma that could be tested
via contingency theory (Benson et al., 1991; Sousa and
Voss, 2001).
1. Most, but not all, companies track financial results
from each project. At SERV, for example, they were
tracking improvement in customer satisfaction rather
than dollars saved. Perhaps certain industries might
not be as interested in tracking financial savings as
others.
2. Most, but not all, companies use full-time Black
Belts to lead projects. At MFG we found that Black
Belts were not used in design for Six Sigma, since
engineers were already assigned to projects full-time.
3. Employees involved in the projects we studied varied
in their use of statistical tools and in their rigor at
following all the steps of DMAIC. This tended to be
true when the root cause for improving the process
was known in advance or when there was a lack of
data.
There are no doubt other contingencies that can be
specified and tested. This would stand in contrast to
those who argue ‘‘one size fits all.’’
Another interesting research project would be to
study the benefits that actually accrue from Six Sigma.
While project savings can be totaled, they might not
translate into organizational savings or improvements in
the bottom line. There is also the question of how to

549

measure savings from design projects when the major
benefit is cost avoidance. Also, there is no established
methodology for measuring revenue enhancements that
occur from improved customer satisfaction or increased
market share.
Internal fit could be another area of interesting
research. The culture of the organization, along with its
structure, might be averse to implementation of Six
Sigma and thus require changes in the shared values of
the employees and in the structure of the company
(Eckes, 2001). An aversive culture could inhibit the
implementation of Six Sigma and may ultimately defeat
it, particularly if there is CEO turnover. The study of Six
Sigma sustainability is closely related to the question of
internal fit.
Six Sigma is an organizational learning process and
one that results in greater knowledge. Viewing Six
Sigma through the lens of knowledge management and
organizational learning can lead to insights about how
to create, retain, and diffuse knowledge using a
structured approach (Choo et al., 2007; Lapré et al.,
2000).
Finally, we suggest that Six Sigma be viewed as an
organization change process. This might provide
improved ways for implementation of the Six Sigma
process and a more enlightened analysis of what needs
to be changed. It might also improve management of the
change management process itself. There is certainly
ample literature about organizational change that could
be used as a starting point (Van de Ven and Poole, 1995).
9. Conclusions
We have proposed an emergent base definition of Six
Sigma and an initial theory based on a grounded theory
approach. Although Six Sigma builds off prior quality
management practices and principles, it offers a new
structure for improvement. The structural differences
simultaneously promote both more control and exploration in improvement efforts. Some organizations may
find benefit from the Six Sigma approach because it fits
their organizational needs better.
Academics need to better understand Six Sigma so
that they do not overhype it or too quickly dismiss it as
nothing new. By better defining and adequately
understanding Six Sigma, scholars can develop a
deeper and richer knowledge of this phenomenon.
Our research makes four contributions:
1. It proposes a rigorous base definition of Six Sigma
from the literature and field study that can be used for
further research. A phenomenon cannot be scienti-

<-----Page 14----->550

R.G. Schroeder et al. / Journal of Operations Management 26 (2008) 536–554

fically studied until it is defined; therefore, we
provide a starting point for future research on Six
Sigma.
2. We provide an underlying theory for Six Sigma
research derived from observation and the literature.
The theory includes the concepts of ambidextrous
organizations, parallel-meso organization, structural
control and structural exploration.
3. We suggest well-grounded propositions and a
framework for future empirical testing.
4. We differentiate Six Sigma from TQM and other
quality management approaches in order to indicate
what is new about this approach.
There are some limitations to our research, including
the fact that grounded theory has inherent weaknesses.
The theory we have developed might require further
refinement, but this is a normal part of the theory
development and testing process. Nevertheless our
grounded theory has a reasonable chance for empirical
verification and a better chance than theory developed
without the triangulation methods and grounded theory
approach used here.
The choice of the two companies studied in depth has
perhaps limited the results in some ways. For example,
neither company stressed cultural change to a large
extent. Eckes (2001), for example, stresses the

importance of cultural change along with technical
change in an organization, and he proposes a
comprehensive approach to cultural change.
Finally, only MFG stressed the use of Six Sigma as a
leadership development program in the company. MFG
selected from among its best people, trained them as
Black Belts, and assigned them to challenging processes
in need of improvement. They also trained everyone in
the company who was assigned to projects at the Green
Belt level and clearly viewed Six Sigma as a way to
train, reward, and promote future leaders.
As we go forward in Six Sigma research, it is an
opportune time to begin testing the theory that has been
developed. This will require random sampling to
empirically test and validate the propositions and
theory provided. Such theory testing should add to our
scientific knowledge regarding Six Sigma and can either
verify or refute certain key elements of the definition
and theory proposed here.
We have also specified a number of additional
research projects using contingency theory, organization learning, and organization change theories. It is
only through academic research that a better understanding of Six Sigma can be developed. We hope that
this initial effort will provide a beginning for future
scientific research and a better understanding of this
important phenomenon.

Appendix
Six Sigma elements obtained from interviews
Parallel-meso structure
Strategic project selection
Master Black Belt then would be supporting the Champion, would be involved in project selection-project identification,
project selection, matching projects to Black Belts, making sure that we’re making the best utilization of the Black Belt
resources for those Champions and for their specific critical business objective
. . .projects . . . [should be] . . . selected by the system that we like to have projects selected by
. . .the . . . project, that was selected based on what’s the greatest opportunity for hard savings based on what’s the
opportunity available within this functional area
. . .project selection . . . The ideal model is that you have a flow down from a top level corporate objective. Here’s the seven
key objectives for MFG. And within those objectives, each of the business unit leaders have a set of those that support
these corporate goals. His goal should roll down within his department and when they come to a level when they complete
those individual goals, there is a definite tie back to or setting individual goals, there is tie back to the corporate goals
Leadership engagement
There are two significant things. The most significant from my point of view is the buy-in of senior executives. They said we’re
going to go do this, this is rational. The second thing is . . . we really are measuring hard savings very, very tough. And we are
continuing to demonstrate that we can produce results . . . the evidence that this program produces results . . . will keep it going
. . .they are almost all tools that we used in TQM and these are not new. There is a rigor to this deployment that is probably better
than the others. There is a top-down engagement to this process
. . .business unit Champion who owns segments of the total Six Sigma commitment in terms of how many projects, how many
dollars in hard savings, and how many Black Belts should that employ and how green belts training going.
Performance metrics
Customer metrics
Does your customer perspective help you to learn more about a solution? Sure. I like to put myself in their shoes and [think] if
I were them and I saw this process change coming. . . I want to make sure that that’s not going to impact me negatively

Appendix (Continued )
. . .let me just step back to the voice of the customer process . . . if that’s integrated and robust . . . there’s a huge amount
of knowledge and information that the customer is bringing in. So it’s not only . . . complaints, which are valuable
information, but it’s also like do you have this product, or do you have this feature or that? Or when the sales force is
out there and they see a product in the field. [The customer] may modify a car door handle [or] an aircraft engine, and
we see that and [bring] back that information on the customer—that ties back into new products. So once again, that
strategic element is tied in to define the opportunity and then [we] use the methodology, whether it’s like a DMAIC or
our CPI methodology or a DFSS/DMADV methodology to drive the new product design
Financial metrics
. . .what really distinguishes it or makes it different [from other quality movements] . . . is the heavy tie to the customer
and the financial focus
I don’t recall in the TQM initiative that there was any reporting of [the metrics] in the monthly operating results . . . it
was not part of every functional organization’s monthly results [to answer] how are you doing? And that is a
significant part of the commitment of the executives
[The] problem I’m having with my transactional or administrative deployment is . . . because most of them aren’t measured,
the senior executives didn’t buy in to it can have a significant impact
Improvement specialist
What’s unique about it? We take people out of their full-time jobs, we take some of the best people. We don’t take good old
lazy Joe or Sally who are the retreads and ought to be retired. We take some of the more energetic, more dynamic, more
hungry people. We take them out of their full-time jobs and give them 4 weeks of training and we send them back
working with VPs on solving the biggest problems the company has. And that’s really unique . . . we train these lead
superstars and plant the seed that those guys in the end will be the leaders of the company
So you give these guys full-time to go drive the methodology and it works. You see clear improvement from it . . . the
teaching is nothing different. The methods of solving problems is nothing unique, but it’s . . . the dedicated resource
and the connection with the Champion that makes this thing really successful
People think Six Sigma is all about Black Belts, but it’s not. It’s all about Green Belts. And we’re using the Black Belts as
kind of the front end people to get trained and get visible successes
I think it’s extremely helpful to have full-time Black Belts working on projects and the training involved. I think many
other quality initiatives do not use people with that much training or that have a full-time dedication. And that I do think is a
critical issue and that could be a big difference in success rates too
Well, I think that first of all, having a dedicated Six Sigma Black Belt person facilitating the team, driving the team, that
that was a success factor. Oftentimes, you form teams and there are people who have other jobs and so therefore the project
becomes the last thing that gets addressed. This being my job [as a Black Belt], I have to address it
Structured method
What’s unique about it is the methodology. How to apply the tools. For example, if I taught you how to cut a board . . . when I tell
you now go and take out [the] windows in my lake house and install a sliding glass door, you wouldn’t [be able to] do that
because you need more than just the skill in how to use the saw. You need the methods as to how to apply it and that’s [the
difference] with six sigma. Having the skill is one thing but knowing how to apply it is the really important part
So it’s the methodology plus the tools that we teach you. [The] roadmap is kind of important in the grand scheme, and every week
of training you cover the roadmap [and] that’s . . . the checklist
I think the unique thing about Six Sigma is that it gives you a platform and a methodology to follow to be consistent and make sure
that you’ve touched all the bases
I think the processes help hold the team together to get consensus. Any project team, any project leader can do that if they’re a
good project leader. But the tools that we use made it very quick, very easy to get consensus because we’ve go our
facts and data to look at
I think the methodology is probably 50% of the improvement, the individual is probably 25%, and the Champion and the project
combine for the other 25%. That’s just a guess. But I think the methodology is the strong contributor here, the primary
contributor. And that’s why it’s important to train everyone in the company
My perspective, I guess, on Six Sigma is that it’s a good set of methods to reduce defects, improve sigmas, reduce variability in a
very methodical way. And I think the reason – a lot of the reason – why it’s successful is that it forces a company to dedicate
resources to a project
