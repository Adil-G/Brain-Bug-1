<-----Page 0----->The Effect of Time Pressure on Consumer
Choice Deferral
RAVI DHAR
STEPHEN M. NOWLIS*
This article investigates the effect of time pressure on choice deferrai. Recent
research suggests that the likelihood of deferral is contingent on the ease of
making the selection decision (which option to choose) as well as the overali
attractiveness of the selected alternative. We focus on how time pressure systematically impacts choice deferral by increasing the use of noncompensatory decision rules in the selection decision and by increasing the relative emphasis placed
on the unique features in the deferral decision (whether to choose). Consistent
with the hypotheses, we find over a series of five studies that time pressure (1)
decreases choice deferral when choice involves high conflict but not when conflict
is low, (2) reduces the impact of shared features on choice deferral, and (3)
decreases choice deferral for sets with common bad and unique good features
(approach-approach conflict) but not for sets with common good and unique bad
features (avoidance-avoidance conflict). We further show that greater attention to
the unique features is not a general property of decision making under time
pressure but rather a consequence of the primacy of the selection decision over
the deferral decision. Consistent with this premise, time pressure did not decrease
the relative attention paid to common features when the task was described as
purely a deferral decision. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings
are discussed.

onsumers often make choices, ranging from which
brand of toothpaste to buy to which stock to buy,
under time pressure (e.g., Cristol and Sealey 1996). Furthermore, the very nature of many choices such as medical
decisions imply a certain degree of urgency. Although
prior literature has addressed the effect of time pressure
when consumers are forced to choose (e.g., see Svenson
and Maule 1993), it has not examined the decision processes and choice outcomes when the no-choice or the
deferral option is available. For example, a consumer who
inspects different brands of television sets under time
pressure might be more or less likely to defer choice and
choose neither than a consumer who is making the same
decision without time pressure. In this article, we examine
the effect of time pressure on choice deferral by studying
(1) causes for deferral under time pressure, (2) how the
degree and type of choice conflict moderate this relation-

ship, (3) how decision processes mediate this relationship, and (4) boundaries under which the predicted effects
operate. This effort can help to extend our understanding
of consumer decision making under time pressure as well
as the decision processes that underlie choice deferral.
When the no-choice option is available, consumers
have to make a "deferral decision" (i.e., whether or not
to choose) in addition to a "selection decision" (i.e.,
which brand to choose).' Building on recent research on
choice deferral, we propose that the deferral decision is
often made after the selection decision and that the likelihood of deferral is contingent on the ease of making the
selection decision (Dhar 1996). In particular, we examine
the effect of time pressure on deferral for choice sets
where the selection decision is either easy or difficult.
When choice involves conflict, consumers are likely to
use strategies that involve processing more of the relevant
information (Bettman et al. 1993). The difficulty of the
selection decision in such cases increases the likelihood
of choice deferral. However, a greater use of noncompen-

'Throughout the article, we will use the term "selection decision"
to refer to the decision regarding which brand to choose, "deferral
decision" to refer to the decision regarding whether or not to choose,
and "choice deferral" to refer to the combined outcome of both of
these stages.

satory decisioti strategies under time pressure makes the
selection decision easier by avoiding difficult trade-offs
and thereby decreases the likelihood of deferral. Thus,
choice deferral is predicted to be lower under time pressure when conflict is involved. Conversely, in a choice
set involving little conflict, time pressure is not expected
to have a significant impact on the ease of selection and
consequently on choice deferral. Thus, the degree of conflict is expected to moderate the effect of time pressure
on choice deferral. Furthermore, the use of a noncompensatory strategy, which affects the ease of selection, is
expected to mediate the effect of time pressure on choice
deferral.
We further propose that the deferral decision depends
not only on the ease of the selection decision but also
on the overall attractiveness of the alternatives (e.g., the
degree to which an option offers relatively positive or
negative features). The primacy of the selection over the
deferral decision suggests that when the deferral decision
is made under time pressure, greater weight will be given
to the features that were considered in the selection decision. In particular, we show that choice deferral under
time pressure is determined to a greater degree by the
attractiveness of the unique features. We test this proposition by examining the effect of time pressure on deferral
for choices involving pairs with unique positive and common negative features (approach-approach conflict) and
pairs with unique negative and shared positive features
(avoidance-avoidance conflict). Thus, besides the degree
of conflict, the type of conflict is also expected to moderate the effect of time pressure on choice deferral by affecting the attractiveness of the options.
We show that the greater attention on the unique features is not a general property of decision making under
time pressure but rather a consequence of the primacy of
the selection decision over the deferral decision. Thus,
common features that are relatively ignored should receive greater weight when the decision task eliminates
the selection decision. We exatnine this by comparing the
weighting of common features for a store choice task
(with a menu of brands in each store), where the selection
decision is eliminated, with a standard brand choice task.
We find that consumers under time pressure are equally
likely to consider both cotnmon and unique features during store choice, as these aspects are both relevant to the
deferral decision.
In the remainder of the article, we first review prior
research relevant to the effect of time pressure on choice
deferral and decision processes, which leads to several
hypotheses that are tested across a series of five studies.
Using the Mouselab program, we also examine the decision processes predicted to mediate the effect of time
pressure on choice deferral. These studies suggest that
the effect of time pressure on choice deferral is consistent
with our predicted changes in decision strategy and selective weighting of cotnmon and unique features. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical
implications of the findings.

TIME PRESSURE AND CONSUMER
CHOICE DEFERRAL
In order to examine the effect of time pressure on
choice deferral, we first review prior research on time
pressure in forced choice and integrate this with recent
work on choice deferral. A number of studies that have
examined the effect of time pressure on forced choice
find three general ways in which people respond to time
constraints. First, consumers tend to accelerate the rate at
which they examine information when deciding under
time pressure (e.g., Ben Zur and Breznitz 1981). Second,
consumers tend to filter information such that they focus
on the more important attributes. For instance, time pressure increases the weight placed on the more meaningful
features and in particular may increase the attention devoted to negative information (Ben Zur and Breznitz
1981; Svenson and Eland 1987; Wright 1974). Third,
consumers choosing under time pressure may alter their
decision strategy. In particular, a number of different studies suggest that a common response to limited time is for
the decision maker to shift from using compensatory to
noncompensatory decision rules (e.g., Payne, Bettman,
and Johnson 1988; Svenson, Edland, and Slovic 1990).
Thus, consumers under time pressure are likely to simplify their selection decision by using a less effortful noncompensatory decision strategy. Although the use of such
strategies may often be adaptive, consumers may use heuristics under time pressure also because they have no
other choice (Simon 1981).
While research on time pressure has focused on forced
choice, recent consumer research has examined the decision processes and outcomes when the no-choice option
is provided (Dhar 1997; Huber and Pinnell 1994; Luce
1998; Tversky and Shafir 1992). These studies find that
consumers are more likely to select the no-choice option
when conflict is high (i.e., both alternatives are attractive)
than when conflict is low (i.e., there is a single superior
alternative). An analysis of the decision processes (Dhar
1997) suggests that subjects who expressed more
thoughts or made more comparisons (and presumably
found the choice more difficult) were more likely to
choose the deferral option. An implicit assumption that
underlies such a pattern of preferences is the notion that
selecting the best option within the choice set precedes
the deferral decision. Thus, the difficulty of making the
selection decision when choice among the alternatives
involves conflict increases the tendency to defer choice.
An interesting issue that emerges is how conflict influences the likelihood of choice deferral when consumers
decide under time pressure. In some cases, time pressure
may result in avoiding certain choices. For example, if
consumers perceive that the time available is completely
insufficient to consider the alternatives carefully, they
may opt out of the decision altogether. This is more likely
to be the case when the decision is unstructured and involves several stages such as searching for complete in-

<-----Page 2----->CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE

formation (Greenleaf and Lehmann 1995).^ Our focus is
on cases where the alternatives are relatively well defined
and the consumer is considering the final moment of
choice. In such cases, the deferral decision is likely to be
based on the ease of selecting an option as well as the
overall attractiveness of the selected option. Our objective
is to understand how constraints in information processing
due to limited time influence the ease of selectioti among
the alternatives as well as the overall attractiveness of the
selected alternative and its implication for deferral. We
first focus on how time pressure influences the ease of
selection and show how this might be moderated by the
degree of choice conflict. Next, we focus on the deferral
decision and how it might be influenced by the weighting
of the common and unique features of the options under
consideration.
When choice involves conflict and no single alternative
has a systematic advantage, Bettman et al. (1993) show
that decision makers are likely to make trade-offs and
process more of the relevant information. Such a decision
process is likely to make the selection decision difficult
and result in choice deferral. Conversely, consumers
choosing among the same alternatives under time constraints are likely to use a noncompensatory rule that
processes less information and avoids making difficult
trade-off comparisons. This shift in decision strategy due
to time pressure may make the selection decision easier
and consequently decrease deferral. In this vein, Dhar
(1996) showed that the decision to defer choice is sensitive to the decision strategy that is used. Specifically,
when choice involved two alternatives that differed on
their advantages but were relatively similar in attractiveness, consumers who used a lexicographic strategy
were significantly more likely to choose than consumers
who were asked to make trade-off comparisons. In summary, a noncompensatory rule simplifies the selection
decision between two options where each excels on certain dimension by favoring the option that is superior on
the more important attribute. Consequently, the increase
in the ease of selection under time pressure should decrease the likelihood of choice deferral.
The above discussion leads to the prediction that a
choice involving a high degree of conflict is less likely
to be deferred under time pressure. In contrast, consider
a choice between two options where one option is clearly
superior to the other (i.e., it is at least as good or far
better on most dimensions). Since conflict is low, the
selection decision is relatively easy even without time
pressure as subjects do not need to make difficult tradeoff comparisons. Since there is no systematic difference
in the ease of the selection decision under time pressure,
no difference in choice deferral is predicted. In summary.
^Our focus in this article is on relatively mild time pressure that is
unlikely to involve affective changes that are intensely negative. In such
cases, extreme time pressure may act as a stressor, resulting in changes
in affective state that could potentially influence decision outcomes
(Maule and Mackie 1990; Svenson and Ediand 1987).

the degree of choice conflict is expected to moderate the
effect of time pressure on choice deferral by affecting
the ease of the selection decision. This leads to the first
hypothesis, which predicts that selection of the no-choice
option will decrease under time pressure for high conflict
decisions (equally attractive alternatives) but not for low
conflict decisions (one alternative is clearly superior).
We tested Hypothesis 1 in study 1.
H I : The degree of choice conflict moderates the effect of time pressure on choice deferral. Specifically, the percentage of consumers who select the deferral option decreases under time
pressure when the options are equal in attractiveness (i.e., high conflict) but not when one
of the options is clearly superior (i.e., low conflict).

STUDY 1: THE MODERATING
EFFECT OF THE DEGREE
OF CHOICE CONFLICT
Method
Subjects were 196 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. The task involved making
choices between two alternatives in three different product categories. Subjects were asked to imagine that they
were thinking of making a purchase in the categories
presented. The instructions in this and subsequent studies
emphasized that there were no right or wrong answers
and that the respondents should choose the option that
best reflected their preferences. Subjects were told that,
as in real choice situations, they also had the option of
not selecting from the options provided and to look for
different alternatives elsewhere (see Fig. 1 for an exampie).
Two factors were manipulated in a 2 (decisions made
either with or without time pressure) X 2 (choice conflict
was high or low) between-subjects design. We used two
alternatives since previous research has suggested that
decision makers are likely to use a more compensatory
decision process in such a situation (e.g., Payne 1976).
Time pressure was manipulated by either giving subjects
a total of 45 seconds to complete the survey (15 seconds
per product category), or by allowing subjects an unlimited amount of time to make decisions.' Time pressure
was manipulated in a group setting (there were small
groups of about 20 subjects) by telling the respondents
in the time-pressure conditions that they had a certain
amount of time to complete each decision. We then
marked on the board each five-second increment until the
15 seconds were completed, and subjects were told there
was no more time, and they had to move onto the next

time available was pretested {N = 30 students) to insure that
subjects would have just enough time to complete the survey.

another store.

problem, where we repeated the procedure. Other research
has also used such a method (e.g., Stiensmeier-Pelster and
Schurmann 1993; Svenson and Benson 1993; Verplanken
1993). As a manipulation check, following Edland
(1994), respondents were asked after completing all
problems, (1) "How much time pressure did you feel
when making your choices?" on a 1-9 scale with endpoints of "no pressure" and "very much pressure" and,
(2) "How fast did you need to make your decisions?"
also on a 1-9 scale with endpoints of "not at all fast"
and "very fast." In studies 2 and 3, time pressure was
manipulated in a similar manner and followed by the
same manipulation checks.
The choice set consisted of options that were either
relatively equal in attractiveness (i.e., high conflict) or
options where one alternative was clearly superior to the
other option in the set (i.e., low conflict). For instance,
in the category of cordless telephones, in the high conflict
condition the choice was between an AT&T brand priced
at $89.99, which offered "range from set = 100 feet; 10
channels for great sound; speakerphone," and a Cobra
brand priced at $49.99, which offered "range from set
= 200 feet; 5 channels for good sound; speakerphone."
In the low conflict condition one option was constructed
to be clearly superior to the other option. For example.

in the category of cordless telephones, consumers were
shown a Cobra brand and an AT&T brand (the relatively
superior option) where both options offered the same
features and had the same price, so that the AT&T would
seem superior." Respondents made choices in the following three product categories, with one category on each
page of the survey: cordless telephones, cameras, and
binoculars. Each alternative was described on five different attributes.

Results
Hypothesis 1 predicts that the proportion of respondents that select the deferral option will decrease under
time pressure when choice conflict is high but not when
choice conflict is low. A logit model was constructed to
test Hypothesis 1. The dependent variable was whether

"A pretest (N = 44 students) was conducted in which the brands
testing Hypothesis 1 were rated in terms of (1) overall product quality
and (2) brand performance. On both scales, the low quality brands were
rated significantly lower than the high quality brands (p < .05 for each
scale). In the condition involving conflict, we then matched these better
brands with a higher price, while in the condition involving no conflict,
these brands were both given the same price.

or not the no-choice option was selected and was modeled
as a function of the following independent dummy variables: (1) a variable indicating whether decisions were
made with or without time pressure, (2) a variable indicating whether the choice set consisted of the two alternatives that required making trade-offs or a choice set in
which one option was clearly superior, (3) a two-way
interaction between (1) and (2), which tests Hypothesis
1, and (4) five alternative-specific variables that capture
the mean tendency to select each alternative (e.g., Guadagni and Little 1983). Our logit analysis in this and
subsequent studies follows other research on choice (e.g.,
Dhar and Sherman 1996; Nowlis and Simonson 1996).
Consistent with Hypothesis 1, coefficient (3) above
was statistically significant (/ = 1.8, p < .05). In the
choice sets that involved trade-off comparisons, preference for the no-choice option decreased from 36 percent
to 21 percent when decisions were made under time pressure (see Table 1). However, in the choice sets where
one option was clearly superior, preference for the nochoice option did not change (from 22 percent to 22
percent) when decisions were made under time pressure.
This result was consistent across all three product categories. In addition, variables (1) and (2) in the logit model
were not significant {p > .20). There were also no significant interactions between (3) and the product category
dummies {p's > .20), indicating that the moderating effect of confiict on choice deferral was similar across product categories. Finally, the manipulation checks were averaged ( a = 0.91) together and showed subjects felt more
time pressure when they had less time to make their decisions (6.5 vs. 4.9, /7 < .01). In studies 2 and 3, the same
manipulation checks showed that respondents felt more
time pressure in the condition in which there was less
time to make choices {p < .01 for each study).

In particular, respondents under time pressure were more
likely to choose when the choice set consisted of two
equally attractive options (high conflict) but no more
likely to choose when the choice set consisted of two
options where one alternative was clearly superior (low
conflict). These results appear consistent with previous
findings that time pressure has a systematic effect on the
preferred strategy (e.g., Edland and Svenson 1993),
which impacts choice deferral by making the selection
decision easier (Dhar 1996). To the extent that time pressure increased the use of decision strategies that avoided
making trade-off comparisons and made the selection decision easier under high confiict, consumers were less
likely to defer choice.
Study 1 focused on the effect of time pressure on the
ease of selection for choice under confiict. In addition to
the ease of selection, the deferral decision is likely to
take into account the overall attractiveness of the selected
option. For instance, even if the choice between two items
is easy, a consumer is likely to select the deferral option
if this item is viewed as not being sufficiently attractive.
Although the attractiveness of an item depends on all its
features, time pressure is expected to alter the weighting
of its unique features and those that are shared with other
alternatives in the choice set, thereby impacting the deferral decision.
In line with previous research that suggests selectivity
in information processing under time pressure (e.g., Svenson and Maule 1993), consumers should be less likely
to process attribute information that is common to both
alternatives, as it may be seen as less beneficial compared
to information on the unique features of each alternative.^
In contrast, when there is no time pressure, choice confiict
may direct attention to the shared features in the selection
decision in an attempt to consider all relevant information
when resolving the confiict (Bettman et al. 1993). Although features that are common to alternatives in the
choice set do not help in making the selection decision,
the attractiveness of these features should be considered
in addition to the attractiveness of the unique features in
making the deferral decision. However, the primacy of
the selection decision over the deferral decision suggests
that time pressure may result in focusing on the same
features that were considered in making the selection decision (i.e., the unique features). This suggests that the
deferral decision process under time pressure may not
sufficiently consider the attractiveness of features that are
shared by the alternatives.
We examine how the underweighting of the common
features in the deferral decision process will affect choice
deferral under time pressure. We do so by manipulating
the attractiveness of the shared features. Under no time
pressure, the shared features may not affect the selection

Discussion
The results show that the degree of choice confiict
moderated the effect of time pressure on choice deferral.

'Recent research suggests that choice processes generally involve a
greater focus oti unique features iti relation to the common features of
the alternatives (Dhar and Sherman 1996; Houston and Sherman 1995).

decision but are likely to be considered during the deferral
decision. Hence, choice deferral should be lower when
the shared features are more attractive (e.g., two VCRs
both offer stereo sound) than when both options offer
less attractive common features (e.g., both VCRs only
offer mono sound). In contrast, respondents under time
pressure may continue to focus on the same features in
making a deferral decision as those that were considered
in the selection decision. Thus, the deferral decision is
less likely to take into account any improvements in the
attractiveness of the common features when choices are
made under time pressure. This discussion suggests the
following hypothesis, which was tested in study 2.
H2: Consumers will pay less attention to the common features in choice under time pressure.
Consequently, the decrease in choice deferral
due to an improvement in the attractiveness of
the shared features will be smaller when choices
are made under time pressure.

STUDY 2: INFLUENCE OF THE
ATTRACTIVENESS OF
COMMON FEATURES
Method
Subjects were 240 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. As in study 1, respondents
made choices between two alternatives in several different
product categories and were given the option of not
choosing either alternative. Two factors were manipulated
in a 2 (decisions made either with or without time pressure) X 2 (alternatives offered either relatively inferior
or relatively superior common features) between-subjects
design. For example, in the category of microwave ovens,
the common features were either "average power to cook
items in average amount of time" and "average size
which cannot fit in certain foods" (relatively inferior
common features) or "superior power to cook items very
quickly" and "large size which can fit in most any size
food" (relatively superior common features). In addition,
each microwave oven offered two unique features. Subjects made choices in the product categories of microwave
ovens, apartments, and automobiles.

Results
Hypothesis 2 predicted that choice deferral under time
pressure would be less sensitive to the improvement in
the attractiveness of the shared features of the alternatives
provided. A logit model similar to that used in study 1
was constructed to test Hypothesis 2. The dependent variable was whether or not the no-choice option was selected
and was modeled as a function of the following independent dummy variables: (1) a variable indicating whether
decisions were made with or without time pressure, (2)
a variable indicating whether the common features were

relatively inferior or superior, (3) a two-way interaction
between variables (1) and (2), which tests Hypothesis
2, and (4) five alternative-specific variables. Consistent
with Hypothesis 2, coefficient (3) above was statistically
significant {t = l.l, p < .05). When there was no time
pressure, the share of the no-choice option was 26 percent
when the options offered relatively superior common features and 68 percent (a change of 42 percent) when the
options offered relatively inferior common features (see
Table 2). In contrast, the preference for the no-choice
option increased from 18 percent to 47 percent (a change
of 29 percent) under time pressure. Thus, the share of
the no-choice option was significantly less sensitive to
the deterioration in the common features (by 13 percent
= 42 percent - 29 percent) under time pressure, as tested
by the logit model. Consistent with the first study, coefficient (1) in the model was significant (t = 2.8, p
< .01), as the overall choice incidence was greater when
decisions were made under time pressure by an average
of 15 percent (these choice sets correspond to the high
conflict situations). In addition, coefficient (2) in the
model was significant (t = 6.8, p < .01), which shows
that subjects were more likely to choose when the common features were very attractive, as would be expected.
Finally, there were no significant interactions between (3)
and the product category dummies {p's> .20), indicating
that the effect of common features on choice deferral was
similar across product categories.

Discussion
The results from study 2 support the notion that choice
deferral under time pressure is less sensitive to the attractiveness of the shared features. In particular, under time
pressure, the deferral decision was more likely to follow
the selection decision in its focus on the unique features
of the alternatives. Without time pressure, however, the
deferral decision was more likely to consider the attractiveness of the shared features.
While the first two studies focused generally on con-

flict, one can distinguish between conflict that arises between attractive alternatives (approach-approach) from
that based on choice between unattractive options (avoidance-avoidance; e.g., Miller 1944; Schneider 1992).
Thus, besides looking at the degree of conflict as in study
1, we can also examine how the type of conflict might
moderate choice deferral under time pressure. While prior
research has shown that deferral is greater for avoidanceavoidance choices (Murray 1975), recent studies have
induced the two types of conflict by altering the relationship among the alternatives that are compared. Specifically, since selection decisions are likely to eliminate
shared features, the two types of conflict can be produced

preceding arguments, time pressure should have a greater
effect on choice deferral when the choice set consists of
unique good pairs than when the choice set consists of
unique bad pairs. We tested Hypothesis 3 in study 3.
H3: The type of choice conflict moderates the effect
of time pressure on choice deferral. Specifically, the percentage of respondents selecting
the deferral option decreases under time pressure when consumers are choosing from unique
good pairs (approach-approach conflict) but not
when consumers are choosing from unique bad
pairs (avoidance-avoidance conflict).

by providing alternatives that share their attractive or their
unattractive features. Following prior research (e.g., Dhar
and Sherman 1996; Houston and Sherman 1995), we

consider cases where the options (1) share bad features
and offer unique good features and (2) share good features and offer unique bad features. Thus, the choice may
be experienced as approach-approach or avoidance-avoidance conflict depending on whether the good or the bad
features of the two alternatives are seen as unique.
Our assumption of a greater focus on unique features
under time pressure suggests that choice deferral will vary
systematically depending on the type of choice set outlined above. When options offer common bad and unique
good features, we expect the common (bad) features to
receive less weight under time pressure in the deferral
decision, as per Hypothesis 2. Since both alternatives offer unique good features, this would result in them being
viewed as more attractive in relation to the no time-pressure condition where attention is also paid to the shared
(bad) features. Further, the greater use of a noncompensatory decision rule under time pressure also increases the
ease of the selection decision. Thus, for sets with common
bad and unique good features (hereafter referred to as
unique good pairs), the ease of the selection decision as
well as the reduced attention on the shared bad features
under time pressure should decrease choice deferral.
When the options in the set offer common good and
unique bad features, the deferral decision process will
underweight the common (good) features under time
pressure, as per Hypothesis 2. In this case, however, an
increased emphasis on the unique features, which are bad,
will make both alternatives seem less attractive and
should increase choice deferral. Thus, the deferral decision process suggests that, in this case, time pressure will
increase choice deferral. On the other hand, the selection
decision process might lead to the opposite effect, as
respondents under time pressure are more likely to use a
noncompensatory decision rule, which increases the ease
of the selection decision. These opposing forces in the
selection and deferral stages make it less clear how choice
deferral will be affected by time pressure when the options offer common good and unique bad features (unique
bad pairs). This leads to Hypothesis 3, which predicts
that the type of conflict will moderate the effect of time
pressure on choice deferral. Specifically, in line with the

STUDY 3: THE MODERATING
EFFECT OF THE TYPE

OF CHOICE CONFLICT
Method
Subjects were 262 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. Respondents made
choices between two alternatives in three different product categories and had the option of not choosing either
alternative, as in prior studies (see Fig. 2). Two factors
were manipulated in a 2 (decisions made either with or
without time pressure) X 2 (alternatives had either common bad features and unique good features, or alternatives
had common good features and unique bad features) between-subjects design. As an example of a choice set with
common good features and unique bad features, subjects
chose between "Apartment A " and "Apartment B , "
which both offered "good new furniture and has dishwasher and refrigerator," and "Apartment A " had " a
high security deposit and no parking," while "Apartment
B " had "high rent and up four flights of stairs." Thus,
each alternative offered four features (two unique and
two common). In the condition with unique good pairs,
subjects chose between two apartments where both had
"high security deposit and no parking," while one apartment offered "new wall-to-wall carpeting and color TV
with cable" and the other apartment offered "good new
furniture and has dishwasher and refrigerator." Three
product categories were tested, including apartments, automobiles, and vacations, and the features for these categories were adapted from Dhar and Sherman (1996).

Results
We predicted that the type of choice conflict would
moderate the effect of time pressure on choice deferral.
Time pressure is expected to decrease deferral when respondents are choosing between unique good pairs but
produce no systematic effect when they are choosing between unique bad pairs. A logit model like the ones used
in the first two studies was constructed to test Hypothesis
3. The dependent variable was whether or not the nochoice option was selected and was modeled as a function

without time pressure, (2) a variable indicating whether
the choice set consisted of unique good or unique bad
pairs, (3) a two-way interaction between (1) and (2),
which tests Hypothesis 3, and (4) five alternative-specific
variables. Consistent with Hypothesis 3, coefficient (3)
above was statistically significant (t = 2.8,/? < .01). For
choice between unique good pairs, the share of the nochoice option was 56 percent, and decreased to 29 percent
under time pressure (see Table 3). However, in the choice
sets with unique bad pairs, the share of the no-choice
option did not significantly change (56 percent vs. 53
percent) when decisions were made under time pressure.
In all three categories, the share of the no-choice option
decreased significantly under time pressure when the options in the set offered common bad and unique good
features. In addition, coefficient (1) in the model was
significant {t = 3.8, p < .01) and coefficient (2) was
also significant (t = 3.l,p < .01). Finally, there were no
significant interactions between (3), the coefficient of
interest, and the product category dummies {p's > .20),
indicating that the moderating effect of the type of conflict
on choice deferral under time pressure was similar across
product categories.

Discussion
The three studies so far have focused on how time pressure affects the selection and deferral decision processes,
and thereby choice deferral. Study 1 shows that the effect
of time pressure on choice deferral depends on the degree
of conflict; when choice conflict is high, time pressure

<-----Page 8----->377

CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE

can simplify the selection decision and decrease deferral.
Studies 2 and 3 show that the type of conflict is also
important in determining the effect of time pressure on
choice deferral. Study 2 finds that common features are
less likely to be considered in the deferral decision process
under time pressure. This makes choice deferral under time
pressure less sensitive to an improvement in the attractiveness of the shared features. Study 3 finds that unique
features are more likely to drive the deferral decision under
time pressure. When choice resembles approach-approach
conflict, time pressure decreases choice deferral by increasing the attention paid to the unique good features and by
making the selection decision easier through the use of a
noncompensatory strategy. In contrast, when choice resembles avoidance-avoidance conflict, time pressure makes the
alternatives appear less attractive in the deferral decision
through the greater focus on the unique bad features, but
also makes the selection decision easier with no significant
effect on choice deferral.
We focused on two aspects of the decision process in
making our predictions: (1) time pressure increases the
use of noncompensatory decision rules in making the selection decision, and (2) time pressure decreases the focus
on shared features in making the deferral decision. Although the results presented are consistent with our premise, the first three studies had some limitations. First,
although utmost care was taken to ensure that subjects
followed the instructions about the amount of time to be
spent on each problem, the paper and pencil methodology
makes it difficult to be certain that subjects followed the
instructions exactly as described. Second, although the
results are consistent with the proposed shift in information processing under time pressure, we did not observe
the processing strategies that were used by the subjects.
An alternative explanation for the results could be that
subjects under time pressure who faced a difficult choice
did not have the time to consider the deferral option, as
it comes after the selection decision.* One advantage of
observing the choice processes is that these can then be
used to perform a mediational test for the proposed differences in the underlying mechanisms. The next two studies
use the Mouselab program (Johnson et al. 1993) in order
to measure the decision processes that underlie our
hypotheses: the ease of the selection decision due to a
greater use of noncompensatory decision rules and the
selective weighting of unique features under time pressure. Furthermore, we test whether the use of a noncompensatory decision strategy is indeed what is mediating
the effect of time pressure on choice deferral.
H4: The degree of noncompensatory decision processing mediates the effect of time pressure on
choice deferral.

"•Noie thai this explanation applies more to the results of study 1 but
cannot explain the difference in deferral under time pressure observed
in study 3.

STUDY 4: THE MEDIATING EEFECT
OE THE DECISION PROCESS
Method
Subjects were 143 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. The task and instructions
were similar to the previous studies. One group of subjects
made choices without any time limits, and the other group
was given 15 seconds for each choice problem in three
different product categories: televisions, microwave ovens, and cameras. As in study 1, the options were relatively equal in attractiveness (i.e., high conflict), with
each described on several features (see Fig. 3 for an example). For instance, in the category of televisions, the two
options varied on the following five features: picture quality (on a scale of 0 to 100), number of speakers, size of
screen, other, and price. Television A offered a picture
quality of 85, six speakers, an 18-inch screen, a sleep
timer, and was priced at $179. Television B offered a
picture quality of 95, two speakers, a 24-inch screen, sleep
timer, and was priced at $249.
The experiment was conducted using Mouselab, a computer-based process tracing technique. Information was
displayed in closed boxes presented in an option X attribute matrix, where subjects could reveal the information
in each box by moving a mouse-controlled cursor to the
relevant box. Mouselab recorded which boxes were
opened, in what sequence, and how much time was spent
in each box. Subjects began the experiment with instructions on how to access information in the boxes by using
the mouse. They then completed a practice problem before making decisions in each of the three categories.
For those in the time-pressure condition, a small circle
appeared on the screen, which ticked down as the time
available was reduced. If subjects did not make a choice
before the time was used, the program beeped, instructed
them to "please make a choice or indicate a value," and
would not allow them to open any more boxes. Similar
to the previous studies, subjects were provided with the
no-choice option. Finally, after all choices were made,
subjects were asked, as a manipulation check, "How
much time pressure did you feel when making decisions?" and responded on a scale of 0 (no time pressure)
to 10 (great time pressure).
As with other time-pressure research that has used
Mouselab (e.g., Payne et al. 1988), we calculated different measures that can provide evidence of the degree
to which subjects use noncompensatory or compensatory processing strategies. First, we calculated the nutnber of acquisitions of each piece of information, referred
to as ACQ. Second, we measured the average time spent
acquiring each piece of information, known as TPERACQ. Third, we calculated the variance in the proportion of time spent on each attribute, referred to as VAR.
Finally, we calculated the relative degree to which subjects made attribute or alternative-based transitions. For
example, if a subject first checked the price of one tele-

Welcome! On the next screens you will be asked to make several decisions and to answer more questions during this experiment. There are no
right or wrong answers. You will only need the mouse in front of you to

(Next page). During this experiment, you will make decisions based on information you collect from the computer screen (subjects are then given additional mformation oti usitig the Mouselab program and complete a practice

advances).
(Next page). Next, imagine that you are shopping for a television set. One
of the features, which we describe as Quality/Reliability ratings, is taken
from Consumer Reports where " 0 " means very bad quality/reliability, and
"100" means perfect quality/reliability. You may now proceed to the next
question. At the bottom of the next screen, you will be asked to indicate
whether or not you would buy one of these televisions. You can choose to
buy neither of them (and go to another store), choose the first television, or
choose the second television.

this would be coded as an attribute-based transition, but
if they first checked the price of one television and then
the picture quality of that same television, this would
be coded as an alternative-based transition. The measure
we used is the number of alternative-based transitions
minus the number of attribute-based transitions divided
by the total number of alternative-based and attributebased transitions combined, known as PATTERN (see,
e.g., Payne 1976; Payne et al. 1988; Sen 1998; Sen and
Johnson 1997). PATTERN can range from +1.0 to
- 1 . 0 with more negative values representing more attribute-based processing. Prior research has found that under time pressure there are (1) fewer ACQ, (2) reduced
TPERACQ, (3) greater VAR, and (4) a more negative

PATTERN (e.g., Payne et al. 1988). We expect to replicate these results, so as to show that processing indeed
was following more of a noncompensatory process under time pressure.
However, of more importance to this research is to
show through a mediation analysis that the use of a
noncompensatory process under time pressure is indeed
what may be driving the difference in the share of the
deferral option. In particular, to show mediation, we
must demonstrate three relationships (Baron and Kenny
1986). Eirst, we must show that the independent variable, time pressure, significantly affects the mediator,
the measure of noncompensatory processing. Second,
we must show that the processing measure significantly
affects the dependent variable, choice deferral. Third,

we must show that the effect of time pressure on choice
deferral is reduced or eliminated if the processitig measure is also included.

Results
Choice Effects. As was shown in study 1, we found
that consumers under time pressure were less likely to
defer choice for options that are relatively equal in attractiveness. Averaged across the three categories, 21 percent
of subjects chose the deferral option without time pressure
and 9 percent selected it under time pressure (Table 4 ) .
A logit model like the one used in study 1 showed this
effect to be significant (; = 2.9, p < .0\). The direction
of these results was consistent across all three categories.
In addition, the results from the manipulation check
showed that those with limited time felt significantly more
time pressure than those with unlimited time (X = 6.2
vs. K = 2.9, F ( l , 142) = 55.7, p < .001). In study 5,
subjects also felt significantly more time pressure when
decision time was limited {p < .001).
Processing Effects. We next examined the process
measures. As expected, subjects acquired fewer pieces of
information (ACQ) when making decisions under time
pressure {X = 15.9, X = 11.6, F ( l , 427) = 51.0,
p < .001). In addition, they spent less time per each acquisition (TPERACQ) when making decisions under time
pressure {X = 0.74, X = 0.60, F ( l , 427) = 109.9,
p < .001). In terms of the variance spent examining each
attribute (VAR), there was greater variance under time
pressure (X = 0.033, ^T = 0.024, F ( l , 427) = 12.9,
p < .01). These results are consistent with Payne et al.
(1988). Finally, there was no significant difference in the
relative degree of attribute-based processing (PATTERN) across the time-pressure conditions (X = -0.276
without time pressure vs. X = -0.284 with time pressure,
p > .50). This may in part be due to the fact that PATTERN assumes that attribute based transitions reveal a
more noncompensatory decision process. However, when
there are only two alternatives, a compensatory strategy

that is often used is the additive-difference rule even
though it involves more attribute-based transitions (Dhar
1996; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997).
Mediation Analyses. Hypothesis 4 predicts that
choice processing under time pressure is likely to be noncompensatory, which in turn will mediate the change in
choice deferral. We completed the mediation analysis,
using VAR, which has previously been shown to vary
with the mode of processing (e.g., Payne et al. 1988). As
mentioned above, we found that VAR was significantly
affected by time pressure, satisfying the first criterion for
mediation. Next, we found that VAR has a significant
relationship on choice deferral {t = 2.2, p < .05), which
satisfies the second criterion for mediation. Einally, the
third criterion of mediation also receives support, as the
effect of time pressure on choice deferral is much weaker
when VAR is included as a variable (? = 1.5, p < .10,
vs. t = 2.9, p < .01, as mentioned above). Thus, in
support of Hypothesis 4, the mediation analysis shows
that VAR at least partially mediates the effect of time
pressure on choice deferral.
As stated previously, although the deferral decision
should consider both shared and unique features, the primacy of the selection decision increases the likelihood of
focusing on the same features that were considered in the
selection decision (i.e., the unique features) when choices
are made under time pressure (e.g., Dhar 1997; Tversky
and Shafir 1992). If such a decision process is indeed
driving the results, it suggests that the relative attention
paid to the common features even under time pressure
can be increased by modifying the nature of the task.
Specifically, if the task is represented as a store choice
(i.e., whether to buy from a store), the selection decision
is eliminated, and subjects should be equally likely to
attend to unique and common features even under time
pressure. Thus, the usual primacy of the selection decision
over the deferral decision may be reversed, depending on
the decision task. We test this hypothesis for the case
where alternatives offer unique good and common bad
features (unique good pairs). In study 3, which looked
at brand choice, we found that the share of the deferral
option was lower under time pressure for unique good
pairs. Since time pressure is not expected to increase the
attention paid to the unique (good) features for a storechoice task, it should have no systematic effect on deferral. We examine these predictions in the next study
using Mouselab.
H5a: The ratio of unique to common features examined is greater under time pressure for the
brand choice task.
H5b: The degree to which unique and common features are examined under time pressure is
moderated by the decision task. Specifically,
the relative attention paid to unique features
compared to common features increases under
time pressure for brand choice but not for store
choice.

STUDY 5: REVERSING THE
PRECEDENCE OF THE SELECTION
DECISION OVER THE DEFERRAL
DECISION
Method
Subjects were 166 undergraduate marketing students
fulfilling a course requirement. Two factors were manipulated in a 2 (time pressure or none) X 2 (brand choice
or store choice) between-subjects design. As in study 4,
this study was conducted using Mouselab. In this study,
subjects in the time-pressure condition were given 18
seconds for each choice problem in three different product
categories: portable computers, restaurants, and automobiles. All items offered three unique good features and
three common bad features. For example, in the restaurants category, subjects chose between Restaurant A,
which offered ' 'good desserts and drinks, wide selection,
and easy to get to," and Restaurant B, which offered
"good appetizers, good entrees, and plenty of parking."
Both restaurants had a ' 'long wait, dull atmosphere, and
unfriendly waiters." As in prior studies, half the subjects
had to decide whether they would eat at Restaurant A,
Restaurant B, or neither/go to another restaurant (hereafter referred to as "brand choice"). The other half of the
subjects were told that both restaurants were in a particular mall, and they had to decide whether they would
choose this mall or go to another mall (hereafter referred
to as "store choice"). Finally, we checked the success
of the time-pressure manipulation by asking the same
question from study 4.

Results
We tested Hypothesis 5 by investigating the ratio of
unique to common features that were examined. To do
this, we constructed a value for each respondent, which
was the number of unique features examined minus the
number of common features examined divided by the
total number of unique and common features examined
(which is similar in style to PATTERN used in study 4).
The value of this number can range from -h 1.0 to - 1 . 0 ,
with positive numbers indicating a greater focus on
unique features and negative numbers indicating a greater
focus on common features. An ANOVA model was then
constructed with this ratio as the dependent measure and
with the time pressure manipulation and the store/brand
choice manipulation as the two independent variables.
The interaction of these two variables tests Hypothesis 5b,
while the simple effect of the time pressure manipulation
within the brand choice decision tests Hypothesis 5a.
Consistent with Hypothesis 5a, consumers focused more

on unique features than common features when deciding
under time pressure for brand choice (X = 0.334 vs.
0.179, F ( l , 247) = 19.1, p < .001). This result is consistent with our assumption in studies 2 and 3. In addition,
and consistent with Hypothesis 5b, the interaction was
significant ( F ( l , 496) = 7.5, p < .01). Compared to
brand choice, there was no difference across time pressure
on the ratio of unique to common features examined in
store choice (X = 0.149 vs. X = 0.154).
Next, we examine the results pertaining to Hypothesis
6, which predicts that choice deferral will decrease under
time pressure for brand choice but not for store choice.
We constructed a logit model to test Hypothesis 6, which
was similar to those used in the first three studies. This
model included the main effect of time pressure, the main
effect of brand/store choice, product category dummies,
and the interactions. Hypothesis 6 is tested by the interaction between time pressure and whether subjects made
brand or store choices. As predicted, we found that choice
deferral decreased under time pressure for brand choice
(by 13 percent) but was relatively unchanged for store
choice (an increase of 2 percent). The interaction from
the logit model testing this effect was significant (t = 2.0,
p < .05) and was consistent across all three product categories (Table 5). Since subjects were more likely to consider common (bad) features in store choice decisions,
there was also a significant main effect for brand/store
choice (t = 5.7, p < .01), indicating that subjects were
overall more likely to defer in store choice.

Discussion
This study found that the ratio of unique to common
features examined is greater under time pressure for brand
choice (Hypothesis 5a), which is consistent with our explanation for the results obtained in study 3. We also
found that this ratio is greater for brand choice than store
choice under time pressure (Hypothesis 5b). Accordingly, choice deferral was lower under time pressure for
the brand-choice task but not for the store-choice task,
supporting Hypothesis 6. This study lends important in-

<-----Page 12----->CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE

sights into previous work on deferral, suggesting that an
increase in choice deferral due to choice conflict arises
because of the primacy of the selection decision over the
deferral decision. Conversely, when subjects view the task
as whether or not to choose from a choice set, they are
more likely to consider all relevant features even under
time pressure.
In addition to examining decision processes using
Mouselab, we conducted a separate study that examined
the memory for attributes under time pressure (e.g.,
Nowlis 1995). Research on consumer memory suggests
that if an attribute can be recalled, then it is likely that it
served as an input for choice (Lynch, Marmorstein, and
Weigold 1988). If common features receive relatively
less weight than unique features when decisions are made
under time pressure, we would expect better recall for
unique features compared to common features when time
is limited. We conducted a study that measured the recall
of common and unique features for the options with
unique good, common bad features and unique bad, common good features. Subjects were 231 undergraduate marketing students fulfilling a course requirement. Two factors were manipulated in a 2 (decision made either with
or without time pressure) X 2 (alternatives had either
three common bad features and three unique good features, or alternatives had three common good features and
three unique bad features) between-subjects design. After
subjects had made their choices and without prior warning, they were asked to recall as many features as they
could from the last category they had seen, vacations. We
found that when decisions were made under time pressure
an average of 1.3 unique features each and 0.6 common
features were correctly recalled, for a ratio of 2.17. Without time pressure, on the other hand, an average of 1.4
unique features each and 1.1 common features were correctly recalled, for a ratio of 1.27. The difference between
these ratios is significant (t = 2.4, p < .01), further
supporting the Mouselab findings in study 5.

DISCUSSION
Consumers often face situations that require making
decisions quickly. We examined the effect of time pressure on choice deferral to gain a better understanding of
decision making under time constraints and the processes
that underlie choice deferral. We proposed that time pressure influences choice deferral by altering the ease of
deciding which option to choose (the selection decision)
as well as by increasing the weight of unique features
in determining whether or not to choose (the deferral
decision). Conceptually, the choice of the deferral option
can decrease under time pressure either if the selection
decision is made easier or if the information that is attended to in the deferral decision process makes the options seem more attractive. Our studies examined the effect of time pressure on choice deferral by (1) testing
predictions regarding choice deferral for different degrees
and types of choice conflict and thus considered conflict

381
to be a moderating influence, (2) using process tracing
methodologies to gain support for the proposed mechanisms and showing that the use of a noncompensatory
rule can mediate the relationship, and (3) testing the
boundaries under which the predicted effects operate.
These studies are summarized next.
We first examined the effect of the degree of choice
conflict when decisions were made under time pressure.
When choice conflict was high and there was no time
pressure, consumers were likely to make trade-off comparisons, which made the selection decision difficult and
resulted in choice deferral. However, since time pressure
increased the use of noncompensatory decision rules that
made the selection decision easier, we anticipated and
found that choice deferral decreased for decisions involving high conflict. In contrast, when choice conflict was
low by virtue of a choice set with a clearly superior alternative, time pressure had no effect on the ease of selection, and there was no difference in choice deferral in
relation to the no time-pressure condition. Thus, this study
provided some initial support for the idea that the degree
of choice conflict moderates the effect of time pressure
on choice deferral.
The next two studies examined how the attractiveness
of the alternatives is altered by the deferral decision process under time pressure, which then affects choice deferral. In one study, we showed that the increased focus
on the unique relative to the common features under time
pressure made choice deferral less sensitive to the attractiveness of the common features. In another study, we
examined how time pressure systematically influenced
choice deferral in sets that offered common and unique
features that were either good or bad. When the options
in the choice set offered common bad and unique good
features, consumers choosing under time pressure were
expected to find the alternatives more attractive by placing
less weight on the common features and to find the selection decision easier by using a noncompensatory rule.
However, when the options in the choice set offered common good features and unique bad features, time pressure
was expected to decrease the attractiveness of the options
by increasing attention on the unique bad features but also
to make it easier to choose by using a noncompensatory
decision rule. Overall, we expected and found that time
pressure reduced choice deferral when the options offered
unique good and common bad features but not when they
offered unique bad and common good features. Thus,
there was support for the proposition that the type of
conflict moderates the relationship between time pressure
and choice deferral.
We next used Mouselab to examine the two proposed
underlying mechanisms. In one study we replicated prior
research showing an increased use of noncompensatory
strategies under time pressure and found that an increased
use of noncompensatory strategies at least partially seems
to mediate the effect of time pressure on choice deferral.
Thus, we found support for our premise that changes in
selection-decision strategies are responsible for the de-

these studies have not considered the option of choice

involving conflict. In a second study using Mouselab, we
contrasted what we had found for brand-choice decisions
(selection and deferral decisions) with what might be
expected for store-choice decisions (pure deferral decisions). We predicted and found that in brand-choice decisions, consumers under time pressure focused more on
unique features than common features, whereas for storechoice decisions, there was no significant change in the
weight placed on the common features. This suggests that
the greater attention on the unique features is not a general
property of decision making under time pressure but
rather a consequence of respondents making the selection
decision before the deferral decision when the deferral
option is provided.

deferral. An interesting question is whether the type of
decision processes observed in the current studies are
consistent with the notion of an adaptive decision maker.
In this case, the normative benchmark against which judgments of accuracy are compared would have to take into
account the reservation utility of the individual. Generally
speaking, the neglect of shared features is problematic
for an adaptive framework since whether or not a feature
is considered in a deferral decision should depend on its
importance weight and not whether it is shared or unique
in the choice set provided.
Our research was confined to simple binary choice sets.
Another line of future research might look at the effect
of the number of brands in the choice set when choices
are made under time pressure. For instance, a number of
studies have shown that consumers prefer the middle option in a three-option choice set when conflict is high
(Simonson and Tversky 1992). In such a case, we would
expect that the share of the compromise option would
decrease under time pressure as subjects would use noncompensatory rules that favored extreme options. Indeed,
the authors have conducted such a study and found the
predicted effects (Dhar, Nowlis, and Sherman 1998).

Theoretical Implications
Recent consumer research has examined how conflict
influences decision processes and outcomes when the nochoice option is provided. In addition, previous work has
shown how decision processes in forced choice are affected by time constraints. The aim of this article was to
show how systematic changes in the selection and deferral
decision processes due to time pressure would combine
to influence choice deferral. To the extent that selection
decisions precede deferral decisions and both are influenced systematically by the amount of time available, it
extends our understanding of factors and mechanisms that
lead to choice deferral in particular and consumer decision
making in general.
Past research on time pressure has focused on singlestage decisions. A general implication of our findings is
that time pressure will systematically distort choices when
decision making requires multiple stages. In particular,
research has shown that modifying decision sequences
can have a systematic impact on the option that is chosen
(e.g., Hauser 1986; Simonson, Nowlis, and Lemon
1993). To the extent that time pressure is going to have
more severe effects on later stages of decision making,
one can make predictions about the precise pattern of
choices that will be observed in multistage decision making. Moreover, modifying the sequence of the selection
and deferral decisions may result in different degrees of
choice deferral for the same choice set. For instance, if
unique features are more salient when the deferral decision is made after the selection decision, it suggests that
altering the sequence of the two stages (asking consumers
to first decide whether to choose and then which to
choose) may alter the focus on unique and shared features
and, consequently, the likelihood of deferral (Dhar and
Nowlis 1999).
Our approach primarily assumed that time constraints
are similar to other task-related factors that influence the
relative costs and benefits involved in information processing (Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993). Although
past research suggests that strategies shift in adapting to
the task by making efficient effort-accuracy trade-offs.

Marketing Implications
The effect of context on choice deferral suggests that
managers should consider not only the attribute values of
their brands but also the relationship among the available
alternatives. For instance, choice deferral may be greater
when no single alternative is easily seen as the best, even
though each option by itself is quite attractive. Additionally, we know that a number of decisions are made by
consumers under time pressure and that consumers often
spend a limited amount of time making decisions in many
product categories. To the extent that the effect of context
on deferral varies with time constraints, it is important to
determine how time pressed is the consumer while shopping in a given category. In this vein, the effect of increased brand proliferation on deferral is likely to be diminished in categories where subjects choose using
simple noncompensatory rules.
Many real world situations involve choice among several attractive alternatives that require difficult trade-offs.
To the extent that decision difficulty increases deferral,
marketers should try to persuade consumers to use strategies that decrease selection difficulty and thus choice deferral. The current research shows that one way to induce
choice would be for the seller to generate time constraints
where none exist. As an example, consider someone looking for a new apartment who is deciding among several
attractive options. In this case, the realtor could casually
mention that there is a second prospective consumer and
that these apartments are available if the lease is signed
immediately. This technique may be successful even
when there is very little uncertainty of losing one of the
alternatives. For instance, electronic stores often give a

<-----Page 14----->CHOICE DEFERRAL UNDER TIME PRESSURE
nominal discount if the consumer makes an immediate
purchase decision. Although the discount may itself provide an incentive to purchase, adding the time constraint
may also restructure the decision in a manner that makes
the choice easier. In addition, there is an increasing number of Internet sites that auction products. Many of these
sites give a limited amount of time in which to bid for
the products, and since difficult trade-offs are likely to
be involved, this might encourage consumers to be more
likely to make a choice.
Recent research has shown that the characteristics of
the products to which new features are added are important determinants of the impact of these features (e.g.,
Nowlis and Simonson 1996). Our findings suggest that,
more generally, the impact of unique features is even
greater when decisions are made under time pressure.
This would suggest that relatively unimportant features
that are seen as unique may be particularly useful in differentiating options and determining choice when consumers have a limited amount of time to decide. For
instance, features that are actually irrelevant such as
"fiaked coffee crystal" can appear to be valuable in certain contexts (Carpenter, Glazer, and Nakamoto 1994),
and such an effect might become even more pronounced
when decisions are made under time pressure.
