UNCERTAINTY: A COMMON APPROACH*

This paper considers a number of parallels between risky and intertemporal choice. We begin
by demonstrating a one-to-one correspondence between the behavioral violations of the respective
normative theories for the two domains (i.e., expected utility and discounted utility models). We
argue that such violations (or preference reversals) are broadly consistent with three propositions
about the weight that an attribute receives in both types of multiattribute choice. Specifically, it
appears that: ( 1 ) if we add a constant to all values of an attribute, then that attribute becomes
less important; (2) if we proportionately increase all values of an attribute, or if we change the
sign of an attribute, from positive to negative, then that attribute becomes more important. The
generality of these propositions, as well as the constraints they would impose on separable representations of multiattribute preferences, is discussed.
(TIME PREFERENCE; TIME DISCOUNTING; INTERTEMPORAL CHOICE; DECISION
MAKING UNDER UNCERTAINTY; CHOICE ANOMALIES)

1. Introduction
The expected utility (EU) and discounted utility (DU) models provide easy access to
the interconnected domains of time and uncertainty. Parallel in structure, both models
view decision makers as selecting between alternativesbased on a weighted sum of utilities,
with the weights being either probabilities (for EU) or discount factors based on time
delays (for DU). EU and DU have been applied to such diverse topics as labor supply,
saving behavior, crime, and fertility,and continue to be broadly utilized as both descriptive
and normative models of choice despite growing criticism of their assumptions and implications and an onslaught of alternative formulations.
The initial appeal of the two theories was due, no doubt, to their formal simplicity,
and their close similarity to the familiar financial calculations of actuarial value and
present value. Subsequent axiomatic derivations-by von Neumann and Morgenstern
(1953) for EU, and Koopmans (1960) for DU-have clarified the logic behind these
calculations, and have brought to the surface the fundamental assumptions that justify
them. These turn out to be surprisingly few in number, and relatively easy to accept, at
least when presented in a transparent formal context.
In parallel with the axiomatic development, however, researchers have uncovered a
growing number of "anomalous" examples, indicating that people reliably violate the
EU and DU axioms when confronted with certain special configurations of choices. The
EU anomalies, and especially the Allais paradox, have stimulated the development of
theoretical alternatives to expected utility (e.g., Kahneman and Tversky 1979, Machina
1982). In contrast, until recently (Loewenstein and Prelec forthcoming), the discounted
utility violations have not been documented or subjected to the same intense discussion
and exposure.
In this paper we draw attention to some remarkable parallels between EU and DU
violations, and, more importantly, propose that the existence of such "matching" violations is not coincidental, but ratherreflectscertain fundamental psychological properties

of multidimensional prospect evaluation. These properties concern the weight that attributes receive in decision making as a function of their magnitude. Our analysis is
restricted to simple prospects consisting of a single nonzero outcome which is to be
received either with a given probability, or at a specified point in time. In subsequent
papers (Loewenstein and Prelec 1989, 1991) we detail a variety of "sequential choice
anomalies" applicable to temporal prospects with multiple outcomes and extend our
theoretical analysis of simple prospects to explain them.
EU and DU are at once excessively restrictive and unnecessarily vague in their specification of attribute weighting. They are too restrictive regardingthe nonmoney attribute
(probability and time), and not sufficiently restrictive toward the money attribute. For
example, DU makes the extreme assumption that people are sensitive to only absolute
time delays-that a given time delay has the same impact on choice regardlessof when
it occurs. The empirical observation that people tend to view a given absolute time delay
as more significant if it occurs earlier is the source of one important DU anomaly. EU's
similarly rigid assumption about probability weighting-namely that only relative probabilities matter-leads to an analogous EU anomaly. In their specification of the money
attribute, however, both models are quite vague. Beyond the assumption of decreasing
marginal utility, which is in any case not integral to either model, virtually any pattern
of weighting is permissible.
By treating the money and nonmoney dimensions commensurably-by relaxing the
restrictions on the nonmoney dimension, while simultaneously adding new restrictions
to the money dimension-we show that it is possible to explain the basic patterns of
anomalous choice in both domains. With one notable exception, the weighting of money,
time, and probability each conform to three simple patterns that we label "decreasing
absolute sensitivity," "increasing relative sensitivity" and "loss amplification."
The paper starts with a brief discussion of the central implications of the normative
theories in ?2. ?3 summarizes, and draws connections between the anomalies and paradoxes that have been uncovered so far in both domains. The theoretical core of the
paper, in ?4, presents a diagnosis of the sources of these violations, in the form of three
properties of attribute weighting that can explain most of the basic choice patterns in
decision making under uncertainty and intertemporalchoice. ?5 develops a multiplicative
choice model that embodies the three properties, and ?6 discusses evidence supporting
and challenging the model.
2. The Normative Models
Encoding or "Framing" Assumptions
The common startingpoint for any normative theory is the establishmentof a particular
canonical format for describingthe choice objects distinguishedby the theory. In expected
utility theory, it is traditional to "integrate" outcomes into final wealth positions so that
the ultimate objects of choice are lotteries over aggregatelevels of wealth. For example,
a decision maker with wealth w would frame an option defined by
X

(x, p) a(x

Xp1; . .. ; xn, p,,)

as

(w + x, p)

(w + x1 Xp1; . . ; w + xn, Pn).

Discounted utility also typically assumes integration. In a standard application, individuals face choices between temporal prospects, which are (finite) collections of dated
consumption outcomes. A temporal prospect
X a (XX t) a(xI

X ti;

... .; x,i

tn)

indicates that outcome xi will be obtained at time ti. Often the time intervalsare presumed
to be equally spaced (i.e., they form a "consumption program" over successive periods
ti= it1), in which case one omits the t1 and expresses the prospects as an outcome

<-----Page 3----->DRAZEN PRELEC AND GEORGE LOEWENSTEIN

772

sequence (xl,... , x,). Integration, here, involves aggregatingnew consumption options
with existing plans. If the decision maker's existing plans call for (cl, . . . , c,), then by
accepting the prospect (xl, . . . , x,), the decision maker reveals a preference for
(cl + xi,

. . .

, cn + xn) over (cl,

. . .

, cn).

Both models have also been derived under the assumption that the final objects of
choice are outcomes evaluated without regard for existing consumption or wealth (see,
e.g., Fishburn and Rubinstein 1982, for time, and Fischer, Kamlet, Fienberg and Schkade
1986, for uncertainty). However, without the assumption of asset integration such models
can easily lead to suboptimal decisions if a person is confronted by repeated choices.
Without asset integration, for example, it is possible that a person who preferred $300
in one year to $200 today, if the decision were divided into two subsidiary choices, would
repeatedly prefer $100 today over $150 in one year. Since a decision maker with such
preferences could be manipulated into violating dominance by a skillful arbitrageur,it
is not clear that such models should be considered "normative" in the strict sense of
the term.
In addition to these book-keeping assumptions, the normative models are each committed to a specific numerical representation for preferences. For risky prospects, the
representation is additively separable across outcomes and linear in probabilities, so that
prospect (xl, Pi, .... Xn, Pn) is preferred to (Yi, q1, . . . , yn qn)at base wealth level w,
if and only if it has higher value according to the expected utility formula
E

piu(w + xi)

? E

qiu(w + yi),

(1)

where u(x + w) is the utility level for a wealth level equal to x + w. For temporal
prospects, the representationis also additively separableacross outcomes, but exponential
in time, so that prospect (xi, . . , xn) is preferredto (Yi, . . . , yn) at base consumption
level (cl,

. ..

,

cA), iff
z

( 1 + r)'u(ci + xi)

2 E

(1 ? r)'u(ci + y).

(2)

Both representations make strong claims about how preference should change if the time
or probability scales are transformed in certain ways. The expected utility representation
implies that only relative probability ratios of nonzero outcomes are significant, so that
the operation of reducing proportionately the probabilities of nonzero outcomes in two
prospects by the same factor should not affect preference. For instance, a person who is
indifferent between two lotteries should still be indifferent if there is only a 10%chance
that either lottery will be played.
The discounted utility representation implies, in contrast, that only absolute time
intervals matter. Contemplating the same choice between (x) and (y) from an earlier
vantage point shifts all time intervals by a constant amount (T) , which, according to (2 ),
reduces both sides of the equation by (1 + r)T. This is the stationarity property, as
originally formulated by Koopmans ( 1960) in a discrete-time context.
3. Anomalies
Even though EU and DU have been widely applied in economic research, recently
both models have been challenged by a proliferation of anomalies-common patterns
of behavior inconsistent with the models' predictions. In this section, we review the most
significant EU and DU anomalies and show that there is a virtual one-to-one correspondence between them.
The Common Ratio! Common Difference Effects
The independence axiom implies that preferences between risky prospects should not
be affected by multiplying the probabilities of nonzero outcomes by a common factor.

The common ratio effect (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) refers to a violation of this
prediction defined by: (x; p)
(y; q) implies (x; ap) -<: (y; aq), for y > x; 0 < a < 1.
A person who is indifferent, say, between a 25% chance of $2500 and a 50% chance of
$1000 would probably prefer a 2.5% chance of winning $2500 to a 5% chance of winning $ 1000.
The corresponding anomaly in intertemporal choice is the common difference effect.
DU implies that a person's preference between two single-outcome temporal prospects
should depend on the absolute time interval between delivery of the objects. However,
both intuition, and experimental evidence (Thaler 1981, Benzion, Rapoport and Yagil
1989) indicate that the impact of a constant time difference between two outcomes
becomes less significant as both outcomes are made more remote. Formally, (x, t)
(y,
d) implies (x, t + e) -< (y, d + e), for y > x, e > 0. A person who is indifferent, say,
between $20 today and $25 in one month will most likely prefer $25 in eleven months
to $20 in ten.
The common-ratio and common-differenceanomalies imply that preferenceis generally
sensitive to both ratios and differences along a dimension. Consider, first, the commonratio effect. Sensitivity to differences can explain why shrinking all probabilities proportionately reduces the significanceof the probabilitydimension, thereby shiftingpreferences
in favor of the prospect that contains the larger money outcome.' Likewise, increasing
the outcome dates in a pair of temporal prospects by a constant interval, decreases the
ratio between the time delays. Sensitivity to time ratios implies a reduction in the relative
importance of time, again shifting preferences in favor of the prospect with the larger
money outcome.
The Immediacyl Certainty Effects
Several researchershave argued that, in addition to the common ratio and difference
effects, a virtual discontinuity of preference occurs when the dimensions of time and
uncertainty approach their point of maximal significance (i.e., t = 0, and p = 1). The
certainty effect (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) refers to the tendency to value dispro(y; q) implies
portionately outcomes that are certain to occur. If ap = 1, then (x; p)
' See Rubinstein ( 1987) for an explicit model of the similarity relations.

(x; ap) >- (y; aq), for y > x; a > 1. The immediacy effect refers to the enhanced
significance decision makers attach to outcomes that are experienced immediately-i.e.,
(x, t) - (y, d) implies (x, t + e) -< (y, d + e), for t = 0, and y > x, e > 0. It can be
detected in the extremely high discount rates estimated for short time delays in several
empirical studies of discounting (Thaler 1981, Benzion, Rapoport and Yagil 1989), and
can also be observed in intertemporal decision making that does not involve monetary
payoffs (Christensen-Szalanski 1984).2 The immediacy and certainty effects are special
cases of violations of stationarity and proportionality, and can therefore be formally
subsumed under the common ratio and common difference effects. Many researchers
feel, however, that these phenomena are qualitatively distinct, and warrantseparatetreatment (see, e.g., Cohen and Jaffray 1988, Benzion, Rapoport and Yagil 1989).
Sign Effects
The "reflection effect" in decision making under uncertainty (Kahneman and Tversky
1979) refers to the finding that modal preferences shift from risk aversion to risk seeking
when positive domain gambles are "reflected" by making all payoffs negative-(x; p)
- (y; q) implies (-x; p) >- (-y; q) for p < q (although see Hershey and Schoemaker 1980).
A similar discrepancy in treatment of losses and gains also can be observed in intertemporal choice defined by (x, tl) -(y, t2) implies (-x, tl) >- (-y, t2), for y > x > 0
and t2 > tl. The attractiveness of gains is reduced faster than the aversiveness of losses.
Loewenstein (1988b) reports evidence of gain /loss asymmetries on the order of 15-20%
for small and moderate outcomes delayed by one year. Thaler (1981) reports even greater
discrepancies.
A necessary condition for sharp sign effects is that people segregate new choices from
their existing assets and "frame" the outcomes of such choices as losses and gains (Markowitz 1952, Kahneman and Tversky 1979) which they treat differently. EU, which
usually assumes a utility function denominated in total assets, cannot account for the
reflection effect, because sign shifts for small amounts have a negligible effect on total
wealth (ruling out wealth effects as an explanation for the behavior) but a major impact
on risk preferences (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Nor can a model that assumes that
utility is a function of asset levels account for the observation that people at all income
levels gamble and buy insurance (Markowitz 1952; see also Harvey 1988).
The same logic applies equally well to intertemporal choice. People display the loss/
gain asymmetry at a wide range of consumption levels. Only by assuming that new
outcomes are segregated, and encoded as gains or losses, is it possible to explain why
people who consume at such disparate baseline levels display the loss/gain asymmetry.
Magnitude Effects
Although not as well established as other EU anomalies, there is also evidence of a
relationship between outcome magnitude and risk taking that is incompatible with EU
(Markowitz 1952). The general pattern is one of (a) risk seeking for very small gains
turning progressivelyto risk aversion as outcome magnitudes increase, and (b) risk aversion for very small losses turning to risk seeking as the absolute magnitude of negative
outcomes increase-i.e., (x; p) - (y; q) implies (ax; p) -< (ay; q), and (-x; p) - (-y;
q) implies (- ax; p) -< (-ay; q) for a > 1, x > y > 0, and p < q.

Christensen-Szalanski interviewed expectant women at different times during their pregnancy concerning
their preference for using anaesthesia during childbirth. At all times prior to labor the great majority expressed
a preference for not using anaesthesia. Following the onset of labor, however, preferences abruptly shifted, with
a large fraction opting for relief. Apparently the cost of desisting from anaesthesia (the pain of labor) and the
benefits (e.g., later satisfactionfrom having given birth "naturally")were balanceddifferentlywhen both outcomes
were in the future and when one (the pain) was experienced in the present.

<-----Page 6----->775

DECISION MAKING OVER TIME AND UNDER UNCERTAINTY

Magnitude effects can also be observed in intertemporal choice. Numerous survey
studies (Thaler 1981, Loewenstein 1988b, Benzion, Rapoport and Yagil 1989) have
revealed a common pattern: a negative relationship between the absolute magnitude of
an outcome and the rate at which it loses value when delayed. For example, Thaler's
(1981) subjects were indifferent between $15 immediately and $60 in a year ($15/ $60
= 1/4) and between $250 immediately

and $350 in a year ($250/$350

= 5/7).

For

losses, the comparable figures were ($15/$20 = 3/4) and ($250/$270 = 25/27). This
pattern can be formalized as (x, tl) - (y, t2) implies (ax, t1) -< (axy, t2), for a > 1, y
> x > 0 and t2 > t, and (-x, tl) - (-y, t2) implies (-ax, t1) >- (-ay, t2). Like sign
effects, the magnitude effects observed in intertemporal choice are incompatible with the
assumption of integration (see Loewenstein and Prelec forthcoming).
Framing Effects
Framing effects, even more than conventional sign and magnitude effects, strike at the
heart of the representational assumptions because they demonstrate that changing the
way in which a prospect is represented, holding constant its "objective" characteristics,
can have a significant impact on choice. Framing effects are generally induced by shifting
the implicit point of reference in a choice (Payne, Laughhunn and Crum 1980, Tversky
and Kahneman 1981) . Such referencepoint shifts can be viewed as linear transformations
of attributes. For example, Kahneman and Tversky were able to obtain preference shifts
by reframing simple gambles into two stages, one common to both prospects, and one
different. If the common stages tend to be ignored by subjects, as they hypothesized, then
the new frame can be interpreted as a scalar transformation of probabilities. Other illustrations of framing express prospects as losses or gains by adding or subtractinga constant
amount to the payoffs of two prospects, while compensating for this manipulation with
a lump sum payment.
Framing effects have also been documented in intertemporal choice (Loewenstein
1988a, Loewenstein and Prelec forthcoming). In one study, for example, subjects were
given a choice between two vacation options, one offering 37 vacation days two years in
a row, the other offering44 days in the firstyear and 30 in the second. In one experimental
condition, the 30 days common to all options were segregated from each outcome; in
the other they were integrated. Choices in the two conditions differed significantly, with
the option offering greater up-front rewards preferred more in the segregated condition.
A second study found a significant shift of choice when payment options for a TV were
expressed in terms of gains (a rebate) or losses (payments).
4. Theoretical Integration
The goal of this section is to distill from the behavioral clues just enumerated a minimal
set of principles that apply to multiattribute choice generally, and that are consistent
with the violations of the normative models in both the time and probability domains.
Representation of Objects of Choice
The starting point for any model of choice is its assumptions concerning the nature
of choice objects. Although often regardedas unproblematic or self-evident, the so-called
"representational" assumptions are psychologically pivotal. Both EU and DU typically
assume that people integrate new alternatives, either with existing wealth (EU), or with
planned consumption (DU). But evidence reviewed in the previous section-sign, absolute magnitude, and framing effects-suggests that people in fact often segregate new
alternatives from current wealth and from future consumption plans. Even when people
do take wealth or consumption plans into account, they probably do so in a much cruder
way than requiredby asset integration. The assumption of asset integrationis undermined

<-----Page 7----->DRAZEN PRELEC AND GEORGE LOEWENSTEIN

776

by the fact that typical decision makers may have only imprecise knowledge of their
current wealth, and only vague or sketchy future consumption plans.
Our starting assumption is that in a multiattribute prospect, the value of each attribute
is encoded or "framed" as a pair of values, the first being the absolute magnitude of the
attribute, and the second being the polarity of the attribute, which is positive if larger
values along the attributeimprove the prospect, and negative otherwise. Thus, for example,
a temporal prospect of $1,000 due in 6 months would be encoded as: (1,000, 6) with
polarities (+-, -), where the negative polarity for the time attribute indicates that we are
dealing with delays, which diminish the overall prospect value.
The central idea behind our explanations of the anomalies is that certain transformations of values along an attribute, as well as changes in polarity, lead to systematic
changes in the weight or "psychological salience" that is attached to that attribute.3In
stating our conditions, we will denote generic two-attribute prospects by (a, b), where
both a and b are formally elements of real intervals A and B. The two special cases of
concern to us, of course, are preferences over simple lotteries (x, p), interpreted as a pchance of receiving $x, and delayed cash payments (x, t) received at time t. The letters
x, y, will always stand for values along the money attribute, while p, q, and t, s, for
values along the probability and time attributes, respectively. It is understood that 0 < p,
q < 1, and t, s> 0.
We now review the assumptions needed to secure a real-valued representation of preferences (these are adapted from Fishburn and Rubinstein's 1982 axioms for preferences
over single, dated cash flows):

Taken together, A 1-A4 guarantee that preferences can be representedby a continuous
real-valuedfunction u(a, b), which is increasing in a and satisfying u(0, b) = 0 (Fishbum
and Rubinstein 1982, Theorem 1).
We now give a more precise definition of a transformation to increase the weight of
an attribute.
DEFINITION1. Let (a, b) be a generic two attributeprospect, andf(a) a transformation
of the first attribute. We say that the transformation f increases the weight of an attribute
iff whenever two prospects are indifferent originally, (al, bl) - (a2, b2), then the transformation has the effect of making the transformed attribute decisive:
(f(al),

b1) -< (f(a2), b2)

iff

(f(al),

b2)

-<

(f(a2), bl).4

The definition for decreasing the weight on an attribute is derived by reversing exactly
one of the preferential inequalities.
Our definition of attribute weighting is illustrated in Figure 1. The inside indifference
curve connects the two indifferent prospects (al, bI) and (a2, b2); the two indifference
curves lying to the northeast pass through the prospects after the first attribute has been
3 There is a close affinity between our approach and that taken by Tversky, Sattath and Slovic ( 1988) to
explain the preference reversal phenomenon. Their basic claim is that the weight of a dimension is enhanced
if the response scale is expressed in units of that dimension (i.e., certainty equivalents for gambles will be
relatively more sensitive to dollars than probabilities). Our hypothesis is that numerical transformations of a
dimension also have a predictable impact on its weight.
4 The definition easily generalizes to prospects with three or more attributes by letting the second attribute,
B, stand for several distinct attributes.

subjected to the transformationf( *). Since (f(aA) bl) >- (ftal ), b2),preferenceincreases
toward the northeast, and the prospect (f(a2) . b2) is preferredto (f(al I), bI). Intuitively,
after applying a transformation tf *) that increases the weight on the first attribute, the
prospect that was initially stronger on that attribute becomes decisive.
We now state three assumptions about the effect of linear transformations on attribute
weight. The first two formalize the intuition that preferences, generally, will be invariant
neither with respect to transformations that preserve ratios nor those that preserve differences along an attribute.

For risky choice, with attributes A and B standing for probability and money (P and
X) , this is inconsistent with the independence axiom, which states that if a given lottery
is indifferent to a second lottery, then indifference should be preserved if both lotteries
are "mixed" with a common third lottery. In the domain of single-outcome lotteries, the
only possible mixtures are those involving the lottery and the certain zero outcome.
Restricted to this domain, the independence axiom may be expressed as

Increasing proportional sensitivity is a generalization of the subproportionality condition, proposed by Kahneman and Tversky ( 1979), to the more general setting of nonseparable preferences (see further discussion below). For unbounded dimensions, like
time and money, IPS will clearly fail at sufficiently large levels: Doubling an award of
10 billion dollars clearly matters less than doubling an award of $500,000; likewise, the
difference between losing one or two million dollars is less important than that between
losing one or two thousand, to most people at least.6
Our final condition states that losses (outcomes below a zero reference point) are
treated just like somewhat larger gains.
A7. Loss AMPLIFICATION. The two operations (i) increasing the absoluttemagnitude
of all values along an attribute by a common multiplicative constant, and (ii) changing
the polarity of an attribute, from positive to negative, have the same effect on the weight
of that attribute.7 Likewise, changing the polarity from negative to positive will have the
same effect as shrinking values by a common multiplicative constant.

In conjunction with the IPS condition, loss amplification implies that changing values
from gains to losses of equal absolute magnitude increases the weight of the money
dimension. By yoking together changes in polarity with scale changes, we explicitly avoid
the claim that losses always have greaterweight. We are not convinced that this stronger
condition is true for very large amounts, in that the perceives] differences between two
huge losses may in fact be less salient than the difference between two equivalent gains.
Indeed, A7 implies that if increasing proportional sensitivity were violated at some level
of an attribute, then changing the sign of the attribute at that level would not increase
the weighting of that attribute.
5. Restrictions on Separable Models
Previous work on descriptive models of risky and intertemporal choice has often concentrated on separable representations, which arise when preferences satisfy the double
cancellation condition (Krantz, Luce, Suppes and Tversky 1971 ):
A8. DOUBLE CANCELLATION.

If (x, a)

(y, b) and (y, c)

(z, a), then (x, c)

(z, b).
For example, Al, A2, A3 and A8 imply that preferences can be represented by the
multiplicative formula f(a)g(b) (Fishburn and Rubinstein 1982, Theorem 3). The
prospect theory model of risky choice, usually written as 7r(p)v(x), has this form, as do
the intertemporalmodels of Fishbum and Rubinstein (1982) and Loewenstein and Prelec
(1989). How do our three conditions (A5, A6 and A7) restrictthe shape of the component
functions, f and g? Considering decreasing absolute sensitivity first, we see that in the
context of a separable representation,f(al )g(al) = f(a2)g(a2) implies
f(al

+ E)g(al)

<f(a2

+ E)g(a2)

iff

f(al

+ E)g"a2)>f(a2

+ c)g(al).

After eliminating the ratio, g(al )/g(a2), from the three expressions, DAS may be stated
as

7 Loss amplification only applies to the money attribute since the time and probability attributes cannot be
reversed in sign.

Increasing the absolute magnitude of a, and a2 by a common constant moves the ratio,
closer to one (i.e., it increases that ratio iff(aI) <f(a2), and decreases it
f(al)/f(a2),
iff(aa) >f(a2)). Equivalently,this means that the slope of the function log lf(a) Ibecomes
less and less steep as one moves further away from the a = 0 point, in either the positive
or negative direction.
The same argument applied to the increasing proportional sensitivity condition shows
that
f(a2)

ff(a2/a)

f(a2)

(if aa1 > 0 and

IaI > 1).

A reduction of the absolute magnitude of a, and a2 by a common proportional constant
moves the ratio, f(al)/f(a2),
closer to one. The implication is that the slope of
log If(a) I becomes shallower as log Ia I decreases, or, equivalently, that log If(a) I is a
convex function of log Ia 1. This is subproportionality,as Kahneman and Tversky ( 1979)
defined it for the probability weighting function.
Finally, loss amplification, together with IPS, means that the scaled ratio of two positive
values will be closer to one than the scaled ratio of two negative values of the same
absolute magnitude:

f(-Ia,1)
f(Ia,1)
if
Iail > la21.
f(-1Ia2l) f(I1a2l)
Equivalently,this meansthat log lf(a) I is a steeperfunctionof log Ix I for negativethan
for positive values of a.
This property is distinct from "loss aversion"-the requirement thatf( a) is steeper in
the negative domain, which has been postulated to hold for decision making under uncertainty (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). The behavioral implications of loss aversion
are that a gain cannot compensate for a loss of equal absolute magnitude (an even gamble
to win or lose some amount should be rejected, for example). Sign-sensitivity, on the
other hand, does not compare gains against losses directly; rather, it compares the probability-money tradeoffacrossthe two domains, of gains and losses;in that sense, it identifies
a second-order gain-loss asymmetry.8
Although only one model of intertemporal choice incorporates a value function that
satisfied the three attribute sensitivity properties (Loewenstein and Prelec forthcoming),
many models have been proposed that include probabilityweighting or discount functions
that embody some of the properties discussed above.
Prelec (1989) has proposed a two-parameter family of discount functions, that spans
the range from the exponential to the power function-i.e., the range between constant
absolute and constant proportional sensitivity. Such a family of functions is generated
by the following axiom:
8 The influence of reference points on the shape of indifference curves has been given a comprehensive
treatment in a recent paper by Tversky and Kahneman ( 1989). By loss aversion, they refer to a local distortion
in a person's global preference structure,produced by a reference, or "status quo" point. Constantloss aversion,
a special case, occurs when the distortion can be expressed by a simple proportional rescaling of values below
and above the reference point on each dimension. In other words, the loss of x units along a dimension is
assessed as if it were a shift in the negative direction of caxunits along that same dimension (with cabeing a
constant specific to that dimension, but always greater than one).

)

In other words, if the two intervals, t - s and t' - s', are subjectively equivalent, then
they will also be equivalent to any weighted average. Stationary time preferences are
included here, since the premise in the axiom will only hold when the two intervals are
equal: t - s = t' - s'. Included also are so-called relative timing preferences (Harvey
1986 ), for which the initial premise will hold if the ratios, t/s and t'/s', are equal. The
most general discount function consistent with A8 is the general hyperbola (Prelec 1989,
Theorem 5)
f(t)

= 1+

at)-,

which reduces to the exponential function as the a-parameter goes to zero and the power
function as a becomes infinitely large. A special case of this function was proposed by
Mazur ( 1987, with a = A), to account for animal preferences over delayed rewards.
The limiting case where time preferences are invariant under proportional changes in
time intervals has been studied by Harvey ( 1986), in the context of discrete time. Harvey
referred to this property as relative timing preferences, and proved that the discount
function must be a decreasing power function,
f(t)

= t#5

,8 < O.

Harvey pointed out that if time relative to the present is split into some constant delay
s, and an additional delay t', then the power discount function becomes
f(t) = (s + t'),

t' = t - s,

which is formally equivalent to the hyperbolic form stated above. Harvey referred to s
as a time lag, which might correspond, for example, to a period during which no contemplated policy alternative can have an effect on society.
Many probability weighting functions also satisfy DAS and IRS. For example, as noted
earlier, the probability weighting function in Kahneman and Tversky's Prospect Theory
satisfies subproportionality. Similarly, Karmarkar's(1978, 1979) probability weighting
function
r(p)

=

PS(+

1

p)s 5

has the requisite s-shape, for s < 1, though it is not subproportionalover the full probability
range. Rachlin, Raineri and Cross (1989) proposed the form
r(p)
=

p
p + k(1 - p) '

which is subproportional everywhere, for k > 1, but which does not overweigh small
probabilities. Prelec ( 1990) derived a log-hyperbolic form
r(p) = (l1- alog {pj})a/,
from a "compounding" axiom, which states that the pair of indifferences, (x, p)

effect, in other words, can be replicated at lower probability levels, by compounding the
reduction of the two probabilities (p and q) at different rates (r and s). The function is
subproportional everywhere, and traces out the s-shape predicted by Kahneman and
Tversky.

DECISION MAKING OVER TIME AND UNDER UNCERTAINTY

6. Predictions of the Model
Single outcome prospects (temporal and risky) provide four separate attributes on
which to test the predictions of the model. Only the money dimension can be reversed
in sign, however, so that the three conditions identified in the previous section yield a
total of 10 predictions of choice behavior, which are summarized in Table 2. We consider
first the predictions for temporal prospects, shown in the two right-hand columns of
the table.
Intertemporal Choice
The common-difference effect-perhaps the fundamental intertemporal choice anomaly-illustrates decreasing absolute sensitivity for the time dimension. Adding a constant
to both delays diminishes the importance of time, thus shifting preference in favor of
the prospect with the larger money outcome. The increasing proportional sensitivity
condition has not been systematically tested, but we have little reason to doubt that it
holds: For example, if one is indifferent between a large prize in two years time and a
smaller prize in one year, then one is likely to prefer the larger prize when months, or
days are substituted for years in the comparison.
Turning to the money attribute, decreasing absolute sensitivity has again not been
tested, perhapsbecause it follows from utility function concavity, which is widely assumed.
For example, a person who is indifferent between $1000 now and $2000 two years from
now, is likely to prefer $2000 now over $3000 at the later date. Increasing relative sensitivity correspondsto the magnitude effect discussed in ?3, and has been tested extensively.
While robust in the range of small to intermediate dollar outcome, as noted above, it is
likely that the effect will reverse at the very high end: A person indifferent between $1000
now and $2000 three years from now, may well prefer ten million now to twenty in three
years (assuming again that he cannot draw on the funds now).
The third condition, loss amplification, is consistent with the observedlower discounting
of losses than gains discussed in ?3. Consider a person who is indifferent between $20 in
one year or $10 now. According to increasing relative sensitivity, the same person would
prefer$200 in one year to $100 now, since magnifyingboth dollar outcomes by a common
constant increases the weight placed on the money attribute. If, instead, we change the
sign to create a choice between -$20 in one year or -$10 now, loss amplification states
that it should have the same effect as increasingthe outcome magnitudes-i.e., to increase
the weight on the dollar attribute relative to the time delay attribute. Thus, following a
sign shift, preference should shift in favor of the earlier smaller loss. It should be noted
that loss amplification does not preclude the operation of other reasons for underdiscounting losses, such as "wanting to get it over with," dread, etc. (Loewenstein 1987).
Decision Making Under Uncertainty
Increasing sensitivity on the probability dimension is illustrated by the common-ratio
effect (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). Shrinking (multiplicatively) the nonzero probTABLE 2

abilities in two risky prospects by a common factor decreases the perceived difference
between the probabilities, which, in accordance with IPS, reduces the weight of the probability dimension. This causes preference to shift in favor of the lower-probabilityhighermoney outcome prospect.
The situation with the decreasingabsolute sensitivity condition is a bit more ambiguous.
For small probabilities, the condition is likely to hold. For example, a person who is
indifferentbetween, say, ($ 1000; 0.1 ) and ($2000; 0.05 ), will most certainlyprefer($2000;
0.5) to ($1000, 0.55). Indeed, risk-aversion or risk neutrality are sufficient to ensure
DAS, in the context of expected utility theory. However, if we make the probabilities
very high, then the condition is no longer self-evident. A person may very well be indifferent between an 80% chance at $2 million and a 90% chance at $1 million, and at the
same time prefer a 99% chance at a million to a 89% chance of two million.
Possibly, the violation of DAS suggestedby this example is due to an intrinsic ambiguity
in how probabilities are framed. With the almost certain windfall in the example, one is
inclined to think in terms of the probabilities of not winning, rather than winning the
prize. In that frame, the relative impact of 11%vs. 1%is greaterthan the relative impact
of 20% vs. 10%.
Turning to the money attribute, decreasing absolute sensitivity is commensurate with
risk aversion and seems perfectly compelling. Adding a constant to the outcomes of risky
alternatives increases the relative weighting of probability, shifting preferences in favor
of the smaller, safer, prospect. A person who is indifferent, say, between $100 for sure
and a 50% chance at $300, will surely prefer $200 to a 50% chance at $400, or $500 to
a 50%chance at $700. The opposite preference pattern would go against robust expected
value increases, and would only be justified by extreme risk-pronenessat the higher dollar
amounts. In the context of prospect theory, for example, DAS is satisfied provided that
the logarithm of the value function is concave in money (which is a weaker requirement
than the traditionally assumed concavity of the value function itself).
Unfortunately for our model, risky choice typically does not conform to increasing
proportional sensitivity. Magnifying the "stakes" of risky prospects increases the importance of the probability dimension, resulting in more risk-averse behavior. What can
account for this one exception? We believe that the discrepancy results from interactions
between attributes, which are different for risky and intertemporal choice.
In decision making under uncertainty probabilistic outcomes are mutually exclusiveone and only one outcome occurs. When evaluating a gamble in isolation, all possible
comparisons take place between the outcome that occurs and those that do not. Furthermore, the effect of such comparisons is generally taken to be contrastive. As a result
of disappointment (Bell 1985), losing a gamble is more painful the greaterthe potential
gain. Likewise, the utility of winning is heightened by the elation that results from pondering the negative outcome that could have occurred, although the disappointment
effect is generally assumed to dominate the elation effect (Bell 1985). We believe that
anticipation of disappointment is responsible for the violation of increasing proportional
sensitivity for risky choice.
Consider what happens as one magnifies the stakes of a simple prospect consisting,
say, of a 0.5 chance at $100 and a 0.5 chance at $0. Although the gamble increases in
expected value, its subjective value does not increase commensurately even after allowing
for risk aversion. This is because, due to disappointment, the zero outcome becomes
progressively worse in utility terms as the positive outcome increases. Disappointment
and elation also have the combined effect of amplifying the utility difference between
the positive and negative outcomes as the positive outcome is improved. Thus, as the
value of the positive outcome increases, the decision maker becomes increasingly preoccupied with the probability of obtaining the better of the two outcomes, increasing the

<-----Page 14----->DECISION MAKING OVER TIME AND UNDER UNCERTAINTY

783

weighting of the probability dimension. The probability dimension becomes relatively
more important because, as the gamble is magnified, its overall value does not increase
commensurately but the decision maker's concern with obtaining the more desirable
outcome increases.
Interaction effects in intertemporal choice are different from those in decision making
under uncertainty, and the difference can explain why increasing proportional sensitivity
is generally observed for temporal prospects but not for risky ones. For simple, oneoutcome prospects, the most important interaction effect is the "endowment" effect
(Elster 1985, Tversky and Griffin 1990). People derive positive utility from "savoring"
a desirable outcome or from dreading an undesirable one (Loewenstein 1987).
Magnifying the outcome in a simple intertemporal prospect enhances utility in every
period, due to savoring (and possibly memory) so that overall utility increases even more
than what would be predicted on the basis of simple discounted utility. Note that this is
precisely the opposite of what occurs in decision making under uncertainty, where the
dominant interaction effect-disappointment-attenuates
the gamble's increase in desirabilityas the value of the positive outcome is magnified. On the other hand, magnifying
the value of the outcome in a simple intertemporal prospect does not have a strong
impact on the importance of time delay. Although one might be more concerned about
experiencing a highly desirable outcome earlier, possibilities for savoring, and hence
willingness to delay may also increase as the delayed outcome improves. Again, this is
in marked contrast to the case of decision making under uncertainty where magnifying
the magnitude of the positive outcome increases preoccupation with the probability of
obtaining it.
Loss amplification does seem plausible when applied to decision making under uncertainty, though it has not been tested systematically. For example, a person who is
indifferent between $10 or a 50% chance at $20 would probably prefer $100 to a 50%
chance at $200, reflecting an increase in the weight placed on probability when outcomes
are magnified. If changing the sign of the money dimension from positive to negative
has the same impact on attribute weighting as does magnifying outcomes, then we would
expect the weight on probability to be increased if we changed the signs of the payoffs
in the original prospects. Loss amplification therefore predicts that the same decision
maker would prefer a 50%chance of losing $20 to a sure loss of $10, a plausible pattern
of choice.
7. Discussion
In this paper we have outlined several significantparallelsbetween intertemporalchoice
and decision making under uncertainty. Actual patterns of behavior in both domains
are surprisinglysimilar, as revealed by the parallelism between the DU and EU anomalies
discussed in ?3.9 As a result, with the sole exception of the weighing of value in decision
making under uncertainty, behavior in both domains can be expressed in terms of three
I
Our argument for a close correspondence between patterns of choice in the domain of time and uncertainty
is bolstered by recent research demonstrating that preference reversalsanalogous to those observed in decision
making under uncertainty also occur in intertemporal choice (Tversky, Slovic and Kahneman 1990). There
are further parallels that we do not explore here. Recently a number of models of preferences over multiple
outcome lotterieshave been developed in which a nonlineartransformationis appliedto the cumulative probability
dimension. In these rank order models extreme outcomes are weighted disproportionately (e.g., Quiggin 1982,
Yaari 1987). We have found a similar pattern with preferences toward sequences of outcomes; the outcomes
that appear at the beginning and end of the sequence receive more weight than called for by conventional
discounting schemes (Loewenstein and Prelec 1990, 1991 ).

<-----Page 15----->784

simple principles laid out in ?4: increasing relative and decreasing absolute sensitivity,
and loss amplification.
The discounted and expected utility models both make extreme assumptions about
the sensitivity of preferences to transformations of the nonvalue attribute; in both cases
actual behavior lies between these extremes. At the same time both theories are relatively
agnostic about how transformations of the value attribute will affect preference-yet it
is possible to specify such effects with some precision.
Our analysis reiteratesthe importance, already evident in research on decision making
under uncertainty, of preferential interactions. The most common practice in attempts
to produce alternative models to EU has been to modify EU to take into account various
violations of independence. Our analysis suggests however that EU and DU may provide
skewed foundations for such efforts; the pattern of choice described by intermediate
sensitivity appears to provide a superior base on which to add interaction effects.
In its conclusion that preferences are sensitive both to absolute and relative transformations of attributes, our findings are related to several earlier contributions. MacCrimmon and Messick (1976), Lurie (1987), and Loewenstein, Thompson and Bazerman
(1989) have demonstrated that interpersonal comparisons of material outcomes reflect
a concern both for absolute and relative differencesbetween one's own and other persons'
payoffs. Even more closely related is Harvey's (1988) discussion of two approaches to
discounting in public policy which he terms absolute and relative timing preference.
These are equivalent to what we would call constant absolute and constant relative sensitivity for time.
Our conclusion that patterns of weighting are relatively similar for different attributes
is also reminiscent of earlier work on decision making under uncertainty which has
treated the probability and time dimensions symmetrically-as diverse attributes are
typically handled in generic multiattribute choice problems (e.g., Slovic and Lichtenstein
1968, Payne and Braunstein 1971) . Most existing choice models, including EU and DU,
assume that qualitatively different patterns of weighting apply to money and nonmoney
(probability or time) attributes. However, such a discrepancy in treatment is not evident
from actual choice behavior. Rather than employing separate rules for different choice
attributes, people seem to apply certain fundamental and relatively simple rules to evaluating different types of attributes.
An interesting question is whether the similarity between intertemporal choice and
decision making under uncertainty applies more broadly to other types of multi-attribute
choice. Time and uncertainty are closely related in a number of ways so it is possible
that the observed parallelism of choice behavior is unique to these two domains. Both
are attributesthat pertainto choice objects' delivery-its time or probabilityof occurringratherthan to characteristicsof the objects themselves. Furthermore,time and uncertainty
are typically correlated with one another in the real world, perhaps also contributing to
their comparable treatment. Anything that is delayed is almost by definition uncertain.
And since uncertaintytakes time to resolve, uncertain outcomes are also typically delayed.
Indeed some researchers have argued that the two attributes really measure the same
thing, although there is disagreement regardingwhich is the more fundamental (Rachlin,
Raineri and Cross 1989, Benzion, Rapoport and Yagil 1989). All of these connections
raise the possibility that the similarity of choice behavior is peculiar to time and uncertainty-that it reflects their intimate connection rather than fundamental processes underlying all multiattribute choices. The answer to this question awaits further research.10
