<-----Page 1----->THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE BUSINESS ANGEL
MARKET: EVIDENCE FROM SCOTLAND
ABSTRACT.
Business angel investing – a key source of finance for entrepreneurial businesses – is
evolving from a fragmented and largely anonymous activity dominated by individuals
investing on their own to one that is increasingly characterised by groups of investors
investing together through managed angel syndicates. The implications of this change have
been largely ignored by scholars. Based on research in Scotland, which has experienced a
particularly rapid growth in angel groups, the paper examines the following issues: the
drivers of this change, the characteristics of the groups; their investment activity and
outcomes; the investment process of angel groups; and the characteristics and role of group
‘gatekeepers’. The paper concludes with an assessment of the impact of this growth of angel
groups on the economy and considers the implications for other regions and countries.

Key words: entrepreneurial finance, business angels, angel groups, angel syndicates, regional
development

<-----Page 2----->INTRODUCTION
It is widely accepted that business growth should be based on equity rather than debt finance
In practice, the funding for each stage in company growth is typically associated with a
particular source. Businesses initially get started on the basis of the personal finances of the
founder/founding team (including the owner’s ‘sweat’ equity) and their family and friends
(the “3Fs”), and then access business angels, venture capital, development capital and
ultimately public markets in order to finance their growth. This has typically been
conceptualised as a funding escalator. Although this model can be criticised for being oversimplistic it is nevertheless the case that, at least in the US, a significant proportion of firms
which raised venture capital had previously raised finance from business angels (Freear and
Wetzel, 1990; Madill et al, 2005) while 52 firms (8%) achieving a NASDAQ listing between
2001 and 2007 had previously raised funding from both business angels and venture capital
funds (Johnson and Sohl, 2012). However, this funding escalator no longer functions
effectively. Changes in the supply of institutional finance which have been observed for at
least the past thirty years (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992; Gompers and Lerner, 2001; Mason,
2009a) have involved a shift from classic venture capital, which specialises in investing new
capital in young growing companies (Bhidé, 2008; Lerner et al 2012), in favour of private
equity which invests in established companies to buy out their existing owners and
restructure their activities with the intention of making them more efficient. One of the
consequences has been that business angel-funded businesses are less likely to be able to
raise follow-on funding from venture capital funds, thereby compromising the so-called
‘relay race’ of financing a growing business “in which angel investment runs the critical first
leg of the race, passing the baton to [the] venture capital [fund] only after the company has
begun to find its stride” (Benjamin and Margulis, 1996:71). There has also been a decline in
the number of IPO listings in the post-bubble era (since 2001), notably amongst smaller

2

<-----Page 3----->companies (Mason, 2011). This is attributed to a variety of factors: an array of regulatory
changes designed to advance low cost trading, which unintentionally removed the value
components that are required to support the market, and smaller caps in particular, such as
quality sell side research, capital commitment and sale (Weild and Kim, 2009; 2010); lack of
investor interest in small caps; and the preference of venture capital funds to exit via a trade
sale rather than an IPO (Bessler and Seim, 2011).

Given the geographical concentration of private sources of venture capital in core regions
(Mason and Harrison 2002a; Zook 2004; Mason, 2007) the funding escalator is at its most
dysfunctional in peripheral regions, where public sector-backed venture capital funds have
sought to fill this gap (Murray, 1998; Mason and Pierrakis, 2013) but with limited
effectiveness (Murray, 1998; 2007; Nightingale, et al, 2009; Lerner, 2009). As a result,
business angels are now playing an increasingly important role in financing new and young
businesses, as well as supporting them through their hands-on involvement.

The importance of business angels in supporting the development of a dynamic
entrepreneurial economy has been recognised by both national and regional governments in
various countries. Angel investment activity is encouraged in a variety of ways, notably
through tax incentives and support for business angel networks and other types of
intermediary which ‘introduce’ angels and entrepreneurs seeking finance to one another
(Mason, 2009; OECD, 2011). This has brought business angel investing into the realm of
economic development, giving government a legitimate interest in what would otherwise be a
private activity. The different objectives of investors and economic development agencies
creates a potential source of tension, an issue that we revisit in the conclusion.

3

<-----Page 4----->The starting point for this paper is that this key source of entrepreneurial finance -– business
angel investment – is changing from an atomistic, fragmented and largely invisible market
comprising almost entirely individuals investing on their own or in ad hoc small groups to
one that is increasingly characterised by highly visible angel groups and syndicates which
consolidate and channel finance from individual investors to entrepreneurial ventures. The
implications of this evolution of the angel market have been largely ignored by scholars. The
consequence is that our understanding of the operation of the market remains based on
studies of individual angels – which is now only part of the overall angel market - and does
not provide insights into the operation and investment activity of angel groups. This paper is
the first to explicitly and systematically examine this transformation of the angel market,
building on previous papers of the overall evolution of the early stage risk capital market
(Harrison et al 2010), the evolution of specific business angel syndicates (Sudek 2006;
Gregson et al 2013), and the emergence of the angel group gatekeeper as a new actor in the
market (Paul and Whittam 2010). Based on a case study of Scotland, where this market
evolution has proceeded the furthest, the paper addresses the following key issues: first, what
are the implications of the growth of angel groups for the financing of entrepreneurial
ventures, second, to what extent does this render redundant our existing understanding of the
investment process which is derived from studies based on individual investors, and third,
what is the contribution of angel investing to economic development?

THE CHANGING ANGEL MARKET
Business angels are high net worth individuals who invest their own money, either alone or
with others, directly in unquoted businesses in which there is no family connection. They
normally invest in the form of equity finance in the hope of achieving a significant financial
return through some form of exit (although this is rarely planned when the investment is

4

<-----Page 5----->made). Typically they will also take an active involvement in their investee businesses
(Mason, 2006). Business angels are particularly important from a regional economic
development perspective because the majority of their investments are local (Harrison et al,
2010b; Avdeitchikova, 2010), hence they are typically recycling and reinvesting locallycreated wealth. Given the geographical concentration of venture capital investing in core
regions (Mason, 2007: Mason and Pierrakis, 2013) business angels are particularly important
in peripheral regions.

In the 1980s and 1990s angels operated anonymously, investing for the most part on their
own or with small groups of friends and business associates in ventures that they came across
through personal social and business networks. Not surprisingly, the angel market operated
inefficiently, with both investors and entrepreneurs incurring high search costs in identifying
one another, and often giving up as a result (Wetzel, 1986). It was very much an ad hoc
activity for most investors and levels of professionalism were correspondingly low (Blair,
1996). Meanwhile, entrepreneurs typically did not understand how to make themselves
‘investment ready’ (Mason and Harrison, 2000; 2001). An early market intervention,
pioneered in the USA (Wetzel, 1984; Wetzel and Freear, 1996) and Canada (Blatt and
Riding, 1996) but subsequently adopted in Europe, was the creation of business angel
networks – essentially introduction services – which provided a communication channel to
enable entrepreneurs to get their investment proposal to the attention of potential investors
and for angels to examine investment opportunities without compromising their privacy
(Mason and Harrison, 1996a). Subsequently some of these networks also delivered
investment readiness programmes (Mason and Kwok, 2010) and angel training (San José et
al, 2005). The difficulties in developing a commercially viable model for this service has
meant that most networks have relied on government funding, and several in the UK have

5

<-----Page 6----->closed after losing this support. Those which operate commercially levy a fee on the
investments that they facilitate. This business model requires a focus on larger deals (Mason
and Harrison, 2000). Evidence on the effectiveness of networks is mixed but broadly positive
(Mason and Harrison, 1996c; Mason and Harrison, 1999; 2002c; Collewaert et al, 2010).

The angel market began to transform in the late-1990s as angels started to organise
themselves into groups to invest collectively. This trend has proceeded furthest in the USA.
The Band of Angels, which was founded in Silicon Valley in 1995, is generally regarded as
the first organised syndicate to be formed. Others, such as Tech Coast Angels (1997), Sierra
Angels (1997), Common Angels (1997) and The Dinner Club (1999), soon followed (Preston
2007). Between 1996 and 2006 the number of identifiable business angel organisations in the
US grew from 10 to over 250 (Preston 2007). The Angel Capital Association, covering the
USA and Canada, was created in 2003 for the purposes of transferring best practice, lobbying
and data collection. It now comprises 187 formal angel groups, plus some affiliate members
(http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/directory/).

There

is

growing

evidence

of

specialisation by industry sector (e.g. health care angel syndicates) and type of investor (e.g.
women-only angel syndicates). In Europe, there has been a similar expansion in the angel
market but, with the exception of Scotland (Harrison et al 2010; Gregson et al 2013) – which
is the focus for this paper - it has evolved differently, favouring angel networks which
provide mechanisms connecting angels with entrepreneurs seeking finance (Mason, 2009b).
In the case of Scotland, the number of identifiable syndicates has grown from 2 to over 20
between 2000 and 2012, the most radical shift in market organisation of any region in
Europe. Moreover, Archangels was founded in 1992, and so is older than its better known US
counterparts. Indeed, if Scotland was a US state it would be the 11th largest in terms of angel
group investment activity (Grahame, personal communication) whereas it ranks only 29th in

6

<-----Page 7----->terms of GDP per capita. Angel groups have also emerged in several other countries, notably
Canada, Australia and New Zealand (OECD 2011). However, with the exception of a handful
of case studies (May and Simmons, 2001; May, 2002; Cerullo and Sommer, 2002; Payne and
Mccarty, 2002; May and O’Halloran, 2003; Sudek, 2006) and some general discussion
(Mason, 2006; Sohl, 2007; 2012; Gregson et al 2013) scholars have been slow to react to this
organisational transformation of the angel market.

Angel syndicates have emerged for two main reasons. First, business angels have difficulties
of investing alongside venture capital funds because of the investment instruments which
VCs use, notably, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution rights, special subscription rights and
enhanced follow-on rights. This became apparent during the dot.com crash of the early
2000s. At this time many of the companies that had been financed in the ‘bubble’ of the late
1990s were running out of cash. The huge fall in valuations in the crash meant that venture
capitalists had to write down the value of many of the investments that they had already
made. The consequence was that those companies that did raise further funding were
refinanced at lower prices. As the initial investors in these businesses, angels were
particularly vulnerable in these, so-called, down-rounds. Unable, or unwilling, to provide new
cash their investments were typically wiped out. This resulted in angels losing trust in venture
capitalists and since then many have sought to avoid investing in deals that are likely to
require follow-on funding from venture capitalists, leading to a growing segmentation in the
early stage risk capital market (Harrison et al, 2010a) A further difficulty is that business
angels and venture capital funds have different objectives. This is particularly clear at the exit
stage where, as Peters (2009) has noted, venture capital funds will refuse to exit at a valuation
that is perfectly acceptable to angel investors but is below their ‘hurdle rate’ because it would
affect their ability to raise a new fund. Second, the decline in the venture capital industry

7

<-----Page 8----->since the dot.com crash has meant that opportunities for angels to pass on their investments to
venture capital funds for follow-on funding are much more restricted, necessitating angels to
make follow-on investments themselves.

These development have prompted individual angels to recognise the advantages of working
together, notably in terms of better deal flow, superior evaluation and due diligence of
investment opportunities, as well as social attractions. Moreover, by grouping together they
can aggregate their investment capacity and so have the ability to make bigger investments
and follow-on investments, with the potential to take businesses to an exit themselves without
the need for follow-on funding from venture capital funds. The ability for angel groups to
achieve ‘early exits’ (Peters, 2009) have been enhanced by a fundamental change in ‘start up
economics’. It costs considerably less to start a technology business now compared with ten
years ago or longer as a consequence of such developments as cloud-based software, web and
social media and e-commerce platforms. When combined with lean start-up techniques to
provide capital efficiency (Blank, 2005; Reiss, 2011) companies can start with little or no
capital and sustain a low burn rate for some time before needing to raise external finance.
This has meant that it has become more feasible for angels to finance businesses to the point
where it achieves commercial feasibility, particularly in ITC sectors without the need for
venture capital funding. However, businesses that are not sold at this point will require
further funding to grow the business and secure customers.

Angel groups are distinctive from BANs. Table 1 highlights the differences and describes the
standard design of a group. However, in practice they take various forms. The key difference
is whether the person appointed to be the external face of the group and manage the

8

<-----Page 9----->Table 1. Business Angel Groups vs. Business Angel Networks
Business Angel Group

Business Angel Network (BAN)

Angel groups in the US (and in some other
countries) are primarily focused on recruiting
members and managing deal flow for those
members. Education, social engagement, pitch
coaching entrepreneurs and other activities may
also be important functions.

In general, BANs seem to have two primary
focuses:

(1) Members are recruited to join the group,
appealing to accredited investors with the deal
flow and best practices offered by the
network. Members are often required to sign rules
of membership agreement stipulating their
expected engagement (meeting attendance,
participating in due diligence, annual investment
numbers, etc.) and committing neither to “steal
deals” nor to solicit entrepreneurs for consulting or
members of business.
(2) Entrepreneurs are solicited to pitch to the
group, through websites and other networking
activities in the community. A small group of
members or staff pre-screen deals for presentation
to the members. Investor-readiness training is
seldom provided by US angel groups.
(3) Once an entrepreneur has pitched to the
members, a due diligence committee of members
(and perhaps staff) is initiated, representing the
group. The deal lead negotiates a single term sheet
for the round of investment with the
entrepreneur. Once the term sheet and due
diligence are complete, the deal is offered to all
members of the group for investment. In some
cases, very popular deals may offer a limited
investment amount or time, on a first come, first
served basis. Members are investing for their own
accounts, consequently members can invest larger
or smaller sums, or pass on a deal.

(1) Soliciting a large mailing list of potential angel
investor members (and others, such as service
providers) and organizing pitching meetings for
them. Members have limited obligations to the
group, that is, small or no annual dues, no duty to
invest as part of the group (versus pocketing deals
for themselves), no participation requirements
(attendance, due diligence), no leadership mandate
and no minimum investment expectations.
(2) Engaging with the entrepreneurial community,
sometimes by providing investor-ready services
and pitch coaching, with a focus, for the most
qualified entrepreneurs, on inviting them to
pitching events.
After the pitching session, the entrepreneurs and
investors are left to their own devices to do a
deal. There is no organized group deal processing;
instead each angel engages with the entrepreneur,
finds co-investors (within or outside the BAN),
completes due diligence, negotiates a term sheet
and closes the deal.
There appear to be two models for the BAN
operational platform: (a) a not-for-profit model,
often driven by economic development agencies
and (b) a for-profit model pursued by experienced
investors and funded by success fees and tolls
charged to entrepreneurs and investors.

There are several models for managing angel
groups, including both member management and
manager management. The angel group does not
make investments or recommend investments to
members, rather members make their own
decisions based on the shared due diligence and
term sheets.

<-----Page 10----->investment process - often termed the ‘gatekeeper’ (Paul and Whittam, 2010) - is one of the
group members or a professional employed by the group. Some of the larger and longer
established US groups have established sidecar funds – that is, committed sources of capital
that invest alongside the angel group. The investors in such funds are normally the syndicate
members but may also include other high net worth individuals (HNWIs) or institutions.
These funds give the syndicate additional capital to invest in deals to avoid dilution, enable
syndicate members to achieve greater diversification by exposing them to more investments
than they can make directly through the syndicate, and is a means of attracting ‘right-minded’
investors who want to participate in seed and early stage deals but cannot be active members
of a syndicate.

The emergence of angel syndicates is of enormous significance for the development and
maintenance of an entrepreneurial economy. First, they reduce sources of inefficiency in the
angel market. The angel market has traditionally been characterised by inefficiency on
account of the fragmented and invisible nature of angels. There was no mechanism for angels
to receive a steady flow of investment opportunities. Angel syndicates, in contrast, are
generally visible and are therefore easier for entrepreneurs to approach, thereby reducing the
search costs of both entrepreneurs and angels and increasing deal flow. A further source of
inefficiency was that each investment made by an investor has typically been a one-off that
was screened, evaluated and negotiated separately. However, the volume of investments that
angel syndicates make enables them to develop efficient routines for handling investment
enquiries, screening opportunities and making investment agreements. The increased number
of investors scrutinising potential risks also improves due diligence.

10

<-----Page 11----->Second, they have stimulated the supply-side of the market. Syndicates offer considerable
attractions for high net worth individuals (HNWIs) who would not otherwise invest in
emerging companies, for example, because they lack the time, referral sources, investment
skills or the ability to add value. However, angel groups are also attractive to many existing
solo angels because of the reduction in risk that arises from investing as part of a syndicate,
notably the ability to spread their investments more widely and thereby achieve greater
diversification, and by access to group skills and knowledge to evaluate investment
opportunities and provide more effective post-investment support. Other attractions of
syndicates are that they enable individual angels to invest in particular opportunities that they
could never have invested in as individuals, offer the opportunity to learn from more
experienced investors and provide opportunities for camaraderie and networking with likeminded individuals. Thus, angel syndicates are able to attract and mobilise funds that might
otherwise have been invested elsewhere (e.g. property, stock market, collecting: Mason and
Harrison, 2000), thereby increasing the supply of early stage venture capital, and to invest it
more efficiently and effectively.

Third, angel groups are helping to fill the ‘new’ equity gap. The diminished number of
venture capital funds have consistently raised their minimum size of investment and are
increasingly abandoning the early stage market, either to invest in larger and later stage deals
or simply because they have been unable to raise new funds from institutional investors.
Angel syndicates are now increasingly the only source of funding for new and emerging
businesses seeking investments in the range £250,000 to £1 million (under $1m in the USA:
Sohl, 2012). Moreover, as a consequence of their greater financial resources angel groups
have the ability to provide follow-on funding. This overcomes one of the potential problems
of raising money from individual business angels, namely that they often lack the financial

11

<-----Page 12----->capacity to provide follow-on funding. Consequently, the entrepreneur is often forced to
embark on a further search for finance. Moreover, in the event that the need for additional
finance is urgent then both the entrepreneur and the solo angel will find themselves in a weak
negotiating position with potential new investors, resulting in a dilution in their investments
and the imposition of harsh terms and conditions. With the withdrawal of many venture
capital funds from the small end of the market individual angels and their investee businesses
have increasingly been faced with the problem of the absence of follow-on investors. Because
angel syndicates generally have greater financial firepower than individual angels or ad hoc
angel groups to be able to provide follow-on financing, it more efficient for the entrepreneur
who avoids the need to start the search for finance anew each time a new round of funding is
required.

Fourth, the ability of angel groups to add value to their investments should be much greater.
The range of business expertise that is found amongst angel syndicate members – described
by May and Simmons (2001: 156), leading angel syndicate practitioners in the USA, as a
“smorgasbord of advice and strategic services” - means that in most circumstances they are
able to contribute much greater value-added to investee businesses than an individual
business angel, or even most early stage venture capital funds. Finally, angel groups are the
most frequent partners in public sector co-investment schemes (Mason, 2009b; Harrison et al,
2010a), acting as the focal point for the leveraging of additional funds into the entrepreneurial
ecosystem.

However, others are less sanguine about the emergence of angel groups. For example, Sohl
(2012: 37) has suggested that “as angels are becoming more organised they are morphing into
a portrait of venture capital funds and are losing some of the valuable characteristics of the

12

<-----Page 13----->angel investor …”1 This, in turn, raises two specific concerns (Sohl, 2007; 2012). First, the
emergence of angel groups will result in a reallocation of angel capital away from smaller,
seed investing to bigger and later stage deals. Second, angel groups will simply attract
“inexperienced wealthy individuals seeking a passive investment” rather than active angels
who can contribute value added to their investee businesses (Sohl, 2007: 360). But whether
these developments are inevitable remains contested. Others have expressed concerns about
the cost raising finance, and specifically the practice of angel groups requiring entrepreneurs
to ‘pay to pitch’ (Entrevestor.com, 2013) and taking fees in the form of a proportion of any
funds that they raise.

DATA SOURCES AND ANALYSIS
The study is based on two sources: aggregate data on investment activity, which provides the
basis for the next section, and interviews with angel group gatekeepers which is the key
source for the following two sections. Quantitative information on angel investment activity
is derived from LINC Scotland and the most recent Scottish Risk Capital Market Report
published by Scottish Enterprise (Harris and Mason, 2012). LINC Scotland provided
information on aggregate investment activity complied on the basis of data provided by its
members. The Scottish Risk Capital Market Report is based on an examination of Companies
House 88(2) returns for all companies that were known to have raised equity finance in the
period 2009-2011. These returns give the date and number of new shares issued, in most
cases the price, but not the names of the investors which had to be identified from other
1

This is illustrated by a recent report from the Boston Business Journal (15 April 2013), headlined “Common
Angels eyes larger new fund, as group seeks to act more like a VC” which describes how Common Angels, a
group of about 50 angels in the Boston area is in discussions to raise a pooled fund which will exceed its
existing $13m fund. The new fund would make a similar number of investments but would invest more capital
into each business. The report also notes that it has centralised it decision-making in an eight member
committee. The report concludes that the end result of these changes is that “Common Angels is now
operating more like a VC firm ...”

13

<-----Page 14----->sources (see Mason and Harrison, 2008 and Harrison et al, 2010a for further discussion of
this source).

This is complemented by information from 22 semi-structured interviews with gatekeepers of
19 groups, 18 of which invest in Scotland.2 In three groups the gatekeeper role was shared by
two individuals. In each case both individuals were interviewed. The groups that were
interviewed included all 17 that are publicly listed on LINC Scotland’s web site. Three other
groups are also members of LINC Scotland but prefer anonymity. These groups were also
invited to participate, via LINC Scotland, but declined to do so. Two additional groups were
interviewed. One was a UK-wide group with a very active Scottish branch but has no
association with LINC. The other group is a Scottish Co-investment Fund partner that also
has no association with LINC. The Scottish Risk Capital Market Report (Harris and Mason,
2012) identified 24 angel groups. However, the groups not included in this study either no
longer exist or are private offices of high net worth families whose investments and
operations are much closer to venture capital investing than angel investing. So, although the
study could be criticized for being LINC-centric it would appear that we have captured most
of the participants in the market.

Securing the participation of such a high proportion of angel groups in the Scottish market
was a considerable achievement. In many cases the initial response was not positive and
follow-up approaches were required. As a consequence, the recruitment process took three
months. It started with an initial email to the gatekeeper to request an interview. In several
cases it was not possible to identify the gatekeeper, but in these cases the recipient of the
email forwarded it to the relevant individual.

14

<-----Page 15----->Of the 22 interviewees, 20 were face-to-face and two were conducted on the telephone. All
agreed for the interview to be recorded for later transcribing. The interviews ranged in length
from 37 to 93 minutes, with the average being about one hour. The face-to-face interviews
took place at a location of the interviewee convenience. Venues included the group’s office,
coffee shops and the researcher’s office. We agreed with participants that information on
individual groups would not be disclosed and that findings would be aggregated. Any
references to specific groups are therefore based on information that is in the public domain
(e.g. media, presentations).

One of the main challenges of qualitative methods, such as interviews, is how to analyse the
information that is collected. Several sections of the interviews were based on objective and
measurable questions, such as the amount invested, number of deals, and age of the
syndicate. However, other parts of the questionnaire, notably on the skills that a gatekeeper
requires and their own learning in the role, were based on opinion and perceptions. This
information has been examined by thematic analysis (Howitt and Cramer, 2007) which is one
of the most frequently used methods of qualitative analysis for “identifying, analyzing and
reporting patterns within data” (Braun and Clarke (2006, p. 79). Boyatzis (1998) describes
the technique as a process of ‘encoding qualitative information’. This process consists of six
steps (Braun and Clarke, 2006). In the first step the researcher becomes familiarized with the
data. This was relatively straight forward since one of the authors was actively involved in
the interviews. The second step involves the creation of an initial set of codes to capture the
key content of the interviews. The third step consists of searching for themes based on the
previously developed codes. In the fourth stage the researcher reviews the themes and test
theme against the original data. The fifth step requires the researcher to define and name the

15

<-----Page 16----->themes. By doing so, the researcher is identifying the “core” of what each theme captures.
This requires accuracy and precision. The last step involves the write-up of the thematic
analysis. The process is iterative with the researcher being able to revisit previous steps to
refine and confirm the analysis.

ANGEL GROUPS IN SCOTLAND: GROWTH AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
The paper is based on Scotland. This is a particularly appropriate context in which to
undertake this study. Scotland has experienced a rapid growth in the number of angel groups.
The initial groups – Archangels and Braveheart – were established in the 1990s. In 2002
LINC Scotland’s membership comprised 300 solo angels and just these two syndicates with
about 70 angel members between them. Ten years later (2012) a total of 24 groups have been
created, although some subsequently either closed or amalgamated. LINC Scotland currently
has 19 groups in membership, which it estimates comprise about 700 investors in total. There
are a small number of other groups that are not members of LINC Scotland. Individual
membership of LINC Scotland is now below 100. Of the 18 Scottish-based angel groups
interviewed for this study, nearly one-third (six, or 30%) were three years old or less,
underlining the recent growth in the formation of syndicates. Collectively they had just over
1,000 members, although this will include some double counting of investors who are
members of more than one group. Two groups have significant numbers of non-Scottish
based members. Membership ranges from less than 10 to over 100. Reflecting the skewed
nature of the visible market observed previously (Mason and Harrison, 2010; 2011), the five
groups with more than 100 members account for 70% of the total (Figure 1).

Figure 1 – Size Distribution of Angel Syndicate membership (source: LINC Scotland)

Two key drivers in the Scottish environment have resulted in this significant increase in angel
syndicate groups. First, LINC Scotland was created3 in 1992 as part of the Scottish Business
Birth Rate Strategy as a conventional business angel network, responsible for both the
demand and supply sides of the market and seeking to make ‘introductions’ between
investors and entrepreneurs that would lead to investments. Some ten years later Scottish
Enterprise, took increasing responsibility for the demand side, leaving LINC Scotland with an
agreed remit to develop the supply side of the market. It took the strategic decision,
influenced by the early successes of Braveheart and Archangels, that this was most
effectively achieved through the development of angel syndicates. Scottish Enterprise co-

17

<-----Page 18----->funds certain activities with LINC but does not provide core funding. LINC’s main sources of
funding come from ERDF4 and the private sector.

LINC actively sought to encourage its individual investors to band together. The older,
established groups were willing to share their knowledge with the new groups. This helps to
explain why, as we comment later, most of the groups have similar operating models. The
visibility of angel groups and publicity for LINC’s activities created a momentum and other
groups emerged independently of LINC’s efforts. These new groups typically emerged from
existing groups of investors who were already working together informally and so had a
‘club’ mentality. However, they were required to find a chairman/gatekeeper, either from
their own members or, less commonly, externally, in order to start investing. LINC Scotland
was able to support new angel groups financially on account of its access to ERDF funding.

The second driver was the Scottish Co-Investment Fund (SCIF) which came on stream in
2003 in response to the acute shortage of risk capital in the aftermath of the dotcom crash.
The SCIF was designed to invest alongside private sector investment partners on a pari passu
basis, investing up to £1 for every £1 invested by the partner to a maximum of £1m per
business (and with the introduction of follow-on funding from the Venture Fund deal sizes
can be even larger). The intention was to improve liquidity in the market, enabling partners to
make bigger investments, or follow-on investments, and freeing up part of their funds to
invest in new businesses rather than follow-on investments. The SCIF carried out due
diligence on prospective partners before accepting them onto the scheme. The partners make
their own investment decisions. SCIF did not undertake its own investment analysis. Their
only decision was to confirm that the business fell within the rules of the scheme. The

18

<-----Page 19----->eligibility criteria were known to investors. Partners could seek initial approval of a
prospective investment’s eligibility in principle at an early stage in their appraisal process.
Once investment terms were agreed by the partner, SCIF approval, or not, was generally
made within 24 hours of bringing an investment to the Fund. This high level of certainty was
built into the scheme following consultation with the initial angel groups and, arguably, has
been a key feature of its success. Although angel groups accounted for less than half of the
Fund’s investment partners, the fund’s maximum investment limit meant that the vast
majority of the deals that qualified were brought by angel groups rather than venture capital
funds.

The existence of the SCIF encouraged the emergence of syndicates in two respects. First, the
SCIF wanted to expand its number of investment partners so welcomed the formation of new
groups, especially in areas of the country where they were lacking. LINC Scotland was
specifically contracted to support the creation of three new groups per annum to be coinvestment partners. Second, angel groups received a 2.5% fee on completion of every coinvestment deal that they participated in. This provided useful additional income to fund the
syndicate’s running costs, supporting salaries of a gatekeeper and possibly one or more
administrative staff.

Investment activity by angel groups has grown steadily since 2002-3, in terms of both
number and amount invested. There were 81 deals in 2012 compared with just 22 in 2002-35
(Figure 2). Only part of the recent rise in investments is due to activity of new groups that did
not exist in 2010 (these groups made 8 investments in 2012). Moreover, investment activity is

the period 2009-12. Almost every other group made less than 10 new investments in the
period (i.e. excluding follow-on investments). The amount invested by members of the angel
groups has risen from £6.3m in 2002-3 to £22.5m in 2012 after peaking in 2011 (Figure 3).
Total aggregate investment (i.e. including co-investors) has increased even more sharply,
from £6.8m in 2002-03 to £30.9m in 2012, having peaked at £34.5m the previous year
(Figure 4), reflecting both the growth of the SCIF and the increasing tendency for angel
groups co-invest with one another. This represents a significant part of the risk capital market
in Scotland (Harrison et al 2010). According to the most recent Scottish Risk Capital report,
angels accounted for over one quarter of investments by value in the £100,000 to £2m range
(Table 2), rising to around half if the SCIF investments are also included.

Of course these investments represent only a fraction of the investment opportunities that the
groups see. The number of opportunities seen by the groups in the previous 12 months ranged
from under 10 (due to circumstances specific to that group) to over 250. However, the
majority of groups saw between 40 and 150 investment opportunities (median = 100). No
doubt some opportunities will be seen by more than one group. The overall ‘yield rate’ –
investments as a proportion of opportunities seen invested - was about 6.5%.

This is

significantly lower than the equivalent data reported by Sohl (2012) for US angel groups.
Assuming that the difference is real, rather due to data or definitional differences, then there
are several possible explanations for this difference. It may reflect differences in year – the
latest US figure is for 2009 whereas the Scottish data are for 2012 and there are considerable
year-on–year variations in the yield rates of US groups. Alternatively, it may reflect the
poorer quality of opportunities that Scottish groups see, their more exacting screening and
selection standards, or the superior investment capabilities of US groups (in terms of numbers
of members and dollars available for investment).

22

<-----Page 23----->Angel groups typically invest anywhere from £25,000 to £500,000 per round, with a few
outliers at each end. However, as the vast majority (85%) of deals had co-investors – almost
invariably the SCIF – so deal sizes were larger. Nevertheless, more than 90% of deals in
2009-10 were below £1m (the maximum allowable transaction under SCIF regulations).
However, the majority of this investment is follow-on funding. This peaked at over 80% at
the start of the financial crisis but has fallen back in 2011 and 2012 (Figure 5). Over 60% of
the companies raising finance in 2009-10 were at the early stage, and around 20% were at the
seed stage. The majority were in technology sectors. (Mason and Harrison, 2011).

However, it is important to recognise the diversity of the investment preferences amongst
Scottish angel groups. This is particularly apparent in terms of sector, where two categories
of groups can be identified. Six (of the 18) are specifically oriented to technology sectors,
with some having a very specific investment focus (e.g. biopharmaceuticals, energy, life
science) and two others have a ‘preference’ for technology. The remainder will invest in
23

<-----Page 24----->‘everything’ or ‘everything except X’. There is less diversity in terms of the stage of
development, with 15 groups looking to invest in early stage or start-up businesses. Two
groups are even more focused on proof of concept and seed stages. There is also diversity in
the size of investment. Three groups stated this was ‘unlimited’, two groups would invest up
to £500,000, and three would go up to £1m. However, the majority of groups are looking to
invest under £250,000 per deal, not including any coinvestment. Finally, the majority (12) of
groups are looking to invest in Scotland, although in a few cases this was ‘not exclusive’.
Four groups reported that they would invest worldwide, confirming that while angel investing
is a local phenomenon it is not exclusively so (Harrison et al, 2010b)

Three aspects of the investment activity of angel groups stand out. First, and reflecting one of
the comments by Sohl (2012), follow-on investments have quickly dominated the investment
activity of angel groups. This may be a ‘natural’ process, reflecting a combination of the
financial strength of angel groups to make follow-on investments and the lack of alternative
investors to provide follow-on funding (Harrison et al 2010a). However, some groups have
turned down the opportunity to bring institutional investors into deals, because of fears of
both being diluted and also losing control of the investment, particularly the ability to
influence, manage and control the exit. The need to invest in ordinary shares so that investors
qualify for tax relief under the Enterprise Investment Scheme is a further discouragement to
seek follow-on funding from institutional investors. As discussed earlier, these investors will
invest using preference shares and other more complex instruments which gives them greater
power over investors with ordinary shares.

Second, there have been surprisingly few exits (Figure 6). The groups have collectively made
37 exits which represents just 4% of their investments. The majority of groups - 12 of the 17

24

<-----Page 25----->Exits

that provided data - have not made any exits. To some extent this reflects the young age of
many of the groups. Indeed, four of the five groups that have achieved exits were formed at
least eight years ago, with the three longest established groups accounting for 92% of total
exits. Nevertheless, it is striking that the vast majority of groups that were founded between
five and eight years ago have not made any exits. This contrasts with earlier studies of exits
by UK business angels which reported median holding periods to exit of four years (Mason
and Harrison, 2002b) and six years (Wiltbank, 2010). This difference reflects the much
longer time that it is now taking globally to exit. It could therefore be argued that we no
longer know what represents the ‘norm’ and accordingly we risk interpreting these data with
unrealistic expectations.

25

<-----Page 26----->However, some commentators argue that the lack of exits also reflects the common view
amongst angel investors that it is inappropriate to discuss exits with entrepreneurs prior to
investing or even to actively pursue an exit after the investment is made (Gray, 2011). The
exit was traditionally never considered or discussed before investing. The prevailing view in
the angel investment community has been that “if you make good investments the exit will
take care of itself”. It is claimed that this approach has resulted in investments in companies
that are not of interest to potential acquirers and so have not been acquired. The outcome is
that large quantities of angel money – and public money that followed as co-investments – is
locked up in portfolios. Whether this remains the common approach of angel groups will be
the subject of a future paper.

The lack of exits has three knock-on effects. First, it contributes to the high proportion of
follow-on investments noted earlier. Second, it limits the amount of capital gains that can be
recycled into new investments, a primary target of national government policy to increase
angel investment levels. Investors also get discouraged having to invest more money into
existing businesses and not seeing returns from their previous investments. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that in some cases this has prompted angels to cease investing. Third, there
comes a point when the lack of exits has a negative influence on the ability of groups to
recruit new angels, or even for new groups to get started.

Third, and equally surprising, is the low number of failed investments (see Figure 6). These
account for 17% of total investments. The three oldest groups account for 82% of all losses.
Previous studies have reported that the median failed investment emerges after two or three
years (Mason and Harrison 2002b; Wiltbank, 2010). In view of the recessionary conditions
that have prevailed since 2008 it would be surprising if general business failure rates have

26

<-----Page 27----->been lower in recent years, so this might suggest that angel groups are managing their
unsuccessful investments badly. This is largely confirmed in our survey, with two-thirds of
the groups reporting that they had no formal strategy for dealing with the ‘living dead’ in
their portfolios. This creates the risk that these investments absorb time and further funding.
However, the groups that do have a strategy for these types of investments tend not to adopt a
‘fast failures’ strategy that is advocated as best practice (Mason and Harrison, 2012). On the
other hand, the ability of investors to pursue a fast fail strategy is limited by several factors,
notably their minority shareholding position and, perhaps, by the attitude of the coinvestment fund. It is unknown whether the SCIF would favour selling investments in ‘living
dead’ businesses back to the management for a nominal figure

ANGEL GROUP INVESTMENT PROCESSES
The investment process of angel groups is rather different to that of individual angels.
Previous research has established that individual angels undertake an initial screening process
to establish whether the proposal is a good fit with their investment criteria and would appear
to have merit. This is typically a fast process, taking anything from one to twenty minutes
(Mason and Rogers, 1997; Harrison et al, 1997), and upwards of 90% of proposals get
rejected at this stage (Feeney et al, 1999). Those proposals that get through the initial
screening are then investigated in detail.

The investment process of angel groups is rather more extended and involves more stages.
Two distinct approaches are apparent amongst the Scottish groups, although there are
differences of detail in each approach. In both cases the gatekeeper is the initial point of
contact for the business. The gatekeeper then undertakes the initial screening role. At its most
basic this may simply be to filter businesses against the group’s key investment criteria. In

27

<-----Page 28----->other cases it is more proactive with gatekeeper assessing the business plan and in some cases
contacting the entrepreneur to gather information about the company. In some groups the
gatekeeper may be assisted by one of the members, perhaps to bring in sector expertise.

The differences in approach occur at the next stage. In some groups the businesses that get
through the filtering and initial screening processes are evaluated in detail by a small group of
the angels. This may include a presentation by the entrepreneur to this inner core. They will
make a collective decision whether or not to invest in the business themselves. If this inner
core decide unanimously to invest then the opportunity is opened up to the rest of the group
for each member to decide individually whether they also want to invest. This approach is
typified by Archangels (Gregson et al, 2013). In the alternative approach those businesses
that get past the screening stage are presented to the group members. Typically the company
will make a presentation. Some groups will coach the entrepreneurs prior to the presentation.
Each individual member then makes their own decision whether or not they are interested in
investing. If there is sufficient interest then a sub-group is established to do the due diligence
and, if appropriate, negotiate the terms and conditions of the investment. The deal will then
be brought back to the members to make individual decisions whether or not to invest.

The key difference between these two approaches is therefore who drives the process after
the initial screening stage. In the first approach it is driven by an active core group of angels,
with the outer core only being invited to invest, on a take-it or leave-it basis, in those deals
that the core group have decided to invest in. In the second approach the members drive the
process, with the gatekeeper undertaking due diligence on those businesses that the
membership are interested in.

28

<-----Page 29----->Compared with individual angels (Mason and Harrison, 1996b), raising finance from angel
groups is more costly for the entrepreneur. None of the Scottish groups require entrepreneurs
to ‘pay to pitch’; however, four groups charge fees associated with the due diligence process
and the majority of groups charge deal/completion fees when the investment is made
(typically 3% of the amount raised) (10 groups) and also levy ongoing non-executive director
monitoring fees (11 groups).

This investment process has a number of implications for entrepreneurs seeking finance from
angel groups. First, there are more people involved in the process and hence more people
have to be persuaded of the merits of the investment opportunity. Second, gatekeepers have
the power to reject investment opportunities but it is the members who make the decision to
invest. The entrepreneur has therefore to get past the gatekeeper in order to reach potential
investors. Third, in contrast to traditional business angel networks where the pitch to an
audience of potential investors is at the start of the process and is used by the investors as the
initial screening process, with angel groups the pitching stage occurs later in the process after
the business has passed the initial screen. This, in turn, has implications for the content and
style of the pitch. Fourth, raising finance from angel groups incurs fees whereas this would
not typically be the case with individual angels. However, business angel networks also
change fees. Finally, given the various stages and different people involved, the length of
time to secure an investment from an angel group will generally be longer than in the case of
individual angels.

THE GATEKEEPER
The previous discussion has highlighted the critical role of the group gatekeeper in the
investment process, managing both the day-to-day operations of the group and, more

29

<-----Page 30----->significantly, controlling access to investors. The emergence of this new actor is one of the
most significant outcomes of the growth of angel groups, with considerable implications both
for scholars who continue to focus on how individual angels make their investment decisions
and also for entrepreneurs. Gatekeepers are of two types: member gatekeepers and manager
gatekeepers (Paul and Whittam, 2010). Gatekeepers have typically emerged from within the
group that initially started the angel group. However, the bigger groups, such as Braveheart
and Archangels, have appointed external managers as they became larger. Some groups have
gone further, hiving off a separate administrator function from the gatekeeper’s role. Indeed,
in 11 of the 18 groups (61%) the role of gatekeeper is shared. In contrast, building an angel
group around a gatekeeper has not proved to be a successful approach. In half of the groups
(9) that were interviewed, members act as managers (more than half of whom receive
remuneration), five groups (28%) have hired an external manager and in the remaining four
groups the gatekeeper role is shared between a member and someone that has been hired. The
implication is that the gatekeeper function changes as the group’s activities increase and
portfolio management becomes a more time consuming and critical function.

The gatekeeper undertakes a variety of functions (Table 3). Two-thirds of gatekeepers
undertake external-facing roles, notably the promotion of the group to attract new investors
and entrepreneurs. Around half also report that they undertake internal roles, mostly
interacting and communicating with the members. However, their main functions are
associated with managing the investment process. Gatekeepers review the business plans and
executive summaries that they receive from entrepreneurs seeking finance, decide whether it
meets the investment criteria of the group, may seek additional information and even meet
the entrepreneur and ultimately make the decision whether the opportunity is passed on to the
group members, whether an inner core or the entire group, to be considered for investment.

30

<-----Page 31----->The gatekeeper may also be responsible for preparing one or more supporting papers on the
business for the group. The gatekeeper will also follow up with members to gauge their
interest in the opportunity. In the second model, discussed in the previous section, if the
group is interested in the business then the gatekeeper will also be involved in the due
diligence process and even in the negotiation. It is of note that fewer than half of the
gatekeepers are involved in the process after the investment is made. Specifically, few
gatekeepers see the preparation of investee companies for an exit being as being part of their
role.

The backgrounds of the gatekeepers are remarkably varied. There is considerable variety in
academic expertise, albeit with a bias to accounting, finance and law. Just under half reported
work experience in banking, accountancy or corporate finance. Eleven (52%) had
entrepreneurial experience although 15 (71%) have personal experience of making angel
investments, reflecting the presence of a number of member angels as gatekeepers. The vast
majority thought they were prepared for the role (95%), even though those in the longer
established groups were actually pioneers, defining and shaping the role. Collectively,
respondents identified a wide variety of skills that were necessary for the role (Table 4).
Those most frequently mentioned were communication skills, people-management skills, and
financial skills. Both broader business-related experience and specific business know-how

32

<-----Page 33----->were also seen by a significant minority of angels as being necessary. The majority of
gatekeepers (59%) believed that they had these skills when the assumed this role. The
remainder indicated that the role was a constant learning experience.

The main areas where, with the benefit of hindsight, angels recognised their knowledge to be
deficient were in terms of the operation of angel syndicates and deal structures. This is
perhaps not surprising in view of the differences between the role of the gatekeeper and that
of an individual angel. Key areas of learning were syndication, deal terms and people –
managing them, communicating with them and accessing them.

CONCLUSION
Angel investing is changing from an invisible and largely individual process to one in which
angels are joining together in organised and managed groups to invest. This is evident in the
USA and Canada, Western Europe and Australia and New Zealand, although the pace of
change has varied between countries. Yet despite the growing significance of the angel
market as a key source of finance for entrepreneurial companies at the start of the so-called
funding escalator little scholarly attention has been devoted to this development, despite the
possibility that it renders much of the existing research base redundant. Nor has there been
much consideration of the practical consequences of this change either for entrepreneurs and
investors nor the policy implications. This paper is the first attempt to provide an in-depth
examination of the growth of angel groups and the implications for the financing of
entrepreneurial ventures.

The paper draws on evidence from Scotland where, for a variety of reasons, the emergence of
angel groups has proceeded further than anywhere else outside of the USA. Indeed,

33

<-----Page 34----->Scotland’s population of angel groups is larger than that of the majority of US states. There
are currently around 20 angel groups in Scotland compared with just two prior to 2000. They
account for more than one-quarter of all investment activity by value in the £100,000 to £2m
range, and more than half if the pull through of investment from the Scottish Co-Investment
Fund is also considered. However, activity is skewed to a minority of larger and longerestablished groups.

The existing debate about the implications of the growth of angel groups mainly focuses on
the benefits, notably their greater visibility and greater professionalism compared with
individual angels which, it is argued, reduces the time and cost for the entrepreneur of raising
finance. In addition it is thought to have expanded the supply of informal venture capital by
attracting passive investors who lack the capabilities to invest on their own. However, others
have raised the concern that the essence of angel investing is at risk of being lost as the
process becomes more organised. Some have also expressed the concern that the angel
market could evolve in the same way as venture capital funds, shifting to making larger and
later stage investments and losing its ability to add value.

Our evidence is finely balanced. On the supply side the process has reduced the number of
investment decision-makers in the market as individual angels have joined angel groups. It
has probably also reduced the number of investments of £50,000 and below which are too
small for groups to make. However, crowdfunding may fill this gap. Groups have focused on
making larger investments and follow-on investments, with the latter trend in particular
constraining the number of new investments. Nevertheless, the creation of new syndicates
continues to mobilise new capital into the market. On the other hand, the greater investment
capability of angel groups has filled the funding gap created by the decline of venture capital

34

<-----Page 35----->funds specialising in seed, start-up and early stage financing. From a process point of view
angel groups extend the investment process, adding more stages and increasing the decisiontime, and the gatekeeper now controls access to the angels. Moreover, market deficiencies
remain. The emergence of angel groups, with government support, has helped resolve the
‘traditional’ equity gap (originally under £250,000 but other definitions have put this figure
closer to £1m). However it has opened up a ‘second’ equity gap (Murray, 1994; Sohl, 2012)
above £1m-£2m for growth capital, beyond the capability of virtually all angel groups, even
with syndication. This is a challenge for angel-backed companies requiring growth capital to
fulfil their potential and may result in their premature sale to overseas companies to the
possible detriment of both investors and the regional economy.

Moreover, Scotland’s angel market may be out of equilibrium. First, the availability of ERDF
funding may have resulted in too many angel groups being created for the available
investment opportunities. Second, it may have resulted in too many manager-led groups and
limited involvement of individual members in contrast to the USA where there appears to be
greater member involvement. Third, some of the angel groups may not be financially
sustainable, certainly without the public sector support they receive. The groups most at risk
are those that have expensive manager-gatekeeper functions and a process that is not
sufficiently ruthless at the initial screening stage, combined with the lack sufficient volume of
investment activity to generate fee income. However, this situation has arisen because LINC
has followed a strategy of increasing investment channels to provide increased choice for
businesses seeking finance. Moreover, if there is an inevitability that established groups focus
on follow-on investments as they mature then there is an ongoing need to create new groups
to make new investments. But new groups take time to reach critical mass, and some may

35

<-----Page 36----->never become fully viable. The alternative outcome might have been fewer, larger groups
which would also have been seen as detrimental for economic development.

A further concern is that some groups appear to be evolving, not to become venture capital
funds, as Sohl (2007; 2012) feared, but fund managers. This is most clearly seen in the case
of Braveheart, now listed on AIM, which describes itself as follows:
Braveheart has around £120m of funds under management and provides equity, loan
and mezzanine funding to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It also provides
SMEs with advisory services, particularly in the areas of corporate finance and
investment readiness. Funding is provided by way of various regional/national funds
and by investment syndicates which the Group establishes and facilitates. Braveheart
also serves the investment appetites of high net worth individuals (HNWs), family
offices, institutional investors and public sector organisations spanning the UK and
Europe.
At least one other group appears to be moving in a similar direction.

Finally, what has been the economic impact of Scotland’s much admired business angel
market? The support that the angel market has received from the public sector both through
ERDF funding and indirectly via the Enterprise Investment Scheme means that this question
cannot be ignored, although it could be argued to be premature. Moreover, there is a risk in
answering the question that it is based on inappropriate yardsticks. Arguably, we lack
sufficient evidence to make a judgement on what represents “success”. Taking the ‘glass half
empty’ viewpoint, a strong case can be made that the impact has been disappointing.
Investors have achieved relatively few exits and most of these have been small, with the
consequence that little wealth has been created for recycling in new ventures, and

36

<-----Page 37----->management learning in a growth company context has been truncated. The other side of this
coin is that it has not led to the creation of ‘companies of scale’, a key focus of Scottish
Enterprise policy over the past decade (Brown and Mason, 2012). The riposte to these
criticisms is twofold. First, acquisitions data shows that the market is dominated by small
exits, typically £25m to £50m, which give a good return to investors but are small enough
that the cashed-out entrepreneurs need to become serial entrepreneurs. Second, it is not the
role of angels to build ‘companies of scale’ (although they have been responsible for a
handful in the past, e.g. Optos). Moreover, these companies are likely to require significant
amounts of finance and therefore carry a significant dilution risk for angels and also
appropriate management.

A glass ‘half full’ perspective would argue that Scotland has stumbled upon an effective
model of angel investing that overcomes the limitations of its angel market imposed by its
historic low level of entrepreneurial activity (Paul et al 2003). This model makes efficient use
of its limited number of active angels to serve as nodes to cluster less knowledgeable money
of high income individuals typically in the professions and who are looking for tax efficient
investments. In the absence of such groups it is quite possible that this money will have been
invested with the traditional fund managers who will not have channelled it either to
entrepreneurial businesses or in Scotland.

So, what are the wider implications beyond Scotland for countries looking to stimulate their
own angel markets? First, choices need to be made, notably between support for BANs and
support for angel groups. Both models result in entrepreneurs receiving funding from angel
investors. To outsiders, the models may seem quite similar but, to angels and entrepreneurs,
the two models are quite different. From a public policy perspective, the evidence on the

37

<-----Page 38----->relative effectiveness of these models is not clear-cut. Second, context matters. LINC
Scotland’s access to ERDF was critical in terms of the number and diversity of angel groups
that have been created, and the dominance of manager-led models. The co-investment fund,
which has been successfully replicated elsewhere (New Zealand, Canada), has also been
critical. Third, there are different models to that developed in Scotland. For example, Halo in
Northern Ireland (http://www.nisp.co.uk/halo/about/) has developed a model in which they
act as the first selection gate for angel groups, inviting them to large pitching events, while
other groups that are not members of Halo will form an outer ‘ring’ to ‘bulk up’ the
investments led by the groups. Fourth, policy-makers cannot simply intervene in one part of
the market. Supporting the angel market has largely addressed the conventional equity gap
but with more early stage companies being funded, combined with the decline in venture
capital funds, this can created an unsatisfied demand for growth funding in amounts in excess
of £1m, the so-called “Series A crunch”. Finally, it is uncertain how crowdfunding will affect
the angel market.
