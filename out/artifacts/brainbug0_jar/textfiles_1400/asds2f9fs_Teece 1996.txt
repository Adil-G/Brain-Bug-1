Abstract
The formal and informal structures of firms and their external linkages have an important bearing
on the rate and direction of innovation. This paper explores the properties of different types of firms
with respect to the generation of new technology. Various archetypes are recognized and an effort is
made to match organization structure to the type of innovation. The framework is relevant to
technology and competition policy as it broadens the framework economists use to identify
environments that assist innovation.

1. Introduction
It is increasingly
recognized
that the dynamism
of a competitive private enterprise
system flows from the development and application of new technology and the adoption
of new organizational forms. As a result, attention is being focused on trying to develop a
better understanding of the institutional environment in which these activities take place.
In market economies, the business firm is clearly the leading player in the development
and commercialization
of new products and processes.* However, much of the literature

in economics proceeds as if the identity of the firm in which innovation is taking place is
of little moment. Moreover, the links between firm structure and strategy and the
innovation process are poorly understood.3
In this paper, it is suggested that the formal and informal structures of the firm, as well
as the network of external linkages that they possess, has an important bearing on the
strength as well as the kind of innovative activity conducted by private enterprise
economies4 Frameworks are presented to indicate how firm structure and the nature of
innovation
are linked. The approach adopted eschews optimality
and embraces
comparative analysis, in the spirit of Williamson’
(1975, 1985), whereby alternatives
are compared to each other rather than to hypothetical idealsThe institutional context is
also considered. In particular, the role of capital markets is at least addressed, and the
legal infrastructure is not assumed away completely. Indeed, various aspects of the legal
system, and in particular intellectual property law, are explicitly considered.
The general approach adopted involves (1) identifying the fundamental characteristics
of technological development, (2) determining the factors that affect innovation at the
level of the firm, (3) identifying distinctive archetypes or governance modes for firms,
and (4) choosing from available alternatives the organizational forms better suited to deal
with various types of innovation. It is hoped that analyzing innovation in this manner will
help broaden the agenda for industrial organization economists and organization theorists
as they begin to grapple with understanding
one of the most distinctive features of
modem capitalism.

2. Fundamental

characteristics

of technological

development

It is impossible to identify the organizational requirements of the innovation process
without first specifying underlying properties of technological innovation. Fortunately,
there appears to be on emerging consensus among scholars who study the innovation
process with respect to the stylized facts. In the main, these appear to characterize
innovation independently of the organizational context in which it takes place.
2.1. Uncertainty
Innovation is a quest into the unknown. It involves searching and the probing and
reprobing of technological as well as market opportunities. With hindsight, much effort is
spent traveling down blind alleys. Serendipity and luck play an important role. There are
various types of uncertainty. Tjalling Koopmans (1957) has made a useful distinction
between primary and secondary uncertainty. Both are critical in the context of innovation.
3For a review, see Dosi et al. (1988).
?he following statement by Little (1985, p.14) is representative of accepted views: “Our work among
innovative companies indicates that the management decision on how to organize for innovation is critical.”
‘The approach rejects assumptions of temporal equilibrium. The framework does not assume that the selection
process immediately weeds out all organizations that do not match the business environment at a particular point
in time. While the organizational system is seen as gravitating toward an end point or equilibrium, it takes so
long to reach it that the environment is likely to change again in the interim, leading to a state of perpetual
disequilibrium.

Secondary
uncertainty
arises “from lack of communication,
that is, from one
decision-maker
having no way of finding out the concurrent decisions and plans
made by others.” Primary uncertainty
arises from “random
acts of nature and
unpredictable
changes in concurrent
preferences”
(1957, pp.162,163).
Williamson
recognizes a third kind of uncertainty, which he calls behavioral uncertainty, which is
attributable
to opportunism.
Such uncertainty
can lead to ex post surprises.6 It is
important to note that secondary uncertainty can be affected by changing the boundaries
of the organization.
As Richardson (1990) and Williamson
(1975) have explained,
vertical integration can facilitate the coordination of complementary investments through
the sharing of investment
plans. Secondary
uncertainty
is thus a function
of
organizational
form.
2.2. Path dependency
Technology often evolves in certain path dependent ways, contoured and channeled by
what might be thought of as technological paradigms (Dosi, 1982, 1982). A technological
paradigm is a pattern of solutions to selected technical problems which derives from
certain engineering relationships. A paradigm identifies the problems that have to be
solved and the way to inquire about them; within a paradigm, research efforts become
channeled along certain trajectories.’ Relatedly, new product and process developments
for a particular organization
are likely to lie in the technological
neighborhood
of
previous successes.

also makes information a valuable commodity. Information about which outcomes will occur, or
are more likely to occur, will obviously have great value. Information, of course, itself has very special
characteristics.
It is not only an indivisible commodity, in which case the classic problems of allocation in the
presence of indivisibilities will be present, but it is also highly tacit, as discussed below. Often it cannot be
readily articulated and codified in language. Combined with the absence of legal protection, these features make
it difficult to trade.
‘Examples of technological paradigms include the internal combustion engine, biotechnology, and tungsten
filament lighting. Technological discontinuities occur when new paradigms emerge. Thus new technologies are
more threatening to existing skills and capabilities if they embody a new paradigm. The emergence of
microelectronics,
which carried with it a new paradigm, was far more threatening to the skills of incumbents
than the emergence of the facsimile, which fused the technology of the telephone and the copier.
‘Specific technological skills in one field (e.g. pharmaceuticals)
may be applicable in closely-related fields
(e.g. pesticides) but they are unlikely to be of use in distant fields (e.g. aircraft). See Teece (1988). Teece et al.
(1994).

2.4. Irreversibilities
Technological progress exhibits strong irreversibilities.
This follows not just because
innovation typically requires specialized investments,
but because the evolution of
technologies along certain trajectories eliminates the possibility of competition from
older technologies,
even if relative prices change significantly.
Thus mechanical
calculators are unlikely to ever replace electronic ones, even if the relative prices of
silicon and steel were to switch by a factor of 1 0009 in favor of steel.
2.5. Technological

interrelatedness

Innovation
is characterized
by technological
interrelatedness
between various
subsystems. Linkages to other technologies, to complementary assets, and to users must
be maintained if innovation is to be successful. If recognizable organizational
subunits
such as R&D, manufacturing, and marketing exist, they must be in close and continuous
communication
and engage in mutual adaptation if innovation in commercially relevant
products and processes is to have a chance of succeeding. Moreover, successful
commercial innovation usually requires quick decision making and close coupling and
coordination
among research, development,
manufacturing,
sales and service. Put
differently, organizational capacities must exist to enable these activities to be closely
coordinated, and to occur with dispatch.
2.6. Tacitness
The knowledge developed by organizations is often highly tacit. That is, it is difficult if
not impossible to articulate and codify (Polanyi, 1962, Winter, 1987). A corollary is that
technology transfer is often difficult without the transfer of key individuals.
This
simultaneously
explains why imitation is often costly, and why the diffusion of new
technology often depends on the mobility of engineers and scientists (Teece, 1977,
Nelson and Winter, 1977). Relatedly, an organization’s
technology ought not to be
thought of as residing in some hypothetical book of blueprints, or with some hypothetical
chief engineer, but in an organization’s system and habits of coordinating and managing
tasks. These systems and habits have been referred to as organizational routines (Nelson
and Winter, 1982). It is the performance of these routines that is at the essence of an
organization’s technological capacity.

‘c For instance, it is possible to receive a patent which is arguably too narrow or too broad in relation to the
patent holder’s contribution to economic welfare. Moreover, in many cases legal protection for technical
contributions may simply not be available, or if available may be difficult to enforce.

copyrightability
of the object or subject matter) and are temporary. Or as Arrow (1996)
put it, technical information
is a “fugitive resource, with limited property rights.”
Accordingly, investment in innovative activity may not necessarily yield property which
can be reserved for the exclusive use of the innovator. But the activity may nevertheless
still be valuable enough to attract some investment,
depending
in part on other
institutional arrangements to be examined later. The degree to which new products and
processes are protectable under intellectual property law will henceforth be referred to as
the intellectual property regime. For expositional simplicity, regimes will be classified as
strong if patents and copyrights are effective, and weak otherwise. Clearly, the industrial
world does not readily bifurcate, and there exists a continuum of appropriability regimes,
as data assembled by Levin et al. (1987) make apparent.
The market for know-how is further confounded because in order to provide full
information to the buyer, the seller of know-how may have to disclose the object of the
exchange, but in so doing the basis for the exchange evaporates, or at least erodes, as the
potential buyer might now have in its possession that which he was seeking to acquire.
Hence, transactions
in the market for know-how must proceed under conditions of
ignorance. Accordingly, at least until reputations become established, exchange is likely
to be exposed to hazards. Optimal resource allocation is unlikely to result.

3. Organizational and market determinants

of the rate and

While our understanding
of innovation has been enriched in recent years, the basic
framework employed in policy debates about innovation,
technology
policy, and
competition policy are often remarkably naive and highly incomplete. Even elementary
considerations
such as those identified in Section 2 are frequently
neglected. In
economics, for instance, it is not uncommon to find debate about innovation policy
collapsing to a rather outmoded discussion of the relative virtues of competition and
monopoly, as if they were the key determinants of innovation. Clearly there is much more
at work. In this section, various classes of variables - some economic,
some
organizational
- are identified that impact the rate and direction of innovation.
Subsequent
sections will identify distinct types of organizations
based on various
organizational attributes. A final section will then endeavor to match these organizations
to different types and levels of innovation.
3.1. Monopoly

power

One reason why our understanding
of innovation has not proceeded faster in the last
half century is that many researchers, particularly industrial organization economists,
have overly focused on just one variable: the degree of market power that a firm or firms
may have. The evidence is unequivocal that competition and rivalry are important for
innovation; but few believe that the world of perfect competition in which firms compete
in highly fragmented
markets using identical
nonproprietary
technologies
is an
organizational
arrangement
that any advanced economy would aspire to achieve.

<-----Page 5----->198

D.J. Teem/J.

of Economic Behavior & Org. 31 (1996) 193-224

Nevertheless, many policy debates proceed on the assumption that fragmented markets
assist innovation.”
Schumpeter was among the first to declare that perfect competition was incompatible
with innovation. He noted, “The introduction of new methods of production and new
commodities is hardly conceivable with perfect - and perfectly prompt - competition
from the start. And this means that the bulk of what we call economic progress is
incompatible with it.“12 However, the Schumpeterian notion that small entrepreneurial
firms lack financial resources seems archaic, at least in countries with a vigorous venture
capital market. In any case, the Schumpeterian debate seems a little beside the point, as
there is an enormous number of variables that can potentially intervene between the
generation of monopolistic rents and the allocation of resources to the development of
new products and processes. Consider, first, single product firms. The notion that
innovation requires the cash flow generated by the exercise of monopoly power assumes
both that (1) capital markets are inefficient, and (2) that monopolistic levels of internal
cash flows are adequate to fund the requisite R&D programs. If capital markets are
operating according to what Fama (1970) has called strong form eficiency, then cash flow
is unimportant because firms with high yield projects will be able to signal their profit
opportunities
to the capital market and the requisite financing will come forth on
competitive terms. Thus if there is strong form efficiency and zero transaction costs (its
corollary), cash will get matched to projects whether or not the cash is internally
generated.
In fact, the world is not properly characterized by zero transaction costs, but that does
not mean that the availability of internal cash flows from monopoly (as compared to
competitive) product market positions is what makes the difference between being able to
fund a project and not being able to fund it. Significant innovative efforts involve
expenditures in a particular year which may be many times the available cash flows. So
the availability of marginally higher cash flows occasioned by monopoly power are
unlikely to grossly change the financial picture, except in unusual circumstances.
Furthermore, even in the absence of adequate internal cash flow, firms need not go to
the capital market to find the requisite financing. The ‘Schumpeterian”
view of the
innovation processes appears to be one that involves full integration, from research,
development, manufacturing
and marketing. But the financial requirements associated
with developing and commercializing
new products and processes can be accomplished
with a myriad organizational
arrangements
including
research joint ventures, coproduction,
and co-marketing
arrangements.
With such arrangements,
there is the
possibility that the capital requirements associated with a new project could be drastically
reduced for the innovator. Economies of scale and scope can often be captured through
interfitm arrangements. In some instances they cannot.13

“Clearly rivalry and competition are important to innovation, but belief in the virtues of perfectly competitive
systems is lore, reflecting casual empiricism and prejudice and not careful theorizing and empirical study. The
same is true for monopoly.
‘*Schumpeter (1934, p.105).

oriented analysis of the limits of outsourcing in the context of innovation, see
Chesbrough and Teece (1996).

199

The link between market power and innovation in specific markets is further undone if
the multidivisional
multiproduct firm is admitted into the scene.14 The basic function and
purpose of the multiproduct structure is to allocate cash generated everywhere to highyield purposes anywhere. If a multidivisional
multiproduct firm does operate this way,
and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that they can and do, then the link between
market power in a particular market and the funding of innovation in that market is
undone. In a multiproduct
firm selling products in markets A through Z, the cash
generated by virtue of power in market A can indeed fund innovation relevant to market
A, but it can equally well fund innovative activity in market Z. The capital market inside
the multiproduct
firm thus unlocks the relationship
between market structure and
innovation proposed by Schumpeter.
When firms do go into the capital market they generally have multiple sources of
funding available. Generically, these can be split into debt and equity. The various types
of debt and equity can on the one hand be thought of as financial instruments or, as
Williamson
suggests, as different “governance
structures” (Williamson,
1988, 1996).
Williamson explains that the decision by firms to use debt or equity to support individual
investment projects is likely to be linked to the redeployability
of the underlying
investment. Since new product development programs commonly involve investment in
assets that are substantially
irreversible
(like R&D) andfor non-redeployable
(like
specialized equipment), debt is only of limited value in financing innovation, unless a
firm has collateral and is under-leveraged
to begin with. Accordingly, the fund sources
generally available to support new product development are internal cash flow and new
equity. In instances when a firm does not already have substantial cash flows, then equity
is the major source of new funds. The role of equity is made distinct if it is considered in
the context of “start-up” firms which do not already have free cash flows. Investors have
obvious problems in evaluating the prospects for new products and processes, and the
best investees have problems, though less serious, in identifying the best investors.15
Now consider internally generated cash flow. Even in the United States where there is a
vibrant venture capital market, internal “free” cash flow is the major source of private
financing for innovation. A firm’s cash flow is not just a function of price-cost margins in
the product markets (sometimes suggested as a proxy for monopoly power) but its
existing asset structures and the need for new investment in existing businesses. A
business can clearly be a “cash cow” even if it is earning only competitive returns. This
would be true if the firm was gradually divesting itself, or simply harvesting its position
‘%ee Kay et al. (1990), undated working paper.
“The investors’ problems are rather obvious. The investor has the difficult challenge of calibrating investment
prospects in an environment where there is usually high market uncertainty, high technical uncertainty, and
bountiful opportunism and optimism. Several kinds of opportunism are possible. One is simply that the
technology can be misrepresented.
This tendency, however, can be checked if the investor hires technical
consultants to validate the entrepreneurs’ claims. Another is that the tenacity and veracity of the entrepreneur are
difficult to calibrate, with consequences much more unfortunate for the investor than for the entrepreneur.
Ascertaining whether the entrepreneurs’ optimism is honest yet misplaced is perhaps even more difftcult. There
is “much evidence that in the context of planning and action most people are prone to extreme optimism in their
forecasts of outcomes, and often fail to appreciate the chances of an unfavorable outcome” (Kahneman and
Lovallo, 1995, p.2). Decision makers often take risks because they deny their existence or underestimate their
extent (March and Shapira, 1987).

in a particular market. Internally generated cash can be readily allocated by management
and is not typically constrained by covenants.
Over the last half decade, a controversial body of literature has emerged which, in
essence, argues that free cash flows must be distributed to shareholders, rather than being
invested internally in discretionary projects, if firms are to operate efficiently (Jensen,
1989). The basic idea is that the discipline of debt is needed to cause capital to be
channeled to high-yield uses in the economy, as well as in the firm. There are severe
problems with this thesis, not least of which is that debt holders are loss averse and not at
all business-opportunity
driven. While it may indeed be the case that free cash flows do
sometimes get misallocated by managers, to delimit them in the manner proposed by
advocates of the free cash flow hypothesis is to force the firm into equity markets to
finance innovation. For reasons explained earlier, this is not always desirable because the
new issues markets, both public and private, have disabilities with respect to recognizing
and funding new opportunities.
To summarize, innovation clearly requires access to capital. The necessary capital can
come from cash flows or from equity. At least with respect to early stage activity, debt
financing is unlikely to be viable, unless the firm has other assets to pledge. However,
certain downstream
investments
needed to commercialize
innovation
can be debt
financed if they are redeployable. Alternatively, alliances can be entered which reduce the
need for new investment in complementary
assets. The point, however, is that there are
many factors besides firm size, and the presence or absence of market power, that affect
an innovator’s capacity to access capitaLI
3.2. Hierarchy
Hierarchy arose to help in the administration of military, religious, and governmental
activities.17 While hierarchies are old, deep hierarchies are relatively new. Anthropologists point out that most tribes, clans and agricultural enterprises have rather flat
hierarchies. The Roman Catholic Church, for instance, has only four levels. Centralizing
and decentralizing are not genuine alternatives for organization; the key issue is to decide
the mix. Hierarchies can accomplish complex organizational
tasks, but they are often
associated with organizational properties inimical to innovation, such as slow (bureaucratic) decision making and weak incentives.
3.2.1. Bureaucratic decision making.
Decision making processes in hierarchical
organizations
almost always involve
bureaucratic features. In particular, a formal expenditure process involving submissions
and approvals is characteristic. Decision making is likely to have a committee structure,
with top management requiring reports and written justifications for significant decisions.
Moreover, approvals may need to be sought from outside the organizational unit in which
16For an expanded discussion, see Day et al. (1993). part I.
“Hierarchical
subdivision is not a characteristic
that is peculiar to human organization. It is common to
virtually all complex systems of which we have knowledge (Simon, 1973, p.202). The advantages of hierarchy
are well understood. In particular, among systems of a given size and complexity, hierarchical systems require
much less information transmission among their parts than do other types of systems.

<-----Page 8----->D.J. Teece/J.

201

the expenditure is to take place. While this may ensure a matching up of expenditures to
opportunities across a wider range of economic activity, it unquestionably
slows decision
making and tends to reinforce the status quo.
The latter characteristic follows from committee decision making structures, which
almost always tend toward balancing and compromise. But innovation is often ill served
by such structures, as the new and the radical will almost always appear threatening to
some constituents.
Put differently, representative
structures, bureaucratic or political,
often tend to endorse the status quo. Strong leaders can often overcome such tendencies,
but such leaders are not always present and their capacities are often thwarted by the
organization.‘*
One consequence is what Williamson (1975) has referred to as a “program persistence
bias,” and its corollary the “anti-innovation
bias.” Program persistence refers to the
funding of programs beyond what can be sustained on merits, and follows from the
presence or influence of program advocates in the resource allocation process. This
proclivity almost automatically has the countervailing effect of reducing funds available
to new programs, which are unlikely to be well represented in the decision making
process. As Anthony Downs points out, “the increasing size of the bureau leads to a
gradual ossification of operations - since each proposed action must receive multiple
approvals, the probability of its being rejected is quite high - its cumbersome machinery
cannot produce results fast enough, and its anti-novelty bias may block the necessary
innovation”
(p. 160).
and diversification
(organizationally
and
The sharpening
of global competition,
geographically) in the sources of new knowledge compels firms to make decisions faster,
and to reduce time to market in order to capture value from technological innovation. It
seems clear that to accomplish such responsiveness,
organizations need new structures
and different decision-making
protocols to facilitate entrepreneurial
and innovative
behavior. Burgelman (1984) identifies a menu of such arrangements
which include:
special business units, new ventures department, new venture divisions, and independent
business units. Clearly, all of these designs imply smaller, flatter and more specialized
structures within which to conduct activities where speed and responsiveness are critical.
In the limit, the spinoff or spinout of a new division signifies that the enterprise’s (or at
least the individuals associated with it) chances of success are greater outside rather than
inside an established hierarchy. In addition to the creation of semi-autonomous
units,
firms can attempt to “delayer” by stripping out layers of middle management.
But
flattening organizations
need not fundamentally
redefine the relationships
between
people and functions in the organizations. Functions may still work sequentially, with
decisions being made from fragmented perspectives.

‘*Oozier (1964, p.225) puts it this way: “People on top theoretically have a great deal of power and often
much more power than they would have in other, more authoritarian societies. But these powers are not very
useful, since people on top can act only in an impersonal way and can in no way interfere with the subordinate
strata. They cannot, therefore, provide real leadership on a daily basis. If they want to introduce change, they
must go through the long and difftcuh ordeal of a crisis, Thus, although they are all-powerful because they are at
the apex of the whole centralized system, they are made so weak by the pattern of resistance of the different
isolated strata that they can use their power only in truly exceptional circumstances.”

<-----Page 9----->202

In essence, the organizational
challenge appears to be that activities are not as
decomposable as they used to be, and that cross-functional
interaction must take place
concurrently, rather than sequentially, if firms are to cut time-to-market for new products
and processes. Cross-functional
and cross-departmental
networks must be strengthened
without causing information overload. Computer networks can assist cross-functional
interaction by project teams, concurrent engineering teams, network teams, task forces
and the like. If such activity becomes completely unstructured, it augments rather than
displaces bureaucracy. Instead of random ad hoc approaches, what is needed are welldefined cross-functional
teams, which can be redefined as needed. With organizational
subunits cross-linked in this way, authority occurs as much from knowledge as position in
the organizational hierarchy. The challenge is to develop a culture which supports the
establishment
of cross-functional
teams which draw on the requisite knowledge,
wherever it may be located.
3.2.2. Low-powered incentives.
As they grow, organizations often become characterized by what Williamson (1985,
p. 153) calls “low powered incentives.” Low-powered incentives can be defined as those
where the co-variance of employee compensation with business unit performance is low.
One reason is that compensation structures inside large organizations need to be sensitive
to relative as well as absolute levels of compensation. If the compensation structure itself
has value through the relativities it establishes, then the enterprise will be reluctant to
disturb the structure to support innovation. Another reason is that stock options cannot be
granted to reflect divisional performance since it is generally the case that the division’s
shares are nontradeable in public markets. The absence of a public equity market for
subunit shares thus deprives the firm of the opportunity to provide an objective capital
market-based
augmentation
to compensation. l9 If the employee is rewarded instead
through stock in the total enterprise, the impact of divisional, departmental,
and
individual performance is likely to be severely diluted.*”
3.2.3. Principal-agent distortions.
Business firms of great size are rarely owner managed. Inasmuch as managers
(agents) trade-off enterprise performance for their own welfare, innovation is likely
to be impaired. This is because the interests of managers are sometimes at odds with
what innovation requires, because the tenure of top management
is usually much
shorter than the gestation period for major innovations. Moreover, principals must invest
in costly information collection and monitoring activities in order to check up on the
performance of agents. These costs can be considerable. Moreover, principals may insist
on certain expenditure controls which themselves slow decision making and thwart
innovation.

“Surrogate valuation indexes can sometimes be created based on the use of “yardstick” companies,
typically do not convey liquidity.

Myopia.

Organizations can become closed to changes in the market and business environment
and to new sources of technology. Individuals in organizations, including chief executive
officers, can fall into the trap of adopting a citadel mentality. The availability of free cash
flows can help sustain that mentality and behavior for considerable periods of time.
Closed systems may be able to hone existing routines, but they will lose the capacity to
engage in new routines. Organizations
can become closed through administrative
arrangements (as when the firm’s boundaries are delimited by its organization chart),
through legalistic (rather than relational) contracting with suppliers and customers, and
through social and cultural norms which stress the importance of inside rather than
outside considerations.
3.3. Scope
The scope of product market activities may impact the innovative performance of firms
in at least three ways. One has just been discussed in the context of finance: the multidivisional multiproduct firm is in a position to re-allocate cash from businesses that have
positive cash flow to new businesses with negative cash flow. A second hypothesis, put
forward at various times by Joseph Schumpeter, Richard Nelson and others, is that the
product market portfolios of multiproduct firms will increase the payoff to uncertain
R&D by increasing the probability that new products and processes resulting from corporate
R&D can be commercialized inside the firm. Neither of these will be the main focus here.
Instead, it is suggested that multiproduct
firms can more readily develop and
commercialize

capacities relevant to disparate lines of business. This fusion - as with mechanics and
electronics
(what Kodama,
1986 calls “mechatronics”)
- by no means occurs
automatically,
and requires internal structures which are flexible and permeable.”
Indeed, there appears to be less diversity in firms’ products than in their technologies
(Pavitt et al. 1989). Nevertheless, the multiproduct firm does afford opportunities for
economies of scope based on transferring technologies across product lines and melding
them to create new products (Teece, 1980, 1982). Despite the path dependent-nature
of
technological change, the diversity of application areas for a given technology are often
quite large, and it is often feasible and sometimes efficient to apply the firm’s capabilities
to different market opportunities.
Suppose application areas outside of the core business do in fact open up. The question
arises as to whether potential scope economies
deriving from the application
of
proprietary know-how in new markets add more to the innovating firm’s value if they are
served through licensing and related contractual arrangements to unaffiliated firms who
then serve the new product markets in question, or by direct investment, either de novo or
by merger/acquisition.
This is an important question, the answer to which ought to help
shape a positive theory of the scope of the firm’s activities.
Whether the firm integrates or not is likely to depend critically on four sets of factors:
(1) whether the technology can be transferred to an unaffiliated entity at higher or lower

“This

is discussed

in Section 4.3.

<-----Page 11----->204

Behavior

& Org. 31 (1996)

193-224

cost than it can be transferred to an affiliated entity; (2) the degree of intellectual property
protection afforded to the technology in question by the relevant statutes and laws; (3)
whether a contract can be crafted which will regulate the sale of technology with greater
or less efficiency and effectiveness or whether department-to-department
or division-todivision sales can be regulated by internal administrative procedures; and (4) whether the
set of complementary competences possessed by the potential licensee can be assessed by
the licenser at a cost lower than alternatives. If they are lower, the available returns from
the market will be higher, and the opportunity for a satisfactory royalty or profit-sharing
arrangement accordingly greater.
These matters are explored in more detail elsewhere (Teece, 1980, 1984, 1986,
Chesbrough and Teece, 1996). Suffice to say that contractual mechanisms are often less
satisfactory than the alternative. Proprietary considerations
are more often than not
assisted by integration, and technology transfer is difficult both to unaffiliated and
affiliated partners, with the consequence that integration (or multiproduct diversification)
is the more attractive alternative, except where incumbents are already competitively
established in downstream activities, and are in a position to render de novo entry by the
technology-based
firms unattractive because of the excess capacity it would generate.
Hence, multiproduct firms can be expected to appear as efficient responses to contractual,
proprietary and technology transfer problems in an important set of circumstances. Mixed
modes, such as joint ventures and complex forms of profit-sharing collaboration, will also
be common according to how the set of transactions in question stacks up against the
criteria identified above.
3.4. Vertical integration
The characteristics of technological development identified earlier also have important
implications for the vertical structure of the firm, and vice versa. Economic historians
have long suggested that there may be links between vertical structures and the rate and
direction of innovation. For instance, Frankel (1955) has argued that the slow rate of
diffusion of innovations in the British textile and iron and steel industries around the turn
of the century was due to the absence of vertically integrated firms. Kindleberger (1964)
has gone so far as to suggest that the reason why West Germany and Japan have
overtaken Britain may be due to “the organization of [British] industry into separate
firms dealing with each other at arm’s length.” This “may have impeded technological
change because of the possibility that part of the benefits of that change would have been
external to the separate firms” (pp. 146,147). Kindleberger also studied the reasons for the
failure of the British railroads to abandon the IO-ton coal wagon in favor of the more
efficient 20-ton wagon, and concludes (1964) that the reason for the slow rate of diffusion
was institutional and not technical. In short, it stemmed from the absence of vertical
integration.22 General Motors’ early dominance in the diesel electric locomotive industry
?echnical

aspects of interrelatedness do not seem to have held up the movement to more efficient size, either

through making such a change uneconomic because of the enormity of the investment required or by adding
amounts too great for any one firm to borrow. The sums involved were not large, and railway finance was rarely
a limiting factor in the period up to 1914. Private ownership of the coal cars by the collieries, on the other hand,
posed a type of interrelatedness that was institutional rather than technical.

has also been attributed to the fact that it was integrated into electrical supply while its
competitors were not (Marx, 1976). A systematic exploration of the relationship between
technological innovation and enterprise boundaries is needed.
For present purposes, it is useful to distinguish between two types of innovation:
autonomous (or “stand-alone”)
and systemic. An autonomous innovation is one which
can be introduced without modifying other components or items of equipment. The
component or device in that sense “stands alone.” A systemic innovation, on the other
hand, requires significant readjustment to other parts of the system. The major distinction
relates to the amount of design coordination which development and commercialization
are likely to require. An example of a systemic innovation would be electronic funds
transfer, instant photography (it required redesign of the camera and the film), frontwheel drive, and the jet airliner (it required new stress-resistant airframes).
With systemic innovation,
internal organization
(integration)
can often assist the
workings of the market. Integration
facilitates systemic innovations
by facilitating
information flows, and the coordination of investments plans. It also removes institutional
barriers to innovation where the innovation in question requires allocating costs and
benefits, or placing specialized investments into several parts of an industry.
Comprehensive evidence with respect to these propositions has yet to be assembled.
Vignettes can be found in Chesbrough and Teece (1996). The only statistical test
performed to date relates to the petroleum industry (Armour and Teece, 1978). These
findings indicated that firm and R&D expenditures for basic and applied research in the
U.S. petroleum industry between 1951-1975, were statistically related to the level of
vertical integration which the enterprise possessed.23
3.5. Organizational

culture and values

Market power is an element of industrial structure; scale, scope, integration and
hierarchy can be thought of as elements of the formal structure of an organization. Of
equal if not greater importance
is the informal
structure
of an organization.
Organizational
culture is the essence of an organization’s informal structure. It is “the
pattern of beliefs and expectations shared by the organization’s members. These beliefs
and expectations produce norms that powerfully shape the behavior of individuals and
groups” (Schwartz and Davis, 1981, p. 33).
Organizational
culture can be thought of as the “central norms that may characterize
an organization”
(O’Reilly, 1989, p. 305). A strong culture is a system of informal rules
that spells out how people are to behave most of the time. By knowing what is expected
of them, employees will waste little time deciding how to act in a given situation (Deal
and Kennedy, 1982). There need not be consensus within an organization with respect to
these beliefs, as the guiding beliefs or vision held by top management and by individuals

Z3Despite the fact that the ultimate objective of R&D programs is to produce innovations, not simply to
dissipate resources on R&D activities, expenditure data can be viewed as a useful proxy for innovative
performance in that they reveal the intensity of innovative activity. Furthermore, if the discount rate facing nonintegrated firms is similar to that facing integrated firms and if similar risk preferences exist across the
management of these firms, the higher productivity per dollar of research expenditure posited in vertically
integrated firms implies that, ceteris paribus, such firms will devote more resources to R&D.

<-----Page 13----->206

of Economic Behavior & Org. 31 (1996) 193-224

lower down in the organization may not be congruent. It is the latter, however, which
define an organization’s culture (O’Reilly, 1989, p.305).
There seems to be an emerging consensus (Deal and Kennedy, 1982, Peters and
Waterman, 1982, O’Reilly, 1989) that the following set of norms assists the development and commercialization
of new products
and processes.
With respect to
development, these include: the autonomy to try and fail; the right of employees to
challenge the status quo; open communication
to customers, to external sources of
technology,
and within the firm itself. With respect to commercialization
or
implementation,
teamwork, flexibility, trust and hard work are considered to be critically
important. The right culture is not just an important asset to assist in technological
development; it may be a requirement.
With a few notable exceptions (North, 1990) economists have given almost no
attention, and little sympathy, to the topic of organizational
culture.24 Occasionally,
economists may speak to the importance of trust and consciousness. Thus Arrow (1974,
p.28) notes that “social demands may be expressed through formal rules and authorities,
or they may be expressed through internalized
demands of conscience. Looked at
collectively, these demands may be compromises which are needed to increase the
efficacy of all.“2” If Arrow is right in his claim that values can increase efficiency, it is
unfortunate that the topic has been left to organizational sociologists and psychologists,
and that economic science ignores what appears to be an important set of variables in the
understanding of organizational performance.
One way for economists to begin grappling with organizational culture is to see it as
control on the cheap; reduction in shirking is just one element?
If individuals can be
motivated and directed without pecuniary incentives (and disincentives) and the exercise
of authority, tremendous resource savings can ensue, and innovation processes can avoid
the burdens of bureaucracy. Conversely, if a firm’s culture and strategy do not align, it is
likely to be unable to implement
its strategy, especially strategies which involve
innovation. For instance, a declaration by top management of a firm that the firm is now
going to be more open to external sources of technological ideas will not ensure that the
strategy will be successful if there is a well entrenched “not invented here” culture inside
the organization. The failure to develop new norms supportive of a particular strategy
“means that changes will persist only where they are closely monitored and directly
rewarded” (O’Reilly, 1989, p.310).

24North’s discussion (chapter 5) is almost exclusively limited to societal culture rather than organizational
culture. He does however note that informal constraints flowing from the broader societal culture are pervasive.
Veblen (1972, p. 174) notes that “at least since mankind reached the human plane, the economic unit has been
not a solitary hunter, but a community of some kind.”
“Moreover,
there is a tendency to squeeze such concepts into “externalities,”
where it is not clear they
belong. Thus Arrow (1974, p.23) notes that: “Trust and similar values, loyalty or truth-telling, are examples of
what the economist would call ‘externalities’. They are good, they are commodities; they have real, practical
economic value; they increase the efftciency of the system, enable you to produce more goods or more whatever
values you hold in high esteem. But they are not commodities for which trade on the open market is technically
possible or even meaningful.”
“Alchien and Demsetz (1972).

3.6. External linkages
Economists, as well as many organization theorists, have traditionally thought of firms
as islands of hierarchical control embedded in a market structure and interacting with
each other through the price mechanism. Indeed, Coase (1937) has referred to firms as
“islands of conscious power.” Coase’s metaphor needs to be transformed from islands to
archipelagos to capture important elements of business organization. This is because
firms commonly
need to form strategic alliances,
vertically (both upstream and
downstream), laterally, and sometimes horizontally in order to develop and commercialize new technologies.27 Compared to arms-length
market contracts, such arrangements
have more structure, involve constant interaction among the parts, more open information
channels, greater trust, rely on voice rather than exit, and put less emphasis on price.
Compared to hierarchies, such alliances or networks among firms call for negotiation
rather than authority and put great emphasis on boundary-spanning
roles. Although firms
connected through alliances have a high degree of autonomy, the relationship may well be
anchored by a minority equity position. These arrangements can be used to provide some
of the benefits of integration while avoiding some of the costs. This undoubtedly helps
explain the proliferation of alliances in recent decades.
The variety of such arrangements to link organizations is almost unlimited, and the
resultant forms quite diverse. A constellation of licensing, manufacturing and marketing
agreements will typically characterize many interorganizational
arrangements. R&D joint
ventures, manufacturing joint ventures, co-marketing arrangements and consortia are just
a few of the resultant forms. Some of these arrangements constitute extremely complex
open systems, and some may be unstable.
The managerial
functions
in these
interorganizational
networks are quite different from the authority relationship which
commonly exists in hierarchies. Managers have to perform boundary-spanning
roles, and
learn to manage in circumstances that involve mutual dependency.
3.7. Assessment
The above discussion of the variables which impact firm-level innovation suggests that
economic and organizational research needs a richer framework if the innovation process
is to be better understood.
Economic research needs to pay greater attention to
organizational structure, both formal and informal, and organizational research needs to
understand the importance of market structure, internal structure, and the business
environment. Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic presentation of the various classes of variables that
have been identified, as well as considerations deemed to be important but assumed away
in this analysis. For instance, the firm’s human resources/capital
and the mechanism by
which firms attract, train, and hold first-rate people has not been deeply analyzed. Nor has
the role of government in the support of the scientific and technological infrastructure
been analyzed. Another major omission has been the strategy by which firms identify
*‘lmai (1988, p.2) notes that “corporate networks in a broad sense are the vital economic institution which has
led the Japanese economic development. The long history of cooperation between firms may be a crucial factor
to explain the special adaptability of the Japanese economy.” Imai uses the term, as it is used in this paper, to
indicate interfirm relationships in general, including zaibatsu and business groups.

In Sections 4 and 5 consideration
is given to identifying particular organizational
forms that have distinct implications for certain types of innovation. The treatment is
illustrative and not comprehensive. It suggests that there are a variety of organizational
modes that can support innovation, but that there are important differences amongst
organizations in the types of innovation they can support.

In the previous section, various organizational
characteristics
were identified.
Distinctive governance modes arise when these characteristics are represented to greater
or lesser degrees. The specification of the governance mode requires attention to at least
four classes of variables: firm boundaries, internal formal structure, internal informal
structure, and external linkages. What immediately becomes clear is that for purposes of
considering the innovative potential of various organizational forms, one can no longer
simply specify the type by reference to one or two aspects of structure. For example, it is
no longer meaningful to discuss the innovative potential of conglomerates,

integrated firms, etc. without specifying much more. Rather than specify all possible
permutations and combinations of these variables in this paper, the focus will be on the
following archetypes: (1) stolid, multiproduct,
integrated hierarchies; (2) high flex
“Silicon
Valley”-type
firms; (3) hollow corporations
of various types; and (4)
conglomerates of various types. There will also be a brief discussion of the individual
inventor (not really an organizational
form). Fig. 2 graphs these structures on ordinal
scales measuring various structure variables plus scope and external linkages.
4.1. The individual inventor and the stand-alone

laboratory

Many still cling to the notion that the individual inventor, standing outside of an
organization, is responsible for the lion’s share of innovation in today’s economy. This
myth springs in part from the first industrial revolution when invention was the province
of the individual or pairs. But since the last quarter of the 19th century and the emergence
of R&D labs, and more recently venture capital, innovation has become more the domain
of organizations, not individuals.28
The problems that the inventor-entrepreneurs
have in extracting value from new
technology are considerable. However, when an inventor (or an enterprise) can rely on the
instruments of intellectual property protection to protect invention from imitation, theory
suggests that the inventor can appropriate a substantial fraction of the invention’s market
value. When property rights are weak (the normal case), the inventors’ ability to capture
value are dramatically circumscribed
(Teece, 1986). In the case where the individual
inventor has a patent but little else, then the patent holder’s options include: (i) licensing
the technology to incumbent firms who already have the necessary complementary assets
in place; (ii) using the patent as collateral to raise debt funds to help develop an
organization to exploit the technology; (iii) exchanging the patent for equity in a start-up,
equity-funded firm; (iv) exchanging the patent for equity in an established firm.
None of these options avoid the problem of valuing the patent and the concomitant
leakage problems which this process exposes. Valuation is likely to require disclosure and
the triggering of what Arrow (197 1, p. 152) has referred to as the fundamental paradox of
information: Its value for the purchaser is not known until one has the information, but
then one has in effect acquired it without cost. While this problem is somewhat softened
when there is good patent protection, most non-industrial providers of funds are going to
need technical experts to evaluate the technology, in which case the risk of leakage
remains. A wealthy inventor can of course overcome some of these problems by signaling
value to financiers and joint venture partners through providing collateral, performance
guarantees, or by co-investing.
If imitation is easy, the problems are more difficult. In those instances the granting of
low royalty, non-exclusive output-based licenses (i.e. royalties rather than up-front fees)
are likely to yield higher rents to the inventor. In this way, the inventor does not provide
much incentive for firms to invent around (in the case of a weak patent) or otherwise
invest resources in imitation; these costs can be extracted in part by the licenser.
‘*That is not to say that individual inventors are not sometimes very important and very successful.
argument is that when they are successful commercially, it is generally in an organizational setting.

My

<-----Page 18----->D.J. Teece/J.

211

Even when the valuation problem is overcome the parties must meet another challenge
- transferring the technology to the buyers. As discussed earlier, the tacit nature of
knowledge (which helps make imitation difficult) also makes transfer difficult (Teece,
1980, 1982). Hence the circumstances
where imitation
is difficult are also the
circumstances where transfer is often difficult. The only clear circumstance where the
inventor can succeed alone is when (1) the technology is well protected by intellectual
property law, (2) the technology can be transferred from the inventor to an organization,
and (3) the inventor already has great wealth. The circumstances where these factors
occur together is likely to be relatively rare.
The stand-alone
research laboratory faces many of the same challenges as the
individual
inventor. The main difference is that the laboratory can bring multiple
organizational skills to bear on the R& D process, and the probabilities of fusing multiple
technologies is likely to be enhanced from the bringing together of multiple research
disciplines. Moreover, if scale economies exist in R&D, the laboratory is better able to
capture these than the individual. But the framework would suggest that stand-alone
laboratories
cannot be viable, unless they happen to work in areas where strong
intellectual property protection is assured.”
4.2. Multiproduct,

integrated,

hierarchical

fims

It is not uncommon to find such enterprises on the industrial scene. N.V. Phillips and
General Motors in the 1980s were good examples. Hierarchical is meant to signal the
presence of bureaucratic decisions, and absence of a powerful change culture and highpowered incentives. Such enterprises are also likely to be internally focused. As a
consequence, external changes in the market as well as in the science and technology
establishment are unlikely to get recognized in a timely fashion. Decision making is slow
and ponderous.
However, if such organizations
are able to achieve what Downs (1967, p.160)
calls “breakout” - where a new organization, possibly a new venture division, is set up
for a special task - it may be able to overcome the anti-innovation
bias, at least
temporarily. Burgelman (1984) has argued that “autonomous
strategic behavior” can
take place inside large firms, if management sets up the appropriate internal structures.
The range of enabling structures is quite large and includes venture teams’ “skunkworks,” new venture divisions and the like. The suitability of these various structures
depends on a variety of technological, market and organizational factors which will not
be explored here.
Nevertheless,
integrated
firms overcome some basic problems associated
with
relying on an economy of Lilliputian
firms. Integrated firms can readily support
systemic
innovation
as discussed
earlier. They can also adapt to uncertainty
(Williamson,
1975) in a sequential fashion as events unfold. (Managerial hierarchies
are often better at adjudicating disputes inside the firm than courts are at adjudicating

be reluctant to use a common R&D laboratory.

disputes
between
and among
firms.)
Large
multiproduct,
multidivisional
integrated firms can take on large projects and can help set standards important to the
continued evolution of a technology. In the early years of the PC industry, IBM
drove floppy-disk drive capacity. The 5.25 in. floppy diskettes initially held 180 KES
each when IBM introduced its PC in 1981. By 1983, capacity had doubled to 360 KB,
and a year later had increased to 1.44MB. But they stayed stuck at 1.44 MB for over
a decade. The explanation does not lie in inherent limits to the technology, but in
IBM’s declining
ability to coordinate choices of follow-along
standards. A new
standard requires PC manufacturers to agree to accommodate it in their machines, that
diskette manufacturers
tool up for it, and that software publishers agree to supply
programs in the new format. IBM’s leadership is no longer sufficient to convert the
industry over.3o
There are also appropriabiiity
benefits. If it is a process technology which is at
issue, the vertically integrated firm is capable of using the technology in-house and
taking profits not by selling the technology directly, but by selling products that
embody or use the process. Thus inasmuch as this type of firm does not have to utilize
the market for know-how to capture value from the technology, the appropriability
problem is softened. Inasmuch
as contracting
is internal,
specialized
assets are
protected and recontracting
hazards are attenuated. The technology transfer process
is likely to be intema1, so the tacitness problem is eased considerably,
as the
redeployment of personnel internally raises far fewer default issues than does external
redeployment.
Such firms are likely to need alliance structures in order to tap into external sources of
new knowledge. If large integrated firms are able to successfully team up with other
firms3’ that have the entrepreneurial
structures in place to promote creativity, then such
firms are likely to be able to access a pipeline of new product and process concepts. The
benefits here are a corollary to the benefits associated with strategic alliances.32 However,
the absence of a change culture and an outward orientation mean that such relationships
may not be sought.
4.3. High jlex “Silicon Valley “-type jirms
The distinguishing
features of such firms are that they will possess a change culture
upon which there is great consensus.33 They will have shallow hierarchies and significant

‘“1 wish to thank Henry Chesbrough for helping develop the facts on this point.
3’Such as the one described in V1.3.
‘*It is important to recognize, based on historical experience in the United States in the period up to 1980, that
the acquisition of a multiproduct, integrated, hierarchical company by high-flex “Silicon Valley”-type company
is often extremely difficult to achieve without destroying the creative and entrepreneurial capacity of the small
companies. This is because the organizational controls of the large organization tend to destroy the innovative
capacities of small firms, as discussed earlier.
331ndicative of this spirit is a statement by Andy Grove, CEO of Intel, “You need to try to do the impossible,
to anticipate the unexpected. And when the unexpected happens, you should double your efforts to make order
from the disorder it creates in your life. The motto I am advocating is, Ler chaos reign, then rein in chaos. Does
that mean that you shouldn’t plan? Not at all. You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot
anticipate fires, so it has to shape a flexible organization that is capable of responding to unpredictable events.”

local autonomy. Such firms will resist the hierarchical accouterments of seniority and
rank found in Category 2 above, and they will resist functional specialization
which
restricts the flow of ideas and destroys the sense of commonality of purpose. Examples of
firms that started this way and still reflect much of this style are Intel, Hewlett Packard,
Sun Microsystems, Motorola, Raychem, Genentech, and 3M.
Decision making in these firms is usually simple and informal. Communication
and
coordination among functions is relatively quick and open. Early on in their development,
one or two key individuals, typically the founders, make the key decisions. In the early
stages, these firms, however, typically do not have a steady stream of internally generated
cash with which to fund new opportunities. Hence, connections to the venture capital
community or to other firms with cash available are important. These firms are likely to
be highly innovative. But they are also likely to be cash-constrained.
Those that are not,
are likely to do very well.
The highly specialized nature of such firms and the absence of good intellectual
property protection
create strategic risks. The ability to capture the rents from
innovation
is by no means assured. But if such firms are able to develop and
manage
their external
relationships
without
losing their distinct
culture
and
responsive
structures,
then many of the problems
stemming
from uncertainty,34
indivisibilities,35 inappropriability,36 asset specificity,37 and tacitness3’ can be overcome,
while organizational
failure issues are held at a distance because much is outsourced
and alliances are used frequently. By providing considerable
autonomy and strong

34Primary uncertainty can never be reduced, but organizations can adapt to it. Secondary uncertainty, due to
ignorance of complementary
investment plans, can obviously be much reduced through bilateral agreements
which involve mutual commitments
and the maintenance of reciprocity through the exchange of hostages
(Williamson, 1985).
351t is perhaps in the realm of indivisibilities that bilateral exchange comes closest to the perfect solution of a
market failure problem. As discussed elsewhere (Teece, 1980, 1982). interfirm agreements are a relatively
straightforward
way to access complementary
assets, particularly if they are already in place, are in excess
capacity, and do not involve a high degree of asset specificity. Even when asset specificity is involved, the
incentives for opportunistic
recontracting
can be attenuated by reputation effects, repeat contracting,
or
exchange of hostages.
361nasmuch as firms can use bilateral contracts to access existing industry capacities so that new capacity does
not have to be put in place de novo, product commercialization
time can be reduced and lead time lengthened.
Thus a major strategic advantage, lead time, can often be enhanced through the use of bilateral contracts. While
the innovator may have to share part of the rent stream with the provider of complementary assets, investment
risk for the innovator is typically reduced and imitators can be outpaced.
“Bilateral contracts enable specialized assets to be protected. While the degree of protection may not be as
great as is provided under vertical integration, it is likely to be significantly higher than under unilateral
contracts. A “hostage,”
or its economic equivalent, including specific investments which are mutually
dependent, can be used to help supportexchange. Thus if a manufacturer installs dedicated equipment to serve
the developer, and the developer makes specialized investments which dovetail with the manufacturer, both can
be assured that transactions will have a better chance of continuing in the face of adversity or superior
opportunities.
“Tacitness
is less a problem if a bilateral relationship exists, particularly if it is supported by equity. If
repeated transactions are contemplated, spillovers and costs associated with seconding technical staff are less
severe as adjustments can be made in subsequent transactions, as long as spillovers and costs are perceived
similarly by both parties.

The term virtual corporation has been used in business parlence in the 1980s and
1990s to refer to business enterprises that subcontract anything and everything. A key
question is whether the innovative capacities of such companies are impaired by the
absence of in-house manufacturing
and other capabilities. Virtual corporations are of
course smaller than they might otherwise be (by virtue of the absence of vertical
integration) and thus generally have shallow hierarchies. They might well have innovative
cultures and external linkages to competent manufacturers.
Defined this way, virtuals have the capacity to be very creative and to excel at earlystage innovation activities. If they do indeed establish a strong alliance with a competent
manufacturer, they may also have the capacity to be first to market, despite the absence of
the requisite internal capabilities.
The hazards associated with virtual structures are not unlike the hazards facing the
individual inventor. The problem is that unless the firm is operating in a regime of tight
appropriability, the innovator may not be able to capture value from the innovation, and
the manufacturer, by integrating into research and distribution, is likely to become the
firm’s competitor (Teece, 1986). Accordingly, the virtual corporation is not seen to be a
viable long-run organizational form, except in limited circumstances.
The RCA color television experience demonstrates
the downside of the virtual
approach to innovation.39 When RCA developed the color television, it made no attempt
to keep the innovation to itself.40 Rather, it licensed its color TV technology aggressively,
and outsourced the manufacturing of key components of the television itself. It utilized a
network of retailers to market the sets. Its licensees, however (particularly the Japanese
licensees), made major investments in the integration of the television components, and
then integrated forward and made the entire television set. In the 197Os, RCA had to
abandon the manufacturing and development of color television sets, leaving the Japanese
as world leaders in consumer electronics.
The RCA experience is not an anomaly. There are real risks in contracting everything
out to the market and functioning as the hub or nexus of contracts. Research and development markets, in particular, are fraught with contractual hazards that undercut the ability
of firms to coordinate arms-length purchases of R&D through markets (Teece, 1988).
Consider the problem of using fixed price contracts to develop new products and
processes. With fixed price contracts, one hazard is the inability to adequately specify in
advance the desired output of the contract. Another hazard is that, if the R&D supplier
shares too much knowledge ex ante, the buying firm can appropriate the knowledge without
any payment. A third concern is the specific nature of most R&D activity. The R&D
supplier and buyer confront hold-up hazards from each other, and there are strong lock-in

effects once a relationship is begun. These hazards are softened with cost-plus contracts,
but these contracts create other problems. The supplying R&D firm has no incentive to
control costs, which creates the possibility of a blank check agreement for the buyer.
For these reasons, R&D is usually linked with manufacturing
inside the firrn4’ For a
similar set of reasons, the marketing function is also joined with these two functions. The
desired output of an R&D process depends critically on the perceived user requirements
for the product. This is highly impacted information, which cannot be contracted for in
advance. And usually there is iteration between the emerging design and user reactions to
the design, requiring an ongoing flow of information between the marketing and R&D
functions. As a result, firms find it necessary to combine these complementary functions,
not through the high-powered incentives of the market, but through the low-powered
incentives of the firm.
Another dimension of this is that while markets are very efficient at coordinating
adjustments where the technological coordination is low in terms of the interdependence
of one technology on another, as the technologies become more interdependent,
the
hazards of coordinating
through the market rise quickly. Internal organization often
incurs greater costs than markets when technological
interdependence
is low. While
coordination costs do rise as interdependence
grows, those costs rise much more slowly
than the market’s costs. Accordingly, as interdependence rises, more integrated structures
displace virtuals. Clearly, virtual is not always virtuous (Chesbrough and Teece, 1996).
4.5. Conglomerates
In the framework developed here, the conglomerate is not an especially distinctive
organizational
form. It is likely to be decentralized,
and this favors the innovation
process. It can also use the internal capital market to fund the development of new
technologies. However, the importance of this is likely to be reduced the more (i) access
to capital, including venture capital, is available for new stand-alone businesses, and (ii)
headquarters management acts much like external capital market agents. Accordingly, on
grounds of access to capital and diversity of activities, one would not expect the
conglomerate to look too different from a portfolio of stand-alone firms with respect to its
innovative capacity.42
However, there are two ways in which one might expect the conglomerate
to
underperform a portfolio of stand-alone firms with respect to innovation. One is that it is
difficult for conglomerates
to develop distinctive company-wide
corporate cultures.
4’Mowery (1982) also finds that the contract research laboratories in the first half of the 20th century confined
their work to simple testing and materials analysis, while internal R&D laboratories conducted the more
sophisticated and firm-specific research.
4?here
has been very little discussion of the relationship between the conglomerate
and technological
innovation. The arguments advanced by Williamson (1975) that conglomerate firms possess miniature capital
markets would suggest that the conglomerate is an ideal form for identifying new investment opportunities,
including process and product innovations, and funding them until they become cash-flow positive. In the
absence of market-for-venture
capital, this argument would seem to imply that the conglomerate form ought to
be associated with a stream of new product and process launches. The best evidence (Kline, 1995) indicates that
relative to appropriately defined yardsticks, conglomerates did not underinvest in R&D, and indeed before 1970
they may well have overinvested.

Accordingly, it may be quite difficult to build a strong internal change culture at the
corporate level. Certainly, as compared to a stand-alone firm, getting across to employees
the notion that the unit must ultimately “stand on its own bottom” will be quite a
challenge. As a consequence, free riding may well be accentuated. Likewise, the design
of high-powered incentives for top management and employees will be hindered by the
absence of an equity instrument
geared to divisional
performance.
In short, the
conglomerate
does not appear to offer distinctive
advantages
in environments
characterized by rapid technological change.
4.6. Alliance enterprise
We define an alliance enterprise as a virtual corporation that has developed strong
commitments
to other enterprises, usually through equity-based
links to affiliated
enterprises lying upstream, downstream, horizontal, and lateral from its core business.
Such structures include consortia (e.g. Airbus, Sematech) as well as semipermanent
teaming arrangements that transcend particular projects. Many new biotech firms in the
United States are heavily alliance-dependent
to fund their R&D and move drugs to the
market.
The viability and desirability of alliances and other external linkage arrangements
depend, not just on the efficacy of this form of contract, but also on the resources/
capabilities which can be accessed in this fashion. Alliances were essential in the 1980s
and 1990s to the pharmaceutical
industry as a mechanism
to tap into the drug
development capabilities of new biotech firms. Since the biotechnology revolution has
occurred outside the organizational
gambit of the established pharmaceutical
industry,
alliances have been embued with virtues they might not otherwise possess. Put
differently, the value of a contract can easily be confused with what it enables one to
access. The comparative institutional approach used here imputes to the alliance only that
which it can uniquely access as compared to other arrangements.

5. Matching innovation

and organizational

archetypes43

The diversity of organizational forms observed is semipermanent and not a transitional
feature of modem industrial economies. The diversity of observed forms in and of itself
suggests that different organizational
arrangements
are suited to different types of
competitive environments and differing types of innovation.
One cannot possibly expect to be comprehensive
in developing a taxonomy of
innovations and organizational
archetypes. However, illustrations are developed below
which involve matching organizational form to the locus of existing capabilities, and to
the type of innovation (autonomous or systemic).
As the interdependence
between technologies increases, pure market forms are less
effective at achieving the requisite coordination. The more systemic the innovation, the
greater the interdependence.
Exposure to recontracting hazards is likely to be frequent.

43This section draws in part on Chesbrough

and Teece (1996).

The discussion in Section 4.4 noted the distinction between autonomous and systemic
innovation.
Autonomous
innovations
(Teece, 1984) create improved products and
processes that fit comfortably into existing systems. These innovations not only fit well
within current industry standards, but they reinforce those standards. An example would
be the introduction of a faster microprocessor using the same architecture, such as the
Intel 80x 86/Pentium
family. Systemic innovations,
however, change technological
requirements and offer new opportunities so that the resulting configuration of both the
innovation and its related technologies (which comprise a system of technology) are
different; for example, audio CD plays require the abandonment of vinyl records and the
manufacture
of CD discs. Innovations
of this type require that the design of the
subsystems be coordinated in order for the gains from the innovation to be realized. Since
these innovations span current technology boundaries, a complex coordination problem
arises.
The other key dimension in organization form is the extent to which the capabilities
needed to exploit the innovation exist within the firm already, and if not, whether those
capabilities are available outside the firm. It has been argued elsewhere (Teece et al.
1994) that the firm is best regarded as a bundle of distinctive capabilities that enables it to
perform functions more efficiently than its historical competitors. The presence or
absence of critical complementary assets affects the prospects for appropriating the gains
from innovation when the appropriability
regime is not tight (Teece, 1986). These two
dimensions motivate the simple framework presented in Fig. 3.

5.1. Autonomous

innovation

Alliances and virtual structures will work well when the technology can be sourced
externally, and the high-flex Silicon Valley-type will work well if it must be developed
internally. When the technology can be sourced externally, the required coordination
takes place with known technologies, so that no special hazards in contracting arise and
adjustments to related technologies to realize the benefits of innovation are minimal.
Indeed, when firms use bureaucratic centralized structures inappropriately
to manage
autonomous innovations, small firms and more decentralized large firms are likely to
outperform them.
As noted, there are important nuances with respect to the particulars of how to organize
for autonomous innovation. (1) The first circumstance is when the technology exploits
capabilities already present within the firm. In these circumstances, internal development
by high-flex Silicon Valley-type firms will work well. (An example here would be the
introduction of a faster microprocessor using the same architecture, such as the Intel
8Ox86/Pentium
family.) (2) The second is when innovation remains autonomous, but
exploitation requires the firm to access capabilities outside its boundaries. Innovating
firms must craft relational structures such as alliances to obtain access, thereby sharing
the gains from innovation. Such firms must also overcome hold-up problems between the
innovator and the owner of relevant outside capabilities. This is where virtual structures
are often virtuous. Sun Microsystems pursued this strategy quite successfully with its
SPARC microprocessor architecture. Sun defined the basic architecture, and then licensed
out the design to other firms. This strategy induced enough entry by SPARC licensees to

develop a standard, and attracted outside software developers to support the architecture.
Sun later split its organization so that its hardware was separated from its software and its
44
microprocessor design.
(3) A third circumstance is when innovation remains autonomous, but requires new
capabilities to be created to exploit its potential. Virtual structures are not quite enough.
Consider biotechnology. New products can continue to pass through the same regulatory
procedures and sell to physicians through the same marketing and distribution channels as
yesterday’s ethical drugs. But the underlying technology draws from a different science
base. Here, internal development
or alliances with equity are required to manage
contractual problems between the young biotechnology
companies developing new
products and the older pharmaceutical companies seeking to add new products to their

44Note that Sun’s strategy of defining a standard microprocessor architecture, and then licensing it, created a
well-defined technical interface and resulted in transforming what would have been a systemic innovation to an
autonomous innovation. Sun’s approach facilitated decentralized innovation around its standard. The downside
to this approach was experienced by IBM in the PC market.

lineup. These additional structures provide a credible ex ante basis for dividing the gains
from innovation between the two types of firn~s.~~
5.2. Systemic

innovations

By their nature, systemic innovations require coordinated adjustment throughout the
system to realize the gains from innovation. The potential from systemic innovations
cannot be fully realized until adjustments are made throughout the system. Unaffiliated
enterprises with weak internal integration will not suffice. The problem is that tight
coordination
is needed. Without
the close integration
of personnel,
necessary
coordination
may be forsaken. Property rights issues may also arise if multiple
enterprises are involved. Information sharing can be reduced or biased, as each seeks to
get the most at the expense of the other. The party that commits first can be held-up by
the other parties, while the party that waits until the others have committed themselves
can extract more rents from the other partners. Even if such opportunism is contained, the
rate of advance of complementary
technologies may not be properly matched, so that
product release dates slip and co-investment schedules of the parties are mismatched.
Lockheed’s failure in the wide-bodied civilian airliner market can be attributed in part
to the debacle it had with Rolls Royce. Rolls Royce committed to develop the RB-211
engine to power the L-1011, but technical problems that took time to be revealed to
Lockheed caused major delays in commercialization,
and took both Lockheed and Rolls
Royce into bankruptcy. Similarly, GM’s success with the diesel electric locomotive, and
the failure of the GE/Alto co-development efforts can properly be tied to the inability of
GE and Alcoa to properly coordinate and integrate their development efforts (Marx,
1976).
What is needed to successfully develop and commercialize
systemic innovations are
institutions with low-powered incentives, where information can be freely shared without
worry of expropriation, where entities can commit themselves and not be exploited by
that commitment, and where disputes can be monitored and resolved in a timely way.
This is precisely what multi-product integrated firms achieve.
While systemic
innovation
favors integrated
structures
from a coordination
perspective, it may nevertheless be the case that the relevant technological capabilities
are resident in unaffiliated enterprises.46 Alliances are then the best arrangement. Virtuals
and even small Silicon Valley-type firms will not survive. NeXT and MIPS, for example,
were dependent of the autonomous decisions of other firms in order to be able to realize
the benefit of their technology. When these other firms delayed their supporting
investments, each company was forced to narrow its focus and retrench.47 This is where
larger firms may have an advantage, by being able to secure minority investment
positions in smaller firms with necessary capabilities, or by using their scale to create

45Pisano (1988) detailed the practice of using joint equity agreements to facilitate these relations in the
biotechnology industry.

47NeXT has completely withdrawn from the hardware side of its workstation business, focusing entirely on its
NeXTStep operating system. MIPS was acquired by Silicon Graphics, and is no longer a significant player as a
workstation microprocessor
architecture developer.

<-----Page 27----->220

sufftcient momentum so that complementary
innovations
are developed.48 Japanese
keiretsu commonly leverage strong relationships to access needed capabilities outside the
firm, and they fit this model. For example, Toyota’s successful introduction of the kunban
production system (a truly systemic innovation) required tremendous coordination with
its network of suppliers. Since Toyota was much larger than its suppliers, and because
until recently it was the largest customer of virtually all of its suppliers, it had sufficient
leverage to compel its suppliers to make radical changes to their business practices
without exposing itself to hold-up.4Y
Another circumstance considered is where the systemic innovation requires entirely
new capabilities in order for the innovation’s potential to be realized. This is precisely the
situation Chandler (1990) describes in Scale und Scope for the leading industries of the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. The leading industries of that era - chemicals, steel,
and railroads - were all transformed by systemic innovation (Teece, 1993). The winners
were the companies that made major investments to shape the markets, and simply did
not rely upon them. Today one sees leading companies like Intel and Microsoft making
extensive investments to enhance their current capabilities and spur the creation of new
among unaffiliated enterprises are exactly the wrong
ones.” Network arrangements
organizational strategy when firms are trying to commercialize and appropriate the gains
of systemic innovation. An excellent illustration of this is an example often held to
support the benefits of decentralization
- the IBM PC. While the PC’s early years
highlighted the benefits of the virtual approach, the passage of more time has revealed the
downside of that approach. This example is examined elsewhere (Chesbrough and Teece,
1996).
The process of matching organizational form to underlying technological and market
conditions is of course a dynamic one. This aspect is somewhat expressed in Fig. 4. An
illustration of some of the dynamics is provided by Motorola which continues to innovate
in hand-held communication
devices, including cellular phones. Future improvements on
cellphone designs, and in particular, weight reduction and extended operation, requires
lighter and more long-lived batteries. Motorola is in a position to advance these
technologies through its own internal R&D programs, which have historically been very
productive. As the older more established battery technologies like Nickel Cadmium have
48The contrast between MIPS and DEC’s Alpha chip is one example. By committing to supply Alpha on its
own workstations, DEC is gathering greater commitment from third-party developers than did MIPS. Apple and
IBM’s PowerPC chip are garnering even more support, as Apple and IBM together claim to have shipped over
one million systems with the PowerPC chip. Scale and integration are the key differences here.
@According to Gerlach (1992) Japanese manufacturers also place managers on the boards of its supplier
firms and usually share their main bank with them. This allows a manufacturer such as Toyota to wield control
over the supplier’s strategic decisions and control the supplier’s access to capital without requiring Toyota to
have complete ownership of its suppliers. It is this which creates functional control. These structures provide a
blend of market incentives (high-powered incentives, external measures of prices, profits and value added) with
internal coordination capability.
soIntel, for example, has just committed itself to building the largest fab in the world in New Mexico to
improve its manufacturing
prowess. Microsoft is competing in virtually every segment of the PC software
business with internally-developed
products, rather than licensing or buying outside products. It recently
announced plans to spend over $900 million in its current fiscal year, a 50% increase over last year’s spending
(San Francisco Chronicle, September 10, 1994, p.D2).

been widely diffused, Motorola can reasonably rely on outsourcing from numerous
existing suppliers to access its requirements in the Ni-Cd domain. However, solid state
and fuel cells are still in their infancy as technologies to support personal communication
devices. Moreover, Motorola is as well placed as others to advance the development of
such technologies. With reliance on unaffiliated parties leading to obvious contractual
hazards (Teece, 1988), internal
development,
or at the minimum
joint venture
development, is suggested for such technologies. In Fig. 4, this suggests that desirable
governance arrangements will migrate toward internal development as the technology
becomes more state-of-the-art and the population of outsider vendors diminishes.”
It is
likely to do so as one confronts more advanced technological options.

6. Conclusions
If this analysis is correct, it has rather strong implications for theory building,
management,
and for public policy. With respect to theory building, it suggests
inadequacy of standard economic approaches that have market structure as the key if
the only determinant of the rate and direction of innovation. Clearly, such approaches

poor guides to policy. At the minimum, firm boundaries (the level of integration), the
structure of financial markets, and formal and informal organizational structure must be
recognized as major determinants. This paper indicates that firm organization (not just
product market structure) is an important determinant of innovation, a point made by
Williamson (1975) that has largely gone unheeded by industrial organization economists.
The framework developed here is designed to shift the market structure-innovation
debate in industrial organization beyond the domain where Schumpeter (1942), Galbraith
(1952), Mansfield (1968) Scherer (1980) and others have put it, and into a new domain
where internal structure, interfirm agreements, and capital market structures attain new
significance. This also has obvious policy significance. The opening up of financial
markets and the emergence of a vibrant venture capital industry have “provided new
forms of finance for innovative activity again on a scale never seen before, effectively
reducing barriers to innovative, competitive entry, across the industrialized
world”
(Rybczynski, 1993). Put differently, product market structure is not the main and possibly
not the key factor in determining the rate and direction of innovation.
The framework also has strong implications
for business history. It suggests the
possible viability of new hybrid organizational arrangements - such as complex forms of
interfirm agreements linking firms with complementary capabilities and capacities - over
both the integrated alternatives and the small firm alternatives. These organizational
forms may well represent a new and dramatic organizational
innovation in business
history. Firms are continuing to learn how and when to use them, and scholars are trying
to understand them. In retrospect, the emergence and growth of these new forms, dating
from about 1970, may turn out to be as significant an organizational
innovation as the
moving assembly line and the multidivisional
firm.
