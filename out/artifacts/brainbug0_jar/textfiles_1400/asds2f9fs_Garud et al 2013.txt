Abstract
Innovation is often thought of as an outcome. In this chapter, we review the
literatures on innovation processes pertaining to the invention, development,
and implementation of ideas. In particular, we explore how these processes
unfold within ﬁrms, across multi-party networks, and within communities.
Moreover, we identify four different kinds of complexities associated with
innovation processes that we label as evolutionary, relational, temporal, and
cultural complexities. While one approach is to manage or control such
complexities, we draw attention to literatures that suggest that it is far more
productive to harness these complexities for sustaining ongoing innovation.
We conclude the chapter by highlighting some areas for future research.

The Academy of Management Annals

Innovation (deﬁned as the invention, development, and implementation of
new ideas) has always been important for the continued vitality of ﬁrms,
regions, and economies. From the germ of an idea to its impact on society,
innovation is a source of transformative change (Mokyr, 1990). For instance,
innovation serves as an engine of organic growth for ﬁrms (Hess & Kazanjian,
2006; Van de Ven, Polley, Garud, & Venkataraman, 1999), as a catalyst for
regional development (Saxenian, 1996), and as the basis for the comparative
advantage of nations (Nelson, 1993; Porter, 1990).
It is no wonder that innovation has attracted the attention of an increasing
number of scholars from different disciplines.1 The breadth of insights that has
accumulated over time is impressive, and scholarly contributions will no doubt
continue to grow. The research that has accumulated offers insights on topics
ranging from the types of innovation (Henderson & Clark, 1990; Roberts, 1988;
Utterback & Abernathy, 1975), the economics of R&D (Freeman, 1974;
Schumpeter, 1934), national systems of innovation (Lundvall, 1992; Nelson,
1993), antecedents and consequences of innovation in ﬁrms (Tornatzky
et al., 1983), and the processes whereby innovations unfold (Burgelman,
1983; Van de Ven et al., 1999). While all these streams are important, our
objective in this chapter is to cover research pertaining to innovation processes,
by which we mean the sequence of events that unfold as ideas emerge, are
developed, and are implemented within ﬁrms, across multi-party networks,
and within communities.
Another objective is to explore the complexities associated with innovation
processes. These complexities arise because innovation processes are: (a) coevolutionary, as they simultaneously implicate multiple levels of analyses
(Murmann, 2003; Van de Ven, 1986); (b) relational, as they involve a diverse
set of social actors and material elements (Bijker, Hughes, & Pinch, 1987;
Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987); (c) inter-temporal, as temporal events and
sequences are experienced in multiple ways (Garud & Gehman, 2012); and
(d) cultural, as they unfold within contextualized settings (Ruttan & Hayami,
1994; Van de Ven, 2004).
While it is useful to summarize what we already know so as to economize on
rediscovery, it is equally important to spark new conversations. Therefore, the
third objective for this chapter is to propose some directions for future
research. To do so, we revisit the literatures on innovation processes to highlight underexplored areas and emergent topics.
A Review of the Literature on Innovation Processes
In the 1980s, research on the process of innovation focused on identifying the
antecedents and consequences of innovation and establishing causal links
between its various stages of development (Tornatzky et al., 1983). In contrast,
we, as members of the Minnesota Innovation Research Program (MIRP),

adopted a process perspective (see Van de Ven, Angle, & Poole, 1989; Van de
Ven et al., 1999). Building on other literature at that time (Kline & Rosenberg,
1986; Roberts, 1988; Rogers, 1983), we conceptualized innovations as more
than the emergence of novel ideas—what are commonly referred to as inventions. Rather, the ideas must be developed, arrangements such as manufacturing and supply chains must be put in place, and activities such as marketing
and servicing must be established in order for the innovation to generate
value in use. Even when such efforts are completed, the innovation may not
be readily adopted, leading to an additional facet of the process—its
implementation.
With this overview of the innovation process covering invention (the emergence of an idea), development (the elaboration of the idea), and implementation (the widespread acceptance of the innovation), MIRP researchers
studied a wide array of settings including administrative innovations, technological innovations, innovations within and across established ﬁrms, and innovations within entrepreneurial startups. The goal was not to uncover causal
links between independent and dependent variables (Mohr, 1982). Instead,
we wanted to understand the process of innovation by observing the sequence
of events that unfold over time and inferring generative causality—i.e. the
driving motors or generative forces of change (Pettigrew, 1990; Tsoukas,
1989; Van de Ven & Poole, 1995). Rather than generalize ﬁndings from a
sample to a population, our aim was to offer observations that could serve as
the basis for transferring process patterns from one setting to another. Transferability is accomplished by understanding how the generative forces underlying observations from one setting can act contingently in another to
produce contextualized outcomes that, in turn, serve as the basis for ongoing
action (Tsoukas, 1989).
This approach yielded several insights as discussed in Van de Ven et al.
(1999). We found that a long period of gestation precedes the emergence of
novel ideas that, when they emerge, often shock the system and set planning
in motion. The process of development is not straightforward, but instead is
characterized by a proliferation of paths as well as many setbacks. This
period is also characterized by ongoing and shifting assessments of progress,
and by the ﬂuid participation of different stakeholders who engage in the development of an industry infrastructure. At all of the MIRP sites that we studied,
implementation did not occur as a simple diffusion process, but instead
occurred by integrating the innovation with what already existed.
We also found that most innovation processes do not unfold in orderly
steps. Yet, these processes are not random either. Rather, innovation processes
are characterized by repeated cycles of divergent and convergent phases. Divergence is driven by the expenditure of resources (people, time, ideas, and
money) above and beyond the system’s normal sustenance. Convergence is
driven by exogenous constraints (such as institutional rules and organizational

mandates) and endogenous constraints (such as resource limitations and the
discovery of possibilities that focus attention).
Even as we were conducting our research, results from innovation studies
were emerging that informed our efforts. For instance, broadly corresponding
to the three sub-processes that informed our studies was the punctuated equilibrium model of change (Tushman & Romanelli, 1985). Punctuation is
marked by the emergence of novelty that can oftentimes be disruptive (Abernathy, Clark, & Kantrow, 1983; Christensen, 1997). Such an event then sets in
motion an “era of ferment”, a period during which different products and services with different functionalities and dimensionalities vie for market dominance (Tushman & Anderson, 1986; Utterback & Abernathy, 1975).
Selection pressures operating on various “technological trajectories” (Dosi,
1982) result in the emergence of a “dominant design”, a watershed moment
that determines winners and losers. Subsequently, the novel idea is further
reﬁned during an “era of incremental change”, when innovation processes
shift to establishing “process innovations” (Tushman & Anderson, 1986; Utterback & Abernathy, 1975).
Overall, these studies are consistent with an evolutionary perspective on
innovation, a tradition that has attracted the contributions of many scholars
(Burgelman, 1983; Dosi, 1982; Levinthal, 1998; Nelson & Winter, 1982;
Teece, 1988). At its core, an evolutionary perspective builds on variation
(the emergence of novelty), selection (the weeding out of those that are
unﬁt) and retention (the elaboration of those that remain), and is sensitive
to path dependence dynamics (Arthur, 1989; David, 1985). For many scholars
in this stream, inertia and resistance is a base line, and of concern is how
change can be brought about (Stinchcombe, 1965).
Besides the evolutionary perspective, MIRP scholars were also informed by
literatures from Science and Technology Studies (Freeman, 1974) and the
Social Construction of Technological Systems (Bijker et al., 1987). This
stream (and related actor– network literature, e.g. Callon, 1986; Latour,
1987) considers the active roles that actors play in shaping not just the technologies at hand, but also the social contexts that determine the dimensions of
worth against which what is good ought to be measured. Rather than path
dependence, scholars view agency as part of an emergent ecology of interactions between social and material elements, all prescribed within a process
of path creation (Garud & Karnoe, 2001). These scholars consider fragility
and change as the baseline, and of interest to them is how closure and stability
can be brought about (Bijker et al., 1987).
Despite these differences, both literatures draw attention to the difﬁculties
associated with the development and implementation of novel ideas. For
instance, novel ideas are viewed as hopeful monstrosities (Basalla, 1988), carrying a sting of illegitimacy (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Dougherty & Heller, 1994;
Lounsbury & Glynn, 2001) that must pass through a progressively stringent set

of evaluation criteria over time (see stage gate model, Cooper, 1990). As a
result, only a few of these novel ideas succeed. In hindsight, many are
“errors of commission” (Garud, Nayyar, & Shapira, 1997).
We review these and related studies by examining the literatures associated
with invention, development, and implementation, as well as the core generative
mechanisms driving these processes (Pettigrew, 1990; Tsoukas, 1989). The literatures can also be organized by the different levels at which these innovation processes unfold—ﬁrms, multi-party networks, and communities (Table 1). Firms
are legal entities where inventions that emerge from the free ﬂow of ideas can
be nurtured through careful mentorship, patient capital, and access to ﬁrmwide resources and capabilities (Burgelman, 1983; Garud & Van de Ven,
1992). Multi-party networks are constellations of ﬁrms that interact with one
another to invent, develop, and implement innovations. In addition, there are
communities comprising public and private actors who have diverse interests
and roles in creating an infrastructure for the innovation (Van de Ven &
Garud, 1989). As with ﬁrms, the intellectual property that is produced belongs
to the community. But unlike ﬁrms, the governance of communities is better
described as a heterarchy (i.e. agency rights are distributed across members)
rather than as a hierarchy (Stark, 1999). As in a multi-party network, the
members of a community are all distinct entities. Yet, unlike multi-party networks that can be characterized as “transaction sets” (Venkataraman & Van
de Ven, 1998), communities have properties that cannot be reduced to their
parts or transactions thereof (Adler, Kwon, & Heckscher, 2008).
Invention

Mechanisms underlying invention. Early debates on the forces shaping
the rate and direction of innovation centered around demand-pull and technology-push mechanisms (Freeman, 1974; Mowery & Rosenberg, 1979).
Demand-pull is consistent with the commonly used adage necessity is the
mother of invention—i.e. people invent to solve an existing problem. In contrast, the reverse of this statement, i.e. invention is the mother of necessity,
could well capture the notion of technology push. Mowery and Rosenberg’s
(1979) extensive review of the literature concluded that both demand and
supply side factors are crucial to understanding the innovation process.
This early literature has evolved over time to draw attention to the recombination of ideas and artifacts across different domains of knowledge and practice (Hargadon, 2003; Van de Ven et al., 1999). Recombination can be led by
individuals who have the capacity to associate ideas across two or more
domains of knowledge (Koestler, 1964; Usher, 1954). These actors can be
brokers (Hargadon & Sutton, 1997) who span “structural holes” (Burt, 2004)
within innovation networks (Ahuja, 2000; Podolny, 2001) to connect knowledge across communities. The emergence of novelty can even be routinized

(Feldman & Pentland, 2003) through the use of heuristics and simple rules
(Davis, Eisenhardt, & Bingham, 2009).

Invention within ﬁrms. Firms are vibrant forums for the ﬂow of ideas
across formal and informal networks (Hargadon, 2003; Nerkar & Paruchuri,
2005). Firms are repositories of ideas and knowledge that belong to the
company (Garud & Nayyar, 1994; Grant, 1996; Kogut & Zander, 1992). This
repository of knowledge “sets the stage” for “acts of insights” to occur
through a recombination of ideas across knowledge domains and, in the
process, the knowledge of the ﬁrm itself is transformed through cumulative
synthesis (Usher, 1954).
While the ﬂow of ideas ought to take place readily within the safe conﬁnes
of a ﬁrm, in practice, there are challenges. To understand why, consider a quintessential ﬁrm. Complexity is reduced within ﬁrms by dividing labor into units
that are governed by a hierarchy wherein decision rights rest with top management teams (TMTs). These arrangements dampen the emergence of novelty.
Locked into “thought worlds” (Dougherty, 1992), members of one community
of practice (Brown & Duguid, 1991; Lave & Wenger, 1991) are unable to recognize (let alone share) ideas and knowledge generated by other communities
(Carlile, 2004). New ideas, to the extent that they emerge, can easily be
stamped out by TMTs who are unable to fully appreciate the value of a new
opportunity, thereby dampening the variations required for novelty to
emerge (March, 1991).
What are the solutions to this problem? Process research suggests that individuals are likely to be creative in their work, especially in ﬁrms that both
enable and motivate innovation (Amabile, 1996; Angle, 1989). The availability
of slack resources is one enabling factor that allows for exploration during work
(Damanpour, 1991; Nohria & Gulati, 1996). One way to do so is to foster a
culture of “play” (March, 1982; Schrage, 2000). 3M, for instance, has temporal
structuring mechanisms such as the 15% rule, which provides employees the
freedom to explore for 15% of their working time (Garud, Gehman, & Kumaraswamy, 2011).
Ideas that emerge from creative bottom up processes (Burgelman, 1983;
Kanter, 1988) can be combined with other ideas through practices such as
the rotation of people (Galunic & Rodan, 1998), or the sponsorship of internal
technology fairs (Nayak & Ketteringham, 1986). Such practices create what
Cohen, March, and Olsen (1972) call a “garbage can”. By this, they mean processes wherein solutions and problems continually become entangled with one
another to create novel ideas.
As ﬁrms tend to favor exploitation over exploration (Benner & Tushman,
2002), novel ideas must be protected in niches such as “skunk works” (Rich
& Janos, 1994) so that they can escape “innovation killers” (such as the use
of Net Present Value calculations, see Christensen, Kaufman, & Shih, 2008).

Separating such exploratory efforts from exploitation, with TMTs overseeing
the activities of the two, represents what Tushman and O’Reilly (2006) call
an ambidextrous organization. Recent research ﬁnds that TMT’s attention
toward emerging technologies (as compared to existing technologies) is associated with faster ﬁrm entry into emerging ﬁelds (Eggers & Kaplan, 2009).

Invention across multi-party networks. There is now a stream of research
that conﬁrms the importance of the ﬂow of knowledge across networks (Ahuja,
2000; Hansen, 1999; Podolny, 2001). Some of the connections between ﬁrms
represent “weak ties” (Granovetter, 1973) that facilitate the ﬂow of ideas
across distant domains. Relatedly, research that builds on Burt’s (2004)
notion of structural holes establishes the importance that brokers play in the
recombination of ideas (Hargadon, 2003).
However, lack of absorptive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) is an impediment to the ready ﬂow of ideas across ﬁrms constituting a multi-party
network. Absorptive capacity refers to a ﬁrm’s ability to absorb domainspeciﬁc knowledge based on its prior knowledge. To the extent that ﬁrms
within a network lack absorptive capacity, recombination of knowledge is
hampered.
Besides the challenges that arise to the ﬂow of ideas due to lack of absorptive
capacity, additional challenges arise because of intellectual property protection
(Teece, 1987). Within ﬁrms, the intellectual property that is generated belongs
to the company, and so this additional barrier does not exist. However, the protection of ideas by ﬁrms in a network may impede the ﬂow of ideas across the
network.
To address this issue, ﬁrms enter into contractual relationships to share,
transfer and license intellectual property (Dyer & Nobeoka, 2000; Gulati &
Singh, 1998). In addition, partners in a multi-party network establish trust
that emerges through ongoing interactions (Ring & Van de Ven, 1994). Yet,
contractual hazards exist, as there is always the possibility that a ﬁrm in a
relationship assimilates its partner’s knowledge, thereby changing the competitive balance between the two (Hamel, Doz, & Prahalad, 1989; Teece, 1986).
Even if ﬁrms in a network try to protect the intellectual property that forms
the basis for their core competence, knowledge eventually leaks out (Dyer &
Singh, 1998).
All of this speaks to what has been termed as competitive “learning races”
between ﬁrms (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Gulati, Nohria, & Zaheer, 2000). Several
issues become salient. Rather than just absorptive capacity, what becomes
important is relative absorptive capacity (Lane & Lubatkin, 1998). Firms that
can learn faster can eventually gain a competitive advantage. Moreover, the
location and strategic orientation of ﬁrms within a multi-party network
becomes important (Obstfeld, 2005; Phelps, 2010; Powell, Koput, & SmithDoerr, 1996). Firms that are brokers spanning structural holes may be better

positioned to identify and exploit opportunities. In addition, given the possibilities of spillovers, acts of reverse engineering and even espionage, as well as the
need to connect with others to generate more robust ideas, ﬁrms must continue
to invent if they want to retain their competitive position in the industry (what
has been called the “Red Queen effect”, Barnett & Hansen, 1996).
More recently, the advent of information technology has given rise to new
approaches for tapping into global solutions to local problems (Yoo, Henfridsson, & Lyytinen, 2010). For instance, InnoCentive acts as a digital broker, connecting ﬁrms with problems to a large network of external problem-solvers
(Lakhani & Panetta, 2007). The problems, posted on InnoCentive’s digital platform, are partitioned and generalized in such a way that no company speciﬁc
information is revealed and intellectual property protection is not compromised. The ﬁrm that posts the problem eventually acquires the intellectual
property generated by the person who solves the problem in exchange for an
announced reward. Variations of such solutions include events and tournaments sponsored by problem-holders to generate competition among potential
problem-solvers to generate robust solutions to difﬁcult problems (Boudreau &
Lakhani, 2009).

Invention within communities. The pooling of resources across multiple
parties within a community is an approach being used to address complex problems that require the joint inputs of several ﬁrms (Senge, Lichtenstein,
Kaeufer, Bradbury, & Carroll, 2007). Such communities are often the venues
for ideas for which a market has not yet emerged, or for niche markets that
are not yet commercially viable (Baldwin, Hienerth, & von Hippel, 2006).
The number of communities continues to grow as the world confronts an
increasing number of complex problems (e.g. worldwide diseases, sustainability issues, and space exploration programs).
These communities confront what is known as the problem of collective
action (Olson, 1965), where interdependent members are not incented to contribute to the collective, leading to a “tragedy of the commons” (Hardin,
1968).2 The literature offers two solutions to this problem. One is to offer privileges of being a community member and to institute incentives to contribute
to the collective by sharing their ideas (Olson, 1965). An example of this
approach is Blade.org, a “gated” community of ﬁrms sponsored by IBM Corporation with the goal of creating inventions for the blade server segment
(Fjeldstad, Snow, Miles, & Lettl, 2012). Members of Blade.org have privileged
access to intellectual assets and other community resources that outsiders do
not, and this serves as an incentive for members of the community to
contribute.
Another solution to the tragedy of the knowledge commons is for members
of a community to commit to norms for the sharing of ideas (Adler et al., 2008;
Baldwin et al., 2006). An example of such a community is the open source

<-----Page 11----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

movement (von Hippel & von Krogh, 2003), wherein community members are
able to tap into occupational communities where professional and craft knowledge resides (Van Maanen & Barley, 1984). Such movements are governed by
informal norms for idea sharing. In addition, formal institutional arrangements such as the General Public License ensure that resources based on contributions released under this license are available to others (O’Mahony, 2003).
Such an approach has led to what has been labeled as an “inverse commons”,
one in which participation by members of a community does not result in the
degradation of community assets, but instead in their regeneration every time
these assets are used (Raymond, 1999).
One of the distinguishing features of such communities is that the users are
the contributors. As a result, these contributors have a keen appreciation of the
bottlenecks and the creative opportunities encountered when technological
solutions are used (Franke & Shah, 2003; von Hippel, 1994; Shah & Tripsas,
2007). For example, a surgeon may develop and experiment with a new
medical device (Lettl, Herstatt, & Gemuenden, 2006), or members of a sporting
community may improve their equipment so they are better able to perform
their activities (Baldwin et al., 2006). In both of these examples, community
members share their innovations with others who evaluate their value. In
sum, the generation and evaluation of ideas are distributed across the
community.
Such collaborative development also happens in scientiﬁc communities
where members are both the producers and the users of the scientiﬁc instruments required for conducting experiments. ATLAS (the largest particle
physics collaboration at CERN in Geneva, involving more than 3000 scientists)
is one such community where members are motivated to collaborate with one
another in their quest to discover the Higgs Boson particle. Knowledge of the
different parts of ATLAS’ particle detector is not concentrated with a few, but
instead is “interlaced” across the community (Tuertscher, 2009). Interlaced
knowledge is created through multiple points of contact, and in turn, also generates multiple connections between the scientists involved. Such multiplexed
interactions generate solutions to complex problems that any one scientiﬁc
group operating on its own would have found difﬁcult to address.
Development

Mechanisms underlying development. While the birth of an idea is difﬁcult, its development is equally challenging. Noting the challenges involved,
Frances Bacon commented, “As the births of all living creatures are, at ﬁrst,
misshapen, so are all innovations . . . ” (Bacon, Boyd, & Whately, 1867).
Extending Bacon’s metaphor, it takes time and effort for an idea to develop
before it can offer value in use. Supporting these observations are those
offered by Usher (1954), who from his extensive study of the history of

<-----Page 12----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

mechanical innovations noted that all novel ideas must be “critically revised”
before they come to fruition.
Studies highlight important milestones that mark this development
process. For instance, at some stage of the innovation process, proof of
concept must be demonstrated. In this regard, many have written about the
important role that prototypes play (Thomke, 2003; Wheelwright & Clark,
1992), not only to demonstrate feasibility, but also to serve as boundary
objects that connect different relevant social groups whose enrollment is
required for the innovation to succeed (Boland & Collopy, 2004; Carlile,
2002). In addition, the initial idea must snowball into a collection of assets,
resources and capabilities, which, in combination, make it possible for the
innovation to be manufactured, serviced and sustained (Cooper, 2001).
Driving the overall process is ongoing feedback generated as different social
groups ﬂexibly interpret and interact with the innovation (Pinch & Bijker,
1987; Tyre & von Hippel, 1997).
These processes are messy, with actors and artifacts becoming entangled
within other processes such as bricolage, improvization and experimentation
that defy simple linear explanations (Baker, Miner, & Eesley, 2003; Baker &
Nelson, 2005; Garud & Karnoe, 2003). The identities of the actors involved
are transformed as they develop the idea (Garud & Karnoe, 2001). Transformed too are the material artifacts and institutional resources that come
into play. Given the disruptions involved and adjustments required, even the
most exciting of new ideas can encounter inertia and resistance (Glasmeier,
1991), thereby making it difﬁcult for an innovation to gather the necessary
momentum (Hughes, 1969). More often, there are false-starts and deadends, partial triumphs and victories, as an idea proceeds from conception to
commercial development (Van de Ven et al., 1999). In the end, the idea
itself is transformed as the innovation process unfolds.

Development within ﬁrms. Firms offer fertile ground for the development
of novel ideas, as they are rich with resources that can be used at the discretion
of TMTs who have the experience and knowledge, as well as patient capital to
nurture ideas from conception to commercialization (Penrose, 1959). This is
the picture richly detailed by Burgelman’s (1991) longitudinal study of Intel
offering an evolutionary perspective on innovation within ﬁrms, with upper
echelons of management selecting and nurturing initiatives that emerge
from all around the ﬁrm.
Burgelman (1994) also described how Intel was able to survive because of
autonomous bottom up processes that generated an option for the company
by escaping the ﬁrm’s internal selection screen. Speciﬁcally, unbeknownst to
top managers who remained focused on DRAM chips, some in the company
pursued microprocessors. Initially, top management at Intel did not actively
pursue this option. However, when competition for DRAM chips intensiﬁed

with the market entry of Asian manufacturers, Intel was able to shift to microprocessors and thus survive.
There are many other ﬁrms such as Research In Motion (RIM), Nokia,
Kodak, and Polaroid that have not been as fortunate. The literature offers cognitive, behavioral and structural reasons as to why incumbents confront such
problems. Cognitive traps arise when TMTs are unable to recognize the need
for change (Tripsas, 2009; Tripsas & Gavetti, 2000) because they seek comfort
in the deployment of a rational calculus to make decisions (Porac, 1997).
Behaviorally, the very “core competencies” (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) of companies can become “core rigidities” (Leonard-Barton, 1992; Sydow, Schreyogg,
& Koch, 2009) as ﬁrms’ operational contexts shift. Structurally, ﬁrms are
unable to recognize architectural innovations that can destroy the architectural
knowledge embedded in ﬁrms’ structures and information processing
procedures (Henderson & Clark, 1990).
Projects are a way to overcome the traps that arise from such cognitive,
behavioral, and structural constraints (Martin, 2009). Projects are mezzolevel organizational arrangements that serve as forums for pursuing new
opportunities. Moreover, projects serve as forums for action and interaction
among a diverse set of organizational actors to facilitate the emergence, formation, and transformation of beliefs, routines, and practices (Nonaka &
Takeuchi, 1995; Ravasi & Lojacono, 2005). No doubt, projects compete for
top management attention to gain corporate resources (Burgelman, 1991;
Kaplan, 2008). However, while TMTs may act as critics, they also can serve
as sponsors, mentors and institutional leaders (Van de Ven & Grazman, 1997).
Noting the importance of projects, several scholars have explored project
team dynamics. Wheelwright and Clark (1992), for instance, introduced the
notion of heavyweight teams, which are teams with the autonomy and
resources to take a project from conception to commercialization. Also inﬂuential is work by Takeuchi and Nonaka (1986) who used the analogy of the
game of rugby to paint a picture of players from different disciplines continually interacting with one another as an idea travels from one part of the ﬁeld (its
conception) to another (its implementation). Ideas, as they progress from
inception to implementation, confront an increasingly broader and tougher
set of criteria as captured in the “stage gate” model for new product development (Cooper, 1990).

Development across multi-party networks. As noted before, no one ﬁrm,
however large, has all the assets required to develop an innovation. Indeed, as
Teece’s (1986) analysis shows, assets required to develop an idea for
commercial application lie distributed across a multi-party network of ﬁrms.
A detailed analysis of the emergence of the SX-70 camera by Polaroid shows
that the social architecture of this network (i.e. the allocation of tasks across
network members) emerged interactively with the camera’s technical

architecture (i.e. the partitioning and interaction of its different parts) (Garud
& Munir, 2008). Issues that drive the process include the distribution of
resources and assets across members of a network, the nature of interactions
required between different parts of the innovation, and the appropriability of
the beneﬁts across network members.
Recent work introduces the notion of technological platforms that lie at the
heart of such multi-party interactions. A technological platform is not a static
entity, as the label may suggest, but instead “an evolving system made of interdependent pieces that each can be innovated upon” (Gawer & Cusumano,
2002). Technological platforms are especially important in systemic industries
where the value of an innovation depends on the complementary assets that
network partners offer (Garud & Kumaraswamy, 1995).
Firms in a multi-party network would like to become “platform leaders”
(Gawer & Cusumano, 2002), and one way for them to do so is to architect
their platforms in such a way that actors offering complementary products
or services can join. Apple’s iTunes platform is a case in point (Boudreau &
Lakhani, 2009; Suarez, 2012). It is easy for different objects such as mobile
phones, computers and televisions to connect with this platform, thereby
engendering convergence (Yoo, Boland, Lyytinen, & Majchrzak, 2012). The
platform also provides third-party developers with opportunities to create
new apps and accessories for these devices, resulting in wakes of innovation
(Boland, Lyytinen, & Yoo, 2007). Because of such ongoing innovation, the platform itself is never complete at any point in time, and is always in-the-making
(Garud, Jain, & Tuertscher, 2008).
In fast moving industries, especially those involving systemic products,
open innovation (Chesbrough, 2003) allows ﬁrms to build upon the strength
of others (i.e. they “run in packs”, see Van de Ven, 2004), legitimize the technology, create a bandwagon, and establish an industry-wide standard. Yet,
opening up a technology implies “transient advantages” (Garud & Kumaraswamy, 1993), requiring ﬁrms to innovate for fear that their platforms will
lose appeal, or that others within a multi-party network may become platform
leaders. In addition, new threats and opportunities arise as industries, technologies, and markets converge (Harianto & Pennings, 1994). For instance,
Apple’s competitors are not only handset manufacturers (e.g. Samsung), but
also companies providing software (e.g. Google) and content (e.g. Amazon).
Each offers multi-sided platforms that have the capacity to impact multiple
markets simultaneously (Armstrong, 2006; Rochet & Tirole, 2006). And so,
each company is continually engaged in platform wars vying for dominance
(Shapiro & Varian, 1999).

Development within communities. Just as development does not unfold
in a vacuum within a ﬁrm, it is also true of the larger ﬁeld/industry within
which novel ideas emerge. Required for innovation is a macro infrastructure

<-----Page 15----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

The Academy of Management Annals

for innovation (Van de Ven & Garud, 1989). In addition to proprietary
research and development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution functions by private entrepreneurial ﬁrms to commercialize the innovation for
proﬁt, it includes collective resources (intellectual, ﬁnancial, and technological
endowments), institutional standards and legitimacy, and educated consumers.
The creation of this infrastructure is well beyond the reach of any individual
ﬁrm, thereby requiring the involvement of many public- and private-sector
organizations such as universities (as sources of ideas), training facilities (for
human resources), and ﬁnancial institutions that perform critical functions
to develop and implement an innovation (to generate the liquidity required
for innovations to ﬂourish).
A number of studies have used and extended this macro infrastructure view
in studies of technological ﬁelds (Garud & Karnoe, 2003), new business startups (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994), the American ﬁlm industry (Mezias & Kuperman,
2001), and ﬂat panel display technologies (Murtha, Lenway, & Hart, 2001). As
Powell (1998) argued, the organizational ﬁeld of an emerging industry is not
only multi-disciplinary but also multi-institutional. He noted that all the
necessary skills and organizational capabilities are not readily found under a
single ﬁrm’s roof, and that technological process goes hand-in-hand with the
evolution of the industry and its supporting institutions.
These infrastructure considerations have led to a realization that new ideas,
especially disruptive ones (Christensen, 1997), must consider existing arrangements (Glasmeier, 1991) as captured in the notion of transilience—the capacity
of an innovation to inﬂuence the established systems of production and marketing (Abernathy & Clark, 1985). The paradox here is that the innovation
requires the support of the very constituents that are disrupted. This process
is not a discrete event, but one that requires transformation of the infrastructure as a transition occurs. For instance, in the emergence of wind turbines,
actors in Denmark progressively scaled up their design by steadily transforming the competencies that lay distributed all across the Danish business ecosystem in an overall collective act of bricolage (Garud & Karnoe, 2003). The
process was marked by ongoing co-creation of the resources in the Danish
wind turbine ecosystem involving interactions between producers, evaluators,
regulators and users of wind turbines (Karnoe & Garud, 2012).
Another implication is that the ﬁrst mover may need to expend considerable resources to create or transform an infrastructure only to set the stage for
fast followers to reap the beneﬁts (Anderson & Tushman, 1990; Teece, 1986).
This happened during the emergence of cochlear implants; 3M primarily
developed and transformed elements of the industry infrastructure in order
to facilitate the development of cochlear implants, but 3M’s efforts beneﬁted
rivals such as Cochlear Corporation, whose multi-channel device design
eventually became the dominant standard (Garud & Rappa, 1994). This
example illustrates the more general empirical ﬁnding by Teece (1986) that

<-----Page 16----->Perspectives on Innovation Processes

the technology offered by the ﬁrst mover may not become the dominant
design, and that the beneﬁts of being a ﬁrst mover in an industry may be
overstated.

Implementation

Mechanisms underlying implementation. So far, we have discussed literatures pertaining to the invention (which represents exploration), and development (which represents elaboration) of novel ideas. However, just because
the potential viability of an idea has been demonstrated, it does not necessarily
mean that various constituents can exploit its beneﬁts (Brown, 1997). All it
means is that these innovations represent hopeful debutantes. Many additional
steps must unfold before these potentially viable innovations can take root,
experience widespread implementation, and become part of an institutional
logic of production, use and regulation. As one can see in the case of electrical
vehicles that have been around for many years, it is only when innovations
become so ingrained in the fabric of society that exploitative processes can
unfold (Kirsch, 2000).
The extant literature offers diffusion as a key mechanism driving widespread implementation. Most diffusion studies use contagion models that prescribe an increasing rate of adoption that eventually tapers off (Abrahamson,
1991; Rogers, 1983; Suarez, 2005). Several points about diffusion curves are
worth noting. First, the ﬂat front end represents a period when a critical
mass has not yet emerged for a social movement to take hold (Rao, 2009;
Schoonhoven & Romanelli, 2001; Sine & Lee, 2009). The tipping point for
such social movement can be sparked by several forces, such as the dramaturgical presentation of an innovation (Lampel, 2001), or the strategic actions of
ﬁrms to sponsor their innovations as industry standards (Garud, Jain, &
Kumaraswamy, 2002), or the enactment of regulations to which constituents
of the ﬁeld must conform (Jaffe & Palmer, 1997). Once a social movement
begins, the upswing of the S curve represents the rate at which widespread
adoption occurs. Again, strategic actions by ﬁrms (such as the adoption of
an open systems approach, as illustrated by Sun Microsystems), or regulatory
policies (such as subsidies for adoption) can accelerate this rate. The third part
of the curve, the upper ﬂat part, highlights the saturation of a market. It can
also occur because of fragmentation, a situation that Sun Microsystems confronted when it was unable to institutionalize its popular Java software.
Rogers (1983) noted that diffusion involves reinvention—a process wherein
adopters modify an innovation to ﬁt their local circumstances. A related
concept is “generative imitation” offered by Tarde (1903) to denote a contextualized propagation of an innovation across time and space. Generative imitation occurs by linking and integrating the new with the old as we found in our
MIRP studies. Completely substituting the old with the new is often not practical or possible (Sood & Tellis, 2005). People are reluctant to replace existing

organizational programs because of the commitments they have made.
Implementation of innovations proceeds more smoothly in those cases
where the new overlaps with and becomes integrated into existing organizational arrangements (Hargadon & Douglas, 2001).
These processes do not occur automatically, as we found with cochlear
implants. Even after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had
granted its approvals for the commercial application of cochlear implants in
1984, different elements of the industry infrastructure continued to evolve.
There were ongoing battles among constituents to shape the meaning of
device safety and efﬁcacy, resulting in a Consensus Development Conference
organized by the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the FDA in
1987 (Garud, 2008). Despite the consensus that emerged, the widespread use
of cochlear implants still did not occur as projected, partly because of a
failure on the part of those developing the devices to understand the culture
of the deaf community. Ironically, members of the deaf community rejected
the device because they feared that it would destroy their culture (Lane, 1992).

Implementation within ﬁrms. Utterback and Abernathy’s (1975)
research in the auto industry highlights how ﬁrms shift their attention to
making non-trivial investments to develop human skills, manufacturing capabilities, and organizational routines in order to reﬁne manufacturing processes
once a dominant design has emerged. They call this the “speciﬁc phase” of the
process, one that Tushman and Anderson (1986) label as an “era of incremental change”. It is during this period that production competencies are generated
to eke out efﬁciencies through a process of learning-by-doing (Argote & Epple,
1990; Dutton & Thomas, 1984). Eventually, the manufacturing process
becomes widely accepted and taken-for-granted as Green’s (2004) research
shows in the context of total quality management.
In addition, the design underlying the new technology is rationalized so that
it can be mass-produced, marketed, and serviced on an ongoing basis (Ulrich &
Eppinger, 1995). Parts are standardized for interoperability and interchangeability (Kanigel, 1997). These parts rest on an overall platform that serves as
the basis for creating a family of related products (Wheelwright & Clark,
1992). Knowledge is now codiﬁed into the product design as different
modules of the platform become black-boxed (Rosenberg, 1982).
The Sony Walkman platform is illustrative in this regard (Sanderson &
Uzumeri, 1995). Sony created “generational” platforms on which it would
create “incremental” and “topological” changes. Sanderson and Uzumeri
described how Sony was able to steadily release a stream of Walkmans for
different market segments. The adoption of platforms to generate a family of
products is readily apparent in many other cases ranging from software
(such as different versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system) to
hardware (such as different variants of a car model).

The institutionalization of knowledge within an architecture that represents
a platform for retention and reuse generates “economies of substitution” as
modules are added and subtracted in order to create different versions of the
product (Garud & Kumaraswamy, 1995). Knowledge spillovers, another
source of such economies, are generated as intellectual assets are combined
and re-combined to generate product extensions for different market segments
(Henderson & Cockburn, 1996). The clustering of knowledge assets (intellectual property, expertise, and specialized assets) into an overall intellectual platform facilitates such spillover and recombination.

Implementation across multi-party networks. Even if an innovation
offers beneﬁts, implementation across a multi-party network comprising
actors who are cooperating and competing with one another is still difﬁcult
(Van de Ven et al., 1999), as was the case with digital video recorders
(DVRs). Introduced by TiVo in 1999, DVRs are platforms that serve multiple
markets simultaneously (Armstrong, 2006; Rochet & Tirole, 2003), such as end
users who can record and view offerings at convenient times, advertisers, the
Nielsen Company which measures audience size, and broadcasters. At ﬁrst,
the innovation was introduced as a breakthrough innovation that would
clearly disrupt many of the constituencies of the existing industry infrastructure. To the extent that consumers skipped the advertisements, the overall
business model that was in place would be disrupted (Zoglio & Wathieu,
2001). It is no wonder that DVRs encountered considerable resistance. Over
time, TiVo and other DVR companies have modiﬁed their technologies so
that network constituents can continue to gather data on customer viewing
preferences through the use of DVRs, an approach that is far more appealing
to the constituents involved (Aspan, 2007). In this way, the innovation itself
has emerged in and through adoption.
As this example suggests, implementation across a multi-party network
involves more than simple contagion effects; ﬁrms actively try to manage the
adoption of innovations across a network. This is best understood by insights
offered by actor-network theorists (Callon, 1986; Latour, 1987). Rather than
diffusion, they offer “translation” as an active mechanism whereby actors
become entangled with an emergent platform.3 Latour (1987) has described
the contestations that unfold as “trials of strength” between multi-party networks of ﬁrms as they try to convince industry members to adopt their
innovations.
Eventually, the institutionalization of innovation in multi-party networks is
manifest in the stabilization of interaction patterns between entities, the allocation of responsibilities and rights, and the overall value proposition
network members generate (Garud & Kumaraswamy, 1995; Jacobides, 2005).
The appropriation of value by the different members of the multi-party
network is partly dependent upon the extent to which platforms are open or

<-----Page 19----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

closed (West, 2003). At one extreme, platforms are closed, i.e. platform owners
control access to interfaces, often through contracts. At the other extreme, platforms are open, i.e. others can build upon the platform, thereby extending its
architecture in an emergent fashion. The speciﬁc strategies adopted determine
the dynamics that ensue. For instance, encountering problems of uncontrolled
change with its Android platform, Google introduced measures to better
control its evolution (Yoo et al., 2012). Apple, on the other hand, exercised
considerable control to extract value from its iTunes platform. Subsequently,
it offered app developers greater access to the interfaces of the platform,
thereby unleashing its generativity. This has now become an essential part of
the company’s strategy.

Implementation within communities. Communities generate collective
resources such as industry standards that are important for the implementation
of innovations (David & Greenstein, 1990). Setting these standards are cooperative technical organizations (Rosenkopf & Tushman, 1998). For instance,
to ensure the emergence and maintenance of an industry-wide standard,
members of the Ethernet standard development organization have been engaging in an ongoing process of extension, generation, ratiﬁcation and incorporation (Jain, 2012).
While studying the emergence of standards is one way of approaching
the widespread implementation of an innovation, another related approach
is to examine how categories generating meaning are stabilized across different markets as manifest in the overall industry-wide discourse (Phillips,
Lawrence, & Hardy, 2004; Porac, 1997; Rosa, Porac, Runser-Spanjol, &
Saxon, 1999). What does a minivan mean, for instance, as compared to a
luxury sedan? In this regard, industry-wide narratives play a role in stabilizing meaning (White, 2002). These narratives originate and circulate through
many different sources. For instance, they are carried by the media and
communicated through company brochures. They also are part of trade
shows and technology events such as the annual Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas. Such trade shows are collective moments in time and
space when actors from different domains become entangled with
one another to enact a collective agenda (Garud, 2008; Lampel & Meyer,
2008).
The stabilization of meaning represents an industry-wide technological
frame (such as around processor clock-speed in the personal computer industry) that holds the different actors of an ecosystem in place (Bijker, 1995; Garud
& Rappa, 1994; Kaplan & Tripsas, 2008). Besides users and producers, a technological frame implicates evaluators who may provide product certiﬁcation
(such as whether or not a product is organic), and regulators such as the
FDA who determine the safety and efﬁcacy of product offerings. Overall, an
industry that emerges around an innovation develops a distinct identity and

<-----Page 20----->Perspectives on Innovation Processes

incorporates a particular style or recipe for operation (Spender, 1989; Wry,
Lounsbury, & Glynn, 2011).

Complexities Associated with Innovation Processes
So far, we have reviewed the literature pertaining to the processes of invention,
development, and implementation unfolding within ﬁrms, across multi-party
networks, and within communities. However, innovation processes are far
more complex than the picture that emerges from the literatures reviewed in
each cell of Table 1 (Garud et al., 2011). For instance, path dependencies
that shape invention, development and implementation speak to evolutionary
complexity. Innovation is also complex from a relational perspective, implicating multiple social and material elements across different levels. Moreover,
there are multiple experiences of the temporal sequences involved, thereby
generating temporal complexity. In addition, how actors from different cultures
and contexts organize to address and harness these relational and temporal
elements speaks to yet another source of complexity; one that we label as cultural complexity. We explore these complexities as a way to integrate insights
across the cells of the framework, and to outline a research agenda on innovation that can move us beyond the conﬁnes of any one cell of the framework.
Innovation and Complexities

Evolutionary complexity. The punctuated equilibrium model (and the
related two-stage dominant design model) that forms the basis for one of
the axes of our orienting framework can be conceptualized as an evolutionary
process with selection pressures (from the marketplace and from other
sources) applying to variations, some of which prevail to form the basis for
what is retained. This process generates evolutionary complexity, by which
we mean a path dependent sequence of events (Arthur, 1989; David, 1985),
initiated by chance events and subsequent developments driven by positive
feedback loops, that locks the system into progressions along speciﬁc directions
(Schilling, 2002). Once locked in, the system can escape only when it encounters exogenous shocks (see Vergne & Durand, 2010 for a review). In other
words, variations are random, selection environments are exogenous, and
the cultural codes that imprint individuals, ﬁrms, and societies are not easily
reversible.
Over time, however, researchers have relaxed some of these assumptions
within a stream of research broadly labeled as complex adaptive process
(Levinthal, 1997). Variations need not be random but instead can be cultivated
(March, Sproull, & Tamuz, 1991). Selection environments are shaped and
emerge through strategic actions and interactions between agents (Anderson,
1999). And, organizational systems can cultivate dynamic capabilities to deal

<-----Page 21----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

with changing environments (Eisenhardt & Martin, 2000; Helfat & Winter,
2011; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).
Some of these developments are partly fueled by a broader ecosystems
approach (Moore, 1996) to studying shifts in agency and structure as a
system moves from one state of equilibrium to another (Adner & Kapoor,
2010; Dougherty & Dunne, 2011; Iansiti, 1998; Jacobides, 2005). Innovation
paths, from this perspective, must traverse a “rugged landscape” because of
the many interdependencies and interactions involved (Kauffman, 1993;
Levinthal, 1997). Such landscape dynamics offer research opportunities to
examine local and global search processes (Rosenkopf & Nerkar, 2001) and
the balance that is required between exploration and exploitation (March,
1991).
These processes are all the more complex when we consider co-evolution. In
the context of innovation, co-evolution implies that evolutionary changes in
the technological traits of one ﬁeld (such as media and entertainment) shape
evolutionary changes in the technological traits of another (such as education),
and vice versa. In addition, co-evolution has been used to introduce multi-level
processes between technologies, industrial structures and societies (Burgelman,
2002; Geels, 2005; Nelson, 1994; Van de Ven & Grazman, 1999). As Van de
Ven and Grazman explained, multi-level processes draw attention to crosslevel adaptation and selection, and the different rates of change at different
levels.
Such multi-level co-evolutionary processes further challenge a linear representation of innovation and technological change as we found with cochlear
implants in our MIRP studies. For instance, driven by their own internal selection environments, ﬁrms continued to introduce (or promised to introduce)
many different kinds of cochlear implants during an era of ferment (Garud
& Rappa, 1994). The high rate of variation led to the postponement of purchasing behavior by users in anticipation of future innovations (Fellner, 1951;
Rosenberg, 1976). In the meantime, industry-wide selection criteria evolved
at a much slower pace because of the ambiguity that was generated as ﬁrms
tried to shape emerging criteria to their beneﬁt. As a result, companies continued on their innovation trajectories despite, and even because of, the ambiguity
involved (Garud & Van de Ven, 1992). Only when criteria as to what constitutes safety and efﬁcacy emerged at an NIH/FDA Consensus Development
Conference did these dynamics subside.

Relational complexity. Detailed accounts of innovation processes suggest
that invention, development and implementation occur through a relational
interplay between social and material elements. For instance, 3M’s Spence
Silver recounted how he stumbled upon a strange new material when he was
conducting an experiment (Lindahl, 1988). It was only through ongoing interactions between the innovators, the technology, and users that this new

<-----Page 22----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

795

material was applied on paper to create Post-it notes. Others too have recorded
such relational dynamics with innovations ranging from bakelite to bicycles
(Bijker et al., 1987).
The entanglements and interactions between social and material elements
characteristic of such processes generate relational complexity (Callon, 1986;
Latour, 2005). Changes in any part of an innovation impact some other part
in an interactive manner. Such interactive processes generate considerable
ambiguity as the equivocality inherent in artifacts (Weick, 1990) is ampliﬁed
by the multiple and sometimes conﬂicting inputs offered by different actors.
Such ambiguity was a core driver of the cochlear implant program (CIP) at
3M (Garud & Van de Ven, 1992). Given such ambiguity, and in the presence
of slack resources, CIP members escalated commitment to the initiative,
despite receiving negative feedback from multiple sources. They only shifted
to a trial-and-error learning mode when ambiguity gave way to uncertainty
as a dominant design emerged and resources for CIP dried up.
Recent work on design adds further insights into the processes that unfold.
Underlying a design attitude is a desire by actors to generate options through a
process of continual prototyping (Boland & Collopy, 2004). These prototypes
incorporate different dimensions of worth ranging from performance to aesthetics to cost. They also serve as boundary objects (Star & Griesemer,
1989), connecting an ever changing network of people and artifacts. As the
set of associations changes, new issues emerge that need to be resolved
(Callon, 1998). Eventually, innovation progresses through the ongoing resolution of the dialectic tensions between actors with different frames of reference
on the one hand, and the affordances that emerge in and through action on the
other.
The interactivity that relational complexity entails holds implications for
the governance that is most appropriate to harness such processes. For
instance, there are difﬁculties involved in engendering ongoing interactions
across ﬁrm boundaries, given appropriability considerations. Consequently,
ﬁrms and communities are potentially better able to deal with the challenges
that arise because of relational complexity. For instance, the integration of
the positive, the negative, and the battery in Polaroid’s revolutionary SX-70
camera’s ﬁlm pod required the company to develop all three components inhouse even though competencies for the negative and batteries existed
outside Polaroid (Garud & Munir, 2008).

Temporal complexity. By temporal complexity, we mean that innovation
processes are characterized by multiple temporal rhythms and experiences
rather than by a single linear conception of time. Multiple temporal
rhythms generate asynchronies in the emergence of different elements of
the innovation and the infrastructure required for its development and
implementation. To the extent that these asynchronies are not addressed,

<-----Page 23----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

the innovation process itself becomes uneven. Indeed, considerations of asynchrony draw attention to issues such as “time pacing” (Brown & Eisenhardt,
1998; Gersick, 1989) and “momentum” (Hughes, 1969). Yet, despite attempts
to orchestrate the process, unanticipated roadblocks emerge in and through
action (Pickering, 1993), requiring changes in plans (Doganova & EyquemRenault, 2009). There also can be delays in the emergence of the infrastructure (Ansari & Garud, 2009), resulting in partial implementation (Whittington, Pettigrew, Peck, Fenton, & Conyon, 1999). Such delays allow incumbent
technologies to make progress (Abernathy et al., 1983; Henderson, 1995),
thereby reducing the performance gaps between the old and the new. For
all these reasons, the overall development and implementation of innovation
can be dampened.
Moreover, the adoption of innovations may even result in initial dips in
productivity gains as existing socio-technical orders are disrupted (McAfee,
2002). This speaks to diachrony, by which we mean that outcomes can vary
dynamically over stretches of time. What is considered to be a mistake at
one point in time can easily turn out to be valuable at a later point in time,
and vice versa. For instance, an idea may not be valuable due to a lack of complementary assets, as Brown (1997) described in PARC’s development of its
early personal computer designed to work in a distributed network. But,
when these assets emerge, latent ideas can suddenly become valuable. As
Brown (1997, p. 96) noted, “Now, some dozen years later, our original views
of client-server and networking architectures are allowing that to happen.”
Such diachrony has been documented in many different domains, including
the emergence of science (Irvine & Martin, 1984).
Temporal complexity is compounded by the fact that different actors
associated with innovation from different social settings experience time in
different ways. For instance, they exhibit different orientations toward the
past, present and future (Emirbayer & Mische, 1998). Some may only have
future orientations toward emerging technologies (van Lente, 2000), for
instance, and others may try to make sense of the past (Weick, 1995). Still
others may be focused only on the present. Then there are others who consider
broader slices of time, looking back to the past in order to go into the future
(Garud, Kumaraswamy, & Karnoe, 2010; Gavetti & Levinthal, 2000; Kaplan
& Orlikowski, 2012; March, 1999).
How can the different timelines be coordinated? The literature draws attention to temporal boundary objects (Yakura, 2002) such as technology road
mapping and scenario planning. Narratives of innovation can serve as one
such boundary object, facilitating the coordination of multiple social groups’
activities (Bartel & Garud, 2009). For instance, companies such as 3M have a
number of narratives of innovation that serve as generative memories and
spawn additional innovations. At the industry level, narratives such as
Moore’s law set expectations (van Lente & Rip, 1998) that structure and

synchronize ongoing disruptive change amongst ecosystem partners with
different temporal rhythms and orientations.
A consideration of narratives also highlights the capacity of actors to strike
when the moment is right (kairos) even as they pursue their projects based on
anticipations of the future and memories of the past as instantiated in the
present (Ricoeur, 1984). When the time is right, an idea that may have been
abandoned or shelved can become valuable, thereby blurring the distinction
between invention and development. As one 3M employee put it, “In most
cases, just looking at the past probably completes 80 to 90% of the product
design” (quoted in Garud et al., 2011). But, for this, moments of kairos must
be cultivated through temporal structuring mechanisms (Garud et al., 2011;
Orlikowski & Yates, 2002) such as 3M’s 15% rule, whereby employees are
empowered to explore for some portion of their time when the time is right.

Cultural complexity. By cultural complexity, we mean that different cultural contexts have their own practices, values and discourses that drive innovation (Brown & Duguid, 1991). Even what is novel and useful, and what
constitutes intellectual property is culturally deﬁned. For instance, a copyright
has been granted to a sequence of postures associated with a speciﬁc form of
yoga (Bikram Yoga) in the U.S.A. This copyright has been contested, given
that these yoga exercises have been practiced in India for centuries, and therefore, cannot be considered novel.
These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that innovation is
culturally induced (Ruttan & Hayami, 1994). One implication is that different
cultural contexts harness different kinds of innovation processes, and generate
different kinds of outcomes. For instance, Lounsbury and Crumley’s (2007)
research in the ﬁnancial services industry shows how the same innovation
(money management) is implemented in different ways depending upon the
local context. Moreover, innovation practices may vary based on whether or
not the environment is resource-rich. For instance, the term Jugaad Innovation
(Radjou, Prabhu, & Ahuja, 2012), a term that is synonymous with bricolage,
has captured the imagination of many in India, a country that has speciﬁc
growth challenges. Frugal innovations (e.g. the laptop created by MIT’s
“One Laptop Per Child” initiative, see Govindarajan & Trimble, 2012) that
address the needs of those at the bottom of the pyramid are part of this
process (Prahalad, 2010).
In turn, such innovations are spawning “reverse innovations” (Govindarajan & Trimble, 2012) where innovations originating in emerging markets are
informing innovations in developed markets. Yet, innovations in one setting
may not be readily adopted in another (Van de Ven, 2004). For instance, customers in certain parts of the world view genetically modiﬁed foods with suspicion despite confronting food shortages (Wynne, 2006). More generally,
cultural complexity suggests that innovations do not just diffuse unaltered

across social groups, but instead, must be reinvented (Rogers, 1983) and redesigned (Brown, 2008; Sanderson & Uzumeri, 1995), a factor that complicates
the implementation of innovation across cultural contexts.

Approaches to Complexity
Most try to manage or reduce these complexities. For instance, to deal with the
potential fragmentation that multi-level co-evolutionary processes can generate, TMTs may be tempted to pre-specify an architecture by stabilizing
elements at the top of the hierarchy that then serve as the basis for the evolution of components below (Clark, 1985; Simon, 1962; Tushman &
Murmann, 1998). Pre-specifying an architecture also addresses the challenges
of managing relational complexity as the technical modules and social partitions of the system need only interact with one another across standardized
interfaces (Baldwin & Clark, 2000; Garud & Kumaraswamy, 1993). To deal
with temporal complexity, people employ temporal coordination mechanisms
ranging from linear technology roadmaps to stage gate models (Cooper, 2001)
and other project management tools such as the project evaluation review technique (Yakura, 2002). To deal with cultural complexity, people take an outsider’s view that decontextualizes a phenomenon and places it within known
categories so as to spawn comparisons, benchmarking, and evaluations
(Harris, 1988; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993).
A problem with such approaches is that they are likely to constrain the
natural emergence and ﬂow of innovation processes. For instance, the concentration of decision rights in TMTs can generate organizational traps that arise
when decision-makers miss out on innovation opportunities that they do not
comprehend (Tripsas & Gavetti, 2000). Modularization (Sanchez & Mahoney,
1996) reduces the possibility of knowledge integration and recombination if
actors become locked into their “thought worlds” (Dougherty, 1992). The
use of linear processes such as the state-gate model (Cooper, 1990) can also
result in valuable assets being discarded as mistakes. Taking an outsider’s perspective can render evaluators blind to new opportunities that emerge in practice (Hargadon & Bechky, 2006).
Given these solutions, innovation occurs after considerable struggle despite
(and not because of) organizing structures (Dougherty & Hardy, 1996), only
to settle down to equilibrium, i.e. a punctuated equilibrium model. However,
organizing for innovation in such a manner (moments of punctuation followed by long periods where the equilibrium holds) is problematic in an
environment characterized by continual change. Continual change is driven
partly by the advent of a host of digital and information technologies such
as the Internet. These technologies are easily reconﬁgurable and can ﬂuidly
connect heterogeneous actors and artifacts from different domains and cultures (Yoo et al., 2012). Continual change is also driven by the rising intensity

of competition between ﬁrms. Firms can only hope to survive in such
environments by continually introducing a host of products and services
(D’Aveni, Dagnino, & Smith, 2010; Garud & Kumaraswamy, 1995; Grove,
1996).
Recent work suggests that organizations can engage in ongoing innovation
by harnessing rather than reducing complexity (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1997;
Van de Ven et al., 1999). For this to happen, appropriate processes, structures
and cultures are required (Garud et al., 2011). For instance, from an evolutionary perspective, exploration and exploitation must occur together as a part of
ongoing work (Bartel & Garud, 2009; Farjoun, 2010). Ongoing variations at the
business level generate the raw materials for selection processes to operate
(Dosi & Lovallo, 1997). TMTs can shape emergent strategy through a
process of “guided evolution” (Lovas & Ghoshal, 2000).
To harness temporal complexity, there is now awareness of the utility of
breaking the linear ﬂow spanning invention, development, and implementation (Van de Ven et al., 1999). For instance, ideas considered as mistakes
or abandoned from one innovation initiative may inform some other initiative.
Or, companies can start with implementation processes (such as sponsoring a
platform or a technological standard) to facilitate the emergence of inventive
ideas and developmental work required for innovations to succeed. Such
models of change depart from the linear models such as the stage gate
model (Cooper, 1990).
These possibilities are enhanced to the extent that relational complexity is
nurtured. One approach is to institute minimal structures (Brown &
Eisenhardt, 1997). Over-determining or under-determining the interactions
between the different elements of a system can lead to either stagnation or
fragmentation, respectively (Dooley & Van de Ven, 1999). Another approach
has explored how platforms of social and technical arrangements can be
created to serve as generative memories (Garud et al., 2011). By this we
mean generating a capacity to retain and maintain assets and intellectual
property generated during the course of normal work to serve as the basis
for innovations for the future. For instance, the Microreplication technology
platform at 3M Corporation is a collection of intellectual property, assets and
people, which has served as a generative platform for spawning a variety of
innovations ranging from the overhead projector to brightness enhancement
ﬁlms.
In addition, given that the value of novel ideas may not be readily recognized, the literature has also suggested the importance of cultural mechanisms
to beneﬁt from complexity. One approach is to cultivate a tolerance and even
celebration of deviance (Bowker & Star, 1999; Florida, 2002). For instance, 3M
sponsored narratives of innovation around the accomplishments of employees
who outsmarted top management to pursue initiatives that deviated from the
norm (3M, 1998). At the ﬁeld level, others have observed the importance of a

<-----Page 27----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 15:34 11 June 2014

“narrative infrastructure” that can help ﬁrms understand each other and coordinate their activities (Deuten & Rip, 2000). More recently, scholars have
explored the role that entrepreneurial narratives play in generating legitimacy
for emerging industries and for establishing collective identity (Lounsbury &
Glynn, 2001).
Overall, Usher’s (1954) model of innovation provides a framework for harnessing these complexities. Based on a study of innovation in the mechanical
industry over a 100-year period, Usher noted several important elements of
the processes involved. These include the perception of a new pattern of
opportunities, and the setting of a stage that facilitates acts of insight that
must be critically revised in order for the innovation to become widely used.
There are multiple innovation journeys that unfold in an evolutionary
fashion that combine to produce revolutionary outcomes. Labeling this as a
process of partial cumulative synthesis, Usher highlighted not just the role of
individuals in the process, but also the distributed and collective fabric with
which they work, and from which they depart to create and nurture innovations. In this way, Usher’s framework is also able to address both relational
and temporal complexities. Given that innovation processes are contextualized
in his model, it is also able to address cultural complexities involved.
Future Research
Drilling Deeper into Innovation Sub-processes
Revisiting the framework we have used to map the literature is one way to
explore future research avenues. No doubt, research will continue to probe
deeper into all innovation processes covering invention, development and
implementation as they unfold across different levels. Of these, processes pertaining to the implementation of innovation, and the dynamics that unfold
within communities have been relatively less studied. It would therefore be
useful to generate deeper processual insights in these areas.
For instance, researchers have noted that implementation does not occur
as a simple diffusion process, but instead through a series of “translations”
(Czarniawska & Sevon, 1996; Latour, 2005), “re-inventions” (Rogers, 1983),
and “re-contextualizations” (Garud & Nayyar, 1994), all of which require
reconﬁgurations of the innovations and the larger associated ecosystems.
Understanding these processes takes us beyond contagion models and
brings issues around power, politics, and legitimacy into play (Bijker et al.,
1987). Such considerations raise questions about the fragility of the process
as an innovation propagates within ﬁrms, across multi-party networks, and
within communities. For example, it is just as easy for an innovation to fragment, as it is to cohere. Dealing with such issues requires theories and
research designs that treat success and failure symmetrically (Bijker et al.,
1987).

Additional issues present themselves when we consider the increasing
importance of communities (such as those dedicated to open source software)
in generating innovation. Digital technologies make it possible for such
communities to emerge and thrive (Boudreau, Lacetera, & Lakhani, 2011;
Faraj, Jarvenpaa, & Majchrzak, 2011). However, we still do not have the
same depth of understanding as we do with ﬁrms and multi-party networks
as to how members of communities driven by mutual and partisan interests
engage with one another (Garud et al., 2002; Hargrave & Van de Ven,
2006). Consequently, these communities can easily fork and fragment
(Kogut & Metiu, 2001). In this regard, the literature has identiﬁed mechanisms that can facilitate coordination such as protocols for taking on leadership
roles in projects (von Krogh, Spaeth, & Lakhani, 2003), and broad-based
governance for the ﬂexible adjustment of rules (O’Mahony & Ferraro,
2007). In addition, a digital trace of how an innovation has emerged can
facilitate coordination by preventing fragmentation (Garud et al., 2008).
Additional research is required to explore social and technical mechanisms
to facilitate the generative engagement of actors with diverse backgrounds
in communities.
Another set of issues emerges when we consider innovation processes
cutting across the various sub-processes and levels of the framework.
When we do so, we are likely to see zig-zagging dynamics with shifts in
the locus of agency as the processes unfold (Van de Ven et al., 1999).
Actors may imagine a certain sequence of events and initiate the innovation
process based on such a conceptualization (van Lente, 2000). However, these
processes seldom unfold as envisioned. When roadblocks or new
opportunities are encountered, plans must be changed as well as the
overall distribution of agency and efforts across the ecosystem. Such
dynamics are unfolding with sustainable technologies that represent the
next wave of disruptive innovations (Garud & Gehman, 2012; Markard,
Raven, & Truffer, 2012).
Exploring and Extending Insights on Innovation Complexities
The complexities associated with innovation offer yet another way to suggest
areas for future research. For instance, researchers who take an evolutionary
perspective have been exploring exaptation (Cattani, 2005; Dew, Sarasvathy,
& Venkataraman, 2004; Levinthal, 1998) as a way to beneﬁt from shifts in
the environment. That is, exploratory ideas can lie latent until the time is
right for them to be developed and implemented (Garud & Nayyar, 1994).
However, the more groundbreaking the idea is, the greater the challenges
involved in its elaboration and subsequent exploitation. This is because existing
structures that allow for exploitation of ongoing activities may be disrupted,
and so will generate resistance against novel ideas (Glasmeier, 1991).

The Academy of Management Annals

Moreover, new structures must be created to support these breakthrough ideas.
The issues surrounding such transformational processes deserve more inquiry.
Considerations of relational complexity suggest tensions that arise when
members of different communities of practice interact with one another
(Brown & Duguid, 1991; Lave & Wenger, 1991). The problem is not just
one of information asymmetries, but more fundamentally of differences in
the ways members of different communities understand their worlds
(Knorr-Cetina, 1999). There are semantic, syntactic and pragmatic differences between members of different communities, leading to the possibility
of conﬂict (Carlile, 2004). What is a novel solution to one group may even
appear to be a negative externality to another. In this regard, recent theorization in actor-network theory suggests the utility of hybrid forums (Callon,
Lascoumes, & Barthe, 2009) where different constituents share not just
matters of fact, but more importantly, matters of concern (Latour, 2004).
The dynamics that unfold at these forums and how they conﬁgure ﬁelds
open avenues for research (Garud, 2008; Lampel & Meyer, 2008).
Temporal complexity considerations suggest the utility of further exploring
asynchronies and diachronies associated with innovation. For instance, asynchrony in the development of different parts of an ecosystem around an innovation highlights the importance of temporal coordination of a disparate set
of actors with different time frames and temporal orientations. In this regard,
the literature offers industry wide narratives as mechanisms for such temporal
coordination. Extending insights on their roles and the mechanisms involved
is a promising agenda to pursue. Considering diachrony, what may be considered as a valuable outcome at one point in time can generate negative outcomes at a different point in time, as was the case with many ﬁnancial
innovations (Bookstaber, 2007). Relatedly, innovation can produce negative outcomes in related ﬁelds, as was the case when corn-based ethanol was used as a
fuel additive and food shortages ensued (Runge & Senauer, 2007). Additional
research and theorization could shed light on these under-researched areas.
Cultural complexity is becoming all the more salient in today’s globally connected world, thereby opening up questions that require investigation. The
very meaning of innovation and the processes involved changes from one
domain and cultural context to another. Innovations for those at the bottom
of the pyramid in developing markets (Prahalad, 2010) may be very different
from those at the top of the pyramid in resource-rich contexts. Consequently,
innovations must be adapted when they cross cultural boundaries (Govindarajan & Trimble, 2012). In this regard, Van de Ven (2004) noted that ﬁrms from
developing countries who “run in packs” to build and expand on their contextspeciﬁc competencies may be more successful at expanding into other developing countries with similar national, political, and institutional contexts than
ﬁrms from developed countries who have not acquired this tacit knowledge
of local practices. More research in this emerging area would be helpful in

order to understand the ﬂow of innovations in an increasingly interconnected
world.

Conclusion
As we have noted in this chapter, innovation is not just the emergence of a new
idea or a ﬁnal product, but the entire process that takes an idea from inception
to implementation. We also noted that innovation processes unfold not just
within ﬁrms, but also across multi-party networks, and within communities.
To review the literature, we examined how these innovation processes
unfold across these different levels.
By way of conclusion, we will brieﬂy reﬂect on the implications of this work
for research, methods, and practice. For research, as we noted, a process perspective sensitizes us to the complexities associated with innovation processes.
For instance, innovation processes may not necessarily follow a linear sequence
from invention to implementation, and will implicate multiple levels simultaneously. In addition, innovation processes are culturally determined, and
so the particulars of how speciﬁc innovation processes unfold will depend
on the cultural setting. Recognizing these complexities is of importance to
future research on innovation as a process.
These observations clearly have implications for the methods used to study
innovation processes. Minimally, one has to take a multi-level, longitudinal
perspective, and follow events implicating actors, artifacts, and institutions
over time. One could report such events from an outsider’s perspective. But,
if we want to understand the complexities that practitioners in the ﬁeld experience, then researchers will need to cultivate a sensitivity to the systems of
meanings that endogenously drive innovation processes in particular settings
(Brown & Duguid, 1991). In this regard, beyond paying attention to the
context, it is important to understand the sub-text of agency. By this we
mean that researchers will need to tap into the temporal experiences of the
actors involved, i.e. their aspirations, current experiences of becoming, and
the memories that they generate (Ricoeur, 1984). And, it is by paying attention
to the interaction between the context and the sub-text that a deeper understanding of innovation processes will emerge.
These insights lead us to implications for practice. When confronting complexity, many try to control or manage it. Indeed, many theoretical models
exacerbate the challenges by suggesting simpliﬁcations of inherently complex
problems. Deploying linear simple models risks dampening the very generative
forces that are required to sustain innovations. Instead, practitioners must
explore and experiment with arrangements that harness complexity as a generative force.
Consistent with Usher’s (1954) work that we introduced earlier, we consider
the thoughts we have offered in this chapter to set the stage for many different

<-----Page 31----->804

acts of insight by the increasing number of scholars who are working on innovation studies. Scholars around the world are privy to multiple different innovation patterns, problems, and solutions that need to be studied, recorded, and
disseminated. As these observations converge, new insights will emerge that
must be critically revised based on norms of sound scholarship.

In the domains of business and economics, more than 7000 articles have been published with the term innovation in the title since 1956 (start of the Social Science
Citation Index). The percentage of articles published each year with the term innovation in the title has been steadily increasing, climbing to over 2.5% (i.e. 690
articles) in 2012.
Hardin used the analogy of a herd of cows grazing on a patch of grass (the
commons) to illustrate this problem—the commons collapses if the grass is consumed at a rate higher than at which it is regenerated. Similarly, within such communities, members may withhold their best efforts to contribute ideas while
extracting beneﬁts, thereby degrading the commons. Such degradation is all the
more likely to occur when community members compete for scarce resources
including customers (Baldwin & Clark, 2006).
The speciﬁc moments are problematization, interessement, enrollment, and mobilization (Callon, 1986). Problemitization is the framing of the innovation situation
in such a way that it becomes an “obligatory passage point” for different actors.
Interessement is the way in which the identities and roles of the different actors
involved are deﬁned and stabilized. Enrollment refers to the negotiations involved
in the acceptance and stabilization of these different identities and roles. And,
mobilization refers to widespread acceptance of the innovation, by even those
who were not actively involved in the initial stages.
