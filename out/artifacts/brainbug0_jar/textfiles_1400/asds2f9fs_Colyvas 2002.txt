Introduction

for these developments. In particular, the precise roles
of two institutions—patents on university inventions
and the technology transfer ofﬁces that manage licensure of these patents—in bringing university inventions into practice, are unclear.
Several years ago a team of researchers, including
many authors of this paper, together with collaborators at the University of California, began a study
that explored in detail what was going on behind
the ﬁgures in the three American research universities that then had the highest revenues from licensing:
Columbia University, Stanford University, and the
University of California. The study worked with the
collection of “invention reports” that all of these universities had been requiring their researchers to make
out whenever their research came up with something
that seemed of likely commercial value. The methodology used and ﬁndings of this study have been published in Mowery et al. (2001).
For the purposes of this paper, two ﬁndings of that
earlier study are important. First, while a number of
observers had attributed the rise of university patenting largely to the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in
1980, which made it easier for universities to retain
title on government funded inventions, our ﬁndings
suggested a more complicated story. In particular,
this period saw the rise and maturing of important new areas and techniques of university research.

For most readers of this paper, the striking increase
in patenting and licensing activities at American
research universities since the late 1970s is a familiar story. The number of patents issued to universities
and colleges more than doubled between 1979 and
1984, did so again between 1984 and 1989, and nearly
doubled once more during the 1990s. In 1980 approximately 20 universities had technology licensing and
transfer ofﬁces. By 1990 that number was 200, and by
2000 nearly every major research university had one.
University license revenues have increased from $220
million to $698 million from 1991 to 1997 alone (Association of University Technology Managers 1998).
Most observers attribute these trends to the BayhDole Act, which was passed in 1980. The act provided blanket permission for performers of federally
funded research to ﬁle for patents on the results of
such research and to grant licenses for these patents,
including exclusive licenses, to other parties, and
encouraged universities to develop “technology transfer ofﬁces” to market and manage their patentable
inventions. Since Bayh-Dole, there has clearly been a
dramatic increase in university patenting and licensing activity, as the statistics in the ﬁrst paragraph
make clear. But while this surface story is familiar,
there were and are considerable unknowns regarding
the details of what has been going on, and the reasons

How Do University Inventions Get Into Practice?

Molecular biology, particularly the concepts and techniques of genetic engineering, became increasingly
prominent in university research, principally research
at the medical schools, after the 1970s. University
researchers also pioneered in the development of new
ways to use computers in research, and in the development of various kinds of software. The university research ﬁndings and techniques in these two
broad arenas were especially interesting to industry. Over the same time, various Patent Ofﬁce and
court decisions increased the range of research results
that were patentable, and this was particularly so for
biotechnology. These two developments were leading to increases in university patenting and licensing
prior to the passage of Bayh-Dole, and in our view
the principal effect of Bayh-Dole was to accelerate and
magnify trends that already were occurring.
This is a ﬁrst report on a study that aims to focus
an even higher powered microscope on the phenomena. We aim to study in detail a considerable number of cases of university inventing to better understand the nature of the projects that led to inventions
reported in invention reports, the motivations for the
research, and the processes and mechanisms involved
in connecting with industry for “technology transfer.”
The cases that form the basis of this report are of
inventions created at Columbia University and Stanford University. In future work, we hope to broaden
the set, and include inventions at a larger number of
universities. Our particular focus is reﬂected in the
title of this paper. We want to understand better “how
university inventions get into practice.”
One question is the role of intellectual property
rights in facilitating technology transfer. The theory
behind the Bayh-Dole Act was that, for the most part,
university research results of potential use in industry
were embryonic inventions requiring a lot of followon work in industry. A start on a new pharmaceutical
was the standard example. It was proposed that, for
that kind of invention, it often greatly facilitated technology transfer, and sometimes was necessary for it,
if the university took out a patent on the invention.
It was argued, ﬁrst of all, that a license to develop
that gives some protection from competitors often
was needed to induce a ﬁrm to invest the resources
62

needed to bring the invention to practice. If the university held the patent, it could grant a ﬁrm such
protection, via exclusive or semi-exclusive licenses. It
was argued that absent intellectual property rights,
university “inventions” (assumed to be embryonic)
would not get into practice.
In addition to the argument that university inventions were not getting into practice because of difﬁculties universities faced in patenting and licensing
them in a way that would provide special incentives
for ﬁrms to develop them, proponents of Bayh-Dole
also argued that there was a signiﬁcant informational
divide between the world of academia and the world
of industry, which made it difﬁcult for university
inventions to get into practice. Thus, another motivation for the passage of Bayh-Dole was the expectation that allowing universities to share in the proceeds
from faculty inventions would create incentives for
the university to advertise these inventions to industry, rather than leaving them “on the shelf”. As we
have noted, since Bayh-Dole, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of universities with
“technology transfer ofﬁces” that administer and market university patents.
The position that lack of intellectual property protection was limiting the use and commercialization of
university inventions lacked evidentiary foundation
(Eisenberg 1996, Mowery and Sampat 2000), and the
role of patents and exclusive licenses in facilitating
the transfer of university technologies remains poorly
understood. Moreover, there is little understanding of
exactly what roles technology transfer ofﬁces play in
bringing inventions to practice. This paper attempts
to shed some light on these via in-depth examination
of a small sample of technologies handled by technology transfer ofﬁces.
To tip our hand, we ﬁnd that both the role of
patents and the role of the university technology
transfer ofﬁces, varies signiﬁcantly from case to case.
In some cases, it is unlikely that technology transfer would have occurred absent intellectual property
rights. In others, intellectual property rights did facilitate universities earning royalty income, but the technology would have been used in industry even absent
patenting and licensing by the university. Similarly, in
several of our cases the university technology transfer

ofﬁces did assist in bridging the divide between the
lab and marketplace, but in others the divide was not
that big to begin with.
We proceed as follows. In §2, we discuss our
research methodology, and brieﬂy survey the cases.
In §3, we draw on these cases to examine the roles of
intellectual property rights in facilitating technology
transfer, and in §4 we focus on the roles of the university technology transfer ofﬁces. In §5 we summarize
our main ﬁndings, and conclude with a discussion
of the limitations of this study and implications for
future research.

Methodology and a Survey of
the Cases

Our focus in this study is restricted to a set of “inventions” for which the universities sought and obtained
intellectual property rights, typically in the form of
patents. While we recognize, indeed we highlight,
that university inventions of this sort comprise only
a portion the ﬁndings and techniques coming out of
university research that get used in practice in ﬁrms,
hospitals, and other organizations that are doing practical work, our selection of case studies is suitable as
a ﬁrst cut into the study of the role of intellectual
property rights and technology transfer ofﬁces in the
dissemination of university research results.
The discussion below is based on 11 case studies
from Columbia University and Stanford University.1
We emphasize that we do not pretend to have a representative sample of cases, either from these universities or from the population of inventions handled by
technology transfer ofﬁces more generally. The small
number of cases we have examined precludes us from
drawing quantitative conclusions, nor does it allow
us to claim generality for the insights we drew from
them. But that is not the point of this paper. Given
that so little is known about these issues, our goal
was instead to examine in greater detail a number
of cases that could suggest lines of investigation that
may be worth pursuing further in broader studies of
1

record can be found in Colyvas, Gelijns, and Rosenberg (2000).

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

the phenomenon of technology transfer from university to industry.
It is also worth noting that for several of our cases,
patenting and licensing began before 1980, consistent with the argument above that universities were
becoming involved in patenting and licensing even
before Bayh-Dole. For these cases, we can discuss the
impact of patenting and university involvement in
licensing on technology transfer, but not the impact of
Bayh-Dole per se. Moreover, we have examined relatively few cases from the 1990s, primarily because it
is difﬁcult to get a long enough window to observe
“technology transfer” (or lack thereof) for more recent
cases. These peculiarities of our sample will be kept
in mind as we discuss the cases.
Descriptions of the cases are provided in the
Appendix, and key features are summarized in Table
1. The cases differ in terms of the technology ﬁeld,
the nature of the knowledge that the underlying
research intended to generate, and the proximity of
the research goals to perceived practical needs. Two
of the inventions (Inventions A and G) represent fundamental techniques or tools that can be and are used
in research in certain broad areas, including prominently research aimed at drug discovery, as well as to
produce commercially useful proteins. Four cases (B,
C, J, and K) deal with inventions that identify possible therapeutic uses for biological processes and compounds. Two (E and F) are specialized software programs. The remaining three cases (D, H, and I) focus
on medical or electrical devices, or components used
in such devices.
What were the origins of the research projects that
led to these inventions? What were the principal motivations of the scientists involved? A number of commentators have expressed concern that, in this post
Bayh-Dole era, expectations of ﬁnancial returns have
come to play a signiﬁcant role in inﬂuencing the allocation of research at universities, and that as a result,
university research is becoming less deep-probing
and fundamental than used to be the case. In none of
these 11 cases did an expectation of ﬁnancial returns
for the scientists, or for the university, appear to have
played a signiﬁcant role in motivating the research. In
some of the cases the research was funded by industry, and industry clearly was betting that the project

could, over the long run at least, contribute to its profitability. But so far as the researchers are concerned,
while availability of funding may have made the
project feasible and attractive, the principal motive
seems to have been to successfully achieve the kind
of research results that academic researchers in their
ﬁelds customarily are congratulated for achieving.
However, those expectations, and the kind of
research done, vary across departments, schools, and
ﬁelds of research, and this has been the case traditionally. Some of the research projects aimed at quite
fundamental advances in understanding or technique.
What was achieved turned out to be very useful
for other researchers, and proﬁtable for companies to
employ. Some of the research was in what Donald
Stokes (1997) has called “Pasteur’s Quadrant.” Here
the researchers had very much in mind certain kinds
of practical problems, and were motivated to help
solve these problems, but their approach involved
quite fundamental research. This is a fair characterization of each of the embryonic pharmaceuticals in
our sample (Inventions B, C, J, and K), the biotechnology research tools (Inventions A and G), and the two
medical devices (H and I). In one of the cases (D), the
invention was a somewhat serendipitous by-product
of fundamental research. The two software projects (E
and F) were from the start explicitly aimed to develop
64

w/o
Type of IPR

something useful for industry, and basically involved
design as contrasted with fundamental research.
The case studies involve inventions emanating from
different research units within the two universities.
Six cases look at projects primarily located at academic medical centers. Two others involved collaboration between researchers at an academic medical
center, and university colleagues in the physical sciences or engineering. Of the other three, one was the
result of work in a research institute afﬁliated with
a university, one came from work in an engineering department, and the third was a byproduct of a
project that involved building apparatus for scientiﬁc
measurement.
It is important to recognize an important characteristic of the research projects, and the university
researchers involved in them, that is apparent in virtually all of the cases in our set. The researchers
involved were members of a community, a network
of scientists, that involved people from the industries that likely could beneﬁt from successful research
results. In many of the cases, it is clear that at least
strategically placed people in industry knew about
the project from its inception. In some cases that was
because industry funding went into the project; but
in some of the cases it was simply because university

scientists and industry scientists roughly communicated to each other what they were doing. The notion
of a chasm between the world of university research
and the world of industry research and application,
implicit or sometimes explicit, in some of the writings
regarding university–industry “technology transfer,”
does not characterize the context in most of our cases.
Indeed, in the one instance where there clearly was
such a wide divide (Invention D), it is interesting that
the technology in question never got transferred.
As with the role of patents in technology transfer,
we will consider the role of the university technology
transfer ofﬁce in the following section. However, note
that the phenomena we have just ﬂagged already suggests that in many of our cases, the role of such ofﬁces
was not to develop links between the university and
industry, but rather to monitor, facilitate, and regulate
the transactions between parties who already know
each other.

3.

The Role of Intellectual
Property Rights in Bringing
Inventions to Practice

Intellectual property, patents or copyrights, have been
taken out on most of these inventions, and on the ones
where patents have not yet been issued, the university
involved has been trying to get intellectual property
rights. Here we believe one sees a very different picture than what one would have seen 30 or 40 years
ago, if one had looked at a roughly comparable set of
university research projects. It now is the norm at our
two universities to consider for intellectual property
protection any research outputs that meet the criteria
for patentability. This policy clearly has enabled our
two universities to reap signiﬁcant ﬁnancial returns
from some of their inventions. Whether the taking out
of patents has facilitated the technology transfer process, or more generally, the ways in which university
holding of intellectual property rights has inﬂuenced
the technology transfer process, is examined below.
It seems widely believed, and was a basic premise
of Bayh-Dole, that what comes out of university
research generally requires a lot of additional work,
generally by industry, before it is of any use. As indicated in Table 1, most of the cases in our sample are
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

such “embryonic” inventions, needing further development to be useful. Others in our set (A, E, F, and
G) were useful to industry even without signiﬁcant
further development.
For the nonembryonic inventions, ﬁrms didn’t need
any assurance of exclusivity to pick up and use what
came out of university research. They did so simply because it was proﬁtable. In the case of the
two biotechnology research tools (A and G), ﬁrms
began planning to use them before a patent was ever
granted, and before involvement of the technology
transfer ofﬁce. In these cases, the fact that universities
could patent and license inventions did allow universities to generate income, but was not instrumental in
bringing the inventions into use.
The fact that some results of university research
come out “ready to use” would not be a surprise to
anyone familiar with the long history of university
research in agriculture. The university agricultural
experimentation stations were “in the business” of
developing ﬁndings and techniques that were ready
for use by farmers. This is also true for a number
of the technologies developed in universities for the
Department of Defense.
However, as noted, six of the cases did require further development before they were usable by industry
or other academic scientists. Four of the cases (B, C, J,
and K) are embryonic pharmaceuticals. These are the
kinds of university inventions that were the center of
attention in hearings that led to the passage of BayhDole. None of these were licensed nonexclusively,
though one was licensed coexclusively to a handful
of ﬁrms. This suggests that in these cases, ﬁrms may
well have needed some assurance of monopoly power
before investing in development and commercialization. However, in at least one of these cases (Invention C), even nonlicensee ﬁrms invested in developing
products based on the invention, apparently believing that if their research was successful, they could
get a patent based on their own work, or have other
means to be able to proﬁt from their work, and didn’t
need protection from the efforts of competitors to be
induced to go for that prize. This suggests that in
the contexts where other means of appropriability are
present, patentability and exclusive licensing of the
“embryonic” university idea may be less essential.
65

<-----Page 5----->COLYVAS, CROW, GELIJNS, MAZZOLENI, NELSON, ROSENBERG, AND SAMPAT
How Do University Inventions Get Into Practice?

Both of the medical device innovations ended up
being licensed with some exclusivity terms, as did
one of the software inventions. For two of these cases
(Inventions F and I) it is not clear whether that was
because an exclusive license was needed to get a company to invest the funds needed to commercialize the
invention, or because the university was involved in
a complex of activities with the company in question
and this exclusive license was part of a web of contractual arrangements.
We state a ﬁnal observation about exclusive licenses
and embryonic inventions: in the cases where significant additional work in industry was needed before
a technology born in the university could effectively
get into practice, it almost never was clear in advance
just which ﬁrm would show the initiative and have
the capability to do successfully the needed additional work. In several of our cases (Inventions B, C,
and K) the ﬁrms that were initially given licenses to
pursue that work, after a time became unenthusiastic about the prospects, and backed off. At the same
time, ﬁrms that originally did not get a license came
to show a strong interest, and in two of the cases
(B and C) offered to push the matter forward. Innovation is an uncertain business. Effective technology
transfer from universities to industry needs to recognize this, and that it generally is not a good idea to
pick a chosen carrier in advance and to stick with
that carrier through thick and thin. While for embryonic technologies some exclusivity may be necessary
to induce development, it is precisely for these types
of technologies that the costs of strong exclusivity are
greatest.
To recap, in our case studies patents and exclusive licenses were unimportant for the transfer of the
inventions that were basically “ready to use” out of
the laboratory. In these cases, the fact that intellectual
property rights were held by the universities allowed
them to generate revenue, but did not help to bring
inventions to practice. On the other hand, intellectual
property rights and exclusivity did appear to be more
important for inducing ﬁrms to develop the “embryonic” inventions in our sample, though the dangers
of strong exclusivity were also revealed to be greatest
for these types of inventions.
66

4.

The Role of University
Technology Transfer Ofﬁces in
Bringing Inventions to Practice

What was the role of the university patenting and
licensing ofﬁce in technology transfer? As noted
above, in the Bayh-Dole hearings it was often suggested that there was a wide gulf between academia
and industry, and thus that ﬁnancial incentives were
needed to induce universities to advertise their inventions and communicate their economic potential.
While this characterization does adequately ﬁt several of the inventions we looked at, in a good number of these cases (Inventions A, C, E, F, G, H, and
I), strategically located people in industry were well
aware of the university research projects even before
the universities began to market the inventions. In
some of these cases (Inventions E, H, I), ﬁrms learned
of the inventions via interactions with the inventors
or their colleagues, while in the others they learned
of the inventions and their potential via membership
in broader scientiﬁc networks. It is interesting that in
the case where links between the academic community and industry were weakest (Invention D), there
has thus far been no sale.
But, in most of the cases here, the auspices of that
ofﬁce mostly were not needed to make contacts with
industry, to spread information, or to induce industry interest. On the other hand, in a number of our
cases the working out of the arrangements for licensing, and for industry funding of university research,
were quite complicated. The patent application process often was complex and time consuming. There
were difﬁcult questions involved in deﬁning and protecting the university’s interests in the transactions.
This is mostly where the university patenting and
licensing ofﬁce came in. One might note that, looked
at from this perspective, the value of these ofﬁces
to universities, and the costs of operating them, are
largely the result of university policies to take out,
enforce, and license patents on their inventions.
As we have emphasized above, however, ours is
a particular sample of inventions, and may not be
representative of university inventions as a whole.
Our main point is that industry actively monitors academic developments and has a range of links with the
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 6----->COLYVAS, CROW, GELIJNS, MAZZOLENI, NELSON, ROSENBERG, AND SAMPAT
How Do University Inventions Get Into Practice?

scientiﬁc community, and thus can learn of promising academic inventions via channels other than the
technology transfer ofﬁces. Though relatively recent
inventions are underrepresented in our sample, there
is no reason to believe that industry monitoring of
and interest in university inventions has decreased
over time.
The marketing activities of technology transfer
ofﬁces are likely to be most important for inventions that generate little industrial interest early on,
either because of lack of initial promise of the inventions or lack of well-established networks between
academia and industry in the relevant technological
ﬁelds. Determining the share of such inventions in all
academic inventions, and the degree to which these
inventions are eventually commercialized, is essential
to assessing the “marginal effect” of technology transfer ofﬁces in bringing inventions to practice, and thus
an important task for future research.

5.

Conclusions and Implications
for Future Research

Since the passage of the Bayh-Dole act in 1980, there
has been a dramatic increase in patenting and licensing by universities and an equally dramatic increase
in the number of universities with technology transfer ofﬁces that manage the patenting and licensing
of university inventions. Though each of these trends
actually pre-date 1980, Bayh-Dole, via endorsement
of the position that intellectual property rights and
university involvement in marketing inventions are
needed to facilitate the commercialization of federally
funded academic inventions, magniﬁed and accelerated them (Mowery et al. 2001). Yet Bayh-Dole was
passed based on little evidence for these positions,
and since then there has been little examination of the
degree to which intellectual property rights on university inventions and technology transfer ofﬁces do
indeed facilitate the commercialization of university
inventions.
This paper suggests that intellectual property rights
are likely to be most important for embryonic inventions, and unimportant for inventions that are useful to industry “off the shelf”. For the inventions in
our sample that were licensed nonexclusively, patents
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

allowed the universities to collect revenues, but did
nothing to facilitate technology transfer. In a recent
interview, the former director of Stanford’s technology transfer program suggested that this may be more
generally true, noting that a “nonexclusive licensing
program, at its heart, is really a tax    [b]ut it’s always
nice to say ‘technology transfer’ ” (Reimers 1998).
Another ﬁnding of this paper is that in the cases we
examined, while the ability to issue exclusive licenses
is most important in the context of embryonic inventions, the dangers of exclusivity are also greatest for
these types of inventions. The uncertainty surrounding how embryonic inventions might develop, not
only makes their development risky, but also makes it
difﬁcult to choose the “right” licensee ex ante. While
the Bayh-Dole debates recognized the ﬁrst of these
points, it neglected the second.
In any case, if intellectual property rights are important for the transfer for embryonic inventions, but
unimportant for others (and indeed may hinder the
transfer of others) one important task for future
research is to assess the relative shares of each of
these in all academic inventions. There has been surprisingly little research on this front. Though Jensen
and Thursby (2001) report that university technology managers say that most university inventions are
“proofs of concept” or “prototypes,” it is not clear
whether this maps immediately into the notion of
embryonic inventions that the proponents of BayhDole had in mind.2
Our second main observation based on the cases
is in some sense an obvious one: technology transfer ofﬁces’ marketing activities are most important for
inventions in technological areas where existing links
between academia and industry are weak. As noted
above, a better idea of the relative frequency of such
inventions is needed to assess how important technology transfer ofﬁces are to bringing university inventions into practice.
2

For example, Jensen and Thursby suggest that the Stanford University Cohen-Bayer technology was “embryonic” when licensed.
Certainly, while at the time of licensing there was considerable
uncertainty about what types of commercial products might result
from the process, the process itself was useful to industry almost
immediately. See Reimers (1998).

67

How Do University Inventions Get Into Practice?

In reﬂecting on these observations, we would like
to call attention again to the long history of American universities in developing technologies of great
use to industry and the public, and mostly not patenting these or formally marketing them. Regarding the
pathways for university–industry technology transfer,
there are reasons to doubt that patents and patent
licensing are any more necessary for effective transfer
today than in earlier years. A survey research study
done in the early 1990s (Cohen et al. 1998) inquired
of industry the most effective channels through which
ﬁrms beneﬁted from university research. In most
industries the most cited channels were publications,
open scientiﬁc communication more generally, and
consulting. In very few industries did licensing of
university patents come up as an important channel. The respondents of this recent survey would
not have been surprised by our ﬁndings drawn
from a more detailed set of observations, i.e. that
patenting and technology transfer ofﬁces are important for the transfer of only a subset of university
technologies.
Finally, it is important to note that enhancing
university revenues, which was not a central argument for the policies articulated in Bayh-Dole, now
clearly is an important objective of universities in
their patenting and licensing policies (Jensen and
Thursby 2001). There is no reason why this objective should mostly be at odds with achieving rapid
and widespread technology transfer, which was the
articulated purpose of Bayh-Dole. But there is no reason to believe, either, that policies that maximize a
university’s revenues are always aligned with those
that maximize technology transfer. The two universities involved in this study are aware of the potential
trade-offs and conﬂicts. But we think it is important
that the problem of objectives which in some cases
may be at odds with each other be more widely recognized. This also remains an important issue for future
qualitative and quantitative research.

Appendix: The Case Studies
Invention A

Invention A is a biotechnological process that is useful both as
a research tool (in academic and industrial labs) as well as for
producing commercially important proteins. The inventors ﬁrst
described this invention in the scientiﬁc literature in the late 1970s,
and the university ﬁled for patent protection on the process and
products resulting from it shortly thereafter. The ﬁrst of a series
of patents on this invention was granted in the early 1980s. Many
ﬁrms and academic researchers began to use the process soon after
it was published, before any patents had issued. In this case, members of the relevant scientiﬁc community apparently assimilated the
invention based on the original published account, and required no
assistance from the inventor or the university.
Given this, the university technology transfer ofﬁce’s licensing
strategy was essentially to identify ﬁrms using the process and
compel them to take out a license, threatening legal action if they
failed to do so. However, since a ﬁrm’s process technology is proprietary information, and as the proteins produced using Invention
A could also be made using other processes, it proved difﬁcult to
identify infringers. Accordingly, the university informed all possible users of the process that they must license the process if they
are using it, and offered licenses at relatively low royalty rates. Following this, some (though certainly not all) users of the process
licensed the invention. The invention was licensed nonexclusively,
and the number of licensees exceeded 30 by the mid-1990s. There
is no evidence that lack of an exclusive license precluded any ﬁrms
from adopting the invention.
Several of the licensees have produced important pharmaceutical products using the process. The university has earned signiﬁcant royalty income based on the sales of these products.

Invention B

Invention B is a “proof of concept,” namely that certain compounds
could be useful in treating a common eye disease. When the invention was developed, in the early 1980s, the inventor planned only
on publishing the results. However, upon learning of the university’s intellectual property policy, he reported the invention to the
university technology transfer ofﬁce, which ﬁled patent applications that eventually resulted in three patents.
Before the inventor’s work in this ﬁeld, the conventional wisdom was that these compounds had little therapeutic value in,
and indeed would be harmful to, the eye. Even after the inventor’s work, few scientists and ﬁrms were convinced that the concept, which had been demonstrated in the test tube and in animals,
would be useful for developing a treatment for humans. Reﬂecting
this, the university found it difﬁcult to ﬁnd a ﬁrm willing to license
the invention. Eventually, a colleague of the inventor convinced a
pharmaceutical ﬁrm to license the invention. However, given the

high costs of development and the uncertainty about the invention, the ﬁrm agreed to do so only if it was granted an exclusive
license.
Following the signing of the license agreement, the inventor
worked closely with the ﬁrm to develop the invention. In this case,
it appears that interaction between the licensee and inventor was
essential to facilitate technology transfer. The development process was proceeding smoothly, and moving towards human clinical trials. However, in the early 1990s, the inventor and university became concerned that while the licensee had done signiﬁcant work in understanding, developing, and testing certain ways
in which the compounds might be used to treat the eye disease,
it had neglected other avenues of exploration. Moreover, several
ﬁrms expressed interest in exploring these other directions, and
the university and inventor began to question its initial wisdom in
granting an exclusive license.
These tensions were temporarily quelled after the licensee’s
therapy based on the university invention earned FDA approval,
hit the market, and became an important source of revenues for
the ﬁrm and the university. Interestingly, the inventor remains
concerned that all of possible avenues for treatment were not
explored, and that the treatment is unnecessarily costly for
consumers.

Invention C

Invention C is also a “proof of concept,” in this case a concept useful in developing a treatment for individuals infected with HIV.
Speciﬁcally, based on their understanding of how the HIV virus
infects, the inventors developed a way to counteract the effects of
the virus. The invention was reported to the university technology transfer ofﬁce in the mid-1980s, which ﬁled applications that
eventually resulted in two patents shortly thereafter.
In the years before the university invention was developed,
many scientists and ﬁrms were actively doing research “in the area”
of the invention. However, Invention C was a major step forward,
and its initial disclosure (in a prestigious scientiﬁc journal, before
the patent applications had been ﬁled) created considerable excitement by ﬁrms and scientists about the possibilities for developing
HIV treatments based on it.
Reﬂecting this broad interest, many ﬁrms approached the university for a license even before the patent issued. The university
issued a “co-exclusive” license to four ﬁrms, i.e. each of the four
ﬁrms were granted a license with the provision that no licenses
beyond these four would be granted. Interestingly, one of the ﬁrms
that did not receive a license complained that “there are many variants and derivatives” of Invention C and “it is in the best interests of the public and (the university) for as many variations as
possible be tested, to maximize the probability that the best therapeutic agent will be found and that (the university) will receive
royalties.” However, the university maintained that allowing for
more licensees would blunt each individual licensees’ incentive to
develop and commercialize the invention, and thus that the coexclusive licenses were most appropriate.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

Despite this, many ﬁrms other than the licensees continued to
experiment with the concept. Indeed, the scientiﬁc journals frequently spoke of a “race” to develop drugs based on this idea,
whose participants included several research groups other than the
licensees. The “race” effectively ended in the early 1990s when
several scientists began to ﬁnd that despite the early enthusiasm,
the treatment did not work well in humans. In response to these
reports, several ﬁrms, including two of the licensees, signiﬁcantly
scaled back their research, and three of the four licenses were terminated by the mid-1990s. However, part of the knowledge gained
from the initial exploration, as well as continued additions to scientiﬁc understanding of HIV, helped a number of ﬁrms (including
the one remaining licensee and several ﬁrms that were not chosen as licensees) develop ideas for therapies that are based on but
fundamentally different from Invention C. In addition, despite its
apparent failure as a therapeutic, the idea in Invention C is now
widely used as a research tool (to isolate HIV) in various academic
and commercial settings.

Invention D

Invention D is a “proof of concept” demonstrating a process for
generating light of a particular wavelength. The discovery occurred
in the course of research sponsored by two federal agencies.
The inventors reported the invention to the technology transfer
ofﬁce in the early 1990s and urged the university to apply for
patent protection. A patent was issued about three years since the
disclosure.
The invention was a serendipitous discovery by a team of scientists conducting basic research in the ﬁeld of astrophysics. None of
the scientists had a prior interest in the development of industrial
products or processes based on the subject matter of the invention.
However, the unusual characteristics of the invention persuaded
the scientists of the potential commercial value of their discovery.
The university contacted potential licensees among ﬁrms with R&D
interests in the ﬁeld of lighting devices. At the same time, it also
urged the inventors to conduct additional tests and experiments to
establish more clearly the prospects for applying Invention D in the
ﬁeld of semiconductor photolithography.
After receiving a negative response from the few ﬁrms interviewed, the university licensed the patent to a technology brokerage ﬁrm. Drawing largely on a network of personal contacts
at international industrial laboratories, the brokerage ﬁrm interviewed a larger number of ﬁrms that could identify potential applications for the patented process. These attempts failed and the
license was terminated. During the late 1990s, another organization that specialized in the management of intellectual property
expressed an interest in the invention, but after conducting additional studies it decided not to take a license. This organization
argued that the technology had a small prospective market, especially because in important ﬁelds of application other technologies
appeared more promising.
It is worth noting that in the area of photolithography for semiconductor manufacturing, the development of new manufactur-

69

ing processes has relatively long lead times. Various consortia and
associations coordinate the technological efforts of the industry’s
participants by identifying the component technologies for successive generations of semiconductor products. At the time Invention
D was realized, the development efforts in the industrial community were already focusing on technologies that held greater
promise.

Invention E

This invention consists of a software tool used in electronic network
design. The development of the software program was carried out
by a graduate student and his supervisor during the early 1980s.
Since its ﬁrst embodiment, the software program has gone through
a number of product generations aimed at expanding its capabilities, at creating versions for different computer platforms, and at
simplifying its user-interface.
The inventors published a few papers in the scientiﬁc literature, describing the nature and capabilities of the software tool. In
the papers, the inventors offered copies of the program to interested readers for a minimal fee, essentially to cover material and
shipping costs. Because of the large number of requests received,
the inventors went on to arrange a start-up ﬁrm to organize the
commercialization of the software program. However, a few years
later the ﬁrm disbanded and arrangements were made for the technology transfer ofﬁce to take charge of the licensing effort. The
work performed by the university at this time was essentially to
manage the licensing and distribution of a software product that
users could adopt with minimal assistance from the inventors. During the late 1980s, work began on a second release of the program, and the technology transfer ofﬁce played a role in making
arrangements for preliminary testing at academic and industrial
sites.
Invention E was licensed widely among academic and industrial users and has generated revenues for the university. Much
of the development or follow-on work on new generations of the
product was carried out within the university, so that the nature
of the licensing activity is that typical of software products. A few
licensees, whose products consisted of suites of software programs,
expressed an interest in obtaining sublicensing rights on Invention E. In general, the university did not grant these rights although
it facilitated the creation of programming interfaces by vendors of
proprietary software packages. Only in one instance the university
agreed to give sublicensing rights for a limited geographic market.
This was part of an agreement with a ﬁrm to develop a graphical
user interface for Invention E. Before the commercialization began,
the agreement was revised and the university retained exclusive
rights to license the enhanced software program.

Invention F

This invention consists of a software-embedded technique for generating and processing geological information. The software program is based on a sequence of innovative techniques developed
over time whose goal is to improve the efﬁciency of oil exploration

70

and drilling. The university was granted several patents for these
techniques during the late 1980s and the ﬁrst half of the 1990s. In
turn, the software program was embedded in more complex software programs for managing oil reservoirs. These inventions collectively represent a signiﬁcant improvement over existing technologies and are diffusing among users, generating royalty revenues for
the university.
The research leading to Invention F began as a cooperative
research effort linking different academic and industrial organizations. The funding for this research came from different sources,
including industrial ﬁrms and federal sponsors. Industrial sponsorship was motivated by the relevance of the research for industry
practice and was never conditional on the promise of exclusive control on resulting intellectual property. Rather, the sponsors received
access to the scientiﬁc information in consideration for their funding. Federal funding of part of the research was also conditional on
outlining a process for technology transfer.
The technology transfer ofﬁce’s role was primarily focused on
the economic, organizational, and legal aspects of the transfer process. The lead inventor had strong connections with people in the
industry and the research goals were clearly aligned to the industry’s needs. After reporting the invention to the university, the lead
scientist played an important role in the technology transfer process. While Invention F is a software tool, its industrial application
required implementation and calibration work that users could not
be expected to undertake. The university followed the suggestion
of the lead inventor and a special ﬁrm was created to deal with
the technology transfer task. Noticeably, the university entered an
agreement to provide integration services to the ﬁrm at the same
time as it granted the latter an exclusive license on the relevant
patents. Within a short period of time, an industrial licensee was
identiﬁed. The industrial ﬁrm, the university, and the special ﬁrm
entered a complex agreement. The industrial partner received an
exclusive license on the patents underlying the software program
and funded additional development work to be performed at the
university-afﬁliated research organization. This development work
resulted in additional patented inventions, for which the university
granted exclusive licenses to the industrial sponsor from the earlier
contractual agreements. In addition, the special ﬁrm was engaged
by the licensee to undertake the marketing activities for the resulting software products.

Invention G

Invention G is a biotechnological process useful in producing proteins, and also as a research tool to understand fundamental biochemical processes and the structure of genes. It was developed
and reported in the scientiﬁc literature in the 1970s. Immediately,
many were aware of its research and commercial potential.
The university technology transfer ofﬁce learned of this invention not from the inventors, but rather via an article in the popular
press. While the ofﬁce was interested in patenting and licensing the
invention, at least one of the inventors was initially reluctant, arguing that because of its broad applicability it should be distributed

widely. The technology transfer ofﬁce was ultimately able to convince the inventors to patent the invention, and ﬁled for patents
on the process as well as resulting products. Three patents were
ultimately issued.
Firms and labs began using the invention even before the patent
was issued. The invention was licensed nonexclusively to many
ﬁrms, at low royalty rates. Nearly 500 ﬁrms have licensed the
inventions, developing thousands of products. The university has
reaped signiﬁcant royalty revenues based on sales of genetic products and end products developed using the process. The process
is also widely used in academia, and has been important to the
further advance of science.

Invention H

Invention H is a medical device that has the capacity to identify,
sort, and isolate populations of living cells. Like many medical
devices, the invention was the result of interdisciplinary research
during the 1960s and 1970s by biologists, engineers, and computer
scientists. The ﬁrst article announcing the invention was published
in a major scientiﬁc journal in 1969 and the laboratory where the
research was taking place subsequently received federal funding in
the form of a contract to develop two machines, one to remain at
the university and the other to be delivered to the funding agency.
The lab had developed a prototype machine that was usable (and
had been implemented at the university for research purposes), but
it was excessively large and had not been made with commercially
available components. Lacking the technical capacity to build the
machine in a way that would be affordable and useful in other
research settings, the inventor decided to ﬁnd a commercial partner to help fulﬁll the government contract and make the machine
more available.
The inventor approached the technology transfer ofﬁce to patent
the invention with the understanding, based on his interactions
with potential commercial partners, that absent a patent and exclusive license, no ﬁrm would be willing to invest the signiﬁcant
resources needed to develop the machine. A patent was issued, and
exclusively licensed to one ﬁrm.
The inventor and his lab had signiﬁcant interaction with the
ﬁrm in developing the invention. The inventor was a consultant
to the ﬁrm, and members of his lab were the primary users of the
earliest generation devices developed by the ﬁrm, identifying problems and paths of potential improvement. In addition to selling
the device, the licensee has sublicensed the patented technology
to other ﬁrms, who have made alternative devices addressing a
broader spectrum of clinical and research needs.
The university has earned signiﬁcant royalties based on the
sales of the device and on the sales of reagents developed for use
with the device. The device also continues to be used widely by
researchers for the study of cells, and by clinicians for counting
cells for diagnostic purposes.

Invention I

Invention I is an improved detector for computed tomography
(CT) scanners, that increases imaging efﬁciency. The invention was

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

developed in the late 1960s by a physicist working as part of a collaborative multidisciplinary team developing a machine to administer radiation treatment of cancer. In developing the latter, the
team of researchers sought to solve the problem of adequate threedimensional imaging to best deliver this novel type of radiation
treatment. This requirement led the team to do the research and
development work which resulted in Invention I.
Following other advances in CT scanner technology in the early
1970s, commercial interest in the ﬁeld grew. Interest in Invention I
increased dramatically after the inventor described it at a scientiﬁc
conference, attended by a number of leading ﬁrms, in the mid1970s.
Importantly, the inventor and his colleagues had signiﬁcant
interaction with industry even before the development of this
invention. When one of the ﬁrms the inventor consulted suggested
he patent the invention, he approached the technology transfer
ofﬁce, which ﬁled for a patent that was issued in the late 1970s.
The invention required some, but not much, additional development before it was usable in CT scanners. Other ﬁrms had
expressed interest in developing and marketing the technology
even before the patent had issued, but they ultimately dropped
out of the CT scanner business. A leading ﬁrm in the industry
approached the university shortly after the patents were issued,
and negotiated an exclusive license. The licensee bundled this
invention together with numerous other patents covering aspects
of the CT scanner (many of which it held, some of which it licensed
from others) and sublicensed the package to other ﬁrms in the
industry. One rationale for such a license was that the licensee ﬁrm,
by virtue of its ﬁnancial resources and its claim to complementary
patents, would be in a better position to prevent infringement and
promote licensing than the university.
The technology was widely used, and indeed remained the standard for much longer than the inventor or licensee had originally
expected. The university earned signiﬁcant royalty revenues from
the invention, most of it based on the sublicenses.

Invention J

Invention J is a receptor that mediates the damage to blood vessels
caused by high glucose in the blood. It is a tricky receptor in that
it has so-called low afﬁnity binding properties; this means that it is
complex (a) to identify ligands for the receptor (i.e., mediators of
destruction that bind to the receptor), and (b) to develop assays for
measuring the receptor’s activity. The university research to discover the receptor was funded by a large pharmaceutical company,
and the NIH supported the subsequent research to delineate its
biological activity and to document its potential role as a therapeutic. Administering the soluble receptor was found to eliminate the
vascular complications of diabetes in numerous animal models. In
addition, other possible uses of the receptor have been discovered,
including a possible role in the treatment of cancer.
The pharmaceutical company that funded the research decided
that the receptor itself should be placed in the public domain. However, the university did take out intellectual property on the ligands and assays to measure the receptor’s activity. This intellectual

71

<-----Page 11----->COLYVAS, CROW, GELIJNS, MAZZOLENI, NELSON, ROSENBERG, AND SAMPAT

property has been licensed exclusively to a start-up company to
develop drugs that block the receptor or to develop biological
products that bind the ligands (mediators) in the same manner.
Drug targets include the treatment of diabetes, inﬂammatory disorders, and tumors.

Invention K

Invention K is a modiﬁed blood clotting factor. This compound
has been placed in the public domain. The university investigators
discovered its potential role in coronary bypass surgery, where a
patient is placed on extracorporeal circulation and needs to take
drugs to prevent blood clotting (i.e. anticoagulants). Although there
are many anticoagulants on the market today, they are not site speciﬁc, and thus deter coagulation or healing of the surgical wound.
A more selective anticoagulant would enable surgeons to operate in
an area free of coagulation, while still allowing for the healing of the
wound. Columbia University faculty applied for a patent on the use
of the compound to prevent blood clotting during coronary bypass
surgery, hemodyalisis, and several other surgical procedures.
The university initially had research agreements with several
pharmaceutical companies to elucidate the structure of the binding site and its biological activity. Then it entered an exclusive
licensing agreement with a biotechnology company, with interest
in cardiopulmonary bypass and coagulation. The process of producing the modiﬁed blood factor was too expensive, the company
retracted, and the license was cancelled. Currently, a license is being
negotiated with a start-up to develop small-molecule drugs.
