An earlier article' 'examinedalternative approaches to the
problem of investment decision under uncertainty. It was shown
there that the various formulationsdiffer essentially in specifying
the objects of choice (commodities). Two such specificationswere
reviewed in detail: (1) The mean, variability approach-this reduces the assets or securities traded in the market to underlying
objects of choice in the form of mean-returnand variability-ofreturnmeasureswhich, it is alleged, enter into investors'preference
functions.2 (2) The state-preference (or, more fully, time-statepreference) approach-which resolves the assets or securities into
distributionsof dated contingentclaims to income defined over the
set of all possible "states of the world."3
The predecessorarticle showed that the more familiar mean,
variability formulationhas never been completedso as to constitute
an acceptable choice-theoreticstructure. If mean-returnand variability-of-return are to be regarded as commodities,the analysis
must go beyond the individual level of decision to show how the
relative "prices" for mean-return and variability-of-return are
determinedin the market. There seem to be rather considerable
difficultiesfacing theorists who attempt to fulfill this program.4In
contrast,the state-preferenceapproachwas demonstratedto be the

natural generalizationof Fisher's theory of intertemporalchoice,5
into the domain of uncertainty. Where Fisher's objects of choice
are titles to consumptionas of differing dates, the generalization
takes the fundamentalcommodities,underlying all market assets,
to be contingenttime-state claims- titles to consumptionfor specified dates and states of the world. While variousassets may package
these underlyingclaimsinto moreor less complexbundles,the "market-clearing"or "conservation"equations determineprices for the
elementarytime-state claims to which asset prices must conform.
The idealizing assumptions, necessary for this formal theoretical
structureto hold, are in some respects akin to those of standard
theory in requiringa kind of precisionof knowledgeor belief as to
preferencesand opportunitiesthat is only very approximatelytrue
of the real world. Thus, the theory that results containsuncertainty,
imperfectknowledgeas to the state of the world that will actually
obtain in the future, but does not contain the "vagueness"we
usually find psychologicallyassociated with uncertainty.
The present article is devoted to an examinationof some implications and applications of the time-state-preferenceapproach,
that reveal its power by casting light upon a numberof unresolved
controversies. These include: (1) the nature and extent of risk
aversion; (2) whether there is an optimal "debt-equity mix" in
financingcorporateundertakings(the Modigliani-Millerproblem);
and (3) the "appropriate"rate of discountto employ in cost-benefit
calculationsfor governmentinvestmentsnot subject to the market
test.
In the very simplest illustration of time-state-preference,there
is one commodity ("corn"),only one possible currentstate (i.e., the
present is certain), and just two possible and mutually exclusive
future states. The objects of choicethen can be symbolized: co, cl,
clb - presenttitles to consumptionof, respectively,currentor time-O
corn,corn at time-1 providedthat state a obtains, and corn at time1 providedthat state b obtains. Each individualhas an endowment
of such claims, has preferencerelations orderingthe combinations
he couldpossibly hold,6and has certainopportunitiesfor transforming his endowedbundle into alternative combinations.The possible
transformationscan take the form of market trading ("financial
opportunities")or else of physical conversions("productiveoppor5. Irving Fisher, The Theory of Interest (New York: Macmillan, 1930;

In this section we restrict ourselves to synchronous choice among
claims to consumption in alternative future states; i.e., we are isolating the problem of risky choice from the problem of time choice.
Under these circumstances the individual's situation may be portrayed as in Figure I, which shows an indifference map and financial

or market opportunities for converting endowment Y into alternative combinations of c1i, and clb. The assumption here is that the
state probabilities 7ra = 7rb = 1/2. The wealth constraint upon the
market opportunities can be written W = POcO+ P1aC1a + P1blb,
where PO, P1i, and Plb are the prices of the respective time-state
claims, with co here taken to be a constant holding of current corn.
The wealth is in turn fixed by the value of the endowment: W = Poyo

Cia = Cib.

The convexity of the indifferencecurves betweenthe commodities cla and c1b, which correspondsto one concept of risk aversion,
may be justified by appeal to the general principle of diminishing
marginalrate of substitutionthat holds for ordinary commodities.
A more convincing defense, perhaps, is the observation of "nonspecialization"- that individualsalmostuniversallypreferto hedge
against many contingenciesrather than place all their bets on one.
It is of interestto relate this formulationto the Neumann-Morgenstern utility-of-income function v (cl) that permits use of the expected-utility theoremin rationalizingrisky choice. It was shown
in the predecessorarticle that a concave v (cl) function, as plotted
in FigureII ("diminishingmarginalutility of consumptionincome")
is equivalentto a convex indifferencemap as in Figure I. In addition, the rather strong theoremwas obtainedthat under these conUTILITY

ditions, if the probabilityratio for the two states 7rb/7ra is equal to
the price ratio Plb/Pla, the individual's optimum must be on the
certaintyline. This is completelyconsistentwith the Friedman-Savage formulation in terms of the Neumann-Morgensternfunction,
which underthe same conditionsleads to the conclusionsthat a fair
gamblewouldnot be acceptedand that the individualwould be willing to insureat fair odds.8
However,one observesin the world instances of risk-preferring
behavior. Some gamblesare acceptedat fair, or even adverse odds.
We will be consideringin this section alternative explanationsfor
this phenomenon. First, however,it is necessaryto clarify one point
on which error is often committed. Whether a particular contract
is a gamble-i.e., an arrangementmoving the individual farther
from the

450

certainty line -

or a particular asset a risky one de-

pends not uponthe termsof the contractor the natureof the asset in
isolation but upon the individual'stotal portfolio and endowedposition. While commonstocks are often regardedas riskierthan bonds,
their purchase may stabilize an overall portfolio with respect to
the hazard of inflation;i.e., may move an investor closer to the 450
line. Similarly,for some individualsa futures contractmay be very
risky, but for a hedgerthe same contractis "insurance"ratherthan
a gamble. The hedger,of course,is someonewho starts with a risky
endowment- i.e., he has an unbalancedendowedstate-distribution
of income- and a contractwith an offsettinglyuneven state-distribution of returnservesto bringhim nearerthe certaintyline.
The predecessorarticle also showedthat it was possible, by relaxing the assumptionof uniquenessof the Neumann-Morgenstern
v (c1) function,to combineconvex indifferencecurveswith solutions
at fair odds that are off the 450 line (see Figure III). The assumption of a single v (c1) functionimplies a symmetryas to state preferences such that

marginal incomes,

at any given level of income, are valued equivalently in all states.
But since the definitionof a state of the worldincorporatesa description of an entire world-environment,there may well be "nonpecuniary" aspects of the respective situations that would warrant biasing the pecuniary-wealthpositionat fair odds. There would then be
a differentv(cl) function for each state, as portrayed for the twostate situation in Figure IV, wherethe functionsva(ciaf)and Vb (Cib)
are defined so as to continue permitting the use of the expectedutility theoremto rationalizeuncertainchoice. This relaxationleads
to the conclusionthat basically conservativebehavioris still consis8. Ibid., pp. 73-77.

tent with a certain amount of seeming risk preference- the risk
preferencebeing a kind of illusion due to looking only at the pecuniary income distribution. Still, this explanationhardly accountsfor
what we observeat Las Vegas, though it may tell us why bachelors
commonlydo not buy life insurance.9
A differentexplanationfor the observedmixture of risk-avoiding and risk-preferringbehaviorhas been offeredby Friedmanand
Savage. They argue that in economicactivities such as choices of
occupation,business undertakings,and purchasesof securities and
real property, people generally prefer both low-risk and high-risk
activities to moderate-riskactivities. This is, assertedly, evidenced
by relatively low realized average return (after allowance for unsuccessful as well as successful outcomes) on the former categories
9. While a responsible family man in his current decisions will attach
considerable significance to income for his beneficiaries contingent upon his
own death, a bachelor with only remote heirs has very asymmetrical statepreferences with respect to income accruing to him under the contingencies
"Alive" or "Dead."

as comparedwith the latter.' To explainthis, and certain other observedbehaviorpatterns- of which the most significantis the simultaneous purchaseof insuranceand lottery tickets by low-income
individuals- Friedman and Savage construct a Neumann-Morgensternutility-of-incomefunction of the special shape2 illustrated
in Figure V.
This doubly-inflectedcurve has a concave segment at the lowincome end, a convex segment for middle incomes, and finally another concave segment at the high-incomeend. For a lottery with
only two outcomes, the relative desirability of taking or refusing
the lottery is found by comparingthe height along the straight line
connectingthe utilities of the outcomes (i.e., the expectedutility of
the lottery) with the heightof the corresponding
point alongthe doubly-inflected curve- the utility of the certain income alternative.
If the lottery is fair, the correspondingpoints are vertically aligned.3

the expected-utility principle for risky outcomes.

The followingmay then be inferred: (1) For individualsin the middle convex segment, small-scale fair lotteries at roughly even odds
(e.g., bets on heads in tosses of a coin) are preferredto certainties,
becomeincreasinglydesirableas the scale of the lottery increasesup
to a point, after which as scale increasesfurtherthe lotteries become
decreasingly desirable. (2) Low-income individuals, especially if
they are towardthe upperend of the initial concavesegment,would
be inclinedto buy fair "long-shot"lotteries, giving them at low cost
a small chance at a relatively big prize. On the other hand, if they
find themselves subject to a hazard threatening (though with low
probability) a relatively large loss, they will be inclinedto escape it
by purchasinginsuranceat fair odds. (3) High-incomeindividuals,
especially if toward the lower end of their concave segment,will be
inclined to bet heavily at fair odds on "short shots" (strong favorites, offeringa large chance of a small gain and a small chance of
a great loss) and, what amountsto the same thing, they will be inclined to avoid purchasinginsurance.
Followingthe lead of Friedmanand Savage, testable inferences
can be derivedif we interpretthe three segmentsas correspondingat
least roughlyto three income classes. The behaviorimplied for the

<-----Page 9----->260

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

low-incomeclass (most particularly,as we have noted, for the upper
end of the low-incomesegment) is to some extent verified by common observation:many poor people place long-shotbets, and many
purchaseinsuranceto protect their modest sources of wealth. Actually, the data cited by Friedman-Savage4indicate that poorer
peoplebuy proportionatelyless insurancethan other incomegroups;
furthermore,the fraction of families purchasinginsuranceseems to
rise smoothly with income. There is thus no indication of a riskpreferringmiddle segment. This evidence does not, therefore,support their position as against the alternative hypothesis of general
risk aversion. The smallerpurchasesby poorerpeoplemay, perhaps,
be explainedaway as due to relatively heavier transactionscosts on
smaller policies (leading to adverse "loading"of rates) or to possession of fewer insurableassets in proportionto income.
The behavior implied by the Friedman-Savagehypothesis for
the upper-incomegroupseems somewhatstrange. Do we really see
rich people failing to insure their major sources of wealth - or,
correspondingly,do we commonly observe them hazarding major
sums on short-oddsbets? 6 A possibledefensehere wouldbe to bring
in the asymmetricalincome-taxtreatmentof gamblingand casualty
gains and losses, and the favorabletreatment of insurancereserves
-all of which combineto induce rich people to insure more and to
gambleless than they otherwisewould. On the other hand, it seems
doubtfulwhetherconservativebehaviorin these respectswas really
uncharacteristicof rich people even beforethe income tax.
But the crucialfailure of the Friedman-Savagemodel lies in its
implied behavior for the middle classes. This group, if they behaved as pictured, would be plungers of an extreme sort. They
would stand ready, at any moment,to accept at fair odds a gamble
of such a scale as to thrust them out of the convex segmentand into
(dependingon the outcome) the poor-man or rich-man class. In
addition, as we have remarked,it is the individual at the upper end
4. Ibid., pp. 66 f.
5. Rich people would, on any risk-preference assumption, tend to selfinsure (to save the transactions cost) against hazards threatening losses involving only minor fractions of their wealth. Thus we would expect to see
them often foregoing the purchase of automobile collision insurance. But the
Friedman-Savage assertion implies that they would omit insuring against
potentially great losses such as those associated with accident liability claims,
and physical disability or death of the main income-earner. Again their own
evidence does not support Friedman and Savage here.
6. Occasional racetrack betting on favorites, so long as the scale is minor,
means little here. The main point of the Friedman-Savage assumption is that
the rich man is willing, at fair odds, to accept a hazard that (if it eventuated)
would thrust him entirely out of the concave segment -out of the rich-man
class! This requires betting on a scale considered pathological in our culture
(see Dostoyevsky, The Gambler).

<-----Page 10----->INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY

of the low-income segment who is most inclined to take longshot bets, and the individual at the lower end of the high-income
segment who is most inclined to take short-odds bets. Thus, the
model would have us believe, the solid risk-avoidersof our society
are only the poorerpoor, and the richer rich. Aside from the notoriouslack of direct confirmationof these assertions,it is of interest
to note how they conflictwith observedstability patternsof the various income classes. With behavioras postulated,the middle ranks
of incomeswould be rapidly depopulated,the end result being a Ushapeddistributionpiled up at the extremes. Needless to say, this is
not observed.
There is one important observationthat should be considered
part of the behavior that needs explainingin constructinga riskpreferencemodel (utility-of-incomefunction): Gamblingon a scale
at all likely to impoverish is rarely observed in middle- and upper-

income groups. One way to reconcile this observation with the
Friedman-Savagemodel would be to shrinkthe middle convex segment to a narrowrange.7 To do this is, however,to lose the main
point of the Friedman-Savageargument,since then risk aversion
wouldbe the predominantbehaviorpatternafter all.8 And the problem remains of combiningthe risk aversion necessary for observed
diversificationof assets and purchaseof insurancewith the existence
of at least a modest amountof gamblingat all incomelevels.9
An easy way out of the difficultylies in recognizingthat many
people take pleasure in gambling per se (i.e., as a consumption
good). A modest amountof pleasure-orientedgamblingwould then
not be inconsistentwith risk aversion (a concave utility-of-income
function) for serious wealth-orientedactivities.' To make this distinction workable,however,it must be possible to distinguishobservationally betweenpleasure-orientedand wealth-orientedgambling,
the latter being defined as a deliberate attempt to change wealth
7. At one point (op. cit., p. 92) Friedman and Savage do suggest that
relatively few individuals are in the middle segment.
8. Substantial numbers of individuals in the middle segment are necessary to explain the alleged observation of preference for low-risk or high-risk
as against moderate-risk economic activities.
9. One possible way out would be to assert that the middle segment is
small and, in addition, slides up and down as the individual's income level
changes-see H. Markowitz "The Utility of Wealth," Journal of Political
Economy, LX (April 1952)-so that he is always willing to undertake a small
amount of gambling from his present income level. As in the case of Ptolemy's
geocentric system, when it becomes necessary to incorporate such ad hoc
"epicycles" to save the phenomena, it is time for a new conception.
1. The following may perhaps be an illuminating analogy. Men like to
live in houses on solid foundations, with square corners, and level floors. And
yet they may pay money to spend a few minutes at an amusement park in a
"crazy-house"with quite the reverse characteristics.

status. Fortunately, the two motives for gambling are observably
distinct, becausethey imply radically differentwageringprocedures.
If gambling is wealth-oriented,it will take the form of hazarding
great sums (proportionateto one's endowment and hopes) on a
single turn of a wheel or flip of a coin. Repetitive gamblingat relatively small stakes would be absurd: the law of large numbers
shrinks the variance of the overall outcome, whereas wealthorientedgamblersare trying to achieve large changes. While repetitive small-stake gambling does not quite guarantee a final result
near the mean, the likelihoodof such outcomesis greatly increased;
in any case, the averagetime requiredto win the desiredsum (or lose
the fortune hazarded) will be enormouslyextended. What we observe at Las Vegas is, of course, very much the repetitive, smallstake pattern. The combinationof adverse odds and limited stakes
assures a high probability that the final outcome for the gambler
will be a modest loss - the price paid for the pleasure of gambling.
All this is not to say that we never observe wealth-orientedgambling, but rather that it is not a sufficientlyimportantphenomenon
to dictate the main lines of our theory of risk.2
On our hypothesis,therefore,we expectto see risk aversionpredominating in wealth-oriented activities at all income levels thus explainingpurchaseof insuranceall along the wealth scale. We
also expect to see a moderateamountof pleasure-orientedgambling,
again all along the wealth scale. Wealth-orientedgamblingwill not
be a very importantphenomenon,but such as exists would be concentratedamongthe poor.3 This is in sharp contrastwith the view
of Friedman and Savage, whose theory indicates that wealthorientedgamblingwill be very significant,and concentratedamong
2. Some wealth-oriented gambling is based on "hunches" or "inside information" that, if true, would make the bet a lottery at favorable odds rather
than the adverse gamble it appears -to others! Of course, given the belief
in favorable odds, even a risk-avoider might gamble. There is also strictly
rational wealth-oriented gambling, as in the classic case of the embezzler who
plunges his remaining cash in the hope of being able to straighten out his accounts prior to an audit. Here the dollar in hand that the gambler risks is
almost costless, as he cannot hope to salvage much of his illegal taking by
conservative behavior. A somewhat similar argument may partially explain
lower-class gambling: the floor on consumption provided by public-assistance
payments -where such payments are liable to be withheld or reduced if the
would-be gambler conserved his assets-permits the individual to gamble
with dollars that do not fully represent sacrifices of consumption to him.
Finally, there is the gambling behavior that would generally be regarded as
pathological; this would be associated with subnormal or aberrant mental
conditions.
3. See footnote above concerning the effect of relief payments (consumption floor) upon the propensity to gamble. Also, ill-informed believers
in hunches, and subnormal or aberrant mental types, will tend to have low income status.

<-----Page 12----->INVESTMENTDECISIONUNDER UNCERTAINTY

263

the middle classes. We, on the contrary,would expect to find the
middle classes to be the most insurance-minded. Insurance purchases by the poor would be deterredby the substantially higher
transactionscost on the one hand, and the relief floor on the other.
As for the rich, they are likely to possess a sufficientdiversity of
assets as to make self-insurancefeasible (this considerationbeing
counterbalancedsomewhatby tax advantages where life insurance
is concerned).
Leaving the sphere of gambling versus insurance, the most
significantclass of economicactivity, in terms of implicationsfor attitudes toward risk, is choice of occupation. Except in the very
highest income brackets,this decision determinesthe nature of the
major source of wealth. In addition, it is difficultto insure or diversify against certain hazardsassociatedwith occupationalchoice,
such as cyclical unemployment and technological obsolescence.
Insurance is available against physical hazards- but there will
typically be penalty rates to pay for life or disability insurancein
dangerousoccupations. Consequently,on our hypothesis we would
expect to observe relatively low returns in occupations that are
highly secure in almost all respects,like teaching and civil service.
In hazardous occupations such as mining, and insecure activities
such as business entrepreneurship,we would expect higher average
returns- even after allowing for injuries and failures. Unfortunately, the evidence available is difficultto interpret because of
differencesin personalqualities of individuals,nonpecuniaryreturns
and differencesof tastes with respectto them, tax and relief effects,
and numerousdifficultieswith the data.4
The evidence on return to property in relation to risk is fortunately somewhat clearer. We must be careful to recollect here,
however, that the "riskiness" (imbalance in the state-distribution
of income) relevant for decisionsis not that of particular assets in
isolation. It is the variability of the state-distributionof consumption possibilitiesyielded by overall portfoliosthat is relevant. For
some classes of assets (securities,in particular) it is relatively easy
to obtain considerable diversification while holding individually
4. Friedman and Savage allege (op. cit., pp. 63-66) that higher returns
are received on (reflecting aversion to) moderate risks-and that the average
returns to high-risk activities like auto-racing, piloting aircraft, business undertakings in untried fields, and the professions of law and medicine (?) are so
low as to evidence an inclination in favor of bearing extreme risks. The
evidence presented for these assertions is weak, to say the least. The following will illustrate one of the many problems of interpreting such data as
exist: for high-risk occupations there is likely to be a selection bias (since
those who overestimate the chance of success are more likely to enter) so
that adverse average results are not necessarily evidence of risk preference.

<-----Page 13----->264

risky assets. The main problemis posed by the overall swingsof the
businesscycle, which limit the variance-minimizingeffect of diversification by imposinghigh correlationamongsecurity returns- and,
probably even more important, high correlation between overall
property income and overall wage or other personal income. Consequently, and especially because of the intrinsically risky situation involved in occupational choice, the risk-aversion hypothesis
would predict relatively high average return on procyclical securities and relatively low on stable or anticyclical securities. This is
borne out by the historically realized yields on equities (highly
procyclical in real terms).5 Comparisonof the cyclically unstable
"industrial"equities with the more stable "utility" equities provides another confirmation.6
Thus, a combinationof a risk-aversion hypothesis for wealthoriented activities with recognition that, for many individuals,
repetitive small-stake gambling (i.e., gambling guaranteed not to
drastically transform the wealth level) is a pleasurable activity,
serves to explainthe available evidence. In contrast,the attempt to
explainboth insuranceand gamblingas reflectinga single utility-ofincomefunctionof peculiarshape leads to contradictions- in which
the supposed risk-preferringgroup is first large and then small,
first a stable and then a disappearing element, etc. -and is in
conflict with more direct knowledge about the risk-seeking propensities of the various income groups.
II.

OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE

The analysis of risky investment decision in terms of state
preferencesmay be applied in the area of corporatefinance to the
controversial "Proposition I" of Modigliani and Miller: "The
market value of any firm is independentof its capital structure
and is given by capitalizing its expected return at the rate pk appropriateto its class."7 Ourmain concernhere will be with the first
part of the proposition,the assertionthat market value is independent of capital structure. Symbolically, the contention is that
Do + Eo = Vo = X/Pk, a constant -where

Do is present (or mar-

ket) value of the debt,E0 the value of the equity, Vois the assertedly
constant value of the firm, and X is the firm's given operatingincome. The languagein the secondpart of the proposition,and elsewhere in their paper, indicate that Modigliani and Miller were employing a mean, variability approachto risk-bearing.8
In the predecessorto this article,Fisher'sanalysis of individuals'
investment decisionsunder certainty was generalizedto include investment decisions of firms. The result was obtained, in equation
(6"'), that the market value (wealth) of the firm under certainty
equals the present value of debt repaymentsplus (if the firm has
productive opportunitiesthat lead to an increase of wealth) the
present value of any equity increment. This looks very much like
the Modigliani-Millertheorem. In fact, it is easy to extend this
result, via a state-preferenceanalysis, to decisions under uncertainty so as to validate the Modigliani-Millertheorem. The extension is based on the premisethat individuals and firms form a
closed system, so that all assets or claims must be held by, and
only by, individualsor firms. Furthermore,looking at the situation
ex post of the productiondecisions (i.e., after commitmentof funds
to investment), the social totals of each time-state class of assets
must then be constant. What this rules out are "external drains"
of which the most crucial are personal and corporatetaxes. Bankruptcy penalties, transactions and underwriting costs, etc., must
also be excluded.
Continuingto employ our simplifying assumptionof only two
time-periods (times 0 and 1), with only one present state but two
future states (a and b), we first develop equations for the firm's
capital input and the distributionof returns.
(1)

-qo = do + eo

Capital input balance

Here qo is the total of corporatefunds committedto investment at
time 0; do is the portion coming from borrowings,and eo the portion from equity funds.9 (In the predecessorarticle we assumed
eo= 0, all-debt financing being possible under certainty.)
8. In their paper the assumption is made throughout that the expected
yield on equities exceeds the yield on riskless bonds; they associate the premium with "financialrisk" due at least in part to variance of outcome (p. 271).
Modigliani and Miller claim that their propositions do not depend upon any
assumption about individual risk preferences (p. 279); this statement is
correct on the level of the individual (who can maximize asset value regardless of personal risk preferences), but on the market level the existence of a
premium reflects the need on balance for compensation to induce bearing of
variability risk.
9. It is assumed that the firm does not consume and has null endowment. Hence all funds for investment must be obtained from outside, and also
the firm has no use for funds except to invest them. While actual firms do

Equations (2) say that all gross asset earnings,in either state, are
fully distributed and that the only recipients are the debt and
equity owners. Here dia is the gross returnto debtholdersif state a
obtains; the other claims are defined correspondingly.If the debt
is riskless, dia = dib = do (1 + r*), where r* is the promised

interest rate on the bond. If the debt is risky so that in state b, let
us say, dib < do (1 + r*) then elb= 0-

since the debt is a senior

claim that must be paid first before equity receives any return.
We have herethreetypes of futuretime-state claims: (physical)
asset claims (qla and qfb), debt claims (dia and dib) and equity
claims (eia and eib). Under the single-price law of markets, unit
claims to the same commoditymust sell at the same price. Hence,
unless there are differentiationsdue to such features as tax status
(excludedby our assumptionabove), the single pricePia must apply
to qia, dia, and eia -and
correspondingly Plb is the price of qib,
dib, and e1b. Taking co as numeraireso that Po = 1, the prices for

the future claims can be written in the form Pia = 1/(1 + ria) and
= 1/(1 + rib), where ria and rib are the "time-and-risk"discountrates for contingentfutureincomes. There is a possiblesource
of confusion here: it might be thought that the equity claim elb
is "riskier"than the debt claim dib, for example,and so should sell
at a lower price. But risk has already been taken account of in the
quantification of dib and elb- in the example given just above, if
state b obtains so that dib is less than do(1 + r*), then the junior
claim elb = 0. Conditionally upon the occurrenceof the specified
state, the various claims all become certainties.i
If we define present values of the firm, of the debt, and of the
equity returnin the naturalway for this problem (ex post of the investment decision),2 we obtain:

Here again there is a possible source of confusion,in that it might

1. Modigliani and Miller describe an "arbitrage"process which has the
effect of enforcing this single-price law (pp. 69-71). While their argument has
been the subject of controversy, it seems unexceptionable under the provisos
of the model here discussed- in particular, under the assumption that the
several types of claim do not diverge in tax status.

seem plausible that the relative constancy of the d's as compared
with the e's would be reflectedby a kind of premiumin the value
Do as comparedwith Eo, given predominantrisk aversion. But since
each formof security is only a package of elementaryclaimsto contingent incomes,market equilibriumrequiresthat the value of the
package equal the sum of the values of the components.3
The Modigliani-MillerTheoremfollows immediately from (2)
and (3):
Vo = Do+Eo.
(4)
Ourformulationmakes it possibleto observethat the propositionin
questionis a special case of a Fisheriantheorem. Financing operations (i.e., market conversionsamong claims to income) take place
within a wealth constraint-they do not change wealth. In the
familiar Fisherian analysis of choices involving time, the market
value of the productivesolution determineswealth; borrowingand
lending can then take place to achieve a different distribution of
timed income claims, but all such transformationsleave wealth unchanged. In the model considered here, the productive solution
determineswealth by the conditionVO= X/pk; financingvia alternative debt-equity ratios then representdifferentpossible ways of
distributingthis wealth over time-state claims. But all the attainable distributionshave the same wealth-value.
We may now examine further the significance of the "closed
system" or "no external drains"proviso stated earlier. Let us suppose that there is no corporatetax, but that equity claims are given
preferential treatment with respect to the external drain of the
personalincometax on the system composedof the individualsand
firms.4This factor, other things equal, would raise the price (lower
the discountingrate) of an equity claim relative to a debt claimand also relative to asset claims assumingthese latter have to be
financed by mixes of debt and equity. Then the single-price law,
for claims conditionedon a given state, could not be applied, and
3. Consider the following analogy. Bread and butter are complements
for most people, and possibly substitutes for some careful calorie-watchersbut, regardless, a package of bread and butter in competitive equilibrium
must sell for the sum of the bread price and the butter price. Any divergence
could only be due to a possible saving of transactions cost, but such costs are
a form of "external drain" assumed away in our model. (The assumption of
competitive conditions also rules out "tie-in sales" as a device for capitalizing
on monopoly power.)
4. The capital gains feature applies to both debt and equity securities,
though in practice equity benefits more. The unique advantage to equity is
the opportunity to reinvest via "retained earnings," escaping personal tax in
the process. (In our analysis, the "retention" is a mere fiction- which is not
the whole story, of course.)

equations (3) and (4) would not hold. Alternatively,if we ignored
the personal income tax but assumed the existence of an external
drain on the corporationin the form of a corporate income tax,
equations (2) would be modifiedso as to become (tie and tlb indicating conditionaltax liabilities):

Equations (2') indicate that there is an opportunity to increase
wealth by tax-minimizingdevices. Under the corporateincometax,
debt and equity earningsare differentiallytreated; tax liability can
be reducedby a high debt/equity fraction. The sum dl, + eie then,
for example, would not be a constant independentof the ratio of
the two - so that even though the prices (or discountingrates) for
asset, debt, and (after-tax) equity earnings are identical, equation
(4) would not follow.
We may concludethis section by noting that we have gone only
a small step toward solving the problemof optimal capital structure
in terms of a state-preferenceanalysis. Doing so would require an
integrationof the personal-tax and corporate-taxeffects, and consideration of other factors (such as the magnitude of bankruptcy
penalties) to yield the optimalbalanceof debt and equity financing.5
The limited purposehere was only to illustrate the use of a statepreferenceanalysis in order to suggest the range of applicability
and the crucial limitations of the much debated Modigliani-Miller
"PropositionI."
III. UNCERTAINTY
ANDTHEDIsCOUNT
RATEFORPUBLICINVESTMENT

The final applicationto be presentedhere of the model of timestate-preference concerns the much controverted question: What
is the "appropriate" discount rate, for use under uncertainty, in
present-worth calculations evaluating government investments not
subject to the market test? Many conflicting recommendations
have been expressed on this question, but only two of these will be
examined here for consistency with Pareto efficiency in an uncertain
world.6 Of these, the first prescribes that the government employ as
5. For a more complete analysis see J. Lintner, "Dividends, Earnings,
Leverage, Stock Prices and the Supply of Capital to Corporations,"Review of
Economics and Statistics, XLIV (Aug. 1962). The result here differs from
Lintner's in showing that uncertainty alone is not sufficient to negate the
Modigliani-Miller theorem.
6. Among the points of view not considered here are those which reject
the market evidence on time preference or time productivity in favor of a
"social discount rate" excogitated from value judgments or planners' time

<-----Page 18----->INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY

discountrate for a public projectthe same rate as would be applied,
in principle,by a companyevaluating a "comparable"projectin the
private sphere. The opposingposition would have the government
take advantage of its power to finance exceptionally cheaply by
undertaking projects that are profitable when the returns are
evaluated at the government'slow borrowingrate. We may think
of these two as prescriptionsto employ,in the first case, a risky, and
in the second case a riskless, rate -to discount the mathematical
expectationsof the uncertainreturns.
The argumentfor use of the risky rate runs somewhat as follows.7
The market rate of interest is generatedby an equilibrium
between marginal time preferencesof consumersand the marginal
time productivityof resources.If neitherprivate nor public projects
involved risk, it would obviously be inefficientto depart from this
equilibrium rate in evaluating intertemporaltransfers of income
(i.e., investments) in the public sphere. It is true that in a risky
world there are many "impure"time-plus-risk interest rates rather
than one pure time-rate, but the way to take this into account is to
use in the public sphere the rate employed for "comparable"investments in the private sphere. Thus, if a power project would in
the private sector be financedhalf from debt sources paying 4 per
cent (this being a riskless rate, let us say) and half from equity
sources requiringan expected return of 6 per cent, the government
discount rate for a comparableproject should be the same 5 per
cent the private company must employ. Then the marginally desirable project would, in either sector, yield 5 per cent in terms of
probabilistic expectation. (If corporate income tax is taken into
account,the marginallydesirableprojectin the private sphere must
have an expectedyield around8.5 per cent, and so the discountrate
for government investment should be correspondinglyhigher.) 8
preferences. This point of view can be defended as a way of compensating for
market bias due to private "myopia" or intertemporal "selfishness," but it
raises issues beyond the scope of the Pareto-efficiency criterion. For discussions of this position see 0. Eckstein, "A Survey of the Theory of Public
Expenditure Criteria,"my "Comment,"and Eckstein's "Reply" in the National
Bureau of Economic Research volume, Public Finances: Needs, Sources, and
Utilization (Princeton University Press, 1961), and S. Marglin, "The Social
Rate of Discount and the Optimal Rate of Investment," this Journal, LXXVII
(Feb. 1963).
7. The argument is based on that offeredin J. Hirshleifer, J. C. DeHaven,
and J. W. Milliman, Water Supply: Economics, Technology, and Policy (University of Chicago Press, 1960), pp. 139-50.
8. It might be argued that the corporate income tax is an equalizing adjustment designed to compensate the community for certain costs imposed
on it by the corporate form of business -in contrast with partnerships, proprietorships, cooperatives, government enterprises, etc. This argument raises
issues which are best avoided here; the principle in contention remains the

<-----Page 19----->270

QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS

Failure to abide by this rule leads to obviously inefficient results. If
the government, merely because it can finance entirely by riskless
borrowing at, say 4 per cent, employed the latter rate in its calculations, the marginally adopted project in the public sector
would yield on the average but 4 per cent while private projects
with higher expected yields were failing of adoption.
The opposing recommendation is based upon the contention
that the higher rates required to secure funds for private investments (e.g., the 6 per cent equity yield in the illustration above)
are a reflection of risk aversion - and that risk aversion is a private,
not a social cost. The possibility of pooling independent risks is
essential to this argument. A.T.&T. can pool more risks than can a
small local telephone company; it will therefore, be able to finance
more cheaply and so to undertake projects with a lower expected
yield than the small company can. The federal government can
pool risks far more effectively than A.T.&T., and so is as a practical
matter quite justified in treating the expected project yield as if it
were riskless. Consequently, the 4 per cent riskless discount rate is
the relevant one for its calculations.9 (It should be noted, however,
that the conclusion of this argument only follows in a "second-best"
sense. For, granted the premises, it would clearly be most efficient
for the government to borrow in order to subsidize the higherexpected-yield private investments - a larger subsidy to the small
telephone company, a smaller one to A.T.&T. - rather than for the
purpose of undertaking lower-yield public investments. Only if this
possibility is ruled out does it follow that lower-yielding government investments should be undertaken.)
A simple numerical illustration will indicate the incorrectness
of the "pooling" argument within the time-state model developed
here. Suppose the society consists of J identically placed individuals
with identical tastes, and let the social endowment consist of 100J
units of income (say, "corn") in time 0, 150J units in the time-state
la, and 50J units in time-state lb. Let the numeraire Po = 1. Suppose, for arithmetical convenience, that the state-probabilities ira =
7tb = 1/2, and that with this distribution of consumption opportunities there is on the margin zero time preference with respect to
same, though in one case the divergence is only between 4 per cent and 5 per
cent and in the other case between 4 and 8.5 per cent.
9. Many prominent theorists have repeated this argument. Among
recent examples are the discussions by P. A. Samuelson and W. Vickrey at
the Principles of Efficiency session, Papers and Proceedings of the 76th Annual
Meeting, American Economic Review, LIV (May 1964). See also, Robert M.
Solow, Capital Theory and the Rate, of Return (Chicago: Rand-McNally,
1964), pp. 70-71.

certainties:thus, the price of a unit of future certainincomePi = 1
(and the riskless discount rate r1 = 0 per cent) 1 where, of course,
P1 = PI. + Plb. Since by hypothesis there is risk aversion, it must

be the case that the overall value of the time-i endowmentfor each
person- 150 (Pia) + 50 (Plb) - must be less than the value of
the averageholdingas a certainty,i.e., less than 100(Pi,) +lOO(Plb)
= 100. (If the prices Pl, and Plb were such that the average holding certain could be purchased within the endowment wealth
constraint, it would be, given risk aversion.) This requires that
Pa be less than l/2. For concreteness, let Pla = .4, and hence Pib
-

.6, thus determiningthe "impure"time-and-state discount rates

ri. = 150 per cent, and r1b = 66% per cent.

Now considervarious investmentopportunities,all of infinitesimal scale so that we can hold the price relationshipsunchanged(the
opportunitiesare infinitesimalon the social scale, but not necessarily
on the individual scale). It is immediately clear that, in terms of
efficiency,either a private or public project whose returns fall exclusively in state la shouldhave these returnsdiscountedat the rate
of 150 per cent. To attempt to make a distinction between public
and private here would be equivalentto chargingdifferentprices for
the same commodity- cl5. If the returnsall fell in state lb, the discount rate should be 663 per cent. For an investmentyielding returns equally in either state (i.e., an investment whose returns are
certain), the 0 per cent rate would be appropriate. For a project
yielding in the ratio of 3 in state la to 1 in state lb (that is, in the
same proportionsas the private and social endowments)the appropriate discount (for applicationto the mathematicalexpectationof
returns) is approximately11.1 per cent.3 The appropriatediscount
rate wouldbe muchlowerif, with the samemathematicalexpectation
of returns,the state-distributionwere reversedso as to pay off more
heavily in the less well-endowedstate lb (the rate to use would be
minus 9.1 per cent, on our assumptions). In every case, of course,
the "appropriate"discountrate is that which correctlydistinguishes
1. Since Pi 1/(1 + rO).
2. Since Pi. = 1/(1 + rna), and Plb = 1(1 + rib).

3. This figure is derived as follows. Let x be the scale of return per
dollar invested. We seek the averaged discount rate r* such that the presentworth calculations in terms of r* and the averaged returns lead to the same
result as the explicit calculation in terms of the state-distributed returns and
the correspondingrla and rlb. We determine r*
in the equation:
I
-1 + 3x/(I + rl) + x/(1 + r1b)=-1 + 2x/(1 + x*). With r = 150 per cent
and rib = 66%
/3per cent the numerical result in th4text is obtained.

efficient from inefficientprojects by showing positive or negative
values in a present-worthcalculation.
The foregoingindicates that there is a single definite discount
rate to be used, whether a project is private or public, in making
efficiencycalculationsfor any given state-pattern of returns. This
result supports,therefore,the "risky discount rate" position on the
normative issue in question. The crucial proviso is that when the
recommendationis made to employ for governmentinvestmentsthe
private market discount rate for "comparable"projects, it must be
understoodthat "comparable"projects are those having the same
proportionatetime-state distributionof returns. In particular,note
that the "risky"rate might be lowerthan the risklessrate.
It is correspondinglyclear that within this model the position
recommendingthe use of the riskless discount rate with the mathematical expectationof returnsmust be incorrect. We have just seen
that it would fail to distinguishbetween,on the one hand, a project
paying off moreheavily in the better-endowedstate and, on the other
hand, a project with a quantitatively identical but reversed statepatternpaying off moreheavily in the moreurgently desiredincome
of the poorer-endowedstate. Or, to take anotherexample,a project
yielding only a dollar in state la would have that dollar reducedto
$.50 in taking the expectation,and then be discountedat the riskless rate (0 per cent here). This is equivalentto letting rla = 100 per
cent, too lax a criterionsince the correctria = 150 per cent. On the
other hand, if the dollar were returnedin state lb the recommendation would indicate too stringent a criterion, employing 100 per
cent instead of the correct 66% per cent. The basic reason, of
course,is that the processof taking mathematicalexpectationsconsiders dollars equivalent when they appertain to equally probable
states - but as between two such states, the dollars in one may be
much more highly-valued on the marginthan in the other. In other
words, dollars in distinct time-states are different commodities
within the model consideredhere, and it is as incorrectto average
them as it would be to average shoes and apples.
We may now turn to the "pooling"argument. Supposeit were
possible to pool two projects, one yielding a dollar in state la and
the other a dollarin state lb. Since the pooledreturnis thus riskless,
it may seem plausibleto employ the riskless rate 0 per cent for the
two, viewed in combination. But this is definitely incorrect. If the
two projects were necessarily tied together, then the recommended
procedurewould be appropriate. But if they are really separable,
they should be evaluated separately (for simplicity, we set aside

<-----Page 22----->INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY

273

complicationssuch as possible interactions between the two). It
could easily happen that the combination,if forced upon us as a
combination,might be desirable-but that it might be more efficient to adopt one componentand not the other, if we could separate
the two. In short, the device of pooling provides no justification
in efficiencyterms for adoptingwhat is incrementallya bad project,
if in fact we can adopt the good one separately from the bad.4
Even if the "pooling" argument is rejected, it could still be
maintainedthat the discountrate on public projectsought "usually"
to be lower than those of private projects. All that is requiredto
supportthis view is that governmentprojects be "usually" (in contrast with private projects) such that they pay off in less well-endowed states. For example, a federal irrigation project pays off
disproportionatelywhen there would otherwise be a drought. Of
course, some special argument is requiredto explain why private
initiative does not exploit such opportunities. But if such opportunities are not privately exploited,then in fact the "usual"private
investmentswould not be the comparableones in the sense required
by the "risky-discount-rate"position.
It may seem surprising,however, that so little can be made of
"pooling"in view of the plausible argumentsadduced in its favor-.
One can, in fact, construct a model in which the pooling argument
makes more sense, and it will be instructiveto comparethat model
with ours above. The key is to distinguishbetweenprivate "states"
and social "states." The idea here is related to a maxim often
(rathertoo sweepingly) expressedin connectionwith life insurance
calculations: "We don't know who will die next year, but we do
know how many!" Similarly, the social total of endowmentsmight
be constant (thus, there is really only one social state, ignoring
distribution) and yet for each individual the endowmentmight be
uncertain.5 For concreteness,imagine the following situation. If
state a obtains, every odd-numberedindividual has an endowment
of 50 and every even-numberedindividual an endowmentof 150; if
state b obtainsthe positionsare reversed. Let us suppose,in orderto
make the case as strong as possible, that the investments available
to even and odd classes of individuals will have returns nronor4. Precisely this error is committed in the so-called "basin account"
doctrine. This theory, put forward by proponents of certain large river basin
plans, maintains that benefit-cost evaluations of component projects should
be ignored so long as the overall plan shows a surplus of benefits over costs.
Federal legislation has adopted this doctrine for the gigantic Missouri Basin
Project. See Report of the President's Water Resources Policy Commission,
Vol. 2, Ten Rivers in America's Future (Washington, 1950), p. 250.
5. This may have been the assumption made in Arrow's original formulation of the state-preference model. See Arrow, op. cit., equation (5).

tionate to their respectiveendowmentdistributions.Then the "even"
individuals will, on the basis of risk aversion, have a bias against
the investments available to them, and the "odd" individuals
similarly against their investments- whereas, if pooled, the investments would tend to become certainties justifying no risk discount.
Considerinvestmentsof the formrequiringa time-0 input of $1,
and yielding a time-i return of $1.50 in an individual's better-endowedand $.50 in his worse-endowedstate, the states again assumed
equally probable. If the subjectivemarginalvalue of a dollar in an
individual's better-endowedstate is .4 and in his poorer-endowed
state is .6 (as before), then each individual would assign a present
worth of - $.10 to the investment opportunity. But if an "odd"
and an "even" investment opportunity were pooled, the return
would be certain; at the riskless 0 per cent rate the combination
would have a zero present worth, and so be on the margin of desirability. Here pooling does not sneak in a bad project under the
mantle of a good one. Rather,two projectsseparatelybad (in terms
of private calculations)may becomea goodprojectin terms of social
calculationsI
A model of this kind is what lies behind the usual "pooling"
argumentjustifying the use of the riskless rate for evaluating government investments. The model diverges in two essential ways
from that presentedearlier justifying the employmentof the risky
rate. First is the assumption,alreadymentioned,that risk is private
rather than social - i.e., that there is only one state with respectto
social totals6 but morethan one state in terms of possible individual
distributions within that total. Second, and this is the really
criticalpoint, is the assumptionthat marketsare so imperfectthat it
is impossiblefor the individuals better-endowedin state a to trade
claims to income in that state against the claims to income in state
b that other individualswould like to sell. In short, the single-price
law of marketsmust be violated.
Continuing our numerical example, the commodity cl. had a
subjective value equal to .4 for even-numberedindividuals and .6
for odd-numberedindividuals. If trade were permittedbetween the
two classes, the two values would have to come into equality.
6. In an unpublished paper, Kenneth Arrow has employed the somewhat
more general assumption of multiple social states, but where the social incomes (endowments) for the several states are uncorrelated with the returns
from incremental investments in the private states. This also leads to the
result that private risks are (on the average) socially irrelevant, and so that
market rates of return reflecting private risk aversion should not influence the
government's discount rate.

<-----Page 24----->INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY

275

Holding to the assumption that a riskless future claim has unit
present value (PI. +Plb = 1), PI. and Plb would then each have

to equal .5. Then strictly private calculations,without any pooling,
would show that the private investment opportunities of the example were on the margin of desirability. The discountrate for the
"comparable"private investmentswould be 0 per cent, so that proponents of the so-called "risky discount rate" for evaluation of
public investment would be led by their analysis to the correct 0
per cent rate in this case. In contrast, as we have seen, proponents
of the so-called "riskless rate"- while also correct in favoring 0
per cent as the discountrate in this case - would be led into definite
error under conditions where private risks are reflective of social
risks.
We may conclude, therefore, that the pooling argument rests
ultimately for support upon market imperfections that prevent
equivalent time-state claims from selling at a uniform price, thus
hindering the possibility of private movements away from risky
(unbalancedwith respect to state) endowmentsby trading. Such
imperfectionsmay, of course, be very prevalent. One important
example concerns assets whose productiveness has a personal
element. Such an asset may be worth much in the hands of some
Mr. X, but little if traded to anyone else. It will, therefore, be
difficultto reducethe riskinessassociatedwith holding such assets.7
Here is a case where, granted the other conditions in our illustration above, the pooling argumentwould have real force. But it is
clear that the argument is incorrect on the level of generality at
which it is usually propounded.If time-state claims can be regarded
as commoditiestraded in perfect markets, the prescriptionfor the
use of the so-called "risky rate"-the discount rate implicit in the
valuation of private projectswith the same proportionatetime-state
distributionof returns- has been shownto be generally correct.
REMARKS
IV. CONCLUDING
To rationalize the process of investment decision under uncertainty, and to explain the price relationships among risky assets,
7. The most important such asset is labor power. Riskiness might deter
both a Mr. X and a Mr. Y. from investing to improve their personal labor
capacities. Yet, the state-distributions of the returns from the two investments might in combination represent a certainty. This would suggest that
Mr. X and Mr. Y form a partnership, so that each has 50 per cent of the
certain combination (i.e., each sells the other half his claims). But, it is possible that one or both will work less productively when he only receives 50
per cent of the benefit of his personal efforts. This possibility would, therefore, inhibit such trading.

two main conceptionsof the choice process have been put forward
by economictheorists. Both conceptionsreducethe observedassets
traded in the marketplaceinto more fundamentalentities - choiceobjects assertedly desired by investors. Under the first and more
familiar approach,the more fundamental entities are represented
by mean and variability measures, ju and a, of overall return
provided by any given portfolio of assets; under the second approach, the assets are regardedas packages of more fundamental
contingent claims to income at specified dates and states of the
world.
In the predecessorto this article, it was shown that the statepreference formulationwas the logical extension, to the world of
uncertain choice, of Fisher's model of certain intertemporalchoice.
The various topics coveredin this article were intendedto serve as
illustrationsof the power and relevance of the state-preferenceapproach,to show that some interestingand novel results in a number
of areas can be obtainedthereby. (1) As to risk aversion,underthe
mean vs. variability approach the investor's attitude toward risk
(whethera is for him a good or a "bad") is a personalcharacteristic.
It remainsunclearhow the risk-loving or risk-avoidingpropensities
of individuals are composed into an overall market premium or
discount for risk. In contrast,under the state-preferenceapproach
the very elementaryprinciple of nonspecializationof choice -among
time-state claims,leads to the inferencethat in their wealth-oriented
decisions,and if asset pricesrepresentfair odds, investorsseek portfolios with balanced state-distributions of income. In general,
however, they will not actually achieve perfect balance (zero a),
because the endowmentsand productiveopportunitiesavailable to
society are not symmetricallydistributedover all the possiblestates.
(2) As to the unresolvedquestion about the existence of an optimal
debt-equity ratio for financing corporate investment, the statepreferenceformulationleads directly to a set of idealizing assumptions ("no external drains") under which all possible ratios are
equivalent in market value. Where the idealized conditions do not
hold, there will in general be an optimal ratio. (3) With regardto
the appropriate discount rate for evaluating government investments, rather vaguely stated ideas concerningrisk aversion as a
social or a private cost can be precisely formulated in terms of
time-state preferences.It was shownthat the efficientdiscountrate,
assumingperfect markets, is the market rate implicit in the valuation of private assets whose returns are "comparable"to the public
investment in question-where "comparable"means having the

<-----Page 26----->INVESTMENT DECISION UNDER UNCERTAINTY

277

same proportionatetime-state distribution of returns. The argument often encountered,to the effect that "risk aversionis a private
cost and not a social cost," was shown to be mistaken unless two
restrictive conditions both hold: (a) Private risks exist, but these
do not representsocial risks (as when the aggregate social endowment is constant,but its distributionover the individualsvaries with
state). (b) Markets are imperfect, so that the single-price law of
markets does not hold for contingent time-state-claims as commodities.
Going beyondthe groundcoveredby this article, there seem to be
considerable difficulties of an operational nature in more direct
empiricaltests employinga state-preferenceformulation. The mean
and the variability of return embodiedin a given set of assets are
already only implicitly observable;when the assets are interpreted
instead as packages of claims to incomesin underlyinghypothetical
states of the world, the fundamental choice-objectshave an even
higherdegreeof invisibility. Assets ordinarilyencounteredin capital
markets, such as corporate bonds or equities, represent complex
aggregates of claims to income in an embarrassingmultiplicity of
