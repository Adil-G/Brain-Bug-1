To better understand the competitive dynamics between an early and a later entrant, in this
study we examined the extent to which word of mouth (WOM) regarding the later entrant and
the later entrant's similarity to the early entrant influences the consumer decision process. We
hypothesized that the influence of WOM and similarity depends on the nature of the decision-making task, which is theorized as either a stimuli-based or memory-based task. A
3-stage, sequential-logit model with 2 focal brands (the early and later entrants) was developed
to test the influence of independent measures on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c) choice, given consideration for both the early entrant and the focal
follower. Data from 2 experiments provides support for the multistage conceptualization of the
consumer decision process and demonstrates that the effects of WOM communication and similarity depend on the nature of the decision-making task.

Brands often benefit by virtue of being the first to market (e.g.,
Kalyanaram, Robinson, & Urban, 1995; Kerin, Varadarajan,
& Peterson, 1992). Consequently, investigating the psychological mechanisms that drive the pioneering advantage has
become a major topic in the marketing literature (e.g., Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989).Nevertheless, amajority of brands are
late movers-not pioneers. For this reason, counteracting the
pioneering advantage with late-mover strategies is essential
for the long-term survival of most brands (e.g., Bowman &
Gatignon, 1996; Shankar, 1999). The research in this study
moves toward understanding the competitive dynamics between a later entrant (afollower) and an early entrant by studyRequests for reprints should be sent to Thomas W. Cline, Associate Professor of Business, Alex G. McKenna School of Business, Economics, and

ing the effects of word-of-mouth (WOM) communication regarding a follower and the follower's perceived similarity to
the early entrant on the consumer decision-making process.
WOM communication is an important source of consumer information; it forms the basis of interpersonal influence anddetermines the relevance of information (e.g., Mahajan, Muller,
&Bass, 1990).Brand similarity is said to influence themanner
in which consumers organize and compare brands in a product
market (e.g., Tversky, 1977) and is an important building
block for brand positioning strategies (e.g., Sujan & Bettman,
1989). Our research studied the robustness of the early-mover
advantage by investigating the joint interplay of WOM communication and brand similarity.
Research on the psychological drivers of the pioneering
advantage has investigated the various processes by which
judgments concerning the pioneer are formed. For example,
Carpenter and Nakamoto (1989) examined an anchoring-

<-----Page 1----->and adjustment-based preference evolution process to explain the pioneering advantage. Following Kardes,
Kalyanaram, Chandrashekaran, and Dornoff (1993), who
theorized that the early-entrant advantage emanates from the
consumer decision-making process, we investigated three
fundamental components of decision making: retrieval, consideration, and choice. However, unlike Kardes et al., who
were interested only in the pioneering brand, we examined
consumers' reactions to both the early entrant and focal follower at each stage of the decision-making process. Although our theoretical framework draws on the pioneering
literature, our focus was not on the pioneer per se. Rather, we
studied the effect of brand sequence on consumers' perceptions in an extant category. To develop our hypotheses, we integrate literature on (a) the psychological mechanisms for the
pioneering advantage, (b) WOM communications, (c) brand
similarity, and (d) phased decision making. With this integration, we hope to provide insights into market dynamics for
the competition between a follower and the early entrant. The
contextual dependence of our results discredits the
one-size-fits-all notion of the pioneering advantage and demonstrates that the varying effects of WOM communication
and similarity are a function of the decision-making task.

CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND
ANDRESEARCHHYPOTHESES
Although pioneering a new market can be risky, if successful,
it can bring higher market share, higher profits, and lower
costs (e.g., Kerin et al., 1992). Since the seminal work of Carpenter and Nakamoto (1989), research on the psychological
mechanisms that underlie the pioneering advantage has
gained momentum (e.g., Kardes & Kalyanaram, 1992). This
research suggests that the pioneering advantage occurs because pioneers inordinately influence consumer preferences
(Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989). This role of pioneering gives
rise to higher retrieval of information related to the pioneer,
which leads to biases in consumer judgments in favor of the
pioneer (Kardes et al., 1993).
A majority of brands, however, are not pioneers. Thus,
given that pioneers often earn disproportionate market share
advantages, some researchers have focused on late-mover
strategies aimed at overcoming the pioneering advantage
(e.g., Zhang & Markman, 1998). For instance, Carpenter and
Nakamoto (1990) showed that in the presence of a dominant
pioneer, the optimal strategy for the late entrant is to differentiate from the pioneer, whereas in the presence of a weak pioneer, the optimal strategy is to challenge the pioneer. Indeed,
understanding the psychological mechanisms that drive pioneering advantage and appropriate follower strategies are
critical for developing a market-driven theory of competitive
advantage (Carpenter, Glazer, & Nakamoto, 1997).In this research, we studied the robustness of an early-entrant advantage by examining the significance of WOM communication

regarding a follower brand and its similarity to the early entrant on the consumer decision-making process.
Research suggests that consumers use a sequential decision-making process to reduce decision complexity (e.g.,
Bettman, 1979). Shocker, Ben-Akiva, Boccaro, and
Nedungadi (1991) suggested that for complex decisions, the
consumer decision-making process consists of three distinct
stages. The first stage begins with a universal set, which consists of all brands available in a product market, and evolves
into a retrieval set, wherein a consumer can access from
memory a subset of brands from the universal set. Partial exposure to brand information and the selective encoding of information to which a consumer is exposed result in retrieval
sets being much smaller than universal sets. The second stage
involves the formation of a consideration set comprising a
subset of brands from the retrieval set that are suitable for a
particular purchase occasion, and the final stage of the decision-making process involves the selection of one brand from
the consideration set (Kardes et al., 1993).
WOM communication is an important source of consumer
information. It forms the basis of interpersonal communications and significantlyinfluences product evaluations and purchase decisions (e.g., Mahajan et al., 1990).In fact, WOM has
been shown to be more powerful than printed information
(Borgida & Nisbett, 1977) primarily because WOM information is considered to be more credible. We conceptualize
WOM in a broad context that includes most forms of noncommercial advertising and consider two important characteristics. First, we examine the manner in which WOM is presented, that is, pallid and vivid cases (Herr, Kardes, & Kim,
1991). For the pallid WOM case, we attribute information to
Consumer Reports (a credible source), and therefore we use a
loose definition of WOM. Second, we investigate the dynamics propagated by negative (vs. positive) WOM.

Vivid Versus Pallid Information
Vividly presented information (vs. pallid information) tends
to be more accessible from memory and weighed more
heavily in consumers' judgments (e.g., Kisielius & Sternthal,
1984). Herr et al. (1991) found that anecdotal information
presented in a face-to-face manner (i.e., vivid WOM) has a
significantly greater impact on product judgments than the
same information presented in printed mode (i.e., pallid condition). Herr et al. argued that prior impressions are easy to
interpret and hence influence encoding and retrieval processes in such a way as to reduce the correspondence between objective and perceived cue diagnosticity. Consequently, prior beliefs formed by vivid WOM information (vs.
beliefs formed by pallid information) are more accessible
and held with a higher degree of confidence. Thus, to the extent that WOM makes information more accessible from the
memory, we expected vivid WOM (vs. pallid printed) information regarding a focal follower to enhance the retrieval
likelihood of the focal-following brand. Given that humans

<-----Page 2----->THE CONSUMER DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

have limited cognitive capabilities, and vivid information
draws a disproportional amount of cognition, we also expected recall for the early entrant to decline (a competitor of
the focal follower). Other things being equal, we also anticipated that vivid WOM (VS.pallid printed) communication
will have a greater influence on product judgments. Therefore, we expected this influence to manifest itself in higher
(lower) likelihood of consideration and choice for the focal
follower (early entrant). (We use the subscript F and E to indicate a hypothesis (HI for the focal follower and the early
entrant, respectively).
HIF: WOM communications (vs. printed information) regarding the focal follower will have a greater positive
influence on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c) choice, given consideration, for the focal follower.
HIE: WOM communications (vs. printed information) regarding the focal follower will have a greater negative
influence on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c) choice, given consideration, for the early entrant.

WOM Valence
Because WOM is perceived as a relatively credible source of
information, it is not surprising that the valence of WOM has
a strong effect on consumer memory and judgment. However, findings on the importance of the valence of WOM are
equivocal. For example, in a stimulus-based task, Herr et al.
(1991) found symmetric effects for negative- and positive-WOM, whereas in a memory-based task, Giese,
Spangenberg, and Crowley (1996) did not find the symmetric
effects. Research on categorization suggests that individuals
categorize information at a level that is cognitively efficient
(Cohen & Basu, 1987; Rosch, 1975). Clearly, the nature of a
decision-making task (stimulus vs. memory) will influence
the cognitively efficient categorization level.
In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, the information is unambiguously available in a consumer's short-term
memory or at point-of-purchase. Consistent with Herr et al.
(1991), we expected the valence of WOM to have a directionally consistent effect on both consideration and choice, given
consideration for the follower (as in a stimulus-based task,
consumers need not rely on memory; the retrieval stage of the
consumer decision-making process is irrelevant). Further,
given that the early entrant competes with the follower, positive WOM regarding the follower should injure the early entrant and negative WOM on the follower should benefit the
early entrant.

HZE: In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will
decrease (increase) the likelihood of (a) consideration and (b) choice, given consideration, for the
early entrant.
A memory-based, decision-making task is likely to elicit
all three stages of the decision-making process (Shocker et
al., 1991) and should encourage product-type categorization (Sujan & Dekleva, 1987). Any WOM information is
likely to be associated with the category exemplar, that is,
the early entrant because early entrants engender disproportionately higher influence on consumer preference formation than later entrants (Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989) and
because product type is the likely level of categorization.
This association of information with the prototypical brand
occurs due to the ambiguity created by the decision environment (Muthukrishnan, 1995). In our research, we simulated a complex product market by sequentially introducing
brands in two stages: the early entrant first followed by
later entrants. This situation simulates ambiguity due to
both the large number of brands (complex market) and the
sequential introduction of brands. Because WOM communication is vivid, it tends to be more accessible and
weighed more heavily in judgments than printed information (Kisielius & Sternthal, 1986). Thus, we expected
WOM regarding the focal follower, positive or negative, to
be absorbed by the early entrant.

(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will increase (decrease) the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b)

Similarity
A critical aspect of brand positioning is how similar or dissimilar a brand is perceived to be to other brands in a product
category (Sujan & Bettman, 1989). The perceived similarity
of the focal follower to the early entrant serves as a signal of
the relative position of the two brands. Because early entrants
play a leading role in the formation of consumer preferences
in a particular product category, it is often perceived as being
typical of the category. Typicality, "the degree to which an
item is perceived to represent a category" (Loken & Ward,
1990, p. 112) determines the competition a brand faces and
the functions (e.g., usage occasions) that the brand performs

<-----Page 3----->190

GREWAL, CLINE, DAVIES

for consumers. Thus, by being similar to or different from the
early entrant, the focal follower defines its typicality to the
product category.'
Because an early entrant is likely to be perceived as relatively prototypicalin a product market, consumers are prone to
compare the early entrant with the follower and not vice versa
(Carpenter & Nakamoto, 1989). Research on the attraction effect would suggest that the perceived similarity of the follower
to the early entrant should influence the attractiveness of the
early entrant. Specifically, research on the attraction effect
shows that in a two-brand, two-attribute product market in
which the competitor brand outperforms the target brand on
one attribute and the target surpasses the competitor on the
other attribute, the introduction of a new brand (usually referred to as the decoy) near the target brand tends to enhance
preferences for the target brand (Huber & Puto, 1983). Assuming that the early entrant is perceived as a category exemplar and the follower as a relative decoy, the attraction effect
literature suggests that as the similarity between the early entrant and focal follower increases, the likelihood of consideration and choice for the early entrant should increase (e.g.,
Lehmann & Pan, 1994; Ratneshwar, Shocker, & Stewart,
1987).Further, research on order of entry shows that consumer
recall for an early entrant brand tends to be higher than for a
later entrant (Kardes & Kalyanararn, 1992).Because consumers are likely to compare the early entrant to following brands,
similarity between a follower brand and the early entrant is
likely to draw more attention to the early entrant (vs. the follower). Thus, we expected similarity to strengthen memory for
the early entrant, thereby producing higher rates of retrieval.
Finally, research on the substitution effect (Huber, Payne, &
Puto, 1982) demonstrates that, for similar brands, the brand
perceived to be dominant tends to take the lion's share of the
market (in our case, the early entrant dominates the focal later
entrant). Therefore, we expected preferences for the follower
to decrease as it becomes more similar to the early entrant and
preferences for the early entrant to increase.

H4F: The greater the similarity between the early entrant
and focal follower, the lower the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c)
choice, given consideration, for the focal follower.
H ~ E :The greater the similarity between the early entrant
and focal follower, the higher the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration, given retrieval; and (c)
choice, given consideration, for the early entrant.

'Categorization research suggests that one should also consider the
"moderately incongruent" case. Thus, we would have to consider moderately similarldissimilar cases in addition to the similar/dissimilar cases we
consider. Practical issues relating to the complexity of the experimental design precluded us from studying the moderately incongruent case. We believe that further research should be carried out to study the moderately incongruent case.

Interactions Between WOM and Similarity
We expected the interaction between WOM and a later entrant's perceived similarity to the early entrant todependon the
decision-making task (i.e., stimulus based or memory based).
In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, the likelihood of
information loss due to factors such as memory deterioration is
not relevant. Research on consumerjudgment suggests that in
such situations consumers are likely to draw inferences from
available information (Kardes, 1994).Thus, as perceived similarity between the early entrant and focal follower increases,
consumers are likely to assume that the two brands possess
similar attributes. As a result, the effects of WOM regarding
the focal follower are likely to be shared with the early entrant.
These effects should vary directly with similarity between the
two brands. Therefore, given high perceived similarity, the
early entrant is likely to benefit more from positive (vs. negative) WOM regarding the follower. For the follower, positive
WOM should provide some credibility to its close positioning
to the early entrant (i.e., legitimacy by virtue of similarity to
the early entrant). In contrast, negative WOM may bring into
question the credibility of the follower's positioning and augment the negative effects of similarity (i.e., the later entrant
may be viewed as an imposter).

H 5 ~ :In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative)WOM regarding the focal follower will decrease (increase) the negative influence of similarity
on the likelihood of (a) consideration and (b) choice,
given consideration, for the focal follower.
H ~ E :In a stimulus-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will increase (decrease) the positive influence of similarity
on the likelihood of (a) consideration and (b) choice,
given consideration, for the early entrant.
In amemory-based task, we need to considertwo important
aspects of the decision-making situation. First, we expected
the salience of the followerto increase as its similarity with the
early entrant increases, thereby making information about the
follower more accessible from memory (Kardes &
Kalyanaram, 1992). Often, the salience of brands depends on
external factors such as the format in which the information is
conveyed (e.g., Finn, 1988).In our case, by presenting the follower as similar to the early entrant, we influence the format of
the information and makeit more salient (Alba, Hutchinson, &
Lynch, 1991). Second, the complexity of the decision-making
task and limited cognitive capacity are likely to repress inference making (e.g., Muthukrishnan, 1995). Taken together,
these situational aspects result in (a) more accurate retrieval/recall of judgment-relevant information and (b) minimal inference making. In such cases, information retrieved
from memory is likely to be used as a direct input (as opposed
to inference drawing; Kardes, 1994), and adjustments are
likely to be insufficient, as limited human cognitive capacity

<-----Page 4----->THE CONSUMER DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

precludes detailed processing (Hastie, 1984). Therefore, we
expected positive (negative) WOM regarding the follower to
directlybenefit (injure)the focal follower and indirectly injure
(benefit) the early entrant.

H6F: In a memory-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative) WOM regarding the focal follower will decrease (increase) the negative influence of similarity
on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration,
given retrieval; and (c) choice, given consideration,
for the early entrant.
H6E: In a memory-based, decision-making task, positive
(negative)WOM regarding the focal follower will decrease (increase) the positive influence of similarity
on the likelihood of (a) retrieval; (b) consideration,
given retrieval; and (c) choice, given consideration,
for the focal follower.

METHOD
We used two experiments to test our hypotheses. Experiment
1 examined a 5-brand product market and involved a stimulus-based task. Thus, we modeled the consideration and the
choice stages of the decision-making process. Experiment 2
studied a 10-brand (1 early entrant and 9 followers) product
market in a memory-based task and elicited the three stages
(retrieval, consideration, and choice) of the consumer decision-making process.

Estimation Procedure
A derivation process that algebraically extends the derivation
of Kardes et al.'s (1993) gave us the following log-likelihood
function (the details of the derivation are available on request
from the authors). Kardes et al. considered only the pioneer
brand for each stage of the consumer decision-making process, whereas we consider two brands-the early entrant and
focal follower-at each of the three stages of the decision-making process. Thus, our likelihood function is based
on 15 outcomes (Figure 1). Specifically, we maximize the
following log-likelihood function:

191

where, F 1 ,F2, F3, F4, F5, and F6 represent the retrieval, consideration, and choice stages for the early entrant and focal
follower, respectively. For the six-term Equation 1, the first
three terms deal with the early entrant and the last three represent the focal follower. The first summation signifies the
retrieval stage for the early entrant and considers all respondents. The second summation term signifies the consideration stage for the early entrant and reckons respondents who
retrieve the early entrant (retrieval early entrant [&I = I),
thereby holding retrieval constant. The third summation term
deals with choice for the early entrant and considers respondents for whom consideration early entrant (C,) = 1 (note that
this also implies that R, = 1). Likewise, the last three summation terms signify retrieval, consideration, and choice for the
focal follower.

Experiment 1
Method. In this experiment, we simulated a product
market with an early entrant and four later entrants in a stimulus-based decision task. A sample of 215 undergraduate students, of which 20 1provided completeresponses,participated
in the experimentand received course credit. Participantswere
exposed to attribute information for five hypothetical brands
(Brands M through Q) of microwaveable pizza and pallid
WOM communication regarding the focal follower.2
Design. The experiment used a 2 (order of entry: early
entrant, later entrant) x 3 (WOM valence: neutral, positive,
negative) x 2 (similarity: similar, different), one within-subjects factor and two between-subject factors, mixed design.
Order of entry was the within-subjects factor; WOM valence
and similarity served as the between-subject factors. The cell
sizes ranged from a low of 29 to a high of 38. Consideration
and choice for the two focal brands served as the dependent
measures. Attribute information about the early entrant was
provided first, where Brands M and N each served as the
early entrant for half of the participants; Brand Q served as
the focal follower. Written information attributed to Consumer Reports (neutral, positive, or negative WOM) was included with the focal follower and similarity was manipulated via the first attribute listed for the focal follower.
Subsequent to brand exposure, participants completed measures of similarity between the early entrant and follower and
recorded their consideration and choice sets.
Manipulation checks. Participants were asked, on a
two-item, 7-point scale (similar to not similar at all and comparable to not comparable a t all), about the similarity of the
early entrant and focal follower. In addition, participants were

As hypothesized, positive WOM regarding the focal follower increased the likelihood of consideration for the follower (HzF: P = 0.82, p < .lo) and decreased the probability
of considering the early entrant ( H ~ EP: = -1.79, p < .01).
However, it appears that positive WOM did not have the anticipated effects on the choice stage for the follower (HzF:P =
-0.03, p = .52) or the early entrant ( H ~ EP: = -0.44, p = .30).
As expected, negative WOM on the follower decreased the
probability of considering the follower (HzF:P = -0.77, p <
.lo). However, it did not effect consideration for the early entrant (HzE: P = -0.52, p = .50) or the choice stage for either
the follower (HzF: P = 0.21, p = .60) or the early entrant (HzE:
P = 0.5 1, p = .25).
As expected, similarity between the two focal brands appeared to reduce the likelihood of the follower being considered ( H 4 ~P: = - 1 . 0 4 , ~< .05) and chosen ( H ~ FP: = -1.78, p <

was not supported, as similarity did not significantly affect
the consideration (H4E:P = - 0 . 5 9 , ~= .5 1) or choice ( H ~ EP: =
-0.09, p = .55) for the early entrant.
The interaction between positive WOM and similarity
suggests that, given high perceived similarity, positive WOM
regarding the follower increases the likelihood of considering ( H 5 ~P: = 1.18, p = .05) and choosing (&: P = 2.01, p <

.05) the follower. Apparently, similarity also transfers the
positive WOM to the early entrant by increasing the consideration probability for the early entrant ( H 5 ~P: = 1.92, p <
.01). In contrast, we did not find support for this hypothesis in
the case of negative WOM for the follower for either consideration ( H 5 ~P: = -0.29, p = .69) or choice (H5F:j3 = 1.52,p =
.13). Our results show that as the similarity between the two
focal brands increases, negative WOM regarding the follower increases the consideration probability for the early entrant (H5E:P = 1.27, p < .05).

Discussion. Positive WOM appears to help the follower (consideration only), whereas negative WOM (consideration only) and similarity between the two focal brands
(consideration and choice) damage the follower. The results
also suggest that positive WOM lends credence to the follower as it becomes perceptually similar to the early entrant.
Here, positive WOM and similarity interact to increase both
consideration and choice for the follower. With respect to the
early entrant, positive WOM regarding the follower damages
the early entrant (consideration only), and yet, as the focal
follower becomes similar to the early entrant, the both positive and negative WOM benefit the early entrant (consideration only).

Experiment 2
Method. In this experiment, we simulated a product
market with an early entrant and nine later entrants in a memory-based decision task. A sample of 328 undergraduate students, of which 273 responses were completed, participated
in the experiment. Three independent sessions were conducted during a 5-day period. Each of the three sessions
lasted for approximately 20 min.4
Design. The experiment used a 2 (order of entry: early
entrant, later entrant) x 2 (WOM valence: positive WOM,
negative WOM) x 2 (WOM type: vivid, pallid) x 2 (similarity: similar, different), one within-subjects factor and three
between-subject factors, mixed design. Order of entry was
the within-subjects factor; WOM valence, WOM type, and
similarity served as the between-subjectfactors. We counterbalanced the brand serving as the early entrant (Oven Fresh
or Round Table). The cell sizes ranged from a low of 24 to a
high of 48. Recall, consideration, and choice between the two
brands served as the dependent measures. We used a
three-phase data collection procedure followed by Kardes
and Kalyanaram (1992). The three phases of the experiment
took place over the course of 5 days, with 2 days dormancy
period between each phase. A manipulation check for similarity showed that the focal follower was perceived to be
more similar to the early entrant under conditions of high (vs.
low) similarity, t(271) = 2.97, p < .Ol.
Results. Table 2 and Table 3 present the results from
the estimation of three-stage, sequential-logit model, which
tested hypotheses HI, H3, Hq, and H6. An LR test shows that
the independent variables collectively explained a significant
proportion of variance in the three-stage, decision-making
process, ~2(46,N = 273) = 388.56, p < .01. A series of LR
tests suggests that the hypothesized independent variables
explained a significant portion of variance in the retrieval,
~ 2 ( 7N
, = 273) = 101.82, p < .01; consideration, x2(8, N =
169) = 30.29, p < .01, and choice, x2(8,N = 148) = 46.41, p <

4A series of pretests were conducted to select fictitious names for the
early entrant and later entrant brands. Fictitious names (e.g., Oven Fresh)
were used (rather than Brand Q, etc.) to increase experimental realism. The
pretests ensured that all brands would be perceived as equal, both in terms of
attitudes and recall. In the first pretest, 26 fictitious names for microwaveable pizza were generated by a group of 23 undergraduate students.
Next, 62 respondents rated the 26 pizza names on a three-item attitude scale.
The average ratings ranged from 2.06 to 5.3 1. Thus, two brands near the median rating were selected, Oven Fresh (M = 3.54) and Round Table (M =
3.45). The descriptionsfor the brands contained four features unique to each
brand. Each of the four attributes for Oven Fresh was tested and found to be
not significantly different from its counterpartattribute for Round Table. An
independent sample of 55 undergraduate students rated the two brands on a
three-item, 7-point scale. Mean attribute ratings for the brands were not significantly different, t(54) = 1 . 3 0 , ~= .20. Another independent sample of 33
undergraduate students revealed no statistical difference in recall for the two
brands over a 2-day period, x2(1, N = 33) = 2 . 7 2 , ~= .18.

We found support for HI, wherein vivid WOM (vs. pallid) appeared to be more accessible from the memory for
the follower (HIF:p = -0.66, p < .05) and made the early
entrant less accessible (HIE: P = 1.09, p < .01). Vivid (VS.
pallid) WOM also had the anticipated effects on consideration probability for the follower (HIF:P = -0.71, p < .lo)
and the early entrant (HIE:J3 = 1.50, p < .01), along with
the choice likelihood for the follower (HIF:P = -1.22, p <
.01) and the early entrant (HIE: P = 1.80, p < .01). Thus,
consistent with Herr et al. (1991), it seems that vivid information is more powerful in comparison to pallid printed
information.
Positive WOM (as opposed to negative WOM) regarding
the follower tended to decrease the consideration probability
for the follower (H~F:$ = -2.73, p < .01) and increase the retrieval ( H 3 ~p: = 0.58, p < .lo), consideration (H~E:
p = 1.99,
p < .01), and choice ( H 3 ~p: = 2 . 9 7 , ~
< .01) likelihood for the
early entrant. However, our results do not support this hypothesis for the retrieval ( H 3 ~p: = 0.19, p = 33) and choice
(H~E:
J3 = 0.38, p = .37) stages for the follower.
Similarity appeared to decrease the consideration probap = - 1 . 7 5 , ~< .01), but did not inbility for the follower (H~F:
fluence the retrieval (HqF: 0 = 0.29, p = .39) and choice (H4F:
p = 0.08, p = .44) probabilities. However, similarity did increase the retrieval (H~E:0 = 0.95, p < .01), consideration
( H 4 ~ : = 1.22,p < .01), and choice (H4~:p = 2.09, p < .01)
probabilities for the early entrant.
Positive WOM (as opposed to negative WOM) attenuated
the negative influence of similarity on the consideration of
the follower (H6~:
p = 1 . 9 9 , <~ .01), but did not influence the
retrieval ( H 6 ~P: = -0.25, p = 3 5 ) and choice (H~F:
P = -0.45,
p = .36) of the follower. It also appears that positive WOM
(vs. negative WOM) attenuated the positive effect of similarity on the retrieval (H6~:P = -1 -31, p < .01), consideration
(H6E: p = - 1 . 8 6 , ~< .01), and choice ( H 6 ~0: = - 2 . 0 8 , ~< .01)
of the early entrant.

50verall, the control variables had the desired effects. As the retrieval set
size increased, the likelihood of retrieving the follower (P = 1.59, p < .01)
and the early entrant (P = 1 . 3 5 , <
~ .01) also increased, but the consideration
probability for the follower (0 = -1.14, p < .01) and the early entrant (P =
-1.73, p < .01) decreased. Likewise, as the consideration set size increased,
the likelihood of considering the foHower (P = 2.27, p < .05) and the early
entrant (p = 1.88, p < .01) increased, whereas the probability of choice for
the follower (P = -1.26,~< .01) and the early entrant (P = - 2 . 1 6 , ~< .01) decreased. Oven Fresh as a brand name was more preferred than Round Table
such that it increased the retrieval likelihood of the follower (P = -1.24, p <
.01) and the early entrant (P = 1 . 2 0 , <
~ .O1), the consideration probability of
the follower (P = -1.16,~< .Ol) and the early entrant (P = 0 . 5 9 , ~< .05), and
the choice likelihood of the follower (P = - 1 . 7 3 , ~< .01) and the early entrant
(P = 1.78, p < .01).

Discussion. This experiment highlights the critical
role that the early entrant plays in a product category. Our results show that, in general, WOM becomes associated with
the early entrant; therefore, positive WOM regarding the follower (vs. negative WOM) increases the early entrant's likelihood of retrieval, consideration, and choice and decreases
the likelihood of considering the follower. Consistent with
research on the attraction effect, similarity between the two
focal brands benefits the early entrant and hurts the follower.
However, when the two brands appear similar, the positive
WOM about the follower, as opposed to negative WOM, also
benefits the follower by increasing its likelihood of consideration and decreasing the consideration and the choice probabilities for the early entrant.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
In this research, we set out to develop insights into the competitive dynamics between an early entrant and a follower by
studying the influences of (a) the type (vivid or pallid) and
the valence (positive or negative) of WOM information on a
follower brand and (b) the similarity between the two focal
brands on various stages of the consumer decision-making
process. We also demonstrate that the effect of WOM and its
interaction with similarity depends on the decision-making
task (stimulus based in Experiment 1 and memory based in
Experiment 2).
Similar to research on attraction effect (e.g., Huber &
Puto, 1983), we found that similarity between the early entrant and later entrant tends to favor the early entrant. Specifically, similarity between the two focal brands tends to (a)
enhance the consideration and the choice likelihood for the
early entrant in the stimulus-based task; (b) enhance the retrieval, the consideration, and the choice likelihood for the
early entrant in the memory-based decision-making task; and
(c) reduce the follower's consideration likelihood in the
memory-based task. Indeed, our results are consistent with
those of Zhang and Markman (1998), who found that common features are better recalled for the early entrant than for
later entrants.
Experiment 1 shows that positive WOM enhances the
consideration likelihood for the follower and decreases the
consideration probability for the early entrant, whereas negative WOM decreases the consideration chances for the follower, but not for the early entrant. The story is different
when follower/early entrant similarity is considered. Here,
cognitive resources are not particularly scarce in our
five-brand, stimulus-based, decision-making task, and
hence, consumers are able to make inferences (Kardes,
1994). Thus, as the two focal brands appear similar, (a) the
positive WOM regarding the follower tends to be partially
absorbed by the prototypical early entrant at the consideration stage of the decision-making process; and (b) the positive WOM regarding the follower lends credence to the fol-

lower, thereby increasing the consideration and the choice
probabilities for the follower. The early entrant appears, in
general, to be immune to negative WOM regarding the follower. This immunity is an important finding. Unlike positive
WOM, negative WOM appears not to be shared with the
early entrant. Instead, negative WOM regarding the focal follower appears to stay close to its target, decreasing the probability of considering the follower. However, when the early
entrant and follower are perceived as similar, negative WOM
regarding the follower increases consideration probability
for the early entrant. Apparently, as perceived similarity between the two brands increases, negative information concerning the follower does not transfer to the early entrant.
Experiment 2 shows that positive WOM, as opposed the
negative WOM regarding the follower, reduces the consideration probability for the follower and increases the retrieval,
consideration, and choice probabilities for the early entrant.
Consistent with our hypotheses, we found that as the two focal brands become similar, positive (vs. negative) WOM regarding the follower enhances the consideration likelihood
for the follower and reduces the retrieval consideration and
choice probabilities for the early entrant. Thus, as we expected, in our 10-brand, memory-based task, consumers do
not draw inferences, and, unlike the stimulus-based task,
positive WOM does not transfer to the early entrant.
Our research brings into clearer relief possible strategies
that a manager of a later entrant might adopt to parry the pioneering advantage. It seems that a me-too positioning (high
level of similarity between the focal follower and the early
entrant) must be accompanied by effective positive WOM regarding the follower. Otherwise, similarity works against the
follower for both stimulus- and memory-based decisions. It
is possible that the late entrant can use other means of communication such as advertising, promotions, and public relations that promote surrogate positive WOM. However, these
other means of communications are likely to generate less
powerful effects, as they are either impersonal or paid forms
of communication. In contrast, WOM is personal, unpaid
means of communication, and hence more credible (Arndt,
1967). The role of WOM communication varies for stimulus-based versus memory-based decision-making task. In a
stimulus-based task, WOM tends to act as a heuristic for initial short listing of brands, whereas in a memory-based task,
WOM helps on retrieval, consideration, and choice. Thus,
even for a low-risk, low-involvement product, encouraging
WOM outside of the retail store (the pointJplace of decision
making) is likely to be beneficial to the follower.
