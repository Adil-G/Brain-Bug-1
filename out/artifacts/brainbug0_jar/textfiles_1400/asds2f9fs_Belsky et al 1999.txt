Patterns of Marital Change and
Parent-ChildInteraction

In an examination of the interrelation of marital
and parent-child relationship subsystems in the
family, 100 families participating in the Pennsylvania Infant and Family Development Project
were studied when their first child turned three
years of age. Distinct patterns of marital change,
identified on the basis of marital reports obtained
at four points in time (during pregnancy and at 3,
9, and 36 months), were related to parent and
child behavior that was measured duringfree-play
and teaching sessions in the laboratory and composited by means of cluster analytic procedures.
Results revealed more systematic associations between marital change patterns andfather-child interaction than between marital change patterns
and mother-child interaction. Whereas discerned
associations in the case of men indicated that marriages that were deteriorating in quality were associated with more negative and intrusive father
behavior and more negative and disobedient child
behavior, some evidence of a more compensatory
process was discerned in the case of associations
between mothers' marriage and behavior. Findings are discussed in terms of relationship boundaries, alliances, and relationship styles.
Until just a short time ago, developmental
psychologists, family sociologists, and clinical
child psychologists toiled in what were essentially
different worlds doing research that was inherentCollege of Health and Human Development, Pennsylvania State

ly interrelated (Belsky, Rovine, and Fish, 1989).
In particular, in their studies of the transition to
parenthood, family sociologists inquired into the
effects of children on marriage but paid little attention to individual differences in children and
the actual nature of parent-child exchanges. Developmental psychologists, in contrast, endeavored to understand processes of reciprocal influence in the parent-child relationship, yet failed
to consider how parents' other primary relationship in the family, namely, the marriage, affected
what transpired between parent and child. And
finally, while clinical child psychologists seeking
to identify family processes responsible for child
behavior problems uncovered a link between
marital discord and child dysfunction, they generally failed to consider, or at least investigate
empirically, parent-child interaction patterns that
might be responsible for such associations
(Belsky, 1981; Emery, 1982).
The addition of the father to the study of the
parent-child relationship during the 1970s revealed a need to move beyond disciplinary boundaries that, by tradition, resulted in such dissociated inquiry into marriage, parenting, and child
development processes (Aldous, 1977; Belsky,
1981). Most of the research that has begun to examine the interrelation of marriage and parentchild relationships since that time involves studies
of families rearing infants and toddlers. The large
majority of findings emanating from these inquiries are generally consistent with the proposition that spousal support of both the emotional
(e.g., love, intimacy) and instrumental (e.g., child

care tasks) variety should be associated with
enhanced parental performance-on the part of
both mothers and fathers-and more harmonious
parent-infant interaction patterns and relationships (for a summary of relevant evidence, see
Belsky, 1990).
There is some indication that patterns of
fathering are more systematically related to patterns of marital interaction or measures of marital
adjustment/satisfaction than are patterns of
mothering (Barber, 1987; Belsky, 1979; Belsky,
Gilstrap, and Rovine, 1984; Dickie, 1987;
Goldberg and Easterbrooks, 1984); and it is particularly noteworthy that such findings have
emerged in studies of middle-class families as well
as in research on unmarried teenage mothers and
fathers (Lamb and Elster, 1985). The fact that
Belsky, Rovine, and Fish (1989) found in a longitudinal path analysis that marital interaction
when infants were one month of age actually predicted fathering but not mothering two months
later is consistent with the notion that men may be
more susceptible to marital influence, perhaps
because their parental roles are less scripted by
social convention. An alternative interpretation of
the entire corpus of data pertaining to the interrelation of marriage and fathering is that for
women the marital and parent-child relationships
are differentiated, whereas in the case of men a
general pattern of relating-actively involved versus disengaged-is applied to spouse and child
alike (Belsky et al., 1989).
Also noteworthy are recent findings suggesting
that the nature of the association between marital
quality and maternal behavior may change as the
child develops. In contrast to the evidence indicating that during the infant and toddler years higher
levels of marital satisfaction, harmony, and support tend to be associated with more sensitive and
supportive mothering, Brody, Pellegrini, and
Sigel (1986) recently reported in their study of
young school-age children that mothers in less satisfying marriages were more rather than less engaged in teaching their children when observed in
a laboratory setting, which suggests, perhaps,
some kind of compensatory involvement with the
child. In light of Brody and associates' additional
evidence that marital problems were linked with
less sensitive and more intrusive fathering, it
seems plausible that mothers might not simply
have been compensating for difficulties in their
own relationships with their spouses, but trying to

Journal of Marriage and the Family
make up for the child's experiences with his/her
father when marital relationships were problematical.
Virtually all the research conducted to date
linking marital and parent-child relationships has
been cross-sectional in design and, as such, does
not reflect the rather dynamic and changing
nature of marital relationship during the early
childrearing years. Although marital change during this period has been discussed in the literature
principally in terms of central tendencies, with
marital quality declining modestly on the average
across the transition to parenthood (for review,
see Belsky and Pensky, 1988), there is a good deal
of variation in the extent to which marriages
change. In fact, in a recent report appearing in
this journal on variation in marital change from
the last trimester of pregnancy through three years
Belsky and Rovine (1990)
postpartum,
distinguished four different change patterns,
which they described as accelerating decline,
linear decline, no change, and modest-positive increase.
In this report we seek to extend the Belsky and
Rovine (1990) research, which examined the antecedents of such change by focusing upon the
parent-child sequelae of variation in marital
change. In particular, using data obtained from
laboratory-based observations of the motherchild and father-child dyads when children were
three years of age, we endeavor to link patterns of
marital change across the first three years of parenthood with parent-child interaction observed
when children were three years of age. The major
goal of this work is to determine whether maternal, paternal, and child behavior are different in
households in which marital quality declines and
in which it does not. Even though we will examine
associations between marital change across the
transition to parenthood and parent-child interaction when children are three years of age, it is
problematical to think in terms of linear causality,
with parental and child behavior being a "consequence" of marital change. Because of the research design employed and the family system
framework from which it derives, the presumption guiding this inquiry is that marital and
parent-child processes are reciprocally related
over time.
The transition to parenthood is widely
recognized to be a time of dynamic change in the
family system, and since it is also presumed that

<-----Page 3----->489

Marital Change and Parent-Child Interaction
what transpires in one family subsystem (i.e., the
marriage) should be related to what transpires in
other subsystems (i.e., mother-child and fatherchild relationships), it stands to reason that, in
households in which marital quality deteriorates,
parent-child relationships may develop differently
than in those in which marital decline is not characteristic of the family system. After all, a deteriorating marriage should affect the psychological
well-being of the individual spouse and might well
result from problems within the marriage pertaining to childrearing attitudes and practices. This
would seem especially likely in families navigating
the shoals of parenthood for the very first time.
On the basis of the evidence reviewed earlier
pertaining to interrelation of marital quality and
parent-child relations, we anticipated that marital
change might be more systematically related to
father-child interaction patterns than to motherchild interaction patterns, with those husbands
experiencing no decline in marital quality or a
modest increase behaving in a more supportive
manner and their children evincing more pleasure
in relating to their fathers. Because we were studying three-year-olds, no prediction was advanced
regarding the nature of the associations that might
emerge between marital change and patterns of
mother-child interaction. Whereas the work of
Brody and associates (1986), dealing with children
from 5/2 to 7 /2 years old, suggested that
deteriorating marriages would be associated with
more positive, facilitative patterns of motherchild interaction, research on infants and toddlers
suggested the opposite, namely, that marital
decline would be associated with insensitive, intrusive, and/or disengaged patterns of maternal
behavior.

METHOD

Sample
The subjects of this investigation were 100
families participating in the second and third
cohorts of the Pennsylvania Child and Family
Development Project (Belsky et al., 1984). These
families enrolled in the project during the last
trimester of pregnancy; were studied intensively
during the infant's first year of life; and were
recontacted for subsequent study when the children were three years of age. All families were
Caucasian, predominantly of middle- and

working-class socioeconomic status. At time of
enrollment into the study, participating families
were in intact marriages and expecting their first
child. Average family income was $26,300 (SD =
10,400) and couples had been married an average
of 3.8 years (SD = 2.71). The mean age of
husbands and wives, respectively, was 28.9 (SD =
4.32) and 26.8 (SD = 3.66); and the two spouses
averaged 15.8 (SD = 2.89) and 15.0 (SD = 2.23)
years of education.
Design and Procedure
This report utilizes data from behavioral observations of parent-child interaction in a laboratory
setting when children were 36-37 months of age,
and self-reported marital quality assessments obtained at four measurement occasions (prenatal,
and 3, 9, and 36 months postpartum).
Measures of parent and child behavior were
obtained in the context of a one-hour session in
which each parent and his/her three-year-old
child were videotaped in a large laboratory playroom richly furnished with toys. Mother and child
were observed at 36 months, while fathers and
their children were observed at 37 months. Each
one-hour observation followed a fixed format,
consisting of seven episodes: parent-child free
play (10 min.), child with examiner (20 min.),
child alone (3 min.), reunion with parent (3 min.),
parent-child clean-up (6 min.), and parent-child
teaching task (10 min.). Only the first and last
episodes are the focus of the report. In the initial
and unstructured free-play episode, the parent
was to make him- or herself comfortable and do
whatever he or she felt like doing. In the final,
structured-teaching episode, the examiner introduced the parent and child to seven plastic bins,
each filled with either a model of blocks stacked
together to be copied or a puzzle to be completed.
The parent was instructed to assist the child in
completing the tasks but to let the child do the actual work.
Parent and child behavior was coded every
minute of the free-play and teaching-task episodes
by different sets of trained observers, using a series of 5-point rating scales; these per-minute ratings were then summed within episodes to create
total scores for free play and for teaching. This
approach was adopted as a compromise between
micro-analytic behavioral coding and global perepisode rating. Interrater agreement on minute-

<-----Page 4----->490

by-minute codings of parent and child behavior
was checked repeatedly and average .85 (kappa),
with a range from .62 to 1.00.
Parent behavior. On the basis of prior research on
parent-child relations that highlights the centrality
of affect (warmth) and control as influential
parameters of parental behavior (for review, see
Maccoby and Martin, 1983), the system for coding parental behavior focused upon these two dimensions, with separate raters coding these dimensions. Warmth/affection was coded with respect to four specific components: positive affect
(e.g., laughing with the child), positive feedback
(e.g., verbally praising what the child has just
done or said), negative affect (e.g., demeaning the
child, speaking harshly), and negative feedback
(e.g., verbal disapproval conditional on something the child has said or done). Because affect
and feedback scores of the same valence (positive,
negative) proved to be highly correlated within
episodes (r > .65, p < .001), these were summed
to create separate composite positive and negative
affect scores for the free-play and teaching episodes.
Four distinct aspects of control also were coded: facilitation (e.g., supporting the child in his or
her efforts to function competently and autonomously), intrusiveness (e.g., parental behavior
that is ill-timed, intrusive, excessive, and/or inappropriately controlling relative to what the child is
doing), undercontrolling (e.g., not providing support or assistance when such availability would
seem to be helpful to the child), and demands for
self-reliance (e.g., explicit or indirect requirements by the parent that the child be self-reliant).
No compositing of these scores proved necessary.
Child behavior. Three general dimensions of child
functioning were scored-attention, affect, and
social orientation-using eight rating scales and
three separate sets of raters. Focused attention reflected the extent to which the child was involved
with the play materials available. To measure
child affect, three aspects of children's feelings
were rated: positive affect (e.g., laughing with
parent), negative affect (e.g., displaying anger to
parent), and strange behaviors (on a 2-point
presence/absence scale), reflecting whether or not
the child engaged in any unusual behavior (like
rocking, hair play, finger picking, ear pulling)
that was presumed to reflect feelings of distress.

Journal of Marriage and the Family
Finally, four aspects of child social behavior were
coded: verbal and physical orientation to parent
(i.e., talking to and being in proximity of parent),
compliance (e.g., following through with a parent's specific directive), and disobedience (e.g.,
refusal to comply with a parent's request). Verbal
and physical orientation scores, which were
scored only in free play, were summed to create a
composite index of social orientation.

Marital Quality Assessments
Parents completed Braiker and Kelley's (1979)
25-item scale of intimate relations at four points
in time-during the last trimester of pregnancy
and again when the child was 3, 9, and 36/37
months of age. This instrument yields four scores,
three of which were employed in the analyses to
be reported. Conflict assesses the interpersonal
character of the relationship in terms of the extent
to which the partners engage in disputes (e.g.,
"How often do you and your partner argue?").
Love taps partners' feelings of attachment toward
each other (e.g., "To what extent do you have a
sense of 'belonging' with your partner?"). Finally, ambivalence measures spouses' doubts and uncertainties about the relationship (e.g., "How
confused are you about your feelings toward your
partner?"). Questions are answered on a 9-point
scale that ranges from "very little" or "not at all"
to "very much" or "extremely." The internal
consistencies of these scales across the four times
of measurement ranged from .61 to .92 for
husbands and wives.
Marital change patterns. The repeatedly measured
marital variables enabled us to identify different
patterns of marital change in the form of each
spouse's trajectory on a particular marriage variable over time. The procedure employed to
achieve this goal is summarized here; for further
details, see Belsky and Rovine (1990). Because
early analyses revealed sufficient independence of
the marriage measures when it came to identifying
marital trajectories, it was decided to consider
each of the three marital measures separately
rather than to composite them.
For each marriage variable (e.g., husband's
ambivalence), the four occasions of measurement
were transformed into three new dependent variables representing the degree of linear, quadratic,

<-----Page 5----->Marital Change and Parent-Child Interaction
and cubic change across time. Cutoff scores were
then established to categorize each type of change
(von Eye and Nesselroade, 1988). In the case of
linear change, for example, a zero score represented no change and intervals of one or more
standard deviations represented ordinal change
units. Similar cutoffs were established for
quadratic and cubic change scores.
For each marital variable categorized, the
linear and quadratic trend scores resulting from
this procedure for each change interval-that is,
from pregnancy to 3 months, 3 months to 9
months, and 9 months to 3 years-were then
crossed to create a 49-cell, two-way contingency
table representing different combinations of a
linear and quadratic trend over time. Visual inspection of the cell frequencies in this contingency
table resulted in the identification of four distinct
"patterns" of marital change for each marital
variable. Since zero change and positive change
were targeted (i.e., anticipated) marital trajectories, all cells with zero linear trend were collapsed into a first category and all cells with a positive
change were collapsed into a second category. (Increase in love scores and decreases in conflict and
ambivalence scores were considered as evidence of
positive change.) Consideration of combinations
of negative linear change and quadratic change resulted in the identification of two negative change
types, accelerating decline and linear decline.
Thus, each original set of repeatedly measured dependent variables for each spouse was categorized
into one of four curve types: positive change, no
change, linear decline, or accelerating decline. For
illustrative purposes, Figure 1 depicts the mean
scores at each time of measurement of these four
marital change patterns in the case of one of the
variables, wife love. For purpose of this report,
individuals assigned to the two decline groups
were joined together, as were those assigned to the
no-change and modest-increase groups, to permit
comparisons of parent and child behavior in families in which marital quality did and did not
decline.
RESULTS

Data Reduction: Cluster Analysis
In order to reduce the number of parent and child
variables subject to analysis, subgroups of parents
(mothers, fathers) and children (child-withmother, child-with-father) in the free-play and

491
teaching episodes were identified by means of
cluster analysis. Cluster analysis is a multivariate
technique for grouping individuals who exhibit
similar profiles of scores across a variety of measures (Aldenderfer and Blashfield, 1984). Thus, it
provides a means of focusing upon patterns of behavior that go together within individuals, rather
than upon individual behaviors.
Separate analyses of mothers' and fathers'
summed ratings within the free-play and teaching
episodes resulted in three-cluster solutions in the
case of each parent, in each episode (see Table 1).
For mothers as well as fathers, in free play and in
teaching, the three clusters could be described as
follows: (a) positive, facilitative-which was always defined by the highest facilitation scores,
and sometimes defined by the highest positive affect scores (fathers) and lowest negative affect
scores (mothers); (b) disengaged-which was always defined by the lowest positive affect scores
and the lowest facilitation scores, and sometimes
defined by the lowest intrusive scores (mother free
play, father teaching) and lowest demands for
self-reliance (mother free play, mother teaching,
and father free play); and (c) intrusive, asynchronous, and aversive-which was always defined by the highest intrusive scores, highest negative affect scores, and highest demands for selfreliance, and once by the highest positive affect
scores (mother) and highest undercontrolling
scores (all except mother free play).
Children's summed rating scores were clustered separately by episode (free play, teaching)
and parent (child-with-mother, child-withfather). For the child-with-mother episodes, two
clusters emerged for free play and for the teaching
task (see Table 2): (a) child-with-mother positive-which, in both episodes, was defined by the
highest focused attention, highest positive affect
and, for free play, the highest social orientation
scores: (b) child-with-mother negative-which,
again in both episodes, was defined by the highest
negative affect, strange behavior, and disobedience scores.
The child-with-father analyses resulted in a
more differentiated pattern, as three final clusters, rather than two, best characterized the data
in each of the two episodes: (a) child-withfather positive-which was generally defined by
the highest focused attention scores, the highest
positive affect and orientation scores in free play,
and lowest negative affect scores in teaching; (b)

maternal behavior or child behavior with mother.
More specifically, when husband marital trajectories were crossed with father free-play clusters,
two of three associations proved reliable (love x
free play: 2[2] = 7.64, p < .05; ambivalence x
free play: 2[21 = 8.92, p < .05; none were significant, however, when father teaching behavior
was examined in relation to marital change. When
child behavior with father in free play and in
teaching were each crossed with father's marital
change, three of six tests of association achieved
statistical significance (love x free play: X2[2] =
6.47, p < .05; conflict x free play: x2[2] = 7.41,
p < .05; conflict x teaching: x2[2] = 6.54, p <
.05). In the case of wives, marital change was
found to relate to maternal behavior in only one
of six instances (love x free play: X2[21= 7.68, p
< .05), with the same being true of the relation
between child behavior with mother and marital
change (conflict x teaching: x2[2] = 8.40, p <
.01).
Consideration of the substantive nature of
these significant associations reveals that, in all
cases, neutral/positive marital change in the case
of husbands was, as expected, associated with
positive child behavior and positive-facilitative
paternal behavior, whereas marital decline was associated with intrusive fathering and negative
child behavior. Illustrative evidence of such associations can be found in Table 3, which shows

that husbands whose feelings of love for their
spouse declined over time were disproportionately
likely to fall in the intrusive cluster and have children who behaved negatively, whereas those
whose feelings of love did not change or increased
modestly were disproportionately likely to show
positive-facilitative behavior and have children
who behaved positively.
Interestingly, the substantive nature of the single significant association in the case of wives'
marital change patterns and maternal behavior
was different (see top of Table 4): Wives whose
feelings of love declined were disproportionately
likely to fall into the positive-facilitative free-play
cluster. The single significant association between
wife marital change and child behavior with
mother reflected a pattern reminiscent of those involving husband marital trajectories: in the case
of spousal conflict, marital deterioration was
associated with negative child behavior during the
teaching task.
The results indicating that deterioration in
marital quality and negative father-child interaction went together, and that-at least in one instance-deteriorating marriage and more positive
mothering were related, led us to undertake a follow-up analysis. This was designed to explore the
Brody et al. (1986) hypothesis that the "compensatory" mothering discerned might have reflected
an effort by wives to make up for their husbands'
negative-intrusive fathering in the face of marital

decline. Thus, we tested, via chi-square analysis,
whether a tendency existed for a specific combination of mother-child and father-child relationships, namely, one involving mother positiveness
and father intrusiveness, to coincide with a decline
in husband and/or wife feelings of love for their
spouse. As the within-family findings presented in
Table 5 indicate, fathers were more likely to be intrusive and mothers positive when either parent,
or both, experienced a decline in their feelings of
love for their spouse. Note that in only 1 of 23
families in which this patterning of maternal and
paternal styles emerge was there no evidence of
decline in feelings of love. Such disproportionate
association between maternal positiveness and
father intrusiveness under conditions of decline in
love (by either or both spouses) is consistent with
Brody and associates' suggestion that positive
maternal behavior may reflect an attempt to compensate for father insensitivity.

DISCUSSION
Most research on the interrelation of marital and
parent-child relationships is cross-sectional in design. And virtually all investigations that are longitudinal involve the simple prediction of parentchild interaction at one point in time, using an assessment of the marital relationship obtained at
some earlier measurement occasion. An inherent
problem with such studies is the assumption implicit in their designs that it is the quality of the
marriage at a single point in time that influences
parent-child relations. The fact, however, that individual differences in marital quality are relatively stable (in this study, pregnancy: 3-year rs >
.50, p < .001), so that effects of early marital
quality may be mediated by later marital quality,
or that the effects of later marital quality may be a
function of earlier (and unmeasured) marital

495

quality, raises important interpretive problems
with the findings emanating from cross-sectional
and simple longitudinal designs.
In this investigation we sought to advance the
study of the interrelation of family subsystems by
adopting what we regarded as a more dynamic approach to family functioning, in particular, one
that reflected the changing nature of marriage
across the early childrearing years and that took
advantage of repeated measurements of marital
quality. In a related report that appeared in this
journal and served as the foundation for the current study, we found that distinctly different
marital trajectories could be identified and, to a
great extent, these could be predicted on the basis
of demographic, personality, and marital information available prior to the child's birth (Belsky
and Rovine, 1990). In this report, we sought to extend this research by examining associations between variation in marital change from the last trimester of pregnancy through the child's third
birthday with patterns of parent and child behavior observed in the laboratory when children
were three years of age.
The most noteworthy finding to emerge from
this research is that, as indicated in many, though
by no means all, studies of infants and toddlers,
what transpires between father and child appears
to be more systematically related to the marital
relationship than what goes on between mother
and child. As suggested earlier, this may be because husbands are more susceptible to influences
in general, as their parental role is less scripted by
social convention. Another possibility is that
women more than men can maintain psychological and behavioral boundaries between their family relationships. Whereas men who have difficulties with their wives may have trouble "compartmentalizing" their affect and thus relate negatively to their children as well, women may be
more skilled at keeping the mother-child and
marital relationships separate.
With regard to specific findings, recall that
husbands whose love for their spouses declined
over time and whose doubts about the durability
and wisdom of their marriage (i.e., ambivalence)
increased, behaved toward their young children in
a more negative and intrusive manner than did
other fathers. Men who evinced no such negative
change in their marriages, in contrast, were disproportionately likely to express positive affect
toward their young children and to interact with

<-----Page 10----->496
them in a sensitive, facilitating way, at least during free play. This was as true of father-son as of
father-daughter relationships.
Because related research on this sample reveals
that it is men who evince less orientation toward
the feelings of others even before their children
are born who are disproportionately likely to experience decline in marital quality (Belsky and
Rovine, 1990), one must be cautious about inferring from the findings just summarized that deteriorating marriages undermine father sensitivity.
Just as plausible is the prospect that certain kinds
of men who interact with their three-year-olds in a
more negative, intrusive manner during free play
simply relate to their wives in analogous ways that
undermine their marital relationships. It is also
possible that men's negative interactions with
their children fuel many marital difficulties, especially if wives seek to protect their offspring (see
below). In all likelihood-and as would be expected, given the family system perspective that
guided this inquiry-adult psychological, marital,
and parent-child processes mutually influence one
another.
The findings linking marital change to child
behavior with the father clearly indicate that the
child's functioning is not spared by whatever process is responsible for the interrelation of husband's marital experiences and their functioning
as fathers. In fact, child behavior with father-in
free play and in teaching-was more consistently
related to husbands' marital change than was
men's own parental behavior. Recall that children
who expressed relatively high levels of negative affect, disobedience, and strange behavior when in
the presence of their fathers in the free play and
teaching situations had fathers whose feelings of
love for their spouse declined from pregnancy
through the child's third birthday and who experienced increasing levels of marital conflict during
this period. By the time the child is three years of
age (if not before), it is certainly conceivable that
his or her negative behavior actually fosters deteriorating marital relations. Not inconsistent
with this line of reasoning is Block, Block, and
Gjerde's (1986) discovery that son's behavior
problems actually preceded marital dissolution.
The point to be made here is not that negative
child behavior by itself causes declining marital
quality, but rather that reciprocal and multidirectional pathways in the family system must be considered.

Journal of Marriage and the Family
The data pertaining to marital decline and
child behavior with father are dramatically consistent with findings linking marital discord and
child behavior problems in clinic populations
(Emery, 1982), as well as with the single significant association to emerge in this study between
wives' marital change patterns and child behavior
with mother. Recall that wives who also experienced increased conflict over time in their marriages had children who were in the group that
evinced the most negative affect, strange behavior, and disobedience during the teaching episode. Such results are certainly consistent with the
proposition that associations between child behavior problems and marital discord in the clinical
literature are likely mediated by what transpires in
the parent-child relationship.
The fact that only one of six simple tests of
association revealed a relation between mothers'
marital experiences and their behavior toward
their children suggests that women may be more
able than men to maintain boundaries between
their relationships with their spouses and their
children. The one significant association that did
emerge-namely, the link between deteriorating
feelings of love for the spouse and more positive
and supportive behavior during free play-is consistent with findings emanating from Brody and
associates' (1986) study of older children, yet generally inconsistent with results of studies of infants and toddlers (see introduction). This result
clearly suggests that the nature of the relation between marital and parent-child subsystems in the
family may change as the child gets older. Consistent with this interpretation are data from the subjects of this study demonstrating that, during the
first year of life, infant-mother attachment security is associated with less precipitous decline in
positive marital activities and sentiments and less
marked increase in negative marital activities and
sentiments (Belsky et al., 1989).
Although the evidence in this study of threeyear-olds and in Brody and associates' investigation of young elementary school children raises
the prospect that a compensatory process emerges
sometime after the first two years of life, it would
be a mistake to conclude that this compensatory
process has been fully illuminated. First, because
only a single indication of compensation emerged,
one should exercise caution before presuming its
generality. Further, the fact that the follow-up
analysis was consistent with the Brody et al.

<-----Page 11----->497

Marital Change and Parent-Child Interaction
(1986) proposition that mothers may be compensating for their husbands' insensitive fathering
should not eliminate from consideration an additional and complimentary compensatory process
-namely, that some women may seek relationship satisfaction with their children to make up
for what they lose in their marriages. Given the
system perspective that guided this inquiry, there
is also need to consider the prospect that it may be
the wife's involvement with the child, particularly
if it contrasts with the father's style of involvement, that fuels marital distress and decline and,
thereby, stimulates more negative, intrusive
fathering.
Finally, it should not be assumed that one
form of compensation is less (or more) problematical than another. Even though a mother's involvement with the child to compensate for loss of
love in her relationship with her husband raises
the spectre of enmeshment and boundary dissolution in the clinical sense, and thereby concern
about the child's developmental prospects, it is
equally conceivable that efforts to make up for
the father's behavior may generate its own problematic outcomes. It is certainly possible that an
alliance between mother and child, forged on the
basis of their respective difficulties with husband/
father, could promote additional relationship
problems that serve to undermine further the
child's well-being rather than buffer him or her
from stress in the father-child relationship. Needless to say, more research is required before the issues raised in this speculative discussion are resolved. What the findings from this study do indicate, however, is that a particular type of family
system-namely, that in which feelings of spousal
love decline and in which fathers are especially
negative and mothers are especially positive,
merits particular attention.
