Most research in evidence-based entrepreneurship builds on quantitative designs, which
is unfortunate because qualitative studies provide a unique contribution to the domain
of entrepreneurship. They look at distinctive phenomena in their specific time period and
context in one way or another, and can help generate and test new theories. We, therefore,
suggest using a systematic synthesis of case studies to aggregate the findings of qualitative
research. Moreover, as a first step, we developed an example to demonstrate how this
approach can advance evidence-based entrepreneurship. Specifically, we synthesized 13
cases to examine how business clusters increase the performance of firms within clusters.

Evidence is the essence of human knowledge (Rousseau, Manning, & Denyer, 2008)

Introduction
Evidence-based decisions and practice models are increasingly important in entrepreneurship research, a trend that is accompanied by an increasing number of meta-analyses
in this domain (Frese, Bausch, Schmidt, Rauch, & Kabst, 2012a). However, the synthesis
of scientific evidence in entrepreneurship is clearly biased toward quantitative research,
which is unfortunate because, in this way, scientific evidence in the field of entrepreneurship is accumulated by focusing on studies that are based on specific methodologies and
epistemological assumptions. However, the field of entrepreneurship is diversified, which

(Davidsson, Low, & Wright, 2001). As a consequence, the field of entrepreneurship is
highly fragmented, and there is a lack of agreement on core concepts and definitions of
key constructs. Integrating the scientific evidence in entrepreneurship research requires
balancing contributions from alternative research strategies (Low, 2001). To account for
the diversity of approaches and methodologies used in entrepreneurship, we suggest
broadening the area of evidence-based entrepreneurship by accumulating the knowledge
that has become available from qualitative case study research.
Specifically, this review introduces the systematic synthesis of qualitative case
studies and describes techniques to synthesize qualitative research systematically. The
goal of the systematic synthesis of qualitative case studies is to accumulate, organize,
and interpret the studies, with the aim of achieving a level of understanding that transcends the results of the individual studies (Campbell et al., 2003; Rousseau et al.,
2008). To our knowledge, there is not a single review in the domain of entrepreneurship
that has tried to synthesize qualitative case studies systematically. A systematic synthesis
of case studies provides multiple contributions to entrepreneurship research. First, the
field of entrepreneurship needs to establish scientific evidence about what has been done
to identify areas of maturation and areas where more knowledge and strong practice
recommendations need to be developed (Chandler & Lyon, 2001; Rauch & Frese, 2006).
This is important, particularly as the field of entrepreneurship needs to develop integrated theoretical frameworks. Second, the systematic synthesis of qualitative case
studies generates evidence that cannot be generated through quantitative meta-analyses.
Case studies provide unique contributions to the field of entrepreneurship, and thereby
contribute substantially to knowledge in entrepreneurship research (Perren & Ram,
2004). For example, case studies often provide unique information about specific time
frames and contexts. Moreover, case studies often look at reasons behind specific behavior that may not be fully revealed in a quantitative study. Additionally, qualitative case
studies can examine study settings that cannot be easily addressed via quantitative
designs. Third, although the aim of case studies is often not to generate broad generalizations, the systematic synthesis of case studies can be used to test theories and hypotheses. Thus, when different case studies are collected across a wide variety of contexts,
the cumulative results provide estimates about generalizability (Yin, 2003). By accumulating the unique contributions provided by case-oriented studies, our approach bridges
the gap between qualitative research and the available case study research to a wider
audience. Fourth, while meta-analyses usually attempt to trace results around the true
value (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004), the systematic synthesis of qualitative case studies
includes techniques that allow investigators to interpret research aiming to create tentative theories of phenomena. The focus of such a synthesis could be on the accumulation
across a set of qualitative case studies where the aim is to derive new theoretical insights.
In this way, the synthesis itself becomes a study that contributes to the generation of
evidence in the entrepreneurship domain.
Thus, we argue that the entrepreneurship domain should develop robust research
evidence across methods and different forms of data (including qualitative and quantitative research) to specify whether or not certain effects depend on specific contextual
conditions (Pittaway & Cope, 2007; Rousseau et al., 2008). In the following sections, we
describe the potential contributions of a synthesis of case studies and the philosophical
foundations of our approach, and we explain the most important steps involved in a
systematic synthesis of qualitative research before discussing an example as an illustration
of such an approach.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->The Systematic Synthesis of Qualitative Research: Conceptual Concerns
Evidence-based entrepreneurship is concerned with the systematic synthesis of knowledge based on several sources of information and transcends the findings of individual
studies (Frese, Bausch, Schmidt, Rauch, & Kabst, 2012b). Evidence-based approaches
have a major impact in medical science, where randomized controlled trials are generally
accepted as the most valid source of evidence (Davies & Nutley, 1999). Other disciplines,
such as management, have different research traditions and, accordingly, used different
methods to establish scientific evidence (Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003). The field of
entrepreneurship has increasingly accepted quantitative meta-analyses as a way of establishing evidence in this domain. While the usefulness of meta-analyses in entrepreneurship has been discussed elsewhere (Frese et al., 2012a; Rauch & Frese, 2006), there are
additional methods for establishing scientific evidence that have not been introduced to
this area of research. This article focuses on the systematic synthesis of qualitative case
studies. Case studies are a type of research that describes a single event or unit of analysis
determined by the researcher (Gephart, 2004, p. 458). Systematic syntheses of case study
research have been conducted in areas such as healthcare, nursing research, and psychotherapy (Briner & Denyer, 2012). Moreover, in the field of management, some of the most
recognized papers on strategic decision making were based on the synthesis of qualitative
case studies (Miller & Friesen, 1977; Mintzberg, Raisinghani, & Théorêt, 1976). Thus,
the systematic synthesis of qualitative case studies can offer a substantial contribution to the
knowledge generated in a given discipline, although to our knowledge it is an approach that
has not yet been tried in entrepreneurship research.
We argue that it is important to take case study evidence into account in the domain
of entrepreneurship because case studies are able to pursue research questions systematically that are not easily answerable by findings generated by quantitative methods.
Through case studies, it is possible to study samples that are extremely small and
exclusive because the members of the population are very distinct and critical, for
example, Nobel laureates or leaders of a business cluster. Such outliers need to be studied
by relying also on qualitative techniques (Zuckerman, 1972). Additionally, case study
research often explores underresearched contexts and new concepts that have been studied
less frequently. This allows researchers to address and interpret complex and/or unique
phenomena embedded in different contexts through an explorative orientation, by making
observations, specifying constructs and measurements, and identifying patterns and regularities. Moreover, case study research is useful for examining entire processes, and finally
can address the interconnectedness of processes, phenomena, and contexts (Pettigrew,
1997). To summarize, we argue that case studies provide a unique contribution to the area
of entrepreneurship, and should therefore be included in evidence-based entrepreneurship.
To include case studies in evidence-based entrepreneurship, we rely on specific
assumptions about the nature of inquiries, about how case studies could be synthesized,
and about the type of research that is suitable for such a synthesis. First, we discuss the
assumptions inherent in our approach.

The Nature of Inquiry That Is Suitable for a Systematic Synthesis of
Qualitative Research
Qualitative research in the domain of entrepreneurship is characterized by a host of
different approaches that are based on different assumptions about reality, the nature
of knowledge, and the extent to which they aim to apply scientific insights to a broader
and more general context (Crotty, 1998; Johnson, Buehring, Cassell, & Symon, 2006).

<-----Page 3----->The multifaceted methodologies used in entrepreneurship research to generate knowledge, such as grounded theory (Lopez, Cunha, & Palma, 2009), ethnographic studies
(Kodithuwakku & Rosa, 2002), phenomenological studies (Cope, 2011), or narratives
(Gartner, 2007), suggest that qualitative research is far away from a shared research
paradigm. Moreover, not all these approaches strive for validity and generalization
(compare, e.g., Creswell, 2009; Johnson et al.; McKelvey, 2002).
Since we propose synthesizing case studies, we assume that the studies have something in common that can be synthesized. Therefore, we assume that the cases reflect a
certain existing reality. However, such a reality does not need to exist in an objective
sense or as a part of a material world, but may also include unobservable entities (Lawson,
2009). As long as such entities can be operationalized, they can be studied and synthesized
empirically. Moreover, we assume that scientific theories are the best approximations of
this reality (McKelvey, 1997). Thus, theory has a relationship to a reality or a meaningful
reference that can be studied scientifically. Knowledge derives from many different kinds
of evidence that can be captured imperfectly and probabilistically. Thus, investigations
do not provide a full explanation of phenomena. Scientific inquiry can make phenomena
observable through scientific instruments, and research findings are always subjected to
falsification (Dul & Hak, 2008). Since this approach assumes that theory leads to prediction and that theory represents that proportion of reality that is within the scope of the
theory, the results of different studies within this scope can be compared and synthesized
in an evidence-based approach (Pawson, 2002; Tourish, 2012). Finally, our approach
assumes that it is possible to generalize empirical observation to some broader category,
other situations, or theory (analytical generalization; Yin, 2003). While new and distinctive concepts and practices are difficult to generalize immediately, qualitative researchers
start their field investigation by identifying central organizing ideas (the so-called
sensitizing concepts) as points of departure from which to study the data and strive for
analytical generalization (from empirical observations to theory building) (Eisenhardt,
1989). The theories become grounded and robust when the researchers verify their
findings by looking at the same phenomenon from different angles using different data
collection strategies and data sources (Yin). This process of analytical generalization may
produce the so-called theories of the middle range (Merton, 1957). With their modesty and
inbuilt contingency, these middle range theories are open to generalization. Thus, generalizations are not based on sampling but on logical inferences based on the theoretical
model (Johnson et al., 2006). Eisenhardt and Yin have legitimized case studies in this
tradition, and they described methods for using case studies for theory building as well as
for providing practice evidence.
In summary, our approach to synthesize qualitative case studies builds on certain
assumptions of scientific realism (Leplin, 1984; McKelvey, 1998). It is important to note
that these assumptions are not shared by all researchers (Creswell, 2009).

The Nature of Synthesis Suitable in an Evidence-Based Approach
Our assumptions about the nature of inquiry suitable for a synthesis of qualitative
research affect our understanding of how knowledge should be synthesized (Rousseau
et al., 2008). Existing literature reports numerous different approaches to synthesize
qualitative research (Denyer & Tranfield, 2006; Dixon-Woods, Agarwal, Young, Jones, &
Sutton, 2004; Finfgeld, 2003), which typically rely on core criteria for evaluating qualitative literature: They have to be systematic and organized, transparent and explicit,
replicable, and they have to synthesize the results (Briner & Denyer, 2012). At the same
time, there are considerable differences between the various approaches. We think that it

is useful to categorize these approaches into three categories: aggregative, interpretative,
and integrative approaches (Table 1). Although aggregative approaches have predominantly been suggested to synthesize quantitative research (Hoon, 2013; Rousseau et al.,
2008), they can also be used to synthesize case studies and biographies. Aggregating case
studies is useful in an evidence-based approach because it aims at integrating comparative
phenomena across studies, and in doing so generalizing research evidence. Generalizations are necessary in any evidence-based approach. Moreover, aggregative approaches
are based on the scientific realism paradigm. The advantage of the aggregative synthesis
is that it relies on a systematic and replicable process. Moreover, it is frequently based on
well-formulated research questions. Furthermore, the aggregative synthesis of qualitative
data often involves the quantification of the information (Christensen & Carlile, 2009). In
addition, this approach enables researchers to categorize circumstances and moderator
variables. It is also important to note that aggregative studies are not only interested in
increasing power through increasing the sample size. In fact, they can contribute to theory
testing and theory development (Eisenhardt, 1989; Hak & Dul, 2010). For example, one
meta-analysis compared broad and narrow task-related traits, and thereby shifted the focus
of the personality approach to entrepreneurship (Rauch & Frese, 2007). The literature
discusses different techniques to aggregate research findings. The traditional metaanalysis is the most prominent example of an aggregative approach (Hunter & Schmidt,
2004). However, aggregative approaches are not limited to meta-analyses; there are
several other methods that aim at integrating the results of qualitative studies
(Dixon-Woods et al., 2004; Larsson, 1993). For example, cross-case surveys, as proposed
by Yin (2003), systematically aggregate the findings of individual case studies, and
similarly Eisenhardt (1989) has argued for replication of qualitative research. As a matter
of fact, these scholars suggest three steps for building evidence from cases: within-case
analysis, cross-case pattern search, and replication (Hak & Dul). Finally, qualitative
comparative analysis can be used to achieve causal inferences based on a number of cases
(Ragin, 1987). Thus, aggregative approaches have been used to synthesize quantitative as
well as qualitative research.

<-----Page 5----->Interpretive synthesis aims at developing new interpretations of qualitative study
findings that are different from the results reported in individual studies (Noblit & Hare,
1988), which requires the deconstruction and decontextualization of study findings and
composing them into new, higher order constructs (Finfgeld, 2003). Studies in this tradition
are predominantly nested in a relativistic paradigm and rely on an inductive approach,
which means that, in most cases, they do not use a predefined coding system. Interpretative
approaches develop concepts and categories from which they develop a theory (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967). This type of synthesis relies on qualitative studies, such as case studies and
narratives. One of the most frequently used integrative approaches is meta-ethnography
(Noblit & Hare). The goal of meta-ethnography is to develop higher order constructs and
develop new research questions. Meta-ethnography relies on a systematic process involving
the creation of themes and metaphors, the comparison of themes and metaphors across
studies, and the reciprocal translation into a higher order interpretation. Meta-synthesis is
another example of an interpretative synthesis that relies on an inductive, explorative
methodology to synthesize research (Hoon, 2013). These interpretative approaches are less
useful for an evidence-based approach, since they do not aim for generalizations but for
ideographic interpretations (Creswell, 2009; Finfgeld).
Integrative synthesis synthesizes evidence by combining different data collection
methods, for instance qualitative and quantitative research, allowing researchers to
overcome the weaknesses inherent in individual methods. An example of an integrative
analysis is the Bayesian meta-analysis, where the evidence of different methods is pooled
by statistically combining two data sets (Dixon-Woods et al., 2004). In the domain of
entrepreneurship research, Pittaway and Cope (2007) combined systematic literature
reviews and bibliographic analysis to explore entrepreneurship education. Another study
used bibliographic analysis to investigate strategic entrepreneurship (Krauss, Marxt,
Filser, & Guieu, 2011). However, in these cases, the aim was not to synthesize qualitative
research; instead, the authors produced a qualitative review based on quantitative as well
as qualitative data. Moreover, their primary goal was not to review qualitative studies, but
rather to provide a thematic analysis of the field. Finally, these kinds of reviews are
difficult to replicate because of lacking standardizations of the methodology of the review
and contested definitions of quality (Rousseau et al., 2008). For these reasons, we disregard systematic literature reviews (Short, Ketchen, Shook, & Ireland, 2010) for an
evidence-based approach.
To summarize, existing literature suggests various methods of synthesizing qualitative
case studies. As with any qualitative and quantitative research, the research question and
available evidence determine which methodology should be used. In other words, the
approach should fit its purpose (Briner & Denyer, 2012, p. 124). We advance the strategy
of synthesizing research in an evidence-based approach with the aim of integrating the
results of case studies, guiding practice recommendations, and opening new areas for
research. Since this type of synthesis aims for generalization, the synthesis needs to build
on a realistic scientific paradigm. Moreover, as is common in evidence-based approaches,
we suggest that the decisions and steps accomplished through the synthesis should be
shared, and thus should be replicable. This type of synthesis requires an aggregative
methodology.

The Type of Case Study Suitable for a Systematic Synthesis of
Qualitative Case Studies
Aggregative methods require the studies being synthesized to be relatively homogeneous (Rousseau et al., 2008). In particular, case studies have been suggested as being
338

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->useful for aggregative synthesis (Jensen & Rodgers, 2001; Newig & Fritsch, 2009).
However, the case study methodology reflects relatively multifaceted research approaches
in entrepreneurship research, which means that the entity of study suitable to a qualitative
synthesis of case studies research needs to be defined more closely. Generally speaking,
it is important for the case studies to provide sufficient information to analyze and
aggregate the cases. The information must, to some extent, reflect an underlying reality
inherent in the case (compare above). This would ideally be accomplished in descriptive
case studies (Yin, 2003), but also by case studies that provide an approximation of an
underlying reality. Case studies that rely on the interpretations of the researcher and the
interaction between the researcher and the case, and on interpretative and constructivistic
paradigms, cannot be synthesized in an evidence-based approach. In addition, case studies
that can be used for the synthesis can include a description of one unit of observation, they
can be part of a publication (e.g., studies including several cases), and they may consist of
data from multiple publications (e.g., when a case has been published in multiple outlets).
Likewise, case studies may focus on individual entrepreneurs, firms, and organizations, or
some broader defined entrepreneurial context (such as clusters, incubators, or regions).
Moreover, it is also possible to distinguish different types of cases (Jensen & Rodgers,
2001), for example, snapshot case studies, longitudinal cases studies, pre–post case
studies, patchwork case studies (Hawthorne studies), and comparative cases studies. All of
these different types of cases are useful entities for the systematic synthesis of qualitative
research.
In addition, it is necessary to develop evaluation criteria that ensure that the cases
included in the analysis are methodologically sophisticated enough to be included in the
systematic synthesis of case studies. However, different types of case studies have developed different criteria for assessing the methodological quality of the cases (Johnson et al.,
2006). Some researchers simply apply criteria used in quantitative research to the evaluation of case studies (Gibbert, Ruigrok, & Wicki, 2008). Thus, case studies can be synthesized, provided that the requirements of construct validity (e.g., establish a clear chain of
evidence), internal validity (e.g., work with a clear framework), external validity (e.g., strive
for generalizability), and reliability (e.g., clarify the research procedures and establish a
case study protocol) (Gibbert et al.) are met. However, some scholars relying on scientific
realism have developed criteria that are more consistent with the underlying philosophical
assumptions, replacing internal validity with credibility (authentic representation, triangulation; Jick, 1979), external validity with transferability (extent of applicability), reliability
with dependability (minimization of researcher idiosyncrasies), and objectivity with
confirmability (researcher self-criticism) (Johnson et al., p. 138). These evaluation criteria
can be readily applied to the cases included in the synthesis.
To summarize, there are different types of case studies that qualify for the systematic
synthesis of case study research. In either case, the cases included should be based on a
scientific realistic research paradigm (Leplin, 1984). It is useful if case studies included in
the synthesis are comparable and homogeneous. The remaining heterogeneity should be
accounted for in the cross-case analysis, for example, by coding moderator variables.
Finally, it is necessary to develop a quality assessment of each case study to determine
criteria for the inclusion in the synthesis.

Description of the Process of Conducting a Systematic Synthesis of
Qualitative Case Studies
The systematic synthesis of case studies should involve a methodological approach
that makes it possible to share the decisions made at each step of the process. Although
March, 2014

339

<-----Page 7----->there is a fair amount of literature describing the steps involved when conducting such
a review in the areas of management and healthcare (Briner & Denyer, 2012; Finfgeld,
2003; Rousseau et al., 2008), this type of review is new to the domain of entrepreneurship.
Moreover, because there are systematic differences between entrepreneurship and other
areas, which may affect the review process, our aim is to describe the five steps of
systematic synthesis (Thorne, Jensen, Kearney, Noblit, & Sandelowski, 2004): (1) defining a research question, (2) developing criteria for study location, (3) developing criteria
for study inclusion, (4) conducting within-case analysis, and (5) conducting cross-case
analysis.
As with any meta-analysis, a systematic synthesis of qualitative research starts with a
research question, which defines the universe of case study evidence in question (Jensen
& Rodgers, 2001). Aggregative approaches typically answer a relatively specific theoretically informed research question that addresses specific constructs, and as such supports
operationalization and the selection of primary studies. Thereby, the research question
specifies the participants (entrepreneur, owner, or manager) in the study, the level of
analysis (firm level or individual level), and the time frame (e.g., before or after the
economic crisis). The research question does not need to be in line with the questions
addressed in the primary studies. For example, qualitative studies typically have a qualitative research question such as “how do entrepreneurs mobilize resources?” A synthesis
of qualitative studies may very well address a quantitative research question such as “are
entrepreneurs aligning more resources more successfully?” Question formulation is a
complex process requiring attention to issues related to the entrepreneurial effort itself, as
well as to the complexities associated with entrepreneurial firms. Therefore, it is useful to
ask practitioners as well as entrepreneurship researchers for an assessment and interpretation of the question to avoid developing a poorly specified question and obscuring
content-related issues related to the question.
Once the research question has been defined, it guides the search for the type of
studies that should be included in the synthesis. Unfortunately, the study location process
may be more complicated for qualitative case studies than it is for quantitative studies
(Evans, 2002). While major entrepreneurship journals, such as Entrepreneurship Theory
and Practice and Journal of Business Venturing, occasionally publish case studies, qualitative research is not the dominant study design presented in these journals.1 However,
qualitative research is not absent in entrepreneurship literature, but it tends to be published
in other outlets, for example, in books and special issues (Gartner & Birley, 2002;
Neergaard & Ulhoi, 2007). Moreover, the descriptive titles of many case studies make it
less likely to identify them by key word search. Additionally, because the content of
abstracts and the index terms being used make it more difficult to identify relevant case
studies as compared with quantitative studies (Evans, 2002), the study location process
needs to include different databases and a range of different search terms to identify
relevant studies (Shaw et al., 2004). Another issue that is relevant to the study location
process is the number of studies that should be located and included in the synthesis. Some
scholars argue that the full body of evidence, published and unpublished, needs to be
included in the synthesis (Briner & Denyer, 2012; Rousseau et al., 2008). This approach
has the advantage of, for instance, reducing the likelihood of publication bias. However,
this strategy can be overly complex and impede deep analysis. If the synthesis aims to
achieve saturated coding categories, theoretical sampling may be an economical way of
dealing with complexity (Finfgeld, 2003).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->As with traditional meta-analyses, the criteria for case study inclusion need to be
specified (Tranfield et al., 2003). We suggested including criteria regarding quality and
comparability of case studies, and moreover suggested to aggregate cases studies with the
same epistemological foundation (compare above). In addition to these formal criteria,
the scope of the synthesis should be defined in advance, determining which type of studies
can be included in the systematic synthesis of the case studies. All criteria for the inclusion
and exclusion of studies should be reported to ensure that the results can be replicated.
After deciding which studies to include, they need to be ordered, coded, and categorized. The coding process should be systematic and involve multiple coders (Rousseau
et al., 2008). The process starts with the analysis of the individual studies. There are
numerous strategies to code the individual studies. On the one hand, syntheses aiming
to integrate research findings should rely on standardized coding rules and codes, which
are often developed in a deductive way and rely on existing theories. For example, the
information could be extracted from the individual cases through content analysis
(Krippendorff, 1980). Moreover, content analysis can also be used to translate the qualitative information into quantitative information (Jensen & Rodgers, 2001). In some
variants of case analysis, it is possible to code concepts that emerge from the data
(Eisenhardt, 1989). The information extracted from the within-case analysis should be
described, aggregated, and presented in tables to inform the reader about the results of
this process. The results of the analysis may also allocate phenomena to contexts and
time points.
Subsequently, the results of the analysis of each qualitative study need to be aggregated to compare and contrast the results at the cross-case level. Again, there are substantial differences in the cross-case synthesis, depending, for example, on whether the aim of
the analysis is to integrate or interpret the qualitative studies. Aggregative synthesis would
rely on a technique like cross-case analysis to accomplish the goal of study aggregation
(Yin, 2003).

An Example of a Qualitative Approach to Evidence-Based
Entrepreneurship: Business Clusters in Developing Countries
In this section, we develop an example of a study aggregating case study evidence
in the entrepreneurship domain. The aim of this study is not to provide a comprehensive
application of a systematic synthesis of case studies, but to investigate a small set of cases
as an example and as a first step in developing a synthesis in entrepreneurship research.
This study addresses a specific research question. Moreover, it is an aggregative synthesis,
integrating knowledge in one domain, and relies on analysis techniques like content
analysis and cross-case analysis. At the same time, the study contributes to theory development by integrating two competing theories. Moreover, the study explicitly has the aim
to extend the context of cluster research by focusing on six different developing economies, and in doing so generalizing evidence that was initially contextualized. Finally, the
synthesis provides a quantification of the qualitative results.

Introduction
The geographical concentration of firms that are involved in related activities and that
may work together to improve their performance (Visser & Boschma, 2004) is a phenomenon that goes back to the earliest urban developments. It is an interesting and almost
March, 2014

341

<-----Page 9----->paradoxical phenomenon that local economies seem to be increasingly important
in today’s globalized economy (Audretsch, Grilo, & Thurik, 2011; Morosini, 2004).
Consequently, a growing number of regions, countries, and cities around the world are
establishing initiatives to stimulate the development of business clusters, assuming that
clusters have a positive effect on economic development, innovation, knowledge transfer,
and firm performance. While this positive effect can be expected from a theoretical as well
as empirical viewpoint, several factors, such as different conceptual and operational
definitions of clusters, reliance on single case studies, and different levels of analysis,
make it difficult to verify valid generalizations (Rocha, 2004).
In this study, we compare the characteristics of business clusters that affect the average
performance of firms in a cluster within the specific context of developing economies. Most
studies have thus far only analyzed business clusters in specific regions or countries. Our
approach uses a single analytic framework to analyze clusters from seven economies, which
makes it possible to test whether theoretical propositions about the effect of clusters can be
applied to different contexts. While there are many publications studying the effectiveness
of business clusters, our approach combines two theories to explain the firm-level effectiveness of clusters: the collective efficiency framework and the global value chain
approach. The collective efficiency framework focuses on different levels of joint action,
ranging from little cooperative linkages to extensive vertical, horizontal, and institutional
linkages (Schmitz, 1995a). While the collective efficiency framework is useful when it
comes to describing linkages among firms within a given cluster (internal linkages),
it ignores the role of external linkages. External linkages of clusters can be analyzed via the
insertion in global value chains, specifically the full range of activities required to bring a
product from conception to different phases of production, delivery, and disposal after use
(Kaplinsky & Morris, 2001). In this study, we compare the two theories and address the
following research question: How does the level of joint action and insertions into global
value chains affect the average performance of firms within business clusters in developing
countries? Thus, as we suggested above, we address a relatively specific research question
that defines the constructs, entity, and context under investigation.

Business Clusters and Performance
The profound interest of the popular literature in business clusters was stimulated
by the early work of Marshall (1920), and more recently Porter (1990). Marshall argued
that concentrations of businesses in particular localities create local external economies
that help firms share knowledge regarding products, markets, and technologies, which in
turn leads to valuable innovations. Porter described three effects of business clusters:
clusters stimulate the creation of new business ventures, drive innovation, and have a
positive impact on productivity. The overall conclusion emerging from relevant literature
is that business clusters could have significant advantages for the constituent firms
(Audretsch et al., 2011). However, the argument that clusters always have a positive
effect on firm performance is not uncontested. There are several examples of clusters of
firms performing poorly (e.g., Sato, 2005; Scott, 2005). Thus, it seems that the advantages of clusters depend on the specific characteristics of the business clusters. We argue
that the performance of firms in business clusters depends on internal as well as external
linkages.
Collective Efficiency and Insertion in the Global Value Chain. The collective efficiency
framework describes linkages among firms within a cluster (internal linkages) (Schmitz,
1995a). Two dimensions of the collective efficiency framework explain how businesses

<-----Page 10----->benefit from clusters: external economies and collaboration among clustered firms. External economies provide resources and product-related, market-related, and technological
knowledge. To benefit from external economies, clusters consciously need to pursue joint
action (Schmitz, 1999a). Thus, the active cultivation of joint action and collaboration
affects firm performance positively. Entrepreneurship literature provides different classifications of internal linkages. In the context of this study, we distinguish three types of
joint action. First, a local industry is characterized by no joint action. The firms in such a
cluster are merely co-located, there are no cooperative linkages and firms may benefit
from passive external economies. Second, in local complex clusters, firms cooperate
tactically, for example, by outsourcing noncore activities. Finally, in local alliances, firms
cooperate strategically and have extensive vertical, horizontal, and institutional linkages.
Internal linkages in clusters should be supported by external actors that connect
clusters to global markets. Such external linkages can be described by referring to the
concept of the global value chain. A value chain describes the full range of activities
required to bring a product/service from its conceptualization, through processes of
production to the customer and disposal after use. The insertion into the global value chain
stimulates upgrading processes that help improve the performance of firms in a cluster
because of enhanced production processes, better products, and extended functions
carried out by the firm. Thus, local producers can, for example, learn from global buyers,
and as a consequence improve company performance.
While local joint action and insertion in the global value chain improve the performance of firms in clusters, we hypothesize that these are not linear effects, but that the two
effects reinforce each other. Businesses achieve the best performance if internal connections are supported by external connections, which provide access to global markets.
Business Clusters in Developing Countries. When looking at entrepreneurship in developing countries, it is important to consider specific issues related to what is a resourceconstrained environment. Businesses in developing economies are usually constrained by
limited resources, low productivity, small markets, low purchasing power among customers, unfavorable physical and institutional infrastructures, and corruption. All these conditions do not support successful entrepreneurial activity. However, clusters provide an
opportunity to overcome these constraints and facilitate business growth and success in
developing economies. It is important to note that there are potential differences between
business clusters in developing economies compared with more-developed economies.
For example, there is evidence to suggest that firms cluster more often in developing
economies, compared with more-developed economies. Moreover, there are structural
differences between clusters in less-developed economies and clusters in developed
economies. Clusters in less-developed economies usually consist of smaller firms that are
geographically more concentrated and that are more homogeneous in terms of their
economic activities. At the same time, clusters in less-developed economies are more
heterogeneous in terms of skills and competencies. Despite these differences, we assume
that the theoretical assumptions described above apply to both developed and lessdeveloped economies because clusters provide competitive advantages to businesses
within clusters, which in turn is related to business performance.

Method
Study Location. In our general recommendations, we discussed that the study location
procedure may aim to locate all relevant studies, or alternatively may be restricted to some
March, 2014

343

<-----Page 11----->theoretical sampling. Since our research question already restricts studies to a particular
context, we decided to attempt to locate the broadest possible array of studies in this
context. In order to locate case studies, we used key word searches in ABI/Inform and in
Econlit, combining the term “cluster” with “lowly developed economies,” “LDC,” and
“developing country.” Furthermore, we examined the databases of institutions that support
entrepreneurship in developing economies (World Bank, ILO, UNU-Merit Maastricht,
Institute of Development Studies, Institute for Industrial Development Policy, and SNV).
In addition, we systematically searched key journals that address entrepreneurship in
developing countries: World Development, Entrepreneurship & Regional Development,
Journal of Developmental Entrepreneurship, and Journal of Development Studies. Moreover, we checked the references of narrative reviews. Finally, we asked experts in the field
to name additional clusters we did not identify with the former strategies. Thus, as we
suggested in our general recommendations, the study location process involved a range
of different strategies to locate cases, exceeding the range of strategies usually used in
quantitative meta-analyses (cf. O’Boyle, Pollack, & Rutherford, 2012; Read, Song, &
Smit, 2009; Rosenbusch, Rauch, & Bausch, 2013). This procedure allowed us to identify
case studies involving 80 business clusters.
Selection Criteria. We used case studies conducted by independent research groups.
As recommended in the third step of the description of the systematic synthesis of
qualitative research, we developed selection criteria specifying the scope of the study
(criteria 1–3) as well as criteria ensuring the quality of studies included in the synthesis (criteria 4 and 5): (1) The cases had to define clusters as geographical concentrations of firms that are involved in the same or similar activities, and that may specialize,
subcontract, or cooperate. (2) The cases describe clusters in low-income economies, as
defined by the World Bank. (3) The cases provide sufficient information to code business performance, levels of joint action, and insertion in the global value chain. (4) The
original publication did not use the case to analyze joint action and/or insertion into
the global value chain. While this criterion is not necessary for a systematic synthesis
of qualitative case studies, we introduced it because we aimed to avoid biases introduced in the original case description, which could occur, for example, when the case
description focuses predominantly on joint action (Schmitz, 1995b, 1999a). (5) We validated our data through cross-verification; therefore, we included cases when we had
information from at least two sources (Yin, 2003). First, in 12 clusters, we integrated information from different publications to create a more complete picture
(Appendix 1). Second, in eight cases, we had access to one “expert” who knew the
cluster well and who checked our coding of the cluster characteristics. As with criterion
4, this is not a necessary criterion for a systematic synthesis of case studies, but it
allowed us to create a more complete picture of the case (Jensen & Rodgers, 2001).
These selection criteria reduced the initial 80 clusters to the 13 clusters coded for the
purpose of our study (Appendix 1). Four of the 13 clusters were located in Africa, three
in Latin America, and six in Southeast Asia.
Measurement. To extract the relevant information from the individual case studies, we
developed a detailed coding scheme in advance, including anchors for the coding. Thus,
as we suggested in our general recommendation, we used a deductive approach to analyze
the cases. The dependent variable was the average performance of firms within a cluster.
We followed the recommendations by Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1986) and differentiated between financial (e.g., profits, overall performance, sales growth, profit growth)
and operational performance (including, e.g., competitive advantage, innovation,
344

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->improvements in technology, quality, skills levels). Independent variables were the level
of local joint action and insertion into the global value chain. The level of local joint action
was coded in three categories: (1) local industries with no joint action, (2) local complex
with specialization, and (3) local alliance with strategic cooperation. The coding of the
insertion into the global value chain was carried out for suppliers as well as buyers. A low
level of insertion was coded if external relationships focused only on import or export.
A high level of insertion was coded if supplier and/or buyer directly assist in upgrading
processes or products. Appendix 1 provides a detailed description of each cluster, the
references of the sources used to analyze the cluster, and the data analysis results of our
coding efforts.
Data Analysis. The qualitative case study analysis consisted of two main activities. As
we recommended, we first performed a separate content analysis of each case. Subsequently, we performed a cross-case analysis (compare step 5 of the general recommendations). First, we developed a case data file for each case, listing the characteristics of
the data sources, a case study description that covers general cluster characteristics as
well as history, and the relevant information that was found in the literature regarding the
concepts local joint action, insertion into global value chains, and the performance of
the firms in the cluster. Second, for each case, we developed a data analysis table that
systematically organized the information along the three concepts level of joint action,
insertion into the global value chain, and performance (compare Appendix 1). Third, we
coded the extent of local joint action, insertion into a global value chain, and performance
within the cluster, which enabled us to translate the qualitative information included in
the data analysis table into quantitative information. The cross-case analysis, finally, was
performed by pattern matching and cross-case analysis, as suggested by Yin (2003). To
display our results, we created figures that organized the cases along the dimensions
of our constructs. Moreover, the quantitative information that was extracted allowed us to
perform additional correlation analyses to test the relationships between the independent
and dependent variables.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 presents the results with regard to the relationship between the level of
joint action and firm performance. The general trend indicated that the clusters with
the highest levels of joint action achieved the highest levels of performance (Otigba
and Pekalongan). However, this relationship was not supported for the Marikina
cluster, which showed a moderate to high level of joint action, but a low-average level
of firm performance. Thus, a high level of joint action is not always associated with high
performance.
With regard to the Marikina cluster, its low level of average performance may be due
to a lack of external linkages with global value chains (Figure 2). Similarly, the majority
of clusters with no insertion into the global value chain also showed low levels of
performance—with the exception of the Suame cluster, which showed moderate levels
of average performance. At the same time, only two of the five clusters with high
levels of insertion into global value chains also showed high levels of average performance. It would appear that insertion into global value chains is a necessary but not
sufficient condition for high-average performance levels.
Therefore, we analyzed the combined effect of local joint action and insertion in
global value chains on performance (Figure 3), which revealed that the two clusters with

the highest levels of average performance (Otigba and Pekalongan) were characterized
both by high levels of joint action and insertion into global value chains. Because all
clusters with low-average performance showed low scores in at least one of the two
dimensions (joint action and/or insertion in the global value chain), we conclude that the
interaction between local joint action and insertion into global value chains is the best
predictor of performance of firm within business clusters.
Our qualitative synthesis of cases allowed us to run some quantitative analyses as
well, although the sample size is relatively small to expect robust results. The Spearman
rank correlation between local joint action and performance was r = .63 (p < .01), the
relationship between insertion in global value chains and performance was r = .68
(p < .01), and the relationship between a combined index (level of joint action with
insertion in the global value chain) and performance was r = .73 (p < .01).
Our synthesis of qualitative case studies of business clusters suggested three
contributions to the literature. First, most existing studies look at the effects of either
internal or external linkages of business clusters. Our analysis revealed that the combination of local joint action and insertion into global value chains helps explain the
performance of firms in clusters, which means that both internal and external linkages
need to be taken into account. Second, our results contribute to the conceptual problems
found in cluster literature, which make it difficult to generalize the results (Rocha, 2004).

For example, relying on single case studies contextualized research findings. With
our systematic synthesis of case studies, we showed that generalizations are indicated.
Third, our study focused on clusters in developing economies. Most approaches to
business clusters were developed in the Western world, as were the two frameworks
we used to study the performance of business clusters. We showed that the results can
be generalized beyond specific economic contexts. Thus, business clusters provide
an opportunity to overcome the environmental constraints that businesses face in
less-developed economies.
Our study has some limitations that suggest avenues for future research. The first
issue is related to the question of causality. It is possible that the high performance of
clusters leads to increased joint action in a cluster. Moreover, it may be easier for
clusters that perform well to establish external linkages compared with clusters performing less well. Due to our design, we were unable to test the causality of the reported
relationships. However, our analysis of the Gamarra cluster indicated that joint action
and insertion into global value chains improved subsequent performance. Such causality

issues can be addressed very well in a synthesis of qualitative cases studies, for example,
by synthesizing pre–post case studies (Jensen & Rodgers, 2001). Second, our analysis
was based on secondary data, which may be biased by the intentions of the original
authors. We tried to minimize such biases by relying on multiple sources for each case
description, and moreover we verified our coding by involving experts familiar with
the original clusters. Third, we did not test for moderator variables that could affect the
results. For example, the stage of cluster development and the type of industry may
affect internal and external linkages. While the limited number of cases included in our
analysis made it difficult to address such moderator variables, this type of analysis is
very possible in a systematic synthesis of qualitative research, and thus opens avenues
for future research.

<-----Page 16----->Since the synthesis aimed for generalizations, our results can be used by institutions interested in enterprise development because we provide information about areas
useful for intervention. Entrepreneurs may benefit from the results because they provide
guidelines for useful cooperation with other enterprises. Finally, we provide suggestions
on how to promote entrepreneurship in less-developed economies.

General Discussion
While evidence-based entrepreneurship is becoming increasingly accepted in the
field of entrepreneurship, it is predominantly based on evidence drawn from quantitative
studies. However, scientific knowledge in entrepreneurship is not restricted to quantitative research. Important concepts like network structure (Elfring & Hulsink, 2007),
effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001), and research into business clusters (as demonstrated
above) have been developed and advanced through qualitative research. We argue that
the cumulative evidence of a discipline includes knowledge from multiple sources of
quantitative as well as qualitative evidence (Rousseau et al., 2008). Thus, evidence-based
best practices need to include qualitative research. In the present contribution, we developed the systematic synthesis of qualitative research and provided an example of such an
approach.

Theoretical Implications
The systematic synthesis of case study research provides several implications for
entrepreneurship research. First of all, the field of entrepreneurship needs to develop
inventories about established knowledge in the field. While the field of entrepreneurship
has advanced considerably in the last two decades, more and more studies have begun
to focus on a vast number of different subjects and theoretical frameworks (Davidsson
et al., 2001; Low, 2001). This development leads to an increasing fragmentation of the
field. However, any discipline has to build evidence in areas of maturation and map
scientific evidence in order to provide practical recommendation. For example, our synthesis of case studies revealed that clusters positively affect the performance of firms in
a cluster. Such established evidence also suggests points of departure for future research.
In general, the field of entrepreneurship predominantly uses quantitative studies, and
consequently meta-analysis to establish such scientific evidence. Thus, there is a dominance of quantitative studies in the field, possibly because research designs and methods
continually improved in quantitative entrepreneurship research, increasing the legitimacy of this type of research (Crook, Shook, Morris, & Madden, 2010). However, 9.5%
of articles appearing in entrepreneurship journals can be classified as case studies
(Chandler & Lyon, 2001). We argue that this type of research needs to be considered in
evidence-based entrepreneurship. Case study research can be increasingly valuable to a
discipline, if the cases involved motivate an interesting research question, if they inspire
new ideas, and if they illustrate concrete examples of constructs (Siggelkow, 2007). At
the same time, we assume that it is inevitable for case study research to increase methodological practices to increase its legitimacy in entrepreneurship research, including,
for example, the use of secondary data and triangulation, the description of coding
procedures and of the analysis, and detailed information about quality concerns. Guidelines that are well understood by editors and reviewers have been described by
Eisenhardt (1991) and Yin (2003).

<-----Page 17----->Second, a systematic synthesis of qualitative research can test theories and concepts
that have been developed in the field of entrepreneurship. New theories are introduced in
conceptual papers or may have emerged from case study research. About 30% of the
papers published in the domain of entrepreneurship are conceptual in nature (Chandler &
Lyon, 2001). However, rather than introducing more and more new concepts and theories,
entrepreneurship research needs to test these theories rigorously to establish what we
know and, based on that knowledge, to identify areas for future inquiry (Low &
MacMillan, 1988). The synthesis of qualitative case studies provides the tools necessary
to achieve such evidence.
Third, the systematic synthesis of case study research contributes to theory development, and thus can go beyond just summarizing scientific evidence. For example, cases
can be synthesized with the aim of developing or enhancing the conceptualization of
constructs. Moreover, a synthesis can compare competing theoretical assumptions, for
example, with regard to whether the relationship between human capital and performance
is better explained by opportunity costs or by learning theory. In addition, a systematic
synthesis of case studies could compare the relationship between constructs, such as the
relationship between network characteristics and innovative activities. Our illustrative
example attained this type of contribution by integrating two different frameworks used to
explain the effects of business clusters.
Finally, a systematic synthesis of case studies allows researchers to develop new
theories or to adjust existing theories. While we suggested developing specific coding
categories in a deductive way, and thus specifying specific categories in advance, the coding system should be flexible enough to allow new categories to emerge through the case
analysis (Eisenhardt, 1989). Thus, the systematic synthesis of qualitative case studies can
have different aims, from describing phenomena to developing and testing theories.

Limitations
We are aware that applying a systematic synthesis of case study research to entrepreneurship requires additional considerations to exploit the full potential of such a synthesis.
A first issue is the question of whether or not it is legitimate to synthesize qualitative
research. Epistemologically speaking, qualitative research is not always suitable for an
evidence-based approach. We argued that case studies that build on scientific realism
are suitable for a synthesis. However, case study research often involves interaction
among the researcher, the data, the context, and the interpretation, and often focuses on
a relativistic paradigm. While there are techniques available to aggregate this type of
research (Campbell et al., 2003), these approaches are not primarily designed to provide
generalizations, and thus are not suitable for an evidence-based approach. Other qualitative research, however, aims at replicating results and making them accessible to practitioners. In this way, our approach contributes to this type of qualitative research by making
the results of this research accessible to a wider audience.
Second, the systematic synthesis of case studies aggregates the evidence from different case studies that look at phenomena from different angles and contexts, and that use
different sources of information. As a consequence, the synthesis loses the ideographic
information inherent in individual case studies. Thus, the generalizations are achieved at
the expense of unique phenomena studied in individual case studies. Therefore, it is
important to build in contingencies in the analysis that are theoretically indicated. Given
that there are sufficient cases available, this could be achieved by coding and analyzing
subsets of cases.
350

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 18----->Third, the systematic synthesis of qualitative research is not a homogeneous approach.
We advanced a specific synthesis of qualitative case studies. However, there are a number
of different techniques available to synthesize different types of qualitative research, and
they all have different strengths and weaknesses (Dixon-Woods et al., 2004; Rousseau
et al., 2008). For example, they are vulnerable in varying degrees to variations in the study
design.
Fourth, there are a number of methodological challenges that need to be addressed
when developing this approach to entrepreneurship further. For example, entrepreneurship
research needs to develop methodological standards for evaluating qualitative research
and the systematic syntheses of qualitative research. As with quantitative meta-analyses,
the process of the systematic synthesis of case-oriented research could be performed by a
team, which could be used to evaluate the consistency of the study location process, the
coding process, and the synthesis of the information (Campbell et al., 2003). Moreover,
there should be a clear set of quality criteria to assess each study before including it into
the synthesis (Jensen & Rodgers, 2001). An additional quality assessment should address
each of the steps of a systematic synthesis: an explicit purpose, a systematic approach to
study location, explicit criteria for study inclusion, a comprehensive within and crossstudy analysis, and a clear interpretation of the findings.
Finally, aggregating the findings of qualitative research is a complex and challenging
matter. For example, the judgments required for finding and extracting the relevant
information from qualitative studies are relatively complex, and this process requires a
deep understanding of the language and methodology used in a given field. Additionally,
all these decisions need to be documented and shared.

Future Research
We believe that there are a number of areas in entrepreneurship research that would
benefit from a systematic synthesis of case studies. For example, there is a continuing
debate in the domain of entrepreneurship about the definition of the concept of opportunity. While some authors define opportunities as situations that are recognized by individuals (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003, 2013; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), others claim that
opportunities are created (Alvarez & Barney, 2007). Both approaches build on a realist
epistemology (Alvarez & Barney). Moreover, there are a number of case studies that
evaluate opportunity recognition (Duxbury, 2012). A systematic synthesis of such case
studies can provide an overview of the empirical evidence, and thereby contribute to the
debate on the origins of business opportunities.
Moreover, complex topics that cannot be easily addressed by quantitative inquiries
can benefit from a synthesis of qualitative case studies. For example, existing literature on
business models is concerned with a complex phenomenon that explains how firms create
value for their customers (Magretta, 2002). While there is agreement in the entrepreneurship literature that business models are an important construct, the literature is fragmented
and characterized by different conceptualizations of the construct (George & Bock, 2011).
A systematic synthesis of case studies on business models could help develop the conceptual boundaries of the concept across case studies. In addition, such a synthesis could
investigate the consequences of business models. For example, a business model should
affect how firms recognize and exploit existing opportunities. Moreover, providing value
for customers should have positive effects on firm performance.
Finally, the notion that entrepreneurial behavior is embedded in contexts can
be systematically addressed in this type of review. Such contexts are usually described
explicitly in qualitative studies, and therefore a systematic synthesis can account for such
March, 2014

351

<-----Page 19----->contextual conditions. For example, some authors argue that opportunity exploitation is
associated with uncertainty (Knight, 1921). A qualitative synthesis could examine whether
uncertainty affects the proposed relationships. Another avenue could be the examination
of a process-based view in entrepreneurship (Baron & Markman, 2004). In this case, to
examine the antecedents and consequences of entrepreneurial behavior, the synthesis
needs to achieve an interpretation of the evolution of phenomena over time. Similarly,
a systematic synthesis of qualitative research could work with conditional validation and
causality, and in doing so identify necessary and sufficient conditions.

Conclusions
In this study, we have argued that evidence-based entrepreneurship needs to synthesize case studies as well. This is important for two reasons. First, the systematic review
of case-oriented research in entrepreneurship helps generate knowledge in the field. This
evidence is not restricted to what we know, but it can also uncover issues that we do not
know yet and that need further examination. Second, a systematic review of qualitative
research in entrepreneurship provides knowledge that is contextualized in the sense of
what works for whom and under which circumstances (Denyer & Tranfield, 2006). As
such, evidence-based entrepreneurship makes knowledge accessible to practitioners
and provides strong implications for actions and behavior. To summarize, our approach
contributes to evidence-based entrepreneurship, which should synthesize knowledge and
generalizations relying on multiple methods and designs (Rousseau et al., 2008).

operational perf.
— Direct: turnover and profitability increased during past years
— Indirect: increasing export rate

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

— Operational

— Financial

Performance:

→ Formerly high performance, currently rapidly declining
performance
— Jepara cluster was responsible for growth of furniture exports
from U.S.$3.8 million (1989) to U.S.$97 million (1996) and
U.S.$147 million (1998) (c)
— In 1998, Jepara had a 40% share in total Indonesian furniture
exports (a)
— Between 1996 and 2000, the number of exported containers
increased from 200 to 2,000 per month; however, at the end of
2002 this has decreased with 40% (a)
— Since 2004, export sales decreased with 10% per year to just 112
million U.S.$ in 2006 (d)
— Export margins for the bigger firms decreased by 20% or more
between 2000 and 2003 (b)
— The declining exports of Jepara mirrors the nationwide average
increasing furniture exports (d)
— Between 1997 and 2002, the number of production units
increased from 2,439 to 3,700 (b)
— Between 1997 and 2002, employment increased from 38,264 to
58,210 workers (b)
— Between 1997 and 2002, workers earnings increased
substantially (estimated, with 10–15% per year between 1997
and 2002)
— Wages in this cluster are above the minimum, but not the highest
in the area
— Complaints about quality (due to too rapid growth)
— Skills not sufficient to fulfill international demand
— Infrastructural problems (due to too rapid growth)
Problems:
— use of illegal raw materials → illegal logging of extremely
young trees (cost-saver)
— foreign buyers demand certified wood, but the certification is
suspended because the state lost control over the timber trade
→ Boost based on the devaluation and depreciation of currency
→ Lack of cooperation, therefore, unable to deal with problems

8. Jepara (Indonesia)

— Number of firms increased by 29% since 1998 (a)
— Employment increased by 20% since 1998 (home workers
increased) (a)
— Increasing sales caused more workers to start new enterprises (a)

— In general, sales increased since 1998 (a)
— In particular, export sales increased (significantly) since 1998 (a)

— Comparative advantage of Ceper gradually decreased (demand
decreased, lost markets to other metal casting clusters) (a)
— Not able to maintain its good performance (a)

— In the late 1990s, Ceper accounted for almost a third of
Indonesia’s annual metal cast production (c)
— Between 1998 and 2001, the number of workers decreased from
5,000 to 3,875 (a)
— In 1997, cluster contained 340–350 firms (b) and in 2001, the

Local joint action:

Cluster characteristics:

— Further characteristics

Used studies:
— Study 1
— Study 2

— Presence of “tightly-wrought webs of social interaction”
— Firms subcontract the demand that exceeds their own capacity
— Strong sense of own identity and distinctiveness (e.g., own shoe
museum in the city)
— Collective attempts to improve the cooperative bases of
production
— Several cooperatives owned by the (small) firms, providing loan
facilities, reduced costs of purchasing, own (collective) brands,
etc.
— Benefiting from economies of scale by forming small supply
consortia
— However, still some distrust and progress should be made to
establish a culture of collaboration and joint political action
— Ingredients present, but still no real culture of collaboration
— Production via vertically disintegrated firms
— Specialized tasks are subcontracted to independent workshops
— Many standard component are brought in
— Even the larger firms regularly subcontract batches of work
— Threatened predominantly by the increasing import of parts
from China

Shoe industry (cheap, low-quality shoes)
Beginning of the twentieth century
Place: Philippines, Marikina, urban area
Firms and workers: 248 firms, mostly small-sized, some larger
with hundreds of employees (2004)
→ Local complex, starting to move to local alliance

a) Scott (2005)

11. Marikina (Philippines)

— Many raw materials are sourced from other Philippine islands
— Degree of outsourcing between direct exporters and
subcontractors differs per subsector
— The production process is more and more split up into several
small tasks that are outsourced to subcontractors and/or
homeworkers
— Little trust between contractors and subcontractors, but network
relations emerging

Furniture (outdoor, antique reproduction, and lifestyle)
In the 1950s
Place: Philippines, Metro Cebu, urban area
Firms and workers: around 303 firms and 45,000 workers (1999);
many small firms; some larger; largest around 2,750 workers
→ Local complex
→ “Cluster benefits from some dynamic cluster advantages”
(c, p. 173)
— Horizontal specialization of firms occurs
— Cooperation initiatives within the cluster (formation of network
relations)
— However, no intensive (strategic) cooperation between firms;
independency is higher valued
— Little loyalty of larger manufacturers to small manufacturers
(upgrading of small firms not a goal for the larger firms)
— Decreasing trust between employers and workers → results in
more outsourcing

a) Beerepoot (2004)
b) Beerepoot (2005a)
c) Beerepoot (2005b)

12. Cebu (Philippines)

— Production process is split up into different stages for different
firms: extensive use of subcontractors
— No network relations, only transactions: subcontractors are not
rewarded for their loyalty to their exporters, and there is hardly
any exchange of information

— Firms are very specialized horizontally: entire streets are
specialized in specific products
— No network relations, only transactions
— Heavy competition between subcontractors because they have to
bid for orders from exporters
— Some subcontractors formed small groups to cooperate and help
each other (sharing equipment, training, etc.)
— Cooperation between exporters is almost absent

Furniture
Late 1940s, closely related to nearby U.S. military bases
Place: Philippines, Pampanga, province (rural)
Firms and workers: around 376 firms, most of them with less than
10 workers (1999); 10,000 people employed (2002)
→ Local industry
→ “Cluster depends on static cluster advantages” (c, p. 173)

<-----Page 27----->360

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

— Larger firms imported their machinery from countries like
Taiwan and Italy

— Only for domestic markets (intense competition with other
countries, mostly China)
— Firms in the cluster never been incorporated into significant
cooperation with foreign buyers: “capacity for export activity is
notably underdeveloped”
— Links to global value chains are totally absent
— Recently some manufacturers started to reach to global markets
by participating in international trade fairs

→ Low performance

— Upstream

— Downstream

Performance:

Global value chains:

— Presence of “associational and institutional infrastructures”
— PFFI (Philippine Footwear Federation Inc.): broad cross-section
of shoe manufacturers in Marikina, representing the cluster in
domestic and foreign forums, provide cluster with consultancy
services and training programs
— League of Filipino Shoemaker aims to ensure that imports do
not evade the remaining tariff regulations
— Philippine Footwear Academy: provides training courses,
technical advice
— Leather Footwear Industry Master Plan (1996): governmental
study about current weaknesses, with the aim to promote and
foster the cluster
— Specific legislation by government to promote the development
of the cluster
— Active participation of the local government
→ No insertion

— Institutional linkages

11. Marikina (Philippines)

→ Low performance (especially exporting, but growing)

— Via initial sales to U.S. military, direct exports to the U.S.
market became possible
— Currently, domestic market most important and preferred
— Around 110 exporting firms
— No foreign buyer agents in the cluster
— Attempt to set up international furniture exhibit, with little
success: only 861 foreign buyers in 2003

— No data (suppose domestic supplies)

→ Some insertion

— No strong local business association that stimulates joint
initiatives
— Present associations are ineffective and lack common initiatives
— The “Furniture City” (where firms can rent production space)
failed (wrong location)
— Well-equipped training center is not in use because of lack of
expertise and funding
— There is a craftsmen school; however, it is not well functioning

— Early 1970s: government and international donor organizations
started to pay attention to the cluster
— Trips to foreign furniture fairs were organized by government
— 1974: establishment of furniture trade association in Cebu and
trade support organizations in Manila
— 1991: first own international furniture exhibit organized in
cluster
— Most exporting firms are registered with the Board of
Investment, which gives them various incentives like 6 years of
tax holiday and low import duties
— Strong presence of business associations, local government, and
training institutes → facilitates information exchange and
upgrading processes
— Association CFIF very active, but still weak on lobbying
→ Insertion
— “the furniture exporters (. . .) are also part of an international
value chain” (e, p. 54)
— Several raw materials (e.g., wood) are imported from countries
like New Zealand and Malaysia
— Knowledge is imported via foreign links (e.g., German
consultants for training)
— 1982: British furniture company started an establishment in the
cluster (antique reproductions), still active in the cluster →
fostered upgrading (training, attracting new foreign buyers)
— After 1982: more and more foreign buyers began to buy from
firms in the cluster (following British pioneer)
— Around 175 firms export directly to foreign markets
— Several foreign buyers have agencies inside the cluster
— Own international furniture exhibit (3,097 foreign buyers visited
it in 2002)
— Main export markets: United States (62%) and Japan (9%)
→ Moderate performance (high compared to total Philippine
furniture industry)

production → rattan is subjected to quick changes in demand
— Chinese threats (Cebu firms have a much lower productivity
rate)
— The cluster still has a reputation for unreliability in deliveries
— The Cebu cluster is heading for difficult times, but it has
survived other crises in the past 25 years (experiencing similar
problems as 25 years ago)

— On average, approx. 26 workers per firm
— Quality too low to satisfy foreign demands

— As an estimation, a firm in Pampanga exports almost
120,000 U.S.$ per year (2002)
— Pampanga cluster exports increased between 1996 and 2000 with
163% (total Philippine industry with 30%), and between 1998
and 2002 with 15%
