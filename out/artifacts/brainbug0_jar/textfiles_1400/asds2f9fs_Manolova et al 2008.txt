thought that the idea of a telephone was a foolish one. The consensus was that the nation had a workable communication system
in the form of the telegraph and the concept of individuals communicating across great distances through speech was considered
to be a bit extreme. Besides, Mr. Bell did not have a company with
any tangible assets to provide collateral. Recognizing an opportunity, Boston attorney Gardiner Green Hubbard and leather
merchant Thomas Sanders of Salem, Massachusetts, helped out.
Later, these same two individuals put up the equity capital to start
the Bell Telephone Company in Boston, Massachusetts.'

INTRODUCTION

Angel financing is defined as "[i]nformal venture capital-equity
investments and non-collateral forms of lending made by private
individuals.., using their own money, directly in unquoted companies in which they have no family connection."' 2 It "is one of the
most common, but least studied methods, to finance new ventures."'3 The National Venture Capital Association assesses it at
$100 billion in the United States, while the institutional venture
capital market is less than half this size at $48.3 billion. 4 Internationally, as of 2001, the volume of formal venture capital investment
was estimated at 0.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), whereas
the share of informal investment was on average 1% of GDP in the
thirty-seven countries participating in the Global Entrepreneurship
5
Monitor.
Angel financing plays a critical role in the financing of emergent businesses. For growth-oriented new ventures, angel financing
fills the critical juncture between informal cash infusions from early
enthusiasts such as "friends, fools and family" and later financing
from formal institutional investors such as venture capital firms,
which, because of their high transaction costs, do not engage in

small investments. 6 In addition, business angels usually have entrepreneurial backgrounds and are known to be hands-on investors,
contributing their skills, expertise, knowledge, and contacts in a va7
riety of informal and formal roles to their investee businesses.

Despite their importance, much of what is known about angel
investors is incomplete and not well understood, in part because
data are difficult to obtain. 8 Those studies that have looked at the

mechanism of angel financing focused mostly on the supply side,
using an agency theory or social psychology lens to explore different aspects of the investment process, such as deal generation,
screening, valuation, deal structure, monitoring, and exit. 9 Very

few studies have looked at the demand side, or the factors that distinguish entrepreneurial firms that receive equity funding from
those who do not. Thus, there is a need for research that explores
the informal venture capital from an entrepreneur's perspective. 10
The purpose of this exploratory study is to fill this gap by investigating the characteristics of entrepreneurs who seek and secure
angel financing. More specifically, we ask two questions: (1) what
are the characteristics of entrepreneurial new ventures that seek informal equity financing?; and (2) what are the characteristics of entrepreneurial new ventures that obtain informal equity financing?
To address the two research questions, we examined all investment proposals submitted to an angel financing network based in
the Northeast over a two-year period. Following the multi-stage selection process implemented by informal equity providers, 1 we focused on the characteristics of the entrepreneur and his new
venture that are associated with increased likelihood of being
funded. Our preliminary findings indicate that entrepreneurs who
seek angel financing tend to be male and well educated, and their
new ventures have predominantly business-to-business models that

boast a variety of sources of competitive advantage. While the median investment sought is around $1.5 million, angel investors
funded new ventures seeking lower amounts of investment, coupled
with higher revenue and profit projections.
The rest of our paper is organized as follows: after a brief review of the literature on angel financing and the relationship between entrepreneurs seeking informal equity financing and the
capital providers, we present our methodology and research design.
We next report and discuss our findings. The study concludes with
some implications for future research and managerial practice.
I.

ANGEL INVESTORS AND THE VENTURES THEY FUND:
AN OVERVIEW

Financing provides the lifeblood of a new venture. A weak financial structure can create problems in all areas of a firm's operations: delays in research and development, ineffective marketing,
and inability to hire qualified personnel. Adequate capitalization,
on the other hand, buffers against the liabilities of newness and
smallness, and allows the owners to continue product development
and to pursue market opportunities. Financial capital input levels,
therefore, are strong determinants of a new venture's survival prospects 12 and growth. 13 For technology-based entrepreneurial ventures, in particular, an MIT study found that established companies
''more often fail because they run out of money than because the
14
technology has problems."'
While institutional venture capital financing has been glamorized in the press and in academic research as the primary source of
outside equity finance, statistics indicate that only one to two percent of all new ventures obtain financing from venture capital
firms. 15 In addition, venture capital firms are typically interested in
making large investments to established businesses that have a

track record of performance, making it difficult for younger, less
16
established businesses to obtain this type of financing.
Angel investors fill a critical gap in the new venture financing
landscape. Angel investors are wealthy individuals who invest in
small firms in amounts that are typically too small to be of interest
to professional venture capitalists. 17 In dollar amounts, angel funding is most commonly sought when a new venture needs more than
$25,000 but less than $1.5 million. 18 Angels usually invest in earlystage businesses, both for the potential of high returns-an earlystage successful deal can give ten times or more return on investment-and for the enjoyment that they receive helping entrepreneurs launch their new ventures. 19 Angel investing is found in most
developed economies. In terms of number of ventures funded, it is
estimated that angels invest in ten to twenty times more companies
20
than venture capital firms.
A growing volume of academic research is exploring different
aspects of angel investors' decision-making processes. Applying an
agency-theory lens, Wong found that "angels [seek to] reduce expected agency costs by forcing entrepreneurs to hold a larger stake
in the firm ....
In addition, angels use informal methods such as
investing in closer geographic proximity and syndicating investments with other angels to mitigate risks. ' 2 1 Wiltbank applied a
model of venture financing from formal venture capital to explore
angel investor outcomes and found that investment in earlier stages
and more participation post-investment was related to fewer nega22
tive exits.
Relatively less is known about the entrepreneurs who seek
and, more importantly, obtain angel funding. On the question of
who seeks private equity financing, Eckhardt, Shane, and Delmar
suggested that "the likelihood that a firm founder will seek external
funds . . . increases with the founder's positive assessment of the

venture. ' 23 On the question of who obtains angel funding, Prasad,
Bruton, and Vozikis argued that the proportion of the entrepreneur's initial wealth invested in the project indicates to potential
investors both the project's value and the entrepreneur's commitment to the project.2 4 Linde and Prasad, in interviews with twentyfive angel investors in the Boston/Route 128 and Silicon Valley areas, identified the five most important decision-making criteria,
namely: geographic proximity, high-growth industry potential, highgrowth venture potential, personal attributes of the entrepreneur
and the management team, and track record of the entrepreneur
and the management team. 25 Similarly, Sudek, in his participant
observation study of an angel network located in Southern California, identified the top criteria to be the trustworthiness of the entrepreneur, quality of the management team, enthusiasm of the
entrepreneur, and the exit opportunities for the angel. 26
Angels' decision-making criteria appear to be comparable
around the world. For example, a study of Australian angel investors revealed that rate of return was the most important financial
criterion, while the management team, the growth potential of the
market, the uniqueness of the product, and the deal structure were
the most important non-financial investment criteria. 27 Angel investors in the United Kingdom also place the quality of the management team as their top investment criterion.28 Similarly,
Feeney, Haines, and Riding in their study of the decision-making
processes of 194 Canadian private investors found the overall business opportunity and the principals of the company as the key investment criteria. 29
In sum, seeking equity is most often associated with the
founder's positive assessment of the new venture's potential, while

METHODOLOGY

Data Collection

Data from the study came from the investment proposals (n =
221) submitted to a large angel financing network located in the
Northeast over a two-year period (2005-2006) and the documented
decisions made by the group. In addition, we collected data about
the funding outcomes for the new venture cohort from a variety of
secondary sources. Data on all companies were cross referenced
with the Angel Capital Association groups in the region in which
the company was based. We also checked the company websites
and business news sources XConomy 30 and bNet 3 1 for press releases pertaining to financing.
To be considered for angel financing, a venture typically submits a business prospectus to an angel financing group and, if chosen, makes a presentation about its business idea. From this initial
document, decisions are made by the angel group to reject the proposal or seek further information about the new venture in a preliminary small group meeting. If the screening committee of the
small group of investors is impressed by the prospectus and the information gleaned from the preliminary meeting, the entrepreneur
presents her fledgling business to the entire investment group.
From there, the group members indicate their willingness to engage
in an enhanced due-diligence process, culminating in their potential
investment in the business idea. Thus, angel investment groups engage in a four-part decision-making process: (1) desk reject the initial idea; (2) presentation of the idea at a preliminary small group
screening meeting; (3) presentation of the idea at the larger group
meeting; (4) more due diligence with the objective of potentially
investing in the business (see Figure 1).
For each proposal submitted, we were given data on the outcomes of the multistage selection procedure: desk rejected,

presented at a screening session, presented at a meeting of the
whole investment group, or funded. Since new ventures submit
proposals to multiple angel groups, and angel groups refer new ventures for funding and sometimes syndicate investments, we also, as
described above, sought information about funding outcomes
outside of the focal investment group.
The investment proposals were between one and five pages in
length and offered unstructured narratives of the entrepreneur and
the new venture. They typically included information on the qualifications of the entrepreneur and the founding team, the nature of
the business, the amount of capital sought, and the intended use of
the funds, as well as a variety of additional product, market, and
financial information.
B.

Data Coding

To generate the dataset, two trained research assistants independently coded the investment proposals, following a specific coding scheme developed by the principal investigators, which
consisted of sixty-four categories. These included the characteristics of the entrepreneur and the founding team, the nature of the
business opportunity, the product-market positioning of the business, the social and technological resources of the new venture, and
the financial projections of the business. Coding inconsistencies,
which occurred infrequently, were resolved by one of the three
study coauthors.
C. Analytical Procedure

To address Research Question 1 (What are the characteristics
of entrepreneurial new ventures that seek informal equity financing?), we calculated the frequencies of different characteristics of
the entrepreneur and his new venture. To address Research Question 2 (What are the characteristics of entrepreneurial new ventures
that obtain informal equity financing?), we cross-tabulated the frequencies of these characteristics by stage of selection (desk rejected, presented at screening, funded by focal angel investment
group, funded by any angel group). At this very early stage of empirical investigation, and taking into consideration the substantial
amounts of missing data in some of the categories, we opted out of
applying analysis of variance or other advanced statistical techniques and, instead, examined the data qualitatively for any dis-

HeinOnline -- 31 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 753 2009

<-----Page 10----->WESTERN NEW ENGLAND LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 31:745

cernable patterns. This analytical approach should be kept in mind
in the interpretation of the results.

RESULTS

Research Question 1: The Characteristicsof Entrepreneurs
Who Seek Private Equity Financing

Research Question 1 explored the characteristics of entrepreneurs who seek private equity financing. In this preliminary investigation, we focused on the demographic characteristics of the
founders, the type of entrepreneurial new venture, the proprietary
and collaborative sources of competitive advantage, and the financial profile of the new venture.
1. Demographics
Four out of five entrepreneurs seeking private equity financing
were men (over eighty percent). In fact, barely over three percent
of the applicants were women or women-only founding teams, and
only 3.6% were mixed teams. As could be expected, applicants
boasted high levels of development of their human capital. Well
over half of the entrepreneurs had a graduate education, and 57.9%
had prior business experience, including 17.2% with entrepreneurial experience. Surprisingly, only two-thirds of the entrepreneurs seeking angel financing included information on the
founding team in their investment proposals.
2. Type of New Venture
Over four-fifths of the entrepreneurial new ventures were business-to-business ventures, and over half of them offered products
rather than services. Both United States-based and foreign ventures submitted investment proposals, but most of the new ventures
were locally based, falling within a 130-mile median distance from
Boston. In the vast majority of the cases (86.9%), the investment
proposals described the introduction of the product as an opportunity to fill an existing gap in the market.
3. Sources of Competitive Advantage
In terms of proprietary intangible resources, between twenty
and thirty percent of the new ventures had either been awarded a
patent or had a patent pending. In addition, five percent of these
ventures had trademarks. As far as collaborative advantage, or advantages stemming from well-formed interorganizational relations,
HeinOnline -- 31 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 754 2009

<-----Page 11----->TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL?

2009]

close to a quarter (24.9%) of the new ventures had established relations with their customers and one in five had entered into an alliance with another company.
4.

Financial Profiles

In their investment proposals, the entrepreneurial new ventures stated ambitious growth agendas, with median projected revenue in year five of over $38 million and projected profits in year
five of over $13 million. The median private equity investment
sought was approximately $1.5 million. Somewhat surprisingly,
only forty percent of the entrepreneurs seeking private equity financing included detailed five-year financial projections, and only
one in four stated the estimated number of years to exit.
B.

Research Question 2: The Characteristicsof Entrepreneurs
Who Obtain Private Equity Financing

Research Question 2 focused on the characteristics of the entrepreneurs who obtained angel funding. Very few of the investment proposals submitted for funding were selected for private
equity financing by our focal angel group. In fact, seven out of ten
investment proposals were desk rejected, one of the three that
passed the desk-rejection stage was additionally screened out during the preliminary screening, so that only two out of ten investment proposals were selected for presentation at the regular group
meetings. Finally, only three of the 221 entrepreneurs who had
sought angel financing were able to actually secure funds from the
focal angel investment group, a very low 1.36%.
This, however, is not to suggest that the new venture cohort did
not secure funding from other sources. We were able to track the
funding outcomes for seventy-seven out of the 221 entrepreneurial
ventures who submitted proposals to the focal angel group.
Twenty-eight of them (over one-third) had obtained some angel financing. Out of these twenty-eight ventures, eighteen were funded
by angel groups only, six had secured funding from both angels and
venture capitalists, while four had obtained financing from angel
groups in addition to other (most often government) sources. Sixteen other ventures were funded by venture capitalists; four were
funded by government agencies; and two were financed by corporate capital. Since our primary interest in this paper is in the characteristics of the entrepreneurial ventures that obtain angel

HeinOnline -- 31 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 755 2009

<-----Page 12----->WESTERN NEW ENGLAND LAW REVIEW

[Vol. 31:745

financing, below we present the results for only this group of
twenty-eight businesses.
1. Demographics
Only one of the entrepreneurs who obtained angel financing
was a woman. While the education credentials of those who obtained financing were similar to the accomplishments of the initial
pool of candidates, only three-quarters of them had prior industry
experience and one in four had prior entrepreneurial experience.
2.

Type of New Venture

There was a variety in the types of new ventures selected for
angel financing. Most of the ventures were business-to-business,
with only one in five having a business-to-consumer model. While
not all of the new ventures were locally based, the median distance
from Boston was well within driving range (25.6 miles).
3.

Sources of Competitive Advantage

Most of the twenty-eight ventures selected for angel financing
identified a proprietary or collaborative source of competitive advantage. Thus, over fifty percent of the new ventures had established relationships with suppliers or customers, and one in four
had set up an interorganizational alliance. Three-quarters of the
new ventures had secured intellectual property protection in the
form of a patent, patent pending, trademark, or a copyright.
4.

Financial Profile

Both the average expected revenues and expected profits of
the companies that received funding were higher compared to the
overall pool of candidates. Projected revenues stood at a median of
over $50 million, and projected profits in year five exceeded $27
million. At the same time, the amount of investment sought was
lower than the average for the pool at $900,000 (see Table 1).
IV.

DIscussION

In this preliminary investigation of the investment proposals
and outcomes of angel investment, we arrived at three principal
findings, which we discuss below.

HeinOnline -- 31 W. New Eng. L. Rev. 756 2009

<-----Page 13----->TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL?

20091

A.

EntrepreneursWho Seek and Obtain Angel Financing Are
Still PredominantlyMale

This finding echoes the results of a long line of prior research,
which laments the limited access of women to sources of institutional equity financing. For example, "[o]f the approximately 1900
companies that received [institutional] venture capital in 1997, less
than 2.5% were woman-owned. ' 32 One explanation may stem
from the predominant industry choices of female entrepreneurs,
which are heavily concentrated in the service and retail sector, and
the relatively small size of their businesses. 33 These industry
choices "appear to be mismatched with the industry preferences of
[equity]," which are likely to avoid the diseconomies involved in
disproportionate monitoring and due diligence associated with certain populations. 34 An alternative explanation suggests that women
may not be involved in the male-dominated social networks, which
35
can gain them access to equity capital.
B.

EntrepreneurialNew Ventures that Seek and Obtain Angel
FinancingFollow a Predominantly Business-to-Business
Model

This finding is similar to evidence from the venture capital industry, which suggests that venture capital firms invest predominantly in industries of high growth potential such as computer
software, hardware, and services; medical, health, and biotechnology; and communications.
C.

Traits of Entrepreneurs Who Seek Private Equity Financing

Our findings are in line with Eckhardt and his coauthors who
argued that "[t]he likelihood a firm founder will seek external funds
for a venture increases with the founder's positive assessment of the
venture," while "[t]he likelihood that a firm founder will receive
external funds for a venture ... increases with objective measures
of the venture's performance." 36 Similarly, empirical evidence
from the activities of angel investors in different countries, such as

the United Kingdom, 37 Australia, 3 8 and Canada, 39 all suggested the

industry and the new venture's growth potential to be among the
key priorities of angel investors. Notably, in addition to detailed
financial projections, the companies selected for funding also included information on their management teams. Thus, these companies also addressed the other major criterion for private equity
investment, namely, the quality of the management team. 40
V.

LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Our preliminary investigation is not without limitations, which
must be kept in consideration when interpreting the study's findings. To begin, we were only able to secure access to the investment
proposals submitted to a single investor group, thus limiting the
generalizability of the study. Keeping in mind that access to angel
investors is notoriously difficult to gain, 41 future research should
augment our findings by studying other angel groups nationally or
internationally. In addition, the unstructured proposals had missing
data in many of the coding categories, preventing more detailed statistical analysis. Finally, our dataset included initial proposal and
final outcome, but no data on the quality of the entrepreneur's
presentation at the angels meeting. Thus, important human capital
intangibles such as enthusiasm or trustworthiness, identified as key
factors in the angel investors' oftentimes personal (gut) assessments
of the entrepreneur, 42 were not captured in our data collection. Future research should augment data from the formal investment proposals with observation and even interview data in order to glean a

investment proposal must include the sources of competitive advantage and the milestones in the growth trajectory of the new venture,
coupled with information on the expertise and commitment of the
management team.
In addition to providing valuable information to entrepreneurs
who are presenting their business ideas to angel groups, our findings also have public policy implications. Governmental organizations that are interested in helping young firms identify, and then
obtain, external financing can apply the findings from our research
study in trainings and small business development initiatives. Importantly, by encouraging women to actively seek angel financing,
many more entrepreneurial new ventures will be given the opportunity to realize their full growth potential. Given a goal of increasing
the number of new ventures that survive and grow, our study is an
important first step in understanding the interrelation between the
entrepreneurs who seek angel funding and the decision-making dynamics of angel investors. In doing so, this study can potentially
help young firms obtain critical early-stage financing.
