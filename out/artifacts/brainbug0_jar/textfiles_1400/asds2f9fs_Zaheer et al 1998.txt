Abstract
A conceptual challenge in exploring the role of trust in interorganizational exchange is translating an inherently individuallevel concept-trust-to
the organizational-level outcome of
performance. We define interpersonal and interorganizational
trust as distinct constructs and draw on theories of interorganizational relations to derive a model of exchange performance.
Specifically, we investigate the role of trust in interfirm exchange at two levels of analysis and assess its effects on negotiation costs, conflict, and ultimately performance. Propositions were tested with data from a sample of 107 buyer-supplier
interfirm relationships in the electrical equipment manufacturing industry using a structuralequation model. The results indicate that interpersonaland interorganizationaltrust are related
but distinct constructs, and play different roles in affecting negotiation processes and exchange performance. Further,the hypotheses linking trust to performance receive some support, although the precise nature of the link is somewhat different than
initially proposed. Overall, the results show that trust in interorganizational exchange relations clearly matters.

(Interorganizational Trust; Interfirm Relations; Relational Governance)

The sharp increase in various forms of interfirm cooperation in the current economic environment has stimulated
a profusion of research on such interfirm ties, and more

specifically on the role of trust in facilitating the organization and coordination of economic activities between
firms. A special issue of The Academy of Management
Journal (1995) on the subject of collaborative interfirm
ties noted editorially that the role of trust in cooperative
relationships is of fundamental importance and that "the
study of trust and its impact on cooperative relationships
at all levels may be a particularly fruitful area of future
research" (Smith et al. 1995, p. 15). Despite the importance of understanding the nature of trust in cooperative
interfirmrelationships, considerable ambiguity is evident
in the literature about the precise role of trust as it operates at different levels of analysis and its influence on
performance.
A fundamental challenge in conceptualizing the role of
trust in economic exchange is extending an inherently
individual-level phenomenon to the organizational level
of analysis. Not clearly specifying how trust translates
from the individual to the organization level leads to theoretical confusion about who is trusting whom because it
is individuals as members of organizations, rather than
the organizations themselves, who trust. The ambiguity
about the multilevel nature of trust is apparent in theoretical frameworks that address the role of trust in economic exchange, notably transaction cost economics
(Williamson 1975, 1985). Specifically, transaction cost
theory implies thatfirms tend to behave opportunistically

(Williamson 1975, 1985), thereby attributing(micro) individual motivations and behaviors to (macro) organizations and thus committing a "cross-level fallacy"
(Rousseau 1985). We maintain that theories of interfirm
exchange that simply view opportunism-or conversely,
trust-as a property of organizations without specifying
the link between micro and macro levels is inaccurate as
it tends to anthropomorphizethe organization.
Some imprecision about the roles of trust at multiple
levels of analysis and how trust is related across levels is
also apparentin economic sociology, more specifically in
relational exchange (Dore 1983, Macneil 1980). A central
premise of relational exchange theory is that personal relations generate trust and discourage opportunisticbehavior between firms. However, that perspective does not
address how interpersonal trust influences the economic
exchange between and among complex social systems,
such as organizations. Simply stated, the relational exchange perspective does not stipulate the mechanisms by
which individual-level action affects organizational-level
outcomes.
Further,though several theoretical traditions have recognized the importance of trust in economic exchange
(e.g., Arrow 1974, Granovetter 1985, Macauley 1963),
little research has been done to explain how trust, particularly when conceptualized as a multilevel phenomenon, operates to affect the performance of interfirm exchange. In particular, the organizational and strategy
literature (e.g., Gulati 1995) has asserted that trust in interfirmexchange is beneficial and can be a source of competitive advantage (Barney and Hansen 1995). In the organizational economics literature, trust has been
theorized to reduce opportunistic behavior, and hence
transaction costs of exchange, ultimately resulting in
more efficient governance (Bromiley and Cummings
1995, John 1984). However, though the link between trust
and performance in economic exchange has been frequently theorized in general terms, elucidating the precise
nature of the trust-performancerelationship in a multilevel context remains an important theoretical and empirical challenge.
The primaryobjective of our research is to explain how
trust operates at both individual and organizational levels
of analysis, how trust at the two levels is related, and
particularlyhow the mechanisms by which this inherently
individual-level phenomenon translates into an
organizational-level outcome: performance. We argue
that in an actual exchange relationship, the role of individual boundary spanners, acting on behalf of their organizations, has an important influence on interfirm exchange. In particular, we propose that institutionalized

practices and routines for dealing with a partner organization create a stable context within which interorganizational and interpersonal trust develop. Further, we
maintain that there is a reciprocal relationship between
trust at the two levels of analysis, and neither alone is
sufficient for understanding relational exchange performance. We conceptualize the trust-performancelink as
being mediated by interfirm negotiation processes, and
we identify the influence of trust at each level on eventual
exchange performance.
We tested our propositions on a sample of 107 buyersupplier interfirmrelationships in the electrical equipment
manufacturingindustry using a structuralequation model.
Our hypotheses linking trust to performance are partially
supported, but several of our findings were unexpected.
The results indicate that interpersonal and interorganizational trust are related but distinct constructs, and play
different roles in affecting exchange performance.

Theory and Hypotheses
Interpersonal and Interorganizational Trust
We use the term interpersonal trust to refer to the extent
of a boundary-spanning agent's trust in her counterpart
in the partnerorganization. In other words, interpersonal
trust is the trust placed by the individual boundary spanner in her individual opposite member. The term interorganizational trust is defined as the extent of trustplaced
in the partner organization by the members of a focal
organization (see Figure 1).
Although considerable research in psychology and sociology has focused on trust in individuals (e.g., Rotter
1971) and in social groups (e.g., Lewis and Weigert
1985a, Zucker 1986), in the organizational and interorganizational context the role of trust has only recently
attracted interest, notably in the marketing channels literature (e.g., Anderson and Narus 1990), and in strategy

Does Trust Matter?

and organizational research (e.g., Bradach and Eccles
1987, Ring and Van de Ven 1992, Zaheer and
Venkatraman 1995). As a result of both the range of disciplinary lenses used to study trust and the inherent ambiguity of the trust construct, there is currently a confusing assortment of conceptual perspectives on trust. For
our purposes, two principal issues are involved in developing a working definition of the trust construct: (1) the
intrinsically complex and multifaceted nature of trust
(Corazzini 1977) and (2) the variety of units and levels
of analysis to which trust has been applied.
In addressing the first issue, we focus on the exchange
dyad to develop a definition of trust that is inherently
relational because we are specifically interested in studying the role of trust in economic exchange and, more generally, in interorganizationalrelationships. The literature
on interorganizationalrelations provides two general definitions of trust: confidence or predictability in one's expectations about another's behavior, and confidence in
another's goodwill (Ring and Van de Ven 1992). We use
and extend both conceptualizations and define trust as the
expectation that an actor (1) can be relied on to fulfill
obligations (Anderson and Weitz 1989), (2) will behave
in a predictable manner, and (3) will act and negotiate
fairly when the possibility for opportunism is present
(Anderson and Narus 1990, Bromiley and Cummings
1995). Our conceptualization of trust as an expectation
ratherthan a conviction reflects an uncertain anticipation
of the referent's future behavior. Our definition explicitly
allows for the possibility of betrayal, which we view as
an inherent feature of trust. This probabilistic element of
trust is analogous to making a "leap of faith" by placing
confidence in a referent without knowing with absolute
certainty that the referent's future actions will not produce
unpleasant surprises. Our definition therefore characterizes interorganizationaltrust as being based on three components-reliability, predictability,1 and fairness-that
capture some of the complexity of trust (Lewis and
Weigert 1985b, Rempel and Holmes 1986, Rempel et al.
1985).
Our conceptualization of trust also explicitly recognizes the distinction between relational and dispositional
trust. Whereas dispositional trust is an individual trait reflecting expectancies about the trustworthiness of others
in general (Rotter 1971), relational forms of trust pertain
specifically to the counterpartin the dyad. That distinction is important because high relational trust does not
imply naively trusting all exchange partners. Rather, relational trust is likely to be based on experience and interaction with a particular exchange partner (Ring and
Van de Ven 1992).
The second issue involved in developing a working

definition of the trust construct concerns the level of analysis involved. The Oxford English Dictionary defines
trust as "confidence in or reliance on some quality or attribute of a person or thing" (emphasis added), highlighting the fact that the referent of trust may vary. In other
words, it is conceptually consistent to view trust as being
placed in another individual or in a group of individuals
such as the partnerorganization. However, the same cannot be said for the origin of trust. In our view, trust has
its basis in individuals, although individuals in an organization may share an orientation toward another organization. From this perspective, interorganizationaltrust
describes the extent to which organizational members
have a collectively-held trust orientation toward the
partner firm, which is quite different from saying that
organizations trust each other. In contrast, we view interpersonal trust as also made up of the three elementsreliability, predictability, and fairness-but with an individual as both the referent and origin of trust.
We note that trust as represented by the three components can be expressed in different forms-cognitive, behavioral, and emotional-at both the interpersonal and
the interorganizational levels. However, we recognize
that to do full justice to the complexity of trust would
require considerably more elaborate schemes (e.g.,
Cummings and Bromiley 1996).

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 9, No. 2, March-April 1998

Micro-Macro Links in Interorganizational Relations
Organizations are far from monolithic. Rather, as Pfeffer
(1982, p. 64) notes, they are ".... pluralistic, divided into
interests, sub-units, and subcultures." Similarly, rather
than the relationship between organizations being faceless and monolithic, it is actively handled and managed
by individual boundary spanners (Katz and Kahn 1978)
whose orientations and motivations may well be different
from those of the organization as a whole. Boundary
spanners are more closely involved in the interorganizational relationship than other members of the organization, and tend to interact with their counterparts to a
greater extent (Friedman and Podolny 1992). Hence,
when examining the characteristics of an interorganizational relationship, we need to study the individual and
organizational levels simultaneously (Rousseau 1985). In
the eyes of some scholars, theory-driven research on multilevel phenomena is what "sets [this] field apartfrom its
parent disciplines in that most of what we study in and
about organizations are phenomena that are intrinsically
mixed-level" (Rousseau 1985, p. 2). In particular,the outcomes of trust may be different when the boundaryspanning individual is considered separately from the rest
of the organization, with importantconsequences for performance.

Does Trust Matter?

We argue that the connection between interpersonal
and interorganizationaltrust is based on institutionalizing
processes. Over time, repeated ties between two firms
evolve into deeper and more stable cooperative arrangements (Gulati 1995). Although individual boundaryspanners come and go, role definitions are stable and enduring
(Ring and Van de Ven 1994). Institutionalizing processes
codify informal commitments made by individual boundary spanners, which over time become established and
taken-for-granted organizational structures and routines
(Zucker 1977). Thus, as new individual boundary spanners enter the interfirm exchange relationship, they become socialized into the norms of the mini-society it
represents (Macneil 1980). Norms from the interorganizational relationship are internalized and recreated in
boundary spanners' interpersonal trust orientations toward each other in the process of conducting exchange.
At the same time, interpersonal trust becomes reinstitutionalized and boundary spanners' trustorientationin turn
influences the orientation of other organizational members toward the partner organization. The creation and
recreation of trust structures and action at the interpersonal and interorganizational levels is akin to Giddens'
(1979) concept of structuration.In sum, the foregoing arguments imply that interorganizationaltrust and interpersonal trust exert a positive influence on each other.

sharing of information. As a result, partners'expectations
about how changes in the external environment will affect
their exchange relationship tend to converge (Malmgren
1961). Specifically, when unforeseen contingencies arise,
such as costs not explicitly covered by the terms of a
contract, high levels of trust facilitate the development of
a common understanding about the contingencies and
how they might be resolved. When interorganizational
trust is high, negotiating positions are based on similar
underlying assumptions, and agreements are likely to be
reached more quickly. In a related vein, we suggest that
trustpromotes negotiating efficiency by enabling each exchange partner to be more flexible in granting concessions because of the expectation that the other exchange
partnerwill reciprocate in the future (Dore 1983).2
From a transaction cost perspective, the most compelling argument for the superior efficiency of interorganizational relationships that involve trust is simply that trust
reduces the inclination to guard against opportunistic behavior (i.e., deliberate misrepresentation) on the part of
the exchange partner (Bromiley and Cummings 1995,
Dore 1983, John 1984). Under conditions of low trust,
lengthy and difficult negotiations over unforeseen contingencies are likely to take place between exchange partners because of the possibility of both ex ante and ex post
opportunism (Williamson 1975). In addition, contractual
and structural safeguards are put in place to protect investments in the relationship (Williamson 1985). Under
high trust conditions, in contrast, firms are less inclined
to rely on elaborate safeguards for specifying, monitoring, and enforcing agreements. Relations high in trust
therefore imply more efficient exchange governance in
the form of eased negotiations.

There is a positive relationship beHYPOTHESIS 1.
tween the extent of interpersonal trust and interorganizational trust in an interfirmdyad.

Trust as Reducing Costs and Improving
Performance
Trustas Reducing Costs of Negotiation. Consistent with
the organization economics literature, we define negotiating costs as those involved in reaching mutually acceptable agreements. By this definition, negotiating costs
include the time and effort required to determine "efficient courses of action, and to settle on divisions of costs
and benefits" (Milgrom and Roberts 1992, p. 147). In
particular, bounded rationality, uncertainty, and information asymmetries stemming from imperfect communication, private information, and observation and verification difficulties, all contribute to increasing costs of
negotiation.
Negotiations are less costly under conditions of high
interorganizationaltrust because agreements are reached
more quickly and easily as parties are more readily able
to arrive at a "meeting of the minds." Interorganizational
trust mitigates the information asymmetries inherent in
interfirm exchange by allowing more open and honest

144

HYPOTHESIS 2.
There is a negative relationship between interorganizational trust and costs of negotiation
between the partners to the exchange.

At the level of individual boundary spanners, the negotiation literaturesuggests that a trust-basedrelationship
is conducive to the discovery of mutually beneficial, integrative solutions (Walton and McKersie 1965). Trusting relations between boundary spanners also have been
found to be associated with easier negotiations (Currall
and Judge 1995). Negotiations may be easier because of
boundary spanners' willingness to share sensitive information and their confidence that information provided by
the counterpartis not misrepresented. Consequently, we
expect mutually beneficial agreements to be reached more
quickly when boundary spanners trust each other. We argue that the relationship between interpersonal trust and
costs of negotiation is likely to be negative, similar to that
between interorganizationaltrust and negotiating costs.

HYPOTHESIS 3.
There is a negative relationship between interpersonal trust and costs of negotiation between the partners to the exchange.

their interpersonalrelationship is likely to affect the level
of conflict (Curralland Judge 1995). Where interpersonal
trust between boundary spanners is high, the parties are
likely to develop solutions that are focused on the problem at hand rather than on the personalities involved
(Fisher and Ury 1991). Moreover, when interpersonal
trust is high, a boundary spanner is likely to give the
counterpart the benefit of doubt rather than jumping to
conclusions about the other's motives and intentions. Further, as conflict often derives from unexpected actions by
one party, the predictability inherent in high levels of interpersonal trust is likely to be associated with lower levels of conflict.
A contrasting view of the link between interpersonal
trust and conflict is based on the premise that interpersonal trust may actually allow conflict to surface without
disruptive consequences. We argue that individuals involved in exchange relationships characterized by trust
may be more likely to confront and resolve disagreements
rather than smoothing them over. This notion is akin to
the idea that boundary spanners are more likely to confront trusted counterparts with "harsh truths" than those
they do not trust. In such cases, the parties are able to
accept periodic disagreements without fear of exploitation because the risk that conflict will permanently damage the interpersonalrelationship is lower in the presence
of interpersonaltrust (Walton and McKersie 1965). Paradoxically, we expect such confrontations ultimately to reduce conflict among boundary spanners by enabling the
individuals to resolve issues in a comprehensive way that
gets at the underlying cause of problems ratherthan treating them superficially. As a result, the sum total of conflict is lower in a high trustthan in a low trustrelationship.
The process of resolving core differences may be conflictual, but in the end it promotes smoother and more
harmonious interactions in the future.

Trustas Reducing Conflict. Because firms' objectives
in exchange relationships are rarely identical, divergent
goals and unforeseen contingencies in their day-to-day
relationships are likely to result in disagreements. Relational exchange ties that are imbued with trust are characterized by the internal harmonization of conflict and an
array of norms and social processes that work to preserve
the relationship (Macneil 1980). Partnersin relational exchange that have forged a high level of interorganizational trust are more likely to give each other the benefit
of the doubt and greater leeway in mutual dealings. Such
leeway will tend to reduce the scope, intensity, and frequency of dysfunctional conflict.
Alternatively, rather than reducing the incidence of
conflict, high levels of interorganizational trust may actually promote conflict. In particular,the "mixed-motive"
nature (Sako 1992) of buyer-supplierrelationships creates
tension between cooperation and competition. Interorganizational trust gives exchange partnersthe confidence to
be open with each other, knowing that information shared
will not be used against them. However, though such
openness may facilitate the discovery of solutions that
increase the size of the collective economic pie, it could
also lead to disagreement over the pie's distribution. As
additional opportunities for profit are recognized, the incentives for exchange partners to attempt to capture a
larger proportion for themselves are raised (Helper and
Levine 1992). The divergence in their goals (e.g., to appropriate as much of the pie as possible for themselves)
may become more salient. As a result, efforts by exchange partners to appropriate the gains from the relationship for themselves are likely to be manifested as conflict.
One way of resolving the apparent inconsistency between arguments for positive and negative effects of trust
on conflict is to view those alternatives in the context of
extended exchange relationships. From that perspective,
higher trust may temporarily be associated with higher
conflict, but over time interfirm disagreements will tend
to lead to either termination or reaffirmation of the relationship. In the latter case, trust is likely to reduce conflict. Based on this line of reasoning, we hypothesize,
HYPOTHESIS 4.

in the exchange relationship.

tween interpersonal trust and the level of conflict in the
exchange relationship.
Costs of Negotiation and Performance. A central
premise of organization economics is that costs are associated with conducting exchange (Coase 1937). Such
transactioncosts stem from the inability of exchange partners to specify contingencies fully in a contract
(Williamson 1985). The efficiency and performance of an
exchange relationship are consequently greatly influenced by the parties' ability to limit the costs associated
with contracting, in particularthe costs of negotiation and
renegotiation. As mentioned earlier, we conceptualize negotiating costs as the time and effort expended by the

145

<-----Page 6----->AKBAR ZAHEER,BILL McEVILY,AND VINCENZOPERRONE Does TrustMatter?

exchange partners to arrive at agreements about the distribution of costs and benefits (Milgrom and Roberts
1992).
We maintain that exchange performance3 is lowered
when negotiation costs are high because ". . . bargaining
position[s] carry direct costs that the bargainersmay wish
they could all avoid. In this regard, the time and energy
so often spent haggling, posturing, and delaying agreements in attempts to influence the terms of the deal are
related wastes" (Milgrom and Roberts 1992, p. 149). The
resources expended in such costly haggling and negotiation take their toll on performance because the exchange
partners are distracted from their business. More specifically, when contingencies arise, such as unexpected costs
not explicitly covered by the contract or unanticipated
design changes, high levels of interorganizational trust
enable the partnersto address these contingencies without
resorting to legalistic remedies. For example, ratherthan
concentrating on assigning blame and debating responsibility for bearing the costs of changes, the parties will
tend to direct their efforts toward determining how best
to reach mutually beneficial solutions.

to the transaction, influences dyadic governance structure
by requiring safeguards against appropriationof the associated rents. Uncertainty in the transactionenvironment
increases the number of contingencies, creating greater
potential for opportunistic renegotiation of the terms of
the contract. Together, asset specificity and uncertainty
have been theorized to influence the governance structure, which is the framework within which firms negotiate, execute, and monitor exchange agreements
(Williamson 1985). Prior research has demonstratedthat
relationship performance is influenced by a governance
structurethat safeguards the firm's specific assets in the
presence of uncertainty (e.g., Heide and John 1990,
Walker and Weber 1984). Given the extensive history of
research in this area, we control for asset specificity, environmental uncertainty, and governance form, and do
not hypothesize specific relationships between these constructs.

HYPOTHESIS6.
There is a negative relationship between supplier performance and costs of negotiation between the partners to the exchange.

Data on dyadic exchange relationships of electrical equipment manufacturersand their component suppliers were
gathered in four phases. In phase 1 an original group of
manufacturing firms in the "Electronic and Other Electrical Equipment and Components" industry (SIC code
3600) was constructed. We selected this industry because
it contains a wide range of purchasing arrangementsand
provides a sampling frame of adequate size. A list of purchasing managers in the firms who are members of the
National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM)
was made available to us by the association. Extensive
semistructured interviews, each 45 minutes to one hour
long, were held with 20 purchasing managers from different firms in the industry.
In phase 2 we identified 1,050 NAPM members who
were eligible to participate in our study on the basis of
the following criteria: (1) their firms purchase components, (2) they deal directly with supplier firms, and (3)
they have purchasing relationships with at least six suppliers. These NAPM members received a letter requesting
their participationin our study of buyer-supplierrelationships. We also asked purchasing managers to identify a
specific supplier firm that provides their firm with some
key component used in the final product.
To control for potentially confounding effects on relational governance caused by the importance of a supplier and by the amount of purchases made from it, we
used a randomizing procedure (Anderson and Narus
1990). We asked purchasing managers to select their
fourth largest supplier and to identify a specific individual

Conflict and Performance. Disagreements are a natural aspect of interorganizational exchange and may result in damaging conflict or may be worked out amicably
with consequences that are largely positive (Anderson

If conflict is frequent and pervasive, however, the outcomes may be dysfunctional because of the increased
time and effort spent resolving the conflict, the involvement of other, more senior, members of the organization,
the spill-over of the conflict into other areas, and the like.
In such cases the performance of the supply relationship

(i.e., the individual counterpart) with whom they have
been dealing personally. The procedure of selecting the
fourth largest rather than the largest supplier also mitigates social desirability bias, which is sometimes present
in questionnaire research. A total of 153 purchasing managers agreed to participate and sent the requested infor- mation about a specific supplier.
Testing for Nonresponse Bias. The participation rate
of approximately 15% (i.e., 153/1,050) was somewhat
low and suggested the potential for nonresponse bias. We
therefore conducted a telephone survey of 100 randomly
selected nonparticipantsto determine whether there were
any systematic differences between our sample and the
rest of the population. We carried out t-tests for differences in the means of participating and nonparticipating
firms on certain key variables. No significant differences
in the means were found for the size of firms (t = 1.10),
length of the business relationship with the supplier company (t = -0.81), or satisfaction with the buyer-supplier
relationship (t = - 0.56). Hence, we believe the threat
to internal validity of the results is limited.
Questionnaires. To increase the reliability and validity of our measures we developed two separate questionnaires on the basis of the semistructured interviews and
previous research: one for the purchasing managers and
another for a second respondent in the purchasing organization (Bagozzi et al. 1991). The questionnaire for the
second respondent was identical to that for the purchasing
managers with the exception that all items corresponding
to the interpersonal relationship between the purchaser's
and the supplier's representatives were eliminated. Questionnaires were pretested among local purchasing managers in the same industry, who were subsequently excluded from the sample.
In phase 3 of the data collection, we mailed the questionnaires to the 153 purchasing managers and to the second respondents. In total, questionnaires were mailed to
306 individuals in the buyer organization. In the final
phase of our data collection we implemented Dilman's
(1978) techniques for maximizing the response rate with
follow-up correspondence, questionnaires, and telephone
calls.
We received a total of 205 responses for a final response rate of 67% of individuals eligible and willing to
participate (205/306). Of the 205 completed questionnaires received, 120 were from purchasing managers and
85 were from the second respondent in the purchasing
organization.
Assessing Multiple Informant Competence. We collected data from multiple informants with the aim of addressing concerns about single-informant bias in research
on interorganizational relations (Kumar et al. 1993, p.

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/VOl. 9, No. 2, March-April 1998

1634). However, that approach poses a further problem
of identifying additional individuals competent to report
on a particular dyadic relationship. We evaluated the
competency of the second informant in the purchasing
organization by including an item designed to measure
specific knowledge of the firm's business relationship
with the focal supplier. Of the 85 second informants surveyed, 77 (91%) responded to the item "I am familiar
with most aspects of our business relationship with Supplier X" by circling four or higher on a scale from one
(strongly disagree) to seven (strongly agree). Any second
informants responding three or lower were removed from
our dataset and not included in any analyses. Of the 77
qualified second informants retained, 68 had matching
questionnaires from purchasing managers.
Measurement
Scales. Table 1 reports the details of the measurement
items and scales used to operationalize our theoretical
constructs. Where available, we used measurement instrumentsfrom the literatureto develop constructs. Some
items were modified to reflect the specific context of the
study. The Cronbach alpha reliability value for each construct is also reported in Table 1. The reliability values
of the measurement scales all exceed the recommended
value of 0.70 (Nunnally 1978) with the exception of that
for the joint action construct, which is marginal at 0.64.
Details of the development of the trust constructs follow.
Trust: To develop measures of trust at the two levels
of analysis we relied primarily on a measurement instrument created and validated by Rempel et al. (1985) as
modified by Rempel and Holmes (1986). We chose to
base our trust scales on that instrument because it was
designed specifically to tap trust in close, personal relationships rather than a more general trusting orientation.
However, not all of the Rempel and Holmes items were
applicable to our research context. In particular, we excluded items measuring a faith element and replaced them
with items designed to measure the fairness component
of trust based on our conceptualization of trust in an exchange context. We also eliminated items that did not
apply to both the interorganizational and interpersonal
levels. We further adapted the instrument for use in an
interfirm context by altering the referent of trust (which
was either the organization or the individual counterpart,
referredto as the "contact person"). Last, we ensured that
items corresponding to all three forms of trust-cognitive, behavioral, and emotional-were represented in the
scales, consistent with our conceptualization.
We created parallel instrumentsto measure trust at both
levels of analysis. The initial item pool for interorganizational and interpersonaltrust scales contained the same

set of items. However, factor analysis of the two trust
measures revealed that a reduced final set of items provided measurement properties superior to those of our
earlier conceptualization of trust as containing the three
components of predictability, reliability, and fairness. In
particular, we found that the emotional form of trust
emerged in the interpersonaltrust construct but not in the
interorganizational one. Further, the predictability items
dropped out of the interorganizationalscale and reliability
did not emerge in the interpersonal scale. The final item
pool contained five items each for interorganizational
trust and interpersonaltrust, of which three correspond to
the original items in the Rempel and Holmes (1986) scale.
Of the five items for the construct interorganizational
trust, two items reflected the fairness component of trust,
one item directly assessed interorganizational trust, and
the other two tap the reliability aspect of trust. We discarded items measuring predictability after assessing the
construct for unidimensionality, as mentioned previously.
The five-item scale for interpersonal trust consists of
one item related to predictability, three items related to
fairness, and one item that directly assesses interpersonal
trust. Items measuring the reliability element of interpersonal trust were eliminated as a result of the assessment
for unidimensionality.

Negotiation: We operationalized the costs of negotiation with a four-item scale. Two items captured the ease
and speed of negotiations pertaining to engineering
changes and two items measured the ease and speed of
negotiations pertaining to increases in raw materials
costs.
Conflict: Two items measured the degree of conflict
between the two organizations and the level of conflict
between the two boundary-spanning individuals. The
items were adapted from Van de Ven and Ferry (1980).
Performance: We operationalized the performance
construct with a four-item scale reflecting the degree to
which the supplier organization fulfilled the goals of competitive price, timeliness of delivery, high quality supply,
and supplier flexibility (Heide and Stump 1995, Walker
1994).4 The operationalization is based on the reasoning
that "the less cooperative the supplier is in meeting the
buyers' needs, the higher the transaction costs the buyer
incurs in trying to achieve its goals in the supply relationship" (Walker 1994, p. 583). This operationalization
is also consistent with the marketing channels literature
(Heide and Stump 1995).
Asset specificity: Our asset specificity construct was
based on a four-item scale measuring the extent to which
the production system is customized for the exchange

149

<-----Page 10----->AKBAR ZAHEER,BILL McEVILY,AND VINCENZOPERRONE Does TrustMatter?

partner in terms of investments in specialized tools and
equipment (Heide and John 1988).
Uncertainty: Four items, adapted from Noordewier et
al. (1990), measured the degree of environmental uncertainty in terms of industry volume, technological trends
of the market, stable availability, and accuracy of forecasts.
Joint Action: The joint action construct was measured
on a five-item scale reflecting the degree of interpenetration of organizational boundaries and the extent
to which the exchange activities are carried out in a cooperative and coordinated manner (Heide and John
1990).
Modeling Approach. We used the estimation procedure of LISREL 7 (J6reskog and Sorbom 1989) to construct a structuralequation model to test our hypotheses.
The LISREL technique has the advantage over standard
regression analysis of explicitly considering the measurement error in the indicators and simultaneously estimating a system of structuralequations. However, researchers have noted the difficulty of fitting LISREL models
with a large number of items per latent variable (Williams
and Hazer 1986). Specifically, as the number of items and
parameters increases, the model "can be unwieldy because of likely high levels of random error in typical
items and the many parameters that must be estimated"
(Bagozzi and Heatherton 1994, p. 43). Because of the
complexity of our conceptual model and the relatively
large number of manifest variables, particularly for the
trust constructs, we used the partial aggregation model
described by Bagozzi and Heatherton (1994). The partial
aggregation approach addresses this modeling problem
by consolidating the manifest items of a latent variable
into a smaller number of composite indicators.
To construct the composite indicators, we first evaluated each construct for unidimensionality using factor
analysis (Williams and James 1994). We then ranked
each construct's items according to their loadings and assigned them to one of two indicators. The mean of the
items assigned to each indicator was used as the value for
the indicator. The indicators were then loaded onto the
respective latent variables in the measurement model. All
constructs were modeled with the partial aggregation
modeling approach, with the exception of conflict which
contained only two items.
Means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations among composite indicators are reported in Table
2, and the loadings of the composite indicators on latent
variables are reported in Table 3. We handled possible
non-normality by using the maximum likelihood estimation procedures of LISREL 7, which "have been found
to be robust against non-normality" (Joreskog and

150

S6rbom 1989, p. 21) even with sample sizes as low as 50
(Anderson and Gerbing 1988).
Convergent and Discriminant Validity. Convergent
validity is ". . . the degree to which multiple attempts to
measure the same concept by different methods are in
agreement" (Phillips 1981, p. 399; Campbell and Fiske
1959). In organizational research, "differentmethods" often is taken to mean obtaining reports from independent,
qualified respondents5 (Bagozzi and Phillips 1982). We
assessed convergent validity in our study by examining
the correlation between interorganizational trust as reported by the purchasing manager and by the second respondent in the purchasing organization. As shown in

Figure 2

(013),

the correlationbetween interorganiza-

tional trust measured by the two respondents (methods)
is 0.706 (t = 4.27, p < 0.01). The positive and highly
significant correlation provides strong evidence for the
convergent validity of our interorganizational trust construct.
Drawing on Campbell and Fiske's (1959) discussion of
construct validity, Bagozzi (1993, p. 54) defines discriminant validity as "the degree to which measures of different concepts are distinct. The notion is that if two or more
concepts are unique, then valid measures of each should
not correlate too highly." We tested for discriminant validity by comparing a model with the correlationbetween
the two constructs constrained to equal one with an unconstrained model. A significantly lower chi-square value
for the model with the unconstrainedcorrelationprovides
support for discriminant validity (Joreskog 1971).
We conceptualized interpersonal and interorganizational trust as theoretically distinct but related constructs.
Consequently, we were primarily concerned with assessing the discriminant validity of those constructs.6 Tests
of a model with a correlation between constructs constrained to unity yielded Z2(7 df) = 17.70, p < 0.013,
and a model with unconstrained correlation yielded the
following: x2(6 df) = 8.05, p < 0.234. The difference in
chi-square (1 df) of 9.65 is statistically significant at p <
0.01, providing strong support for the discriminantvalidity of interpersonal and interorganizationaltrust.
Analysis
To test our hypotheses we specified two models using the
maximum likelihood estimation procedure in LISREL: a
trust correlation model and a structural model. The trust
correlation model (see Figure 2) tested Hl, predicting a
positive link between trust at the two levels of analysis,
with data from both the primary and secondary respondents of the purchasing organization. The significance of
the correlation coefficients estimated by the LISREL procedure, and reflected in the b parameter, provides a test

of H1. The structural model (see Figure 3) tested H2
through H7, which link trust with performance, mediated
by costs of negotiation and level of conflict. Data from
the purchasing manager respondents were used to estimate the path coefficients that are reflected in the respective y and fivalues. The statistical significance of the path
coefficients provides tests of the hypotheses.
Results
Trust Correlation Model. The model consists of three
latent variables: interpersonal and interorganizational
trust as reported by the purchasing manager and interorganizational trust as reportedby the second respondent in
the purchasing organization. The degree of overall fit between the actual and predicted covariances among variables of a model is reflected in a series of goodness-offit measures. This model had a chi-square value (6 df) of

152

Does Trust Matter?

8.05 (p = 0.234). Standardfit indices, as reportedin Figure 2, indicate a satisfactory fit of the model with the
data.7
The predicted relationship (H1) is tested by the strength
of the correlation between interpersonaltrust reportedby
the purchasing manager and interorganizationaltrust reported by the second respondent (see Figure 2, 023). Interpersonal trust and interorganizational trust are highly
correlated(023 = 0.442; t = 2.74;p < 0.01), providing
support for H1. As a second test of H1, we specified a
correlation path between interpersonal and interorganizational trust both as reportedby the purchasing manager
(see Figure 2, 012). Once again, the correlation is positive
and statistically significant (012 = 0.546; t = 3.18; p <
0.01), adding further support for Hi.
StructuralModel. The structuralmodel (see Figure 3)
specifies the relationships between trust and performance,
mediated by conflict and negotiating costs, with controls
for transaction cost variables. Following Venkatraman
(1989), we tested for the mediated relationships by specifying an additional direct path along with the mediation
paths. In other words, to test the prediction that the interorganizational trust-performance link is mediated by
negotiation costs, we specified three paths: a link between
interorganizational trust and negotiation, a further path
between negotiation costs and performance, and a third
direct path between interorganizationaltrust and performance. The same patternof structuralpaths was specified
for each of the remaining mediated relationships hypothesized. This model had a chi-square value (86 df) of 94.82
(p = 0.242). Standard fit indices, as reported in Figure
3, suggest a good fit of the model with the data.
Hypothesis 2, predicting a negative relationship between interorganizational trust and costs of negotiation,
is strongly supported (y1 = -0.810; t = -5.87; p <
0.01). Hypothesis 3 predicting a negative relationship between interpersonal trust and costs of negotiation and is
not supported. Rather, the relationship is both positive
and statistically significant (y3 = 0.359; t = 3.23; p <
0.10). As predicted in H4, a negative relationship was
observed between interorganizational trust and conflict
(Y2 = -0.593; t = -4.47; p < 0.01). Contraryto H5,
a negative relationship was not observed between interpersonal trust and conflict. The relationship is positive,
although not statistically significant (y4 = 0.017; t =
0.148; n.s.). Hypothesis 6, predicting a negative relationship between supplier performance and costs of negotiation, is not supported (/Bl= 0.264; t = 1.39; n.s.), nor
is H7, predicting a negative relationship between supplier
performance and conflict (f82= 0.034; t = 0.264; n.s.).

trust to performance is positive and statistically significant (y7 = 1.011; t = 3.716; p < 0.01), but the direct
path from interpersonal trust to performance is not significant (Y8 = -0.066; t = -0.477; n.s.).

Discussion
In this paper, we examined trust-based relational exchange to explicate a mechanism for the connection between trust and performance, and to distinguish between
the consequences of interorganizationaland interpersonal
trust. Our results broadly support the thesis that trust in
relational exchange influences negotiation processes and
performance, although the precise nature of the link is
somewhat different from what we initially proposed.
Eased negotiation and reduced conflict are indeed outcomes of trust, yet the pattern of findings differs sharply
across levels. Interorganizational trust emerges as the
overriding driver of exchange performance, negotiation,
and conflict, whereas interpersonaltrust exerts little direct
influence on those outcomes. Nevertheless, interpersonal

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCEVOl.

9, No. 2, March-April 1998

trust may also matter through its institutionalizing effects
on interorganizationaltrust.
Key Findings
Trust at Two Levels of Analysis. As hypothesized, we
found interorganizationaltrust and interpersonal trust to
be related, although empirically and theoretically distinct.
Moreover, that finding is not merely an artifact of singlesource bias given that we used data from two different
respondents in the buying organization to test the relationship. From the perspective of the boundary-spanning
individual in the buying organization, this means that the
more one trusts the supplier representative with whom
one deals, the more one's organization trusts the supplier
organization. We see this relationship as operating in the
opposite direction as well, suggesting mutually reinforcing effects of trust at the two levels. The implication of
these reciprocal effects is that, although interorganizational trust may appearto be the more importantinfluence
in relational exchange, interpersonal trust must also be
considered for its effects on interorganizationaltrust. At

the same time, interorganizational research examining
trust solely at the individual level may be missing important institutionalized effects of interorganizational
trust. Simply aggregating interpersonal trust as a proxy
for interorganizationaltrustignores the influence of social
context in the form of individuals' interactions (Coleman
1990) and organizational rules (Sitkin and Roth 1993)
that constrain and orient its members.
Perhaps our most striking finding is that interpersonal
and interorganizational trust operate quite differently
within relational exchange. Interorganizationaltrust is associated strongly with lowered costs of negotiation and
conflict, but interpersonal trust is not related to conflict
and showed a seemingly anomalous positive association
with negotiation costs. These findings imply that the effects of trust in the interorganizationalcontext are distinct
at the individual and organizational levels of analysis.

at both levels of analysis are partially supported. Although interorganizational trust is related strongly to
costs of negotiation and the level of conflict in the dyad,
the relationship between trust and performance is not mediated by negotiation costs and conflict, contraryto what
we had hypothesized. Further, although we did not hypothesize a direct effect of trust on performance, our empirical results in fact reveal a direct link between interorganizational trust and performance, though not
between interpersonaltrust and performance.
Given their strong theoretical rationale in the organizational economics literature, the lack of support for the
positive performance effects of eased negotiations and
reduced conflict is somewhat surprising.Nonetheless, before concluding that the trust-performancerelationship is

Does Trust Matter?

a direct rather than a mediated one, we note that eased
negotiations and reduced conflict resulting from interorganizational trust may in fact be enabling conditions allowing exchange partners to pursue a variety of bilateral
governance mechanisms-such as exchange of personnel
and shared decision making-that lead to improved performance.
The preceding point notwithstanding, we believe the
strong direct relationship between interorganizational
trust and performance is a noteworthy and meaningful
finding. It indicates that the performance of interfirmexchange is in fact associated with the level of interorganizational trust. Such a link has often been suggested in
previous work on interfirm exchange, but relatively little
empirical support for this relationship exists. A key implication of this finding is that firms in exchange relationships may derive competitive advantage from relationships imbued with high levels of interorganizational
trust. Interestingly, the basis for the performance enhancement does not appear to be based on efficiencies
gained from eased negotiation processes. Rather, we
speculate that the enhancement of transaction value
(Zajac and Olsen 1993)-such as cooperation in the exploration of new information and coordination technologies, new market opportunities, and product and process
innovation-may account for the link between interorganizational trust and exchange performance. As one of
the industry participants we interviewed put it:

interorganizational trust acts to smooth negotiation processes and thereby reduce the transaction costs of interfirm exchange.
The Role of Interpersonal Trust. We found no support
for our hypotheses relating interpersonaltrust to the costs
of negotiation or to the level of conflict in the exchange
relationship. In fact, the finding that interpersonal trust
related positively to the costs of negotiation is contrary
to our initial hypothesis. These results are counterintuitive given that research in the boundary-spanningliterature has indicated the importance of boundaryspanning individuals in managing the interfirm relationship (Friedman and Podolny 1992).8
To investigate the apparent anomaly of negotiation
costs increasing with interpersonal trust, we constructed
a three-dimensional surface plot of negotiation costs
against interpersonal trust, controlling for interorganizational trust (see Figure 4). Although the pattern is not
readily apparent,the surface of the plot is saddle-shaped
and rises to the maximum in both the foreground and the
background. Examination of the plot confirms the inverted U-shaped relationship between negotiation costs
and interpersonaltrust. Further,the thirddimension of the
plot, interorganizationaltrust, provides a possible explanation for the increasing part of the U-shaped curve. Specifically, where interpersonal trust is low, we find that
interorganizational trust remains high. High interorganizational trust appearsto compensate for low interpersonal
trust and thus to explain the low level of negotiation costs.
At the same time, the high negotiation costs associated

It is necessary to get away from a "remedy-oriented" contract
which includes all contingencies. We need to focus on what can
go right instead of what can go wrong.

Our findings rule out negotiation processes as a mediating
link, but future research should ascertain the role of these
and other value-enhancing exchange processes.
Although the entire chain of proposed theoretical relationships is not supported,our hypotheses about the link
between interpersonal and interorganizational trust and
the links between trust and the costs of negotiation and
conflict are partially supported. These findings are consistent with transaction-cost-based explanations for the
role of trust in exchange (Bromiley and Cummings 1995),
while also emphasizing the positive outcomes from interfirm exchange (Zajac and Olsen 1993). Similarly, the
negative relationship between interorganizational trust
and the level of conflict in the dyad can be attributedto
the willingness of the parties to grant one another greater
leeway when differences arise. In low trust situations,
suspicion of the partner's motives may result in dysfunctional conflict and impede effective exchange processes.
Taken together, the findings support the conclusion that

with intermediate levels of interpersonaltrust are accompanied by lower levels of interorganizationaltrust as indicated by the high point in the foreground, which corresponds to interorganizationaltrustat its lowest level and
both interpersonal trust and negotiation costs at their
highest levels. This patternof findings indicates that even
though the individuals across the dyad may not trust each
other, as long as the institutionalized structures accompanying high interorganizational trust are in place, negotiating costs will be kept down. Further, high interorganizational trust and low interpersonal trust can coexist
in the same relationship given that boundary-spanningindividuals come and go, whereas the institutionalized
structures and processes accompanying interorganizational trust are more stable and enduring (Ring and Van
de Ven 1994).
We conducted an additional analysis to confirm the
curvilinear relationship between interpersonal trust and
negotiation costs by regressing negotiation costs on interpersonal trust and its squared term. The results show a
positive and significant coefficient for the main term, consistent with the LISREL analysis, and a negative and significant coefficient for the squared term.9 The negative
sign for the squared term indicates an inverted U-shaped
relationship between interpersonal trust and negotiation
costs. In other words, the costs of negotiation appear to
be lowest at both low and high levels of interpersonal
trust and are highest at intermediate levels of interpersonal trustrepresentingthe inflection point of the inverted
U-shaped curve. We calculated the inflection point of the
curve to be at 4.30 for interpersonaltrust, suggesting that
negotiation costs increase with increasing interpersonal
trust up to the value 4.30, after which they decline.
Those observations are strong indications that interpersonal trust by itself is insufficient for lowering negotiation costs. Nevertheless, interpersonal trust is by no
means unimportant. At the point where interorganizational trust is at its maximum, negotiation costs are higher
when interpersonal trust is low, as indicated by the relatively high point in the background.From that point down
the upper right edge of the surface, increasing interpersonal trust clearly corresponds to lowering negotiation
costs. This observation makes it apparent that interpersonal trust plays a distinct, though subordinate, role in
affecting the costs of negotiation when examined in conjunction with interorganizationaltrust.

Implications
In comparison with interpersonal trust, interorganizational trust emerges as the dominant influence on exchange processes and outcomes. The pattern of results
suggests that institutionalized practices and routines for

156

dealing with a partnerorganization, as captured by interorganizational trust, transcend the influence of the individual boundary spanner. In considering the role of trust
in relational exchange, we argue that firms must recognize the impersonal (Shapiro 1987) structures,processes,
and routines that create a stable context within which interpersonal trust can develop and persist (Heide and
Miner 1992, Parkhe 1993). The stability of interfirmexchange is not created and maintained solely by boundary
spanning individuals, but ratheris institutionalized in the
interorganizationalrelationship. As one purchasing manager we interviewed asserted:
Even though I may leave, the relationship [between our firms]
will continue since what we've been doing goes beyond one or
two people. Over the years, there are a host of people who have
worked together.

We do not by any means suggest that the social component of exchange is unimportant.On the contrary, our
data indicate that interpersonal trust, in conjunction with
interorganizationaltrust, plays a unique role in relational
exchange, over and above the effects of governance structure. However, we suggest that when exchange is carried
out between organizations with an institutionalized pattern of dealings, the interorganizationalcontext becomes
more prominent.

Limitationsand Suggestionsfor Future Research
Our study makes importanttheoretical and empirical contributions to the literature on the role of trust in interorganizational relations. However, the validity of the implied causal links of our model is limited by the
cross-sectional nature of our research design. We therefore encourage longitudinal research on the development
and consequences of trust in interorganizational exchange. Furtherinvestigation of our findings based on indepth case studies would also enhance our understanding
of how interorganizationaltrust builds up over time and
its dynamic relationship with interpersonaltrust.
In our study, we inferred from a specific buyer-supplier
setting to interorganizational relationships more generally. Clearly replication of our findings in other interfirm
settings, such as joint ventures and strategic alliances, is
needed to establish their external validity. Further,we see
an interesting extension of the research in cross-national
settings where cultural differences may alter the outcomes of trust in relational exchange.
We also encourage more research specifically examining the "downside" of trust in interorganizationalrelations. Much has been made of the positive effects of trust,
but there is clearly potential for abuse of trust by exchange partners. Barnes (1981), for example, suggests
that excessive levels of trust can result in exclusive and

<-----Page 17----->AKBAR ZAHEER, BILL McEVILY, AND VINCENZO PERRONE

Does Trust Matter?

dysfunctional reliance on soft rather than hard data to
inform decision making.'0 Finally, our understanding of
the phenomenon of interorganizationaltrust and its consequences would be greatly enhanced by a study of contextual antecedents of trust-such as the extent to which
exchange partnersshare similar organizational structures,
policies, and mindsets or cultures-and its immediate
outcomes such as negotiating costs, conflict, and relationship performance.

explicitly detail the use of the multitrait-multimethod(MTMM) matrix
with two informants as different methods. As those authors indicate,
"[i]nformants one and two are treated as methods" (p. 469).
6The test was carried out with data from the same respondent, thereby
providing a stronger test of discriminant validity than using data from
two different respondents for interpersonal and interorganizational
trust, respectively. The latter approach is considered a less stringent
test because method and trait variance are confounded.
7For each of the models estimated, we report four standardfit indices.
The goodness of fit index (GFI) reflects the relative amount of variance
and covariance jointly explained by the model. The adjusted goodness
of fit index (AGFI) is the same as the GFI, but adjusts for the number
of degrees of freedom in the model. The normed fit index (NFI)
(Bentler and Bonett 1980) represents the point at which the model
being evaluated falls on a scale from a null model (specifying mutual
independence among indicators) to a perfect fit. The comparative fit
index (CFI) (Bentler 1990) is similar to the NFI, but corrects for small
sample size by subtracting the degrees of freedom from their corresponding chi-square values. Each of these indices range from zero to
1.00, with values closer to 1.00 indicating a good fit. A commonly
accepted rule of thumb is that a fit index should be greater than 0.90.
8In order to verify that these results are not a methodological artifact
we performed an additional analysis. We found a near identical pattern
of results using partial correlation analyses which is analogous to multiple regression analysis. Specifically, controlling for interorganizational trust we found that the partial correlation coefficient between
interpersonal trust and conflict while negative, was nonsignificant (partial correlation coefficient = - 0.09, p = 0.16) and the partial correlation coefficient between interpersonal trust and costs of negotiation
was positive and marginally significant (partial correlation coefficient
= 0.15, p = 0.066). This pattern of results is quite consistent with
those that we obtained using LISREL.
9The standardized beta coefficient for the squared term is - 1.273 (tvalue = -2.85; p < 0.01).
l?We are indebted to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this point.

Concluding Remarks
Overall, our research makes several contributions to research on relational exchange by examining the nature of
trust in buyer-supplierdyads. Through the use of multiple
organizational respondents, our study recognizes the distinction between interorganizational and interpersonal
trust. Although associated with each other, these constructs are shown to relate differently to costs of negotiation and conflict in the interfirm relationship. Further,
enhanced supplier performance, lowered costs of negotiation, and reduced conflict are shown to be related to
high levels of interorganizationaltrust.

Endnotes
'Whereas reliability includes an element of trust as competence (Barber
1983), predictability simply refers to the degree of consistency in intended behavior.
2Clearly, as one reviewer points out, contextual factors other than trust
also may affect negotiation costs, such as the extent to which exchange
partners have similar organizational structures, policies, and mindsets
or cultures.
3We define exchange performance as the extent to which the supplier
has fulfilled the buyer's requirements in terms of price, timeliness of
delivery, input quality, and supplier flexibility.
4We believe that in buyer-supplier relationships, though there may be
a degree of congruence about what the goals of the relationship are,
the buyer organization is the final arbiter of the extent to which exchange goals have been met to a satisfactory degree.
5There is a well-established precedent for this approach in the organizational literature. Most importantly, Bagozzi and Phillips (1982)
