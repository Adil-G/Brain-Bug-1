BUILDING COMMITMENT, ATTACHMENT, AND
TRUST IN STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING
TEAMS: THE ROLE OF PROCEDURAL JUSTICE
M. AUDREY KORSGAARD

University of South Carolina
This study examined how decision-making procedures can facilitate
the positive attitudes necessary for cooperative relations in decisionmaking teams. We hypothesized that consideration of memher input
and memhers' influence on a decision affect their perceptions of procedural fairness and consequently, their commitment to the decision,
attachment to the group, and trust in its leader. An experiment involving intact management teams supported these hypotheses and indicated
that perceived fairness partially mediated the impact of procedures on
commitment, attachment, and trust.

An organization is shaped by the stream of strategic decisions its managers make over time and by how they make those decisions (Bourgeois,
1984; Eisenhardt, 1989; Mintzberg & Waters, 1985). Managers often work in
teams to make such decisions because the complexity and ambiguity of the
issues with which they must grapple can overwhelm the capacities of any
one individual (Child, 1972; Hambrick & Mason, 1984; Mason & Mitroff,
1981). A team's decision-making effectiveness depends in part upon its
members' cooperativeness in providing information and in fully airing differences in assumptions and interpretations (Schweiger, Sandberg, & Rechner, 1989). The normative rational model of strategic decision making has
focused on the production of high-quality decisions as a means of enhancing
organization performance (Hitt & Tyler, 1991; Porter, 1980).
The ultimate value of high-quality decisions depends to a great extent
upon the willingness of managers to cooperate in implementing those decisions (Guth & MacMillan, 1986; Maier, 1970; Woolridge & Floyd, 1990). But
the limited evidence that exists suggests that processes deemed to lead to the
highest-quality decisions may adversely influence team members' affective
responses to the processes (Amason, 1993). Strategic decision-making teams
whose members have fully aired their views in reaching decisions are at
times left uncommitted to the decisions and disinclined to work together in
a cooperative manner in the future (Schweiger, Sandberg, & Ragan, 1986). A
more complete view of effective decision processes should therefore consider not only the quality of decisions hut also the impact of such processes

on team members' affective responses, such as commitment to the decision,
attachment to a team, and trust in its leader. Some researchers have considered such affective responses to he components of cooperativeness (e.g.,
Pinto, Pinto, & Prescott, 1993), and others have treated them as antecedents
of cooperation (e.g., Deutsch, 1962). We adopted the latter perspective and
focused on the production of affective responses expected to enhance organizational cooperation.
Why is the level of commitment managers have to carrying out individual strategic decisions important to an organization? Commitment to carrying out a decision is important hecause the memhers of a decision-making
team can delay or sabotage the implementation of initiatives (Guth & MacMillan, 1986); even slight delays can prove critical in highly competitive and
dynamic environments (Eisenhardt, 1989). We define commitment here as
the extent to which team members accept the strategic decision reached and
intend to cooperate in carrying it out. Individuals' commitment to a strategic
decision ensures that the mutual and consonant choices necessary for coordinated, cooperative effort will be made (Deutsch, 1957), whereas lack of
commitment places a major constraint on the range of options the team's
leader can consider (Guth & MacMillan, 1986). The extent to which team
members agree with and cooperate with a decision can greatly affect the
leader's ability to implement it (Hitt & Tyler, 1991). Finally, hecause strategic decisions are often interwoven and integrated with one another, lack of
commitment to a decision generally has repercussions far beyond its impact
on the success of that decision alone (Bourgeois, 1984; Eisenhardt, 1989).
The attachment that team members feel toward one another is also important to long-run cooperation in a group and its ultimate effectiveness
(Deutsch, 1957; Schweiger et al., 1989). We define members' attachment to
a team as the extent to which individuals feel themselves to be part of the
team and look forward to working with other team members. Attachment
differs from cohesiveness, which refers to the collective motivation of the
group to remain together, in that attachment is an individual phenomenon
and cohesiveness, a group one (Shaw, 1981). Alienation from other team
members may impede a member's willingness to share information on future
decisions (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988; Eisenhardt, 1989) and thus disrupt
cooperation and coordination among memhers. Similarly, lack of attachment
may exacerbate the tendency of memhers to pursue self-interest at the expense of reaching globally superior team decisions (Guth & MacMillan,
1986). Further, because strategic decisions are ambiguous and not all contingencies can be anticipated in advance, flexibility and willingness to live
with differences in perspectives are important to the success of team processes. Members who feel attachment to a team are more apt to cooperate in
reaching decisions speedily than those who feel little in common with the
team or who do not enjoy interacting with other team memhers (Deutsch,
1949; Tjosvold & Field, 1983).
Theorists have suggested that leadership is particularly important to the
strategic decision-making process (Thomas, 1988) and that to he effective.

the leader of a decision-making team must gain the trust of the team's members (Eisenhardt, 1989). Deutsch (1957) saw trust as a prerequisite to the
existence of a stable cooperative system. Following Ring and Van de Ven
(1992), we used trust here to represent the degree of confidence the members
of a team have in the goodwill of its leader, specifically, the extent to which
they believe that the leader is honest, sincere, and unbiased in taking their
positions into account (Folger & Konovsky, 1988; Roberts & O'Reilly, 1974).
Time and circumstances often require a leader to make decisions without
team consensus (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988; Eisenhardt, 1989; Woolridge
& Floyd. 1990). Because both honest differences of opinion and selfinterested differences arise, a leader must upon occasion step in and choose
an option because consensus cannot be reached in a timely fashion (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988). Further, managers often prefer to save time and
effort by voicing their views and then letting the leader decide (Eisenhardt,
1989). Given diversity of views and interests, strategic decisions will rarely
be popular with all the parties concerned. If a team's leader has not created
in team members the necessary level of trust, lack of cooperation with decisions, unwillingness to share information, and sabotage of future decision
processes may result. The challenge, then, for the team leader is to conduct
the strategic decision-making process in such a way as to engender team
members' commitment to decisions, attachment to the team, and trust in the
leader's judgment.
The foregoing discussion suggests that the processes used to reach strategic decisions affect the commitment, attachment, and trust of individual
team members and that these affective responses are critical antecedents of
people's cooperation in implementing strategic decisions. This position is
consistent with research and theory on the role of individual affect in fostering cooperation in groups (e.g., Deutsch, 1962; Tjosvold, 1984). Recent
empirical evidence also supports the presence of a causal link between affective responses and cooperative behavior (Kim & Mauborgne, 1993; Pinto
et al., 1993). Using procedural justice theory as a framework, Kim and
Mauborgne predicted and found a link between managers' perceptions of
procedural fairness, their affective responses to strategic decision processes,
and their cooperation in implementing strategic decisions. Their work is
important not only because it further supports the theorized link between
affect and cooperative implementation behavior, but also because it demonstrates the potential usefulness of organizational justice theory for understanding strategic decision-making processes. Nonetheless, their work did
not examine how perceptions of fairness and desired affective responses
were produced.
In short, past research on strategic decision-making processes has focused on how the quality of decisions might be enhanced (e.g.. Cosier, 1980;
Schweiger et al., 1986; Schwenk, 1982) but has largely ignored the affective
responses of team members to the processes employed to make strategic
decisions (Eisenhardt, 1989; Guth & MacMillan, 1986). Nonetheless, theory
suggests that how group members respond to decision processes is impor-

<-----Page 3----->1995

tant to the level of cooperation that can be achieved (Barnard, 1938). Kim
and Mauborgne (1993) took an important step in illuminating this phenomenon by demonstrating the link between fairness perceptions and cooperative behavior. In this study, we sought to extend their work by examining the
antecedents of perceptions of procedural justice and to extend the existing
literature on strategic decision making by examining how commitment, attachment, and trust are created—or undermined—through the strategic decision-making process.
PROCEDURAL JUSTICE IN STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING

Procedural justice theory is concerned with the impact of the fairness of
decision-making procedures on the attitudes and hehavior of the people
involved in and affected by those decisions. The basic premise of justice
theories is that fair treatment is central to people and a major determinant of
their reactions to decisions. Research on procedural justice evolved from
equity theory (Adams, 1965), which is concerned with the fair distribution
of resources. Researchers found that people care not only about the outcome
of decisions, but also about the procedures used to make decisions. In fact,
people are affected by the perceived fairness of such procedures regardless
of the perceived fairness of a decision itself (Folger & Konovsky, 1989; McFarlin & Sweeney, 1992). Procedural justice theory distinguishes between
control over a decision outcome and control over the decision process and is
particularly focused on the meaning of involvement in decision making
(Thibaut & Walker, 1975). Hence, it is well suited to enhance understanding
of affective reactions to group decision making and the design of decisionmaking procedures. Several aspects of decision-making procedures are relevant to creating perceptions of fairness; we focus on two: consideration of
member input and influence over a decision. Consideration of input refers to
the extent to which a team leader shows consideration of the input team
members bring to a decision-making process; influence refers to the extent to
which the members' input affects or is reflected in the final decision. The
distinction is important because time pressures as well as competing internal and external demands prevent team members from having significant
influence over every strategic decision (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988; Dess
& Origer, 1987; Eisenhardt, 1989; Woolridge & Floyd, 1990).
Research on participation in decision making has also examined the
impact of decision-making procedures on affective reactions. Researchers
have examined a variety of techniques designed to enhance participants'
attitudes (Maier, 1970; Tannenbaum & Schmidt, 1973; Vroom & Yetton,
1973). Prescribed participative decision-making styles range from a consultative style, in which participants are consulted about but do not control
decisions (similar to consideration), to joint decision making, in which participants make decisions together (similar to influence; Yukl, 1994). However, a lack of consensus on the mechanisms underlying participation have
presented research conclusions on the impact of participation in decision

making [Greenberg & Folger, 1983; Locke & Schweiger, 1979). In particular,
this stream of research has not clarified whether influence is necessary for
participation in decision making to have an impact and what role, if any,
consideration of input plays in participation in decision making (Greenberg
& Folger, 1983; Hoffman, Burke, & Maier, 1970), By distinguishing between
consideration and influence, the procedural justice perspective provides
some insight into the mechanisms of participation.
What Makes Decision-Making Procedures Fair?

The procedural justice literature provides guidelines for structuring procedures to maximize fairness perceptions. One primary means is through
voice: allowing individuals affected by the decision to present information
relevant to it (Folger, 1977). Even when a particular decision is unfavorable
to them, if individuals have voice they will feel that their interests are protected in the long run and will consider the process fair (Thibaut & Walker,
1975). Having input into a decision also makes people feel the decision
maker or leader values them and affirms their status in the group or organization. Procedures that signify to participants that they are respected members of a group are deemed fair (Lind & Tyler, 1988). An individual's merely
having a chance to say something does not, however, ensure perceptions of
procedural fairness. Consideration of input, the extent to which a decision
maker acknowledges and shows consideration of others' input, is needed for
voice to affect perceptions of fairness. If people's input is solicited but ignored, voice is void of meaning; individuals will not feel a sense of indirect
control or of status and respect. Several studies have found that voice in
decisions had a stronger, more positive impact on judgments of fairness
when people believed a decision maker considered their input (Leung & Li,
1990; Lind, Kanfer, & Earley, 1990).
A basic premise of this study is that the members of a strategic decisionmaking team have voice in strategic decisions. We define a team member as
an individual who regularly has input into strategic decisions. However,
how team leaders respond to input is what shows team members whether
their opinions are actually considered. Shapiro (1993) found that managers'
perceptions that their input was considered were related to the communication behaviors of their superiors; specifically, managers felt that input was
considered when superiors listened attentively and patiently and made an
attempt to understand the managers' viewpoint. Conversely, team members
can become frustrated if they feel a team leader does not give their views
adequate consideration (Bourgeois & Eisenhardt, 1988). Shapiro and Brett
(1993) found that a decision maker's hehavior, including the extent to which
he or she showed consideration of input, was significantly related to perceptions of procedural fairness, regardless of the degree of control individuals had over the decision outcome. Thus, a team leader's consideration of
member input is critical to ensuring that team members perceive decision
making as fair and acceptable. Therefore,

<-----Page 5----->1995

Hypothesis la: Leader consideration of team members'
input has a positive impact on team members' perceptions of procedural fairness. Team members ivhose input
is considered shouJd judge the decision-making procedure to be more fair than members whose input is not
considered.
When Are Fair Procedures Most Important?

Giving members voice in the decision-making process allows them
some degree of indirect control over a decision. Indirect control over decisions should be particularly important when direct control is not possible;
that is, when members do not directly influence decision outcomes. In fact,
Tyler, Rasinski, and Spodick (1985) found that the effect of voice on judgments of fairness was stronger when group members had less direct control
over decisions. Procedural justice researchers have asserted that when a
decision does not meet individuals' preferences, they are more apt to carefully assess the procedures used to make the decision (Leung & Li, 1990).
This greater attentiveness to how the decision was made is likely to cause
procedural factors like consideration to play a greater role in perceptions of
fairness. Indeed, Leung and Li found that the impact of consideration on
individuals' perceptions of procedural fairness was greatest when their preferences were not met. Consideration is especially important to people under
these circumstances because it assures them that their opinions were respected and that they had an opportunity to affect the decision (Shapiro,
1993). This logic suggests that when team members' input does not influence
a leader, they are likely to be particularly sensitive to how much consideration their views were given during the decision-making process. Eisenhardt
(1989) substantiated this position in a team context, finding that team members wanted to be sure that their team leaders heard and understood their
views, especially when the leaders alone made the decisions; she labeled
this process "consensus with qualification." We have argued that the consideration a team leader shows for team members' views will affect members' perceptions of the fairness of the decision procedure and that this
impact will be greater when team members have little direct influence over
the final decision. Therefore,
Hypothesis lb: The impact of a team leader's consideration of team members' input on perceptions of procedural fairness is moderated by the influence members
have over a final decision. Speci/icaJJy, the effect of consideration is stronger when member influence is low than
when it is high.
Consequences of the Fairness of Decision-Making Procedures

Procedural justice theorists have argued that fair procedures serve two
purposes. One is to help protect individuals' interests; over the long run, fair

<-----Page 6----->Academy of Management Journal

procedures should result in individuals' receiving what they are due. Consequently, the fairness of procedures is associated with positive attitudes
toward a decision, such as satisfaction, agreement, and commitment (Lind &
Tyler, 1988). The second function of fair procedures is symbolic and helps
to streTigthen individuals' relationships with a group, leader, and organization. Fair procedures serve as a sign to individuals that they are valued and
respected members of the group or organization and thus promote harmony
and trust in relationships with others. Consequently, fair procedures are
associated with positive attitudes toward the group, leader, and organization, such as group harmony, trust in the leader, and organizational commitment (Lind & Tyler, 1988). We have outlined two factors, leader consideration of input and memher influence over a decision, that are important to
creating a sense of procedural fairness. We now develop hypotheses regarding how team members' perceptions of procedural fairness in a decisionmaking process will affect their commitment to the decision reached
through the process, their attachment to the decision-making team, and their
trust in the team's leader.
Decision commitment. A determinant of the successful implementation
of strategic decisions is the degree to which team members are committed to
the course of action outlined in the strategy (Dess & Origer, 1987; Woolridge
& Floyd, 1990). Procedures promoting perceptions of fairness are likely to
strengthen the team members' commitment to the decision (Earley & Lind,
1987). Our position is that when the leader of a team acknowledges team
members' input, they are more apt to be committed to the decision reached.
Cuth and MacMillan (1986) speculated that decision commitment on the
part of middle managers is related to access to the leader and the extent of
serious attention their positions are given. Eisenhardt and Bourgeois (1988)
also found that team members were willing to accept decisions made by their
firm's chief executive officer (CEO) when they had been able to voice their
views but were frustrated with the process if they perceived that the CEO did
not listen to them. Thus, consideration of team member input should result
in greater commitment to strategic decisions.
Hypothesis 2a: A team leader's consideration of team
members* input has a positive impact on the members'
commitment to a final decision. Team members whose
input is considered should be more committed to the decision than members whose input is not considered.
As noted above, procedural fairness is likely to affect reactions to decisions, such as commitment to them, because it helps individuals protect
their interests, at least in the long run (Lind & Tyler, 1988). Individuals may
also be able to protect their interests in a particular decision when they have
direct control over it. The decision represents their ideas and preferences, so
their commitment to it should be strong. However, when members see little
evidence of their influence on a decision, the procedures used to reach the

<-----Page 7----->1995

67

decision are likely to have a greater impact on their commitment to the
decision. Thus, consideration of input should he particularly important
when members have little influence over a final decision. Therefore,
Hypothesis 2b: Team members' influence moderates the
impact of leader consideration on decision commitment.
Consideration has a stronger impact on decision commitment when member influence is low than when it is high.
Group attachment. Team members' relationships to one another are
important to the implementation of strategic decisions as well as to the
continued functioning of a team. When individuals feel a sense of attachment to their group, they will work more cooperatively and more diligently
to ensure that group goals are met (Deutsch, 1949; Janis, 1982). Conversely,
acrimony among team members limits consensus and acceptance of decisions (Nutt, 1987; Woolridge & Floyd, 1990). As noted earlier, fair procedures have symbolic meaning to group members: having input into decisions signals individuals they are valued and respected members of the
group (Lind & Tyler, 1988). Alexander and Ruderman (1987) found that
perceptions of procedural justice were negatively associated with group conflict. However, for input to carry this meaning, the decision maker must
consider it. That is, members feel their status in the group is confirmed when
their input is taken seriously. Individuals are likely to feel more attached to
the group when they sense that they are members in good standing. Thus,
consideration of team member input should enhance members' attachment
to the group. Eisenhardt and Bourgeois's (1988) observation that there was
less political infighting in teams whose leaders had consultative styles provides some indirect support for the model in a strategic decision context.
Hypothesis 3: A team leader's consideration of team
members' input has a positive impact on members' attachment to the team.
Trust in the leader. Strategic decisions will not always be made by
consensus, nor will a team leader's decisions always equally favor all members of a team. Consequently, the team leader needs the trust of members to
maintain direction over the process of making and implementing strategic
decisions. Procedures involving meaningful participation are likely to affect
members' feelings of trust in the team leader. Several studies have demonstrated that perceptions of procedural fairness are positively related to trust
in the leader or decision maker (Alexander & Ruderman, 1987; Folger &
Konovsky, 1989; McFarlin & Sweeney, 1992). Further, Eisenhardt's (1989)
study suggests that a chief executive officer's style can give team members
confidence that their views will be taken into account and allows them to
feel comfortable leaving the ultimate decision in the CEO's hands. Trust is
strengthened because individuals feel they are treated as legitimate, respected members of the team. The leader's consideration of member input

<-----Page 8----->^^

Academy of Management Journal

February

helps communicate this message to members and therefore should affect
members' trust in the leader. Therefore,
Hypothesis 4: A team leader's consideration of team
members' input has a positive impact on the members'
trust in the leader.
The Mediating Effect of Perceived Fairness
Implied in the previous discussion of commitment, attachment, and
trust is that procedural factors such as consideration and influence affect
these attitudes because procedures create a sense of fairness. Fair procedures
allow individuals to have a sense of indirect control over the outcome,
thereby promoting commitment to the decision. Fair procedures also indicate members' status and value to the group and leader, thereby promoting
positive attitudes toward both. In other words, perceptions of fairness mediate the effects of decision-making procedures on decision commitment,
group attachment, and trust in the leader. Specifically,
Hypothesis 5a: Perceptions of procedural fairness mediate the impact 0/ consideration and the interaction of
consideration and influence on commitment to a decision.
Hypothesis 5b: Perceptions 0/ proceduraJ fairness mediate the impact of consideration on attachment to a group.
Hypothesis 5c: Perceptions of procedural fairness mediate the impact of consideration on trust in a team leader.
METHODS
Setting and Design
To test these hypotheses, we conducted an experiment with intact teams
of middle- and upper-level managers. An intact management team is a preexisting, relatively permanent team of employees, as opposed to an ad hoc
group. The use of such teams had two principal advantages over using ad
hoc groups. First, members of intact management teams are more likely to be
emotionally invested in their teams than are members of ad hoc groups.
Second, members of such teams have established relationships with the
team's other members and leader. Gonsequently, intact teams provide a more
realistic and stringent test of the impact of decision-making procedures than
do ad hoc teams.
The sample consisted of 20 intact management teams of a Fortune 500
company participating in its executive development program on strategic
management. Teams were drawn from three divisions of the company: consumer electronics, industrial electronics, and medical technology, and each
consisted of 3 to 6 middle- or upper-level, fast-track managers and a leader.
The sample included 89 team members and 20 team leaders. On the average.

<-----Page 9----->1995

Korsgaard. Schweiger, and Sapienza

69

team members were 41 years old, had worked for the company for 5 years,
had been in their current positions for 3 years, and had been with their teams
for 3 years. Eighty-one percent of the members were men. The mean age of
team leaders was 45 years, and their average length of company experience
was 8 years. Team leaders had been in their current positions for an average
5 years and had been with their teams for 4 years. Eighty-five percent of the
leaders were men.
A two-by-two factorial design was employed, in which we manipulated
consideration (high or low) and influence (high or low), to produce four
experimental conditions. To minimize potential confounding effects of systematic differences while preserving the intact teams, we used random assignment at the team level, with five teams assigned to each of the four
conditions.
Procedure and Task

The study was conducted in the context of a training session on strategic
decision making. Team members first participated in a session on strategy
formulation to ensure their exposure to concepts of strategy. The groups in
each experimental condition had a separate training session. At the beginning of each session, we administered a questionnaire containing demographic questions and premeasures on perceptions of the group and leader.
Teams were instructed in a structured, group-based decision-making technique that they were to apply to a strategic management case. The case used
in this study was the Leitch Quality Drug Company (Glueck, 1980). Following the decision-making exercise, a second questionnaire was administered
that included the dependent variables and manipulation checks.
The object of the case analysis was to make recommendations to the
managing partner of Leitch and to state supporting facts and assumptions.
Team members were to assume the role of members of Leitch's top management team and provide input to their team leader, who had responsibility
over the final decision to which the recommendations pertained. First, team
members worked on the case individually, analyzing the company's situation and developing recommendations and supporting assumptions. Each
team leader received oral instructions on how to lead the structured group
discussion that was to follow the individual analysis process; the manipulations were embedded in these instructions, which are reproduced in the
Appendix. Leaders were instructed to allow each group member to present
his or her assumptions and recommendations without comment from others.
After all members had presented their analyses, the leader separated from
the group and made the final decision concerning the case. The leader then
returned and communicated this decision to the team.
Experimental Manipulations

Consideration. Leaders were instructed to show high or low consideration to each member's input. The manipulation of consideration was based
on behaviors identified by Shapiro (1993). Leaders in the high consideration

<-----Page 10----->^^

condition were required to actively listen to each member's presentation of
the case and to acknowledge individuals' input in communicating the final
decision. Active listening involved asking clarifying questions, taking notes,
and rephrasing the members' statements. Acknowledgment of input involved leaders' noting the commonality of or difference between a member's
recommendations and their own. In the low consideration condition, leaders
were instructed to listen without comment to the input of group members
and to present their final decisions without acknowledging members' input.
Influence. Leaders in the high influence condition was instructed to
change their decisions using whatever team member input they chose. Leaders in this condition were not forced to incorporate all member input because doing so might compromise the quality of decisions. Leaders in the
low influence condition were instructed to present their own, initial decisions as their final decisions. In both conditions, team members were not
told how or if the leaders would use their input, and leaders were instructed
not to reveal the extent to which members influenced their decisions.
Measures
Perceived procedural fairness was measured by four 9-point Likert-type
items, adapted from Tyler and Cain (1981) and Tyler and colleagues (1985),
that assessed the perceived fairness of the procedures used to make a decision; an example is *'How fair were the decision-making procedures used by
your team leader to make his/her case recommendations?" We averaged the
items into a single index of procedural fairness [a = .96). Decision commitment concerned members' commitment to a team leader's decision and was
captured by two 9-point Likert-type items developed by Earley and Lind
(1987); an example is "If the case were a situation your team was actually
facing, how committed would you be to the recommendations decided upon
by your team leader?" The average rating of these two items was used as an
index of commitment (a = .89).
AttQchment to the group concerned the extent to which members identified with and desired to interact with their teams and was assessed by the
average rating of two 9-point Likert-type items adapted from the Michigan
Organizational Assessment Questionnaire (Seashore, Lawler, Mirvis, & Cammann, 1982). An example is "I feel I am really part of my team." Because we
used intact teams, we assessed the effects of the manipulations on changes
in attachment, measuring it before and after the decision-making exercise.
The coefficient alpha of this scale was .91 on both the pretest and posttest
measures. Trust in the leader addressed the degree to which team members
believed their team leaders were trustworthy and was measured by the mean
of four 9-point Likert-type items developed by Roberts and O'Reilly (1974);
an example is "I feel free to discuss the problems and difficulties I have in
my job with my manager." Both pretest and posttest measures of trust were
administered (a = .89 and .97, respectively).
Decision quality. Previous research on strategic decision-making techniques suggests that there may be a trade-off between achieving high-quality

<-----Page 11----->1995

Korsgaard. Schweiger. and Sapienza

71

decisions and member acceptance of those decisions. For example, a consensus approach generates more acceptance than more conflict-based approaches but also results in lower-quality decisions (Schweiger et al., 1989).
Thus, we assessed the effects of consideration and influence on decision
quality as a means of assuring that procedures designed to be fair did not
adversely affect decision quality.
Decision quality was evaluated by two independent judges, one an academic and one a member of the studied organization. Using the rating
procedure outlined by Schweiger and colleagues (Schweiger et al., 1986,
1989), judges evaluated the team leaders' final assumptions and recommendations along three dimensions: the validity of assumptions, the importance
of assumptions, and the overall quality of recommendations. They rated the
validity of assumptions on a five-point scale ranging from 1, "low confidence in the validity," to 5, "high confidence in the validity." Each assumption was rated separately; we aggregated validity ratings for each team into
an overall rating. The importance of assumptions was rated on a five-point
scale ranging from 1, "not important," to 5, "very important." For an overall
rating of importance, we averaged the importance ratings made for each
assumption. The quality of recommendations was rated on a five-point scale
ranging from 1, "low-quality recommendation," to 5, "high-quality recommendation." The degrees of the judges' agreement for validity, importance,
and quality were 91, 87, and 89 percent, respectively. All disagreements
were resolved through discussion. We aggregated ratings of these three dimensions to form a single decision-quality composite for each team (a =
.79).
Manipulation checks. The manipulation of consideration was evaluated
by two 9-point Likert-type items, completed by team members, concerning
the extent to which a leader listened carefully and acknowledged a member's input. We measured the efficacy of the manipulation of influence by
two Likert-type items, completed by leaders, assessing the extent to which
the leaders revised their assumptions and recommendations on the basis of
member input. Table 1 gives descriptive statistics and correlations for all
variables.
RESULTS
Manipulation Checks

Results of a t-test showed that the manipulation of consideration resulted in significantly different perceptions, with members of groups in the
high consideration condition reporting greater consideration of their input
(high consideration, x = 6.10, low consideration, x — 3.76; tgy = 6.91, p <
.05). The analysis of the manipulation check for influence also showed a
significant difference between conditions, with leaders in the high influence
group more likely to use member input (high influence, x = 7.20, low influence, X = 4.05; t^B = 6.89, p < .05).

Effects of Consideration and Influence
Perceptions of fairness. Given that the processes and outcomes are hypothesized to occur at the individual level, the unit of analysis for this study
was the individual. Because random assignment occurred at the team level,
we used a nested design and followed a three-way nested analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure to account for within-condition team effects (Kirk,
1982). This procedure accounts for the variance due to within-condition
differences between teams and uses this term as the error term to produce a
more stringent F. Table 2 summarizes ANOVA results for the effects of the
independent variables on perceived fairness, and Table 3 reports descriptive
statistics within condition.
Hypothesis la, which states that consideration of member input will
have a positive effect on perceptions of procedural fairness, was supported
(F'i.16 = 12.02, p < .01). Specifically, members of the high consideration
groups judged the procedure to be more fair than those in the low consideration groups (high consideration, x = 5.41, low consideration, x = 4.10).
Hypothesis lb, predicting that the effect of consideration on perceptions of
fairness would be stronger for low influence teams, received weak support
(Fi.16 ^ 3-70, p <

.10).

Decision commitment. The effects of the independent variables on decision commitment were analyzed via a three-way ANOVA, with team as a
nested factor (Table 2). Results supported Hypothesis 2a, predicting that
consideration of member input will result in higher decision commitment.

The results show a significant main effect of consideration on commitment
to the leader's decision (high consideration, x = 5.04, low consideration,
X = 4.81; Fi 16 = 10.20, p < .01). Hypothesis 2b, which states that the effect
of consideration on commitment will be stronger when influence is low, was
supported by the significant interaction of influence and consideration (F^ -^g

revealed that consideration only has an impact on decision commitment
when influence is low.

Hypothesis 3, predicting that consideration will have a positive effect
on attachment to the group, was supported in that there was a significant
interaction of time and consideration (F,,,e = 14.36, p < .01) This finding
indicates that levels of attachment changed as a function of leader consideration of member input. Post hoc comparisons of group means revealed ^ a t
attachment increased for members given high consideration (pretest, x 5.80, posttest, X = 6.36) but decreased for members given low consideration
(pretest, x = 6.31, posttest, x = 5.89).
. , . , ,^.,
Trust in leader. A repeated-measures analysis was conducted to test
Hypothesis 4 which predicts that consideration will have a positive effect
on trust in a leader. As Table 4 indicates, the significant interaction of time
and consideration supported this prediction (F,,,6 = 11-51. P < .01). Post
hoc comparisons confirmed, as the pattern of means suggests, that members
trust in leaders increased if the formers' input was considered (pretest, x 5 97, posttest, x = 6.35) but decreased if their input was not considered
(pretest, x - 6.49, postttest, x - 6.00).
Decision quality. To analyze the effects of consideration and lntluence
on decision quality, we conducted a two-way ANOVA with team as the unit
of analysis As anticipated, consideration did not have a significant effect on
decision quality (F^.^g = 0-09)> nor did the interaction of consideration and
influence (F^^ig = 0.36).
Unanticipated Effects of Influence

In addition to the hypothesized effects of the manipulations, influence
alone had an impact on a number of dependent variables. Influence had a
significant main effect on perceptions of fairness, with members of groups in

<-----Page 15----->1995

75

the high influence condition judging the procedure as more fair (high influence, x = 5.20. low influence, X = 4.31; F-^-^Q = 7.30, p < .05). Influence also
had a significant main effect on decision commitment, with members in the
high influence condition more committed to the leader's decision (high influence, X = 5.01, low influence, x = 4.85; Fj ^g = 5.39, p < .05). Further,
the interaction of influence and time had a significant effect on trust (F^^g ~
20.87, p < .001). Post hoc comparisons of group means revealed that in the
high influence groups, members' trust in their team leaders increased over
time (pretest, x — 6.09, posttest, x = 6.58), whereas trust decreased in the
low influence condition (pretest, x = 6.36, posttest, x = 5.77). Finally,
influence had a significant, positive effect on decision quality [F-^-^Q = 7.20,
p < .05), in that leaders of teams in the high influence condition (x = 4.03)
made better-quality decisions than leaders of teams in the low influence
condition (x = 3.43). Thus, when team members are allowed to influence a
leader's decision, the quality of the decision is enhanced.
Mediating Effects of the Perceived Fairness of Procedures

It was hypothesized that perceptions of procedural fairness would mediate the impact of consideration and influence on decision commitment,
attachment, and trust. For us to demonstrate such a mediating effect of
perceived procedural fairness, the independent variables had to be related to
fairness perceptions and to the dependent variables (Baron & Kenny. 1986).
These two conditions were met in the ANOVA results outlined above. Further, the relationship between the independent and dependent variables had
to diminish or disappear after the variance due to the perceived fairness of
the procedures was accounted for (Baron & Kenny, 1986). To test for this
condition, we conducted an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with perceived fairness as the covariate, for each of the dependent variables.
Hypothesis 5a predicts that perceived procedural fairness will mediate
the main effect of consideration and the interaction of consideration and
influence on decision commitment. The results of the ANCOVA revealed
that both effects were still significant when we controlled for perceived
fairness (consideration, F^^g = 4.58, p < .05; consideration x influence,
^1,16 ^ 7.31, p < .05). However, the magnitude of these effects was smaller
when we controlled for perceived fairness: without the control, the main
effect of consideration had an eta-square equal to .05; with fairness perceptions as a covariate, the eta-square for consideration was equal to .01. A
similar result was found for the interaction of consideration and influence
(without fairness perceptions, Ti^ = .05; with fairness perceptions, TI^ = .03).
These results suggest that perceived fairness partially mediates the effects of
consideration and influence on decision commitment.
Hypothesis 5b states that perceptions of procedural fairness will mediate the effect of consideration on group attachment. The ANCOVA results
indicated that that effect was still significant with perceived fairness controlled [F^^Q = 13.06, p < .01), and its magnitude was slightly reduced when
perceived fairness was accounted for (without fairness perceptions, T]^ =

<-----Page 16----->Academy of Management Journal

February

.07; with fairness perceptions, T)' = .06). This finding suggests that perceived fairness provides weak, partial mediation of the effect of consideration on attachment to the group.
Hypothesis 5c predicts that procedural fairness perceptions will mediate the effect of consideration on trust. That effect was not significant with
perceived fairness accounted for (F, .^ - 3.13, p > .05), indicating that the
perceived fairness of procedures fully mediates the impact of consideration
on trust.
DISCUSSION
This study examined the impact of different decision-making procedures on intact management teams in three divisions of a Fortune 500 company. In so doing, it sought to shed light on the antecedents of organizational
cooperation and to contrihute to research on strategic decision making and
procedural justice. The results indicate that the processes by which strategic
decisions are made do indeed have a significant impact on team members.
Specifically, the manner in which team leaders elicit, receive, and respond
to team members' input affects their attitudes toward the decisions themselves and toward the other members of teams, including the leaders. This
study's most important finding may be that, even in intact management
teams, with their attendant histories, values, and norms of behavior, leaders'
styles of conducting a decision-making procedure elicited changes in team
members' affect toward the teams and the leaders and influenced how committed team members were to the decisions reached. The results hold out the
possibility that leaders of strategic decision-making teams can use procedures that improve the chances of gaining cooperation and commitment to
decisions without sacrificing the quality of decisions in the process.
The results indicate strong support for five of the six hypotheses concerning the effects of consideration and influence and weak support for one.
Specifically, we found that when team leaders showed strong consideration
of members' input, team members saw the process as fairer, and consequently, had greater commitment to the decision, greater attachment to the
team, and greater trust in the leader. These effects of consideration on affective responses were found over and above the main effects of influence. We
also found that, as hypothesized, the impact of consideration on commitment to a decision was significantly greater when leaders did not allow team
members' input to influence their decisions. In addition, we found partial
support for the hypotheses predicting that justice perceptions mediate the
impact of procedures on commitment, attachment, and trust.
We found weak support for the prediction that the extent to which a
leader allowed team members' input to influence a decision would moderate
the effect of consideration on perceptions of fairness. This result may indicate that consideration has a relatively unconditional effect on judgments of
procedural fairness. Alternatively, it is possible that the weak result reflects
the lower power to detect relationships inherent in the nested design.

<-----Page 17----->1995

One unexpected result was that feelings of attachment and trust significantly decreased over time when leaders exhibited no specific signs of
consideration of input. This pattern of results may be evidence of the "frustration effect," in which voice in decision making results in resentment
rather than acceptance of a decision (Greenberg & Folger, 1983). When a
decision maker fails to respond to input, perceptions of unfairness may be
more severe than they would be if participants had no voice at all (Greenberg
& Folger, 1983). This finding suggests that middle- and upper-level managers
may not only appreciate but may expect some degree of consideration for
their input. When team members are asked to be involved in strategic decision making, they expect their input to be taken seriously.
Implications for Strategic Decision-Making Research

Previous research on strategic decision making (e.g., Schweiger et al.,
1986, 1989) has speculated that engendering positive attitudes in teams toward decisions and other team members is achieved at the expense of decision quality. However, our results indicate that achieving positive affect
does not adversely influence the quality of decisions. Here, leaders achieved
positive affect through careful consideration of team members' input. The
results suggest that leaders may not need to relinquish control over decision
quality to gain commitment and subsequent cooperation; they merely have
to treat people fairly and with respect. This interpretation is consistent with
Eisenhardt's (1989) finding that team members were content to allow a GEO
to make strategic decisions as long as they were sure that their views were
known and considered. Although the subjects of this research were middleand upper-level managers, the findings are potentially applicable to GEOs or
leaders of top management teams who daily face the kinds of tasks and
challenges studied here.
This study also helps explain why, as Woolridge and Floyd noted (1990:
239), involvement in strategic decisions by itself is insufficient to create
commitment and cooperation. Leaders who include individuals on a management team merely because it is the politically wise thing to do—rather
than because they sincerely want their input—may be undermining rather
than improving their chances of garnering necessary support and effective
implementation. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that by overtly showing
consideration in the strategic decision-making process, leaders can achieve
support for initiatives even if they do not attempt to compromise to meet the
interests of all constituencies. Thus, they may be able to expand the range of
the implementable (Guth & MacMillan, 1986). Such latitude may prove to be
a significant strategic advantage over less effectively run firms.
Finally, this study supports the position that leadership may be particularly important to effective strategic decision-making processes (Eisenhardt
& Bourgeois, 1988; Thomas, 1988). The results show that how leaders interacted with team members during decision making had a significant impact
on several dimensions potentially critical to future cooperation. The findings not only indicate the importance of a decision maker's conduct toward

<-----Page 18----->7ft

team members, but also Illustrate the ease with which managers can be
trained to be considerate. The effect of consideration was achieved by providing team leaders with simple instructions on how to evaluate and respond to member input. Thus, enhancing the fairness of decision-making
procedures does not require any special interpersonal skills. However, leaders' ability to generate feelings conducive to information sharing and cooperation both horizontally across functions and vertically across levels may
yield a competitive advantage for an organization.
Implications for Procedural Justice Research

These findings also contribute to our understanding of the function of
procedural justice in decision making. First, the success of our manipulation
of consideration validates and extends previous findings concerning the role
of consideration in procedural justice. Because previous studies have assessed the impact of consideration as a measured variable (e.g., Leung & Li,
1990), causal inferences concerning it have been limited, and little is known
about how to get decision makers or leaders to act considerately. Guided by
Shapiro's findings (1993) concerning what it means to have input considered, the present study provides evidence of the effects of decision makers'
consideration of input on affective responses. Further, this study provides a
strong test of a basic proposition of the group-value model of procedural
justice, that decision-making procedures affirming people's standing in a
group produce positive feelings toward the group, leader, and organization
(Lind & Taylor, 1988). The finding that, independent of the opportunity to
influence the leader, consideration of input changed these attitudes shows
that group members placed significant value on their group standing. However, the effect of consideration on decision quality is unclear. Although the
results show that influence has a positive impact on decision quality, the
high mean scores that accompanied high influence might have prevented us
from detecting a positive impact of consideration on decision quality.
Limitations and Future Directions

Future research could benefit from identifying the major limitations of
this study. First, the teams worked on written cases in a training setting
rather than on the actual strategic decisions they were facing. Moreover,
although the present study demonstrated that leaders are capable of giving
consideration to member input, it is unclear whether or when leaders are
willing to act in this manner. Further, although we used a repeated-measures
design, the relatively brief time frame of the study limited our ability to draw
definitive conclusions about the extent to which observed changes in attitudes would persist. Finally, because we used intact teams, random assignment to conditions occurred only at the team level, placing limits on causal
inferences made on individual-level outcomes. However, we specifically
chose to study intact teams in order to test the power of fairness procedures
in the most stringent of contexts, one in which there already existed a history, values, and norms.

<-----Page 19----->"1995

Korsgaard, Schweiger, and Sapienza

79

Future research should address the following issues. First, researchers
should continue to examine the links between procedures, fairness perceptions, affective responses, and cooperative behavior. Second, researchers
should examine the role of fairness in decision implementation. Factors
such as the degree to which decisions can be corrected or modified may also
affect fairness judgments (Sheppard & Lewicki, 1987). Third, future research
should assess the extent to which leaders are willing to behave fairly and
factors that may inhibit the application of fair procedures in strategic decision making. Fourth, to more fully test whether fair procedures are still
effective under conditions of high conflict, researchers should attempt to
integrate fair procedures with decision-making procedures designed to enhance decision quality. Fifth, fairness concerns should be examined in situations in which a team leader plays a less directive role in the decisionmaking process than the leaders did here. The way in which members respond to one another may be also important to building commitment to a
decision, particularly when there is diversity of opinion. Training team
members as well as team leaders to show consideration of input may prove
fruitful in such cases. Finally, future research on fairness in group decision
making should address group-related factors, such as opinion diversity
(Greenberg & Folger, 1983) and group status (Lind & Tyler, 1988), that are
likely to moderate the impact of procedures on perceptions and attitudes.
In conclusion, this study reinforces the call for and the potential fruitfulness of further investigation into the dynamics of strategic decisionmaking processes. It especially calls attention to the need to understand the
determinants of and consequences of affective or emotional elements in
strategic decision making (Eisenhardt, 1989; Kim & Mauborgne, 1993;
Schweiger et al., 1989). As did Kim and Mauborgne, we demonstrate the
usefulness of applications of procedural justice theory to understanding strategic decision making and its potential to inform efforts to improve strategic
decision-making practice. This is the first study to specify procedural elements that will enhance affective responses to strategic decision making important to cooperative team relations without compromising the quality of
decisions.

After working individually on the case, each team leader received one of the following sets
of instructions, with the choice depending upon the condition to which they were assigned.

"Now you will get back together with your group and listen to their presentations. We want
you to use a structured approach. First, have each member present his or her view of the case,
allowing about 10 minutes per presentation. Do not allow any interruptions or evaluations of
the presentations. Even you should not comment or question the presentation, just allow them
to speak. That way, everyone will get a chance to state his or her own case free from criticism.
Do not present your views at this time or comment on anyone else's views. This is just a time
to gather information, not evaluate it.
"After everyone has spoken, you will privately evaluate members' assumptions and recommendations. Compare each member's assumptions and recommendations with your own
and look for commonalities. Make a note when you see commonalities between your own
recommendations and assumptions and your team members. Do this for each member of your
team. Try to come up with some comments relating to each member's recommendations.
"After you have evaluated all of your members' answers, you will go back to the group to
present the recommendations that you developed prior to examining theirs. Read your recommendations to the group. Do not change from your initial recommendations. Do not discuss
your evaluations of the group's recommendations at this point."

these presentations, take notes of the key recommendations and any questions you have. After
each presentation, restate the team member's recommendations in your own words to make sure

minimize miscommunications. Ask any questions to clarify what the member said, but do not
evaluate or critique his or her ideas. Do not present your views at this time. This is just a time
