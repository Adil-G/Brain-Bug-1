Abstract
Knowledge is recognized as a crucial element of economic growth in addition to physical capital and labor. Knowledge can be
transformed into products and processes and is, in this way, exploited commercially. The ability to produce, identify, and exploit
knowledge depends on the existing knowledge stock and the absorptive capacity of actors such as employees at firms and researchers
at universities and research institutions. The existing knowledge stock might not be commercialized to its full extent; therefore,
knowledge flows must occur and transmission channels are needed. The paper tests the hypotheses that entrepreneurship and
university–industry relations are vehicles for knowledge flows and, thus, spur economic growth.

1. Introduction
It is important to understand why regions postdifferent growth rates. Labor and physical capital certainly are important sources of economic growth, but
knowledge creation, flows, and capitalization are also
important elements in stimulating economic development. Recent empirical studies (Plummer and Acs, 2005;
Acs and Varga, 2005; Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004a,b;
Varga and Schalk, 2004) have shown that knowledge
spillovers positively affect technological change and
economic growth. An earlier study by Glaeser et al.
(1992) found evidence that growth in cities is promoted
by local competition and by a great level of diversity.
Entrepreneurship is a possible vehicle to increase the

level of industrial diversity and to affect local competition by challenging incumbent firms. Historic industrial
diversity promotes a diversified skill base which allows
new high-tech industries to utilize these skills and profit
from them (Henderson et al., 1995).
This study focuses on the commercialization of
knowledge, which is understood as the transformation
of knowledge into products, processes, and organizations
and their contribution to regional economic growth. Different factors may explain why the degree of knowledge
commercialization varies across regions. One explanation could be differences in the amount of research
and development activities across regions. Research and
development is crucial for the ability to identify, absorb,
and exploit internally and externally generated knowledge created by other firms or research institutions (see
Cohen and Levinthal, 1989). Therefore, a low level
of research and development in a region may not just
result in a lower level of absorptive capacity but also

<-----Page 1----->1500

in a lower degree of knowledge exploitation in these
regions.
Another reason may be underexploited knowledge:
incumbent firms do not exploit new knowledge to the
full extent, or knowledge generated in research institutions and universities is hardly commercialized at all.
Consequently, knowledge flows are necessary for other
actors to exploit the new knowledge. Entrepreneurship
and university–industry relations may function as mechanisms for knowledge flows as well as the commercialization of knowledge.
This paper analyzes regional economic performance
by using a production function approach similar to
Audretsch and Keilbach (2004a). One contribution of
this study is the examination of a cross-sectional time
series, which allows controlling for unobserved heterogeneity between the regions. A second contribution
is that university research and its utilization by private businesses are also considered. The results of the
econometric analysis suggest that regions with a high
level of entrepreneurship and university–industry relationships experience greater productivity, and consequently, economic growth. In particular, both start-ups
in innovative industries and university research in engineering science foster economic growth. The remainder
of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
the theoretical framework and links the channels of
knowledge flows to economic performance. Section 3
describes the methodology and database. The relationship between economic performance and entrepreneurship and university–industry relations is empirically
tested in Section 4. Section 5 provides a summary and a
conclusion.
2. The capitalization of knowledge and the
importance of knowledge ﬂows
Although knowledge is understood as an essential
driver of economic growth, it is hardly linked to growth in
empirical analyses. The new growth theory proposed that
knowledge stimulates technological progress, thereby
increasing productivity. Romer (1986, 1990) and Lucas
(1988) explained economic growth through the accumulation and spillover of technological knowledge. New
knowledge is a crucial input factor for innovation and
is commercialized by transforming it into new products, processes, and organizations. Research and development activities are a vehicle for private businesses,
universities, and other research institutions to generate new knowledge. Firms face the decision to carry
out research and development by themselves; engage in
research alliances with other firms, universities, or gov-

ernment laboratories; contract out specific research and
development projects; recruit researchers and scientists
from other firms or research institutions (Bercovitz and
Feldman, 2005; Arundel and Geuna, 2004). Therefore,
not only the knowledge-producer but also other organizations such as private and public businesses, research
institutions, or universities can also apply and commercialize the newly generated knowledge. Whereas the
other organizations are usually in the same industry or
discipline, they may also be in related or different industries or disciplines. However, the possibility to exploit
knowledge from the environment particularly requires
it to flow. Knowledge spillovers allow other economic
actors to exploit the newly created knowledge as well as
resulting in an acceleration of economic growth. Cohen
and Levinthal (1989) conclude that research and development activities not only generate innovations but also
increase the firm’s ability to identify, assimilate, and
exploit externally created knowledge (see also Cohen
and Levinthal, 1990; Zucker et al., 1998). This indicates
that the higher the level of research and development
activities, the greater the level of absorptive capacity as
well as the pool of knowledge that can be exploited.
The created knowledge may be underexploited. One
explanation may be that incumbent firms do not want to
take the risk combined with new products or processes.
They might focus on exploiting the profit possibilities
of their given product program, and they are not interested in searching for new opportunities and realizing
them (Audretsch, 1995; Geroski, 1995). Furthermore,
the deployed technology, the factual production capacity,
or the availability of qualified human capital may also
affect the exploitation of knowledge. Even if firms do
not commercialize knowledge to the full extent, patenting or secrecy may be an effective tool in order to protect
intellectual property and to hinder knowledge spillovers
(Cohen et al., 2002a). Cohen (2005) suggests that patents
are not as important as secrecy, lead time, and complementary capabilities, which are the key mechanisms for
appropriating returns to innovations in most industries.
Patents only play a critical role in a small number of
industries, in particular drugs and medical equipment;
other industries use the other mechanisms to protect
innovations (see also Arora et al., 2005).
Underexploited knowledge also results if research
carried out at universities and research institutions is
hardly translated into new products or services (Pavitt,
2001). The two primary missions of universities are
research and teaching and not specifically the capitalization of their generated knowledge. A direct contribution to the industry via research alliances with
firms as well as an active strategy in extending the

<-----Page 2----->P. Mueller / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1499–1508

research process into the development process are, possibly, a third mission of universities (Etzkowitz and
Leydesdorff, 2000; Etzkowitz, 1998). Therefore, possible vehicles for the commercialization of academic
research are university–industry partnerships or the creation of university spin-off companies (Rosenberg and
Nelson, 1994; Hall et al., 2003; Arundel and Geuna,
2004; Meyer, 2003; Di Gregrio and Shane, 2002; MeyerKrahmer and Schmoch, 1998). The importance of academic research was also underlined by Mansfield (1998)
as well as by Beise and Stahl (1999). They concluded
that a part of new products and processes could only be
developed because of academic research and would have
been substantially delayed otherwise.
Furthermore, different studies suggest that knowledge spillovers depend on a strong regional component,
thereby taking advantage of spatial proximity to research
facilities, universities, and industry specific agglomerations (Jaffe et al., 1993; Anselin et al., 1997, 2000;
Audretsch and Feldman, 1996; Glaeser et al., 1992;
Henderson et al., 1995). Analyzing patent citations,
Jaffe et al. (1993) found that knowledge spillovers from
academic research to private industries have a strong
regional component. Arundel and Geuna (2004) found
that proximity is important for the use of public science.
Spillovers from university may also affect firm growth
(Audretsch and Lehmann, 2005). The closer that firms
are located to a university and the higher the number of
academic papers published at this university, the higher
the growth rates for these firms are. The argued explanation for the regional localization of knowledge is usually
the tacit nature of knowledge, which is obtained via
direct, interpersonal contacts (Anselin et al., 1997, 2000;
Maskell and Malmberg, 1999; Hippel, 1987; Senker,
1995). As long as there is a delay between the discovery
of knowledge and its codification, the premier mechanisms for knowledge flows are interpersonal interactions
(Arundel and Geuna, 2004). Firms are then able to access
knowledge faster and more successfully and are more
likely to know where to access new knowledge via local,
direct, and interpersonal contacts. A study by MeyerKrahmer and Schmoch (1998) showed that informal
contacts also have a high value for academic researchers.
University researchers ranked collaborative research and
informal contacts as the two most important interaction
types between universities and industry. According to
in-depth interviews, both interaction types are characterized by a high degree of bi-directional exchange of
knowledge.
Acs et al. (2005) develop the concept of a knowledge filter, which functions as a barrier limiting the
total conversion of knowledge into new products,

1501

processes, and organizations. Thereby, knowledge is
transformed into economically useful knowledge by
either incumbent firms or start-ups. Incumbent firms
learn, increase their absorptive capacity, and incorporate new knowledge into their firm-specific knowledge; thus, they absorb knowledge spillovers. New ventures are assumed to be the mechanism to transmit
knowledge and transform it via knowledge spillovers
into economically relevant knowledge. Nevertheless,
their concept does not account for universities as
knowledge-producers and university–industry relations
as a mechanism for knowledge spillovers. Entrepreneurship as well as university–industry relations are proposed as possible transmission channels for knowledge.
It is assume that they penetrate the knowledge filter,
thereby stimulating the commercialization of knowledge. Furthermore, these two determinants in addition to research and development activities may, particularly, explain why regions post-different growth
rates.
Entrepreneurial activity, taking the opportunity and
setting up a business, is one possible mechanism in
which knowledge spills over and the capitalization of
knowledge occurs. Founders of the new ventures might
have worked for incumbent firms or universities before
they commercialize the new knowledge, thereby inheriting knowledge from their former employer. Innovative
start-ups may introduce new products or even create
new markets. According to Audretsch (1995), many
radical innovations have been introduced by new firms
rather than by incumbents. Studies on spin-offs found
that frustration with the (former) employer as well as
the expectation of greater financial rewards are reasons
that cause individuals to leave their employer and lead
them to create their own firm (Garvin, 1983; Klepper
and Sleeper, 2005). Starting a firm might be the most
promising or even the only possibility to commercialize knowledge (Audretsch, 1995). Particularly, frustration may arise among the scientists and engineers if
their ideas about a new product or process are rejected
by their employer (see Garvin, 1983 for examples).
According to Agarwal et al. (2004), existing organizations with abundant underexploited knowledge represent
seed-beds for spin-offs. Employee mobility and spin-offs
are important vehicles for the diffusion of knowledge
in technology- or knowledge-intensive industries. This
pattern can be observed in the laser industry, disk drive
industry, tire industry, and the wireless telecommunication industry (Klepper and Sleeper, 2005; Buenstorf
and Klepper, 2005; Agarwal et al., 2004; Dahl et al.,
2003; Sull, 2001; Franco and Filson, 2000; Christensen,
1993).

<-----Page 3----->1502

P. Mueller / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1499–1508

University–industry linkages are proposed as the second mechanism facilitating the exploitation of knowledge and the flow of ideas (Mansfield and Lee,
1996; Fritsch and Lukas, 2001; Arundel and Geuna,
2004; Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch, 1998). Interactions between universities and industry are recognized to
increase the rate of innovation in the economy and many
governments have taken up the cause of enhancing these
research alliances (Cohen et al., 2002a; Spencer, 2001;
Laurensen and Salter, 2004). According to the European
Commission, firms in Europe especially fail to commercialize new knowledge generated in universities and
other public research institutions in comparison to their
U.S. counterparts (EC, 2001; Arundel and Geuna, 2004).
Unsurprisingly, public research hardly results in readyto-produce innovations; however, if the generated knowledge is transferred via research alliances it may accelerate technology transfer and enable firms to develop new
products and processes (Cohen et al., 2002a; Spencer,
2001; Mansfield, 1991, 1998; Rosenberg and Nelson,
1994).
The types of university–industry relations amongst
others may include informal information sharing among
research partners, one-on-one research ventures, contract research on solving a specific problem of firms,
or seminars for industry (Hertzfeld et al., 2005; MeyerKrahmer and Schmoch, 1998). Arundel and Geuna
(2004) found that Europe’s largest firms mainly assess
public research output by hiring trained scientists and
engineers, through informal personal contacts, by contracting research out to public research organizations,
and through joint research projects. Analyzing the influence of public research on industrial R&D in the U.S.,
Cohen et al. (2002b) found that the dominant channel of knowledge transfer was publications and reports
followed by informal exchange, public meetings or
conferences, and consulting. Businesses rated contract
research, cooperative ventures, patens, and hiring graduates as moderately important. However, they only
included those firms with R&D laboratories in their
study. Scott (2003) points out that firms use research
alliances with universities as a vehicle to expand and
complement their absorptive capacity. Especially firms
that have downsized their research and development
facilities may benefit from linkages with universities
(Adams et al., 2001). Additionally, small ventures use
collaborative research with universities or research institutions to obtain access to R&D inputs (Audretsch
and Feldman, 1996). On the contrary, Czarnitzki and
Rammer, 2000 study on Germany suggests that firms
with fewer than 500 employees use less knowledge from
universities and research institutions than large firms. In

manufacturing, only 11% of the small firms draw knowledge from publicly funded research institutes compared
to 24% of large firms. Moreover, universities are used
more often as a source of knowledge than other research
institutions such as Fraunhofer Gesellschaft or Max
Planck Society. Laurensen and Salter (2004) found that
firms which frequently draw from externally generated
knowledge are also more likely to use universities as a
source of knowledge (see also Bercovitz and Feldman,
2005). Therefore, university–industry research partnerships are transmission channels for both small and large
firms to generate, receive, apply, and commercialize
knowledge.

3. Data and methodology
In order to test the hypothesis that entrepreneurship and university–industry relations stimulate economic growth, a Cobb-Douglas production function is
employed in order to estimate regional economic performance for the West German regions between 1992 and
2002 (in the style of Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004a).
The analysis is restricted to West Germany because East
Germany can be regarded as a special case with very
specific conditions not comparable to the West in the
1990s (Fritsch, 2004; Kronthaler, 2005). One important
contribution of this paper is the analysis of panel data,
hence, the consideration of the cross-section and timeseries dimension. The spatial analysis is on the level of
planning regions, which usually consist of a core city and
the surrounding counties. There are at least two reasons
to use the spatial concept of planning regions. First, they
account for the economic interaction between the counties and cities. Secondly, most universities in Germany
are located in cities. The spatial concept of planning
regions takes into account that adjacent districts without
a university benefit from research carried out at universities in the same planning region.1
The following model is employed to analyze
the impact of capital, research and development,
entrepreneurship, and university–industry relations on

1 Although polytechnics (also called universities of applied science
or Fachhochschule in German) are located in smaller cities and rural
areas, they receive very little in the way of grants from private businesses. Only one planning region does not have a university or a
polytechnic. Grants from industrial sources do not exist in about 10%
of the planning regions. This is often due to the fact that music conservatories and art schools rarely receive research grants from private
businesses. There are a few examples of universities that did not receive
any grants.

The parameter α1 represents the elasticity of capital
intensity. An additional term on labor is included in
the model to test for deviation from the case of constant returns to scale (parameter α2 ), which proves to
be significant. The output elasticities of R&D in private businesses (RDI) and in universities (RDP) are
measured by the parameters α3 and α4 . The impact of
entrepreneurship (E) and university–industry relationships (UI) is measured by the parameters α5 and α6 .
The model includes population density (AGG) as a control variable. Population density is meant to control for
agglomeration externalities, e.g., the proximity to universities and research institutions, availability of human
capital and highly skilled employees. The subscript i
denotes the planning regions in West Germany and t
denotes time, namely 1992–2002. The fixed-effect estimator allows controlling for the unobservable regional
specific effect (μi ). The regressions estimate the heteroscedasticity robust standard error. Additionally, the
regressions control for spatial autocorrelation by including the average residuals of adjacent regions (ϕit ). However, the coefficients of the other variables hardly change
if this control variable is not included in the models.
This might indicate that the concept of planning regions
already account for spatial interaction and spillovers.
Regional aggregate output Y is measured by regional
gross value added of all industries (at constant 1995
prices). The physical capital stock K is estimated with
gross fixed capital formation (investments, at constant
1995 prices) following the perpetual inventory method
(see also Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004a or Audretsch et
al., 2006).2 Due to confidentiality, the gross fixed capital
formation of some districts is not reported; therefore, two
planning regions had to be excluded from the analysis.
Labor L is measured by the number of employees. The
establishment file of the German Social Insurance Statis2 Various publications of the Federal Statistical Office and statistical
offices of each state provided data on regional gross value added and
gross fixed capital formation (investments). Data on gross fixed capital
formation (investment) are annually published by each statistical office
of the German Federal States (series EI 6). Data on regional gross value
added are published by the working group of the Statistical Offices of
the German Federal States, Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnung der
Laender every other year between 1976 and 1990 and annually since
1992.

tics provided the number of employees in each region.
The number of employees does not comprise civil servants, army personnel, or self-employed because they
are not obliged to contribute to the social insurance system. Only employees in public and private businesses
must be reported to the Federal Employment Office for
enrollment in the social insurance system (for details see
Fritsch and Brixy, 2004).
The share of employees devoted to research and
development in the private sector measures R&D in private industries (RDI). Public research (RDP) is measured
by the share of researchers and scientists at universities
per overall employees in the respective region. Employees in the private sector who have a university degree
in engineering or natural science are used as a proxy
for employees engaged in research and development
in private businesses. Information exists for the years
from 1987 to 2002. It is most likely that the number of
employees engaged in research and development is overestimated. First, not every employee in these occupations
must be automatically engaged in research and development. Secondly, researchers may move from research
and development into other functions later in their career,
for example, the co-ordination of other researchers or
staff (Zellner, 2003; Biddle and Roberts, 1993). The
share of employees characterized as R&D personnel
ranges from 0.8% to 5.7% (Table 1). The Federal Statistical Office provided data on the number of researchers
and scientists at each university for the years 1992–2002.
Researchers and scientists are comprised of professors,
research assistants, or technical personal in laboratories (all full-time personal). On average, 0.3% of the
employees in each region are scientists or researchers at
universities.
Regional entrepreneurial activity is measured by the
number of new ventures formed per 1000 employees
in the respective district. The German Social Insurance
Statistics (IAB) as well as the ZEW foundation panel
provided information on regional entrepreneurship. Both
data sources are not fully comparable but complement
one another. First, the German Social Insurance Statistics only lists new businesses with at least one employee
who is subject to obligatory social insurance (for details
see Fritsch and Brixy, 2004). The ZEW Foundation
Panel also registers start-ups consisting of only owners and only new independent firms not branches or
plants of existing firms (for more details see Almus et al.,
2002; for details on a comparison see Fritsch and Niese,
2002). Between 1996 and 1998 the German Social Insurance Statistics reported on average 189,000 start-ups and
the ZEW Foundation Panel reported 260,000 start-ups
(Fritsch and Niese, 2002). The number of start-ups is

correlated by 0.95 on the regional level between 1992
and 2002.
The advantage of the ZEW Foundation Panel is
that it allows identifying innovative start-ups on the
basis of the NACE industry classification (Nomenclature
générale des Activités économique dans les Communautés Européennes) since 1990. The German Social
Insurance Statistics first introduced the NACE as an
industry classification in 1998, using another industry classification since 1983. The industry classification
NACE allows identifying innovative start-ups: namely,
start-ups in R&D-intensive manufacturing industries,
knowledge-intensive services, and technology-intensive
services. It is assumed that start-ups in innovative
industries reflect knowledge-related entrepreneurship.
Founders of businesses in innovative industries are rather
unlikely to start a venture out of necessity and are more
likely to enhance knowledge spillovers by being a spinoff of a research intensive firm or research institution.
The share of innovative start-ups is used as an indicator of knowledge related entrepreneurship. According to
the ZEW Foundation Panel, the share of innovative startups, start-ups in knowledge- and technology-intensive
service industries, is on average 12%.
The regional level of university–industry relations is
measured by the amount of grants given from firms in the
private sector to universities per academic researchers
and scientists (constant 1995 prices). This information
is available for each university and has been aggregated
to the spatial level of planning regions from 1992 to 2002.

The available data on industry grants do not differentiate
between disciplines such as mathematics, information
technologies, biology, physics, chemistry, engineering,
medicine, or social science. Only the total amount of
grants (comprising of grants from the German Science
Foundation, industry, governmental organizations, and
foundations) is separately reported for different disciplines. Although the total value of grants from industrial
sources is highly correlated with the total value of all
grants with a correlation coefficient of 0.95, the distribution between the disciplines cannot be assumed to be the
same. Some disciplines might be dominated by industrial funds, others by the foundations, or governmental
institutions.
A closer examination of the total amount of grants
regarding different disciplines shows that engineering
receives most of the grants. The field of engineering acquired on average 20% of all grants (Table 1).
Researchers and scientists in natural science (i.e., biology, chemistry, or physics) acquired on average 16% of
all grants. The disciplines of mathematics and information technologies received on average 5% of all
grants and are, herewith, even behind general social sciences. Furthermore, the universities, unfortunately, are
not asked to report the location of financial granter.
Therefore, there is no information on the location of the
firms that gave grants. Of course, it is rather unlikely that
research alliances are only formed between firms and
universities that are located in the same planning region.
However, Mansfield and Lee (1996) concluded that the

<-----Page 6----->P. Mueller / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1499–1508

proximity of a university in addition to its size and
quality enhance research collaboration between large
U.S. corporations and universities. Fritsch and Schwirten
(1999) analyzed three German regions and found that
research partners of universities and polytechnics are
mostly located in Germany and about 40% are located
in the close surroundings of the universities or polytechnics. Nevertheless, location may be less relevant if the
university’s research is unique and indispensable for a
firm and such research can be purchased easily.
4. Entrepreneurship and university–industry
relations and economic growth
If entrepreneurship and university–industry relations
are successful in penetrating the knowledge filter, knowledge flows are facilitated and a positive impact on
economic performance can be expected. The empirical
results indicate that not only physical capital and labor
are sources of growth but also the regional knowledge
stock, entrepreneurship, and university–industry relations are relevant. A statistically positive relationship
between regional labor productivity and capital intensity is always found (Table 2). The results confirm that
both research in private firms and at universities are necessary conditions for economic growth. The impact of
research and development activities in the private sector on regional economic performance is stronger than
the impact of research carried out at universities. A
possible explanation for the lower impact of university
research is that knowledge generated in universities is
rarely commercialized by the university, it still needs
to be applied, and does not automatically result in new
products and processes (see also Pavitt, 2001). Its com-

1505

mercialization depends on additional knowledge transfer
channels.
The two proposed transmission channels for knowledge spillovers enter the regression in the predicted positive way (Table 2, model II). Regions with a higher
level of new firm formation activity also experience
greater economic productivity. Setting up a firm reflects
the commercialization of knowledge. Entrepreneurship
penetrates the knowledge filter and stimulates economic
growth. University–industry relations also confirm their
ability to penetrate the knowledge filter.
The results suggest that research relations are a significant vehicle to commercialize the knowledge generated
at universities, which is usually abundant but underexploited. Research collaboration between the industrial
sector and universities allow knowledge transfers in both
directions and significantly affect regional economic
productivity. The region’s population density controls
for agglomeration externalities, which proves to be positive and significant. Agglomerated areas are usually
characterized by a greater amount of skilled labor, human
capital, and research institutions which are conducive to
superior economic performance (Glaeser et al., 1992).
The general measure of entrepreneurship may be
misleading because it does not differentiate between
necessity and opportunity entrepreneurship. New ventures in knowledge- or technology-intensive industries
are most likely founded because of opportunities and are
a better reflection of knowledge spillovers. Therefore,
the proportion of innovative start-ups (based on the
ZEW Foundation Panel) is included in the model to
measure knowledge-related entrepreneurship (Table 3).
Knowledge-related entrepreneurship can be interpreted

entrepreneurship. New firms in innovative industries
are an important mechanism for knowledge spillovers
and the commercialization of knowledge. Furthermore,
results suggest that regional divergence is amplified if
regions with a low level of innovative start-ups are not
able to close the gap with other regions. Audretsch and
Keilbach (2004b) found that high-tech and knowledgeintensive entrepreneurship had a positive impact on the
region’s growth rate of labor productivity.
The effect of university–industry relations most likely
differs by discipline, i.e., engineering, natural science,
and information technologies. Some disciplines like
social science receive few grants from industrial sources
but do receive grants from the German Science Foundation or other governmental institutions. As mentioned
earlier, statistics regarding industrial grants do not allow
a differentiation between disciplines. However, since
the total value of grants from industry, German Science
Foundation, or other governmental agencies is reported
separately and the total value is highly correlated with
industrial grants, the total value of grants per researcher
in each discipline is used as a proxy (compare models
I and II, Table 3). Grants in engineering sciences significantly affect regional economic performance. Grants
in mathematics and information technologies are also
significant. Research in natural science is less applied,
and the results show that grants in this area do not have
a direct effect on regional economic performance. The
results are not surprising; research in engineering sciences is expected to be more applied in nature.

5. Concluding remarks
This paper addresses an important research
question—the transfer and commercialization of knowledge through entrepreneurship as well as university–
industry relationships and the impact of this on regional
economic growth. The results are three-fold. First, a
well developed regional knowledge stock is a crucial
determinant of regional economic performance. New
knowledge needs to be generated at existing firms
and research institutions before it can be exploited.
Researchers at firms and universities must be able to
apply and assimilate knowledge. The evidence suggests
that both basic and applied research promotes growth.
Secondly, regions with a higher level of entrepreneurship experience greater economic performance. In
particular, new firm formation in innovative industries
is an important mechanism to commercialize knowledge. Thirdly, universities are a source of innovations:
the more firms draw from knowledge generated at
universities, the more those regions experience economic growth. Consequently, it may be concluded
that the proposed knowledge transmission channels –
entrepreneurship and university–industry relations –
increase the permeability of the knowledge filter, thus
improving regional economic performance.
Empirical studies found that firms are most likely to
draw from university research if they follow specific
innovation strategies. Firms with internal R&D strategies that focus on exploratory activities will allocate a

<-----Page 8----->P. Mueller / Research Policy 35 (2006) 1499–1508

greater share of their R&D resources to grants supporting university research. Furthermore, firms specifically
prefer universities as research partners when they are
concerned about the appropriation of the results (see also
Schmidt, 2005). Laurensen and Salter (2004) found that
firms using university knowledge are in a small number of industrial sectors and that these firms already
have a more open-search strategy drawing from external knowledge sources. Additionally, universities are
of modest importance compared to other knowledge
resources such as suppliers and customers. Therefore,
research visibility of universities is important and should
be increased if possible. The German government and the
European Commission have already introduced various
instruments to foster research partnerships and cooperation between universities, research institutes, and private
businesses. Public support programs are usually conditional on being joint research projects between different
actors, for example, private businesses, universities, or
other research institutions.
Policy implications regarding entrepreneurship
would be to stimulate entrepreneurial awareness and to
develop entrepreneurial skills. It is not sufficient to have
policies based solely on the generation of knowledge
but rather policies need to be based on the exploration
and commercialization of new knowledge. Furthermore,
especially innovative start-ups may encounter financial
constraints. Thus, public policy may focus on creating
a healthy business environment for venture capitalists.
