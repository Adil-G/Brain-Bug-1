Much of the strategy and management advice
that business leaders turn to is unreliable or impractical. That’s because those who would guide
us underestimate the power of chance. Gurus draw
pointed lessons from companies whose outstanding results may be nothing more than random fluctuations. Executives speak proudly of corporate
achievements that may be only lucky coincidences.
Unfortunately, almost no one provides scientifically
credible answers to every business leader’s basic
questions about superior performance: Which companies are worth studying? What sets them apart?
How can we follow their examples?
Frustrated by the lack of rigorous research, we

enough period of time to qualify as truly exceptional.
Then we discovered something startling: The many
and diverse choices that made certain companies
great were consistent with just three seemingly elementary rules:
1. Better before cheaper—in other words, compete on differentiators other than price.
2. Revenue before cost—that is, prioritize increasing revenue over reducing costs.
3. There are no other rules—so change anything
you must to follow Rules 1 and 2.

they even general strategies. They’re foundational
concepts on which companies have built greatness over many years. How did these organizations’

leaders come to adopt them? We have no idea—nor
do we know whether the executives even followed
them consciously. Nevertheless, the rules can be
used to help today’s and tomorrow’s leaders increase
the chances that their companies, too, will deliver decades of exceptional performance.

Beyond Truisms

The impetus for our research was the increasing popularity over the past 30 years of “success study” business books and articles. Perhaps the most famous of
these are Thomas Peters and Robert Waterman’s In
Search of Excellence (1982) and Jim Collins’s Good to
Great (2001), but there are many others. The problem with them is they don’t give us any way to judge
whether the companies they hold up as examples
are indeed exceptional. Randomness can crown an
average company king for a year, two years, even a
decade, before performance reverts to the mean. If
we can’t be sure that the performance of companies
mentioned in success studies was caused by more
than just luck, we can’t know whether to imitate their
behaviors.
We tackled the randomness problem head-on.
Finding what we assumed would be weak signals
in noisy environments required a lot of data, so we
began with the largest database we could find—the
more than 25,000 companies that have traded on
U.S. exchanges at any time from 1966 to 2010. We
measured performance using return on assets (ROA),
a metric that reflects strong, stable performance—unlike, say, total shareholder return, which may reflect
the vagaries of the stock market and changes in investor expectations rather than fundamental company
performance. We defined two categories of superior
results: Miracle Workers fell in the top 10% of ROA for
all 25,000 companies often enough that their performance was highly unlikely to have been a fluke;
Long Runners fell in the top 20% to 40% and, again,
did so consistently enough that luck was highly unlikely to have been the reason. We call the companies
in both these categories exceptional performers. For
comparison purposes, we also identified companies
that were Average Joes. (See the sidebar “Finding the
Signal in the Noise.”)
A total of 174 companies qualified as Miracle
Workers, and 170 qualified as Long Runners. That’s
the entire population of companies that separated
themselves from the noise in this way. (It’s probably
worth mentioning that of the allegedly superior companies mentioned by 19 high-profile success studies

we examined, barely 12% met our criteria, even for
Long Runner status.)
Exceptional companies, it turns out, come in all
shapes and sizes. 3M, with its legendary innovation
and thousands of products in commercial and industrial markets, made the list, but so did WD-40—a
company built on a single, unpatented product that
was designed to prevent corrosion on nuclear missiles and has since become most famous as the bane
of squeaky hinges. The globally ubiquitous McDonald’s proved to be exceptional, but so did Luby’s, a
cafeteria chain, when it had only 43 locations (it has
since grown to almost 100). IBM qualified, and so did
Syntel, even though at the time it was only 0.5% of
Big Blue’s size.
To understand what was behind superior performance, we identified trios in each of nine industries;
each trio consisted of one company from each of
our performance categories, carefully matched for
years of overlap and relative size, with one from each
of our three performance categories. We searched
for behavioral differences that might explain the
specific performance differences we had discerned.
For instance, if a Miracle Worker’s ROA advantage
was driven primarily by superior gross margins, we
looked for behaviors that might account for that. If
asset utilization was salient, we looked for the behaviors that drove asset utilization. Where the data
permitted, we built financial models to estimate the
impact of these behavioral differences on performance. To illustrate: Heartland Express, the Miracle
Worker in our trucking-industry trio, relied entirely
on gross-margin advantage for its ROA edge, and
its gross margins seemed to be a function of higher
prices. By recalculating the company’s financials
without that premium, we satisfied ourselves that
Heartland’s pricing was a plausible explanation for
its higher gross margins and thus its better ROA.
Then things got messy. We repeatedly tried and
failed to isolate measurable behaviors that were consistently relevant. For example, at first it seemed that
an M&A-shunning strategy might be driving exceptional results in the trucking industry; yet during one
15-year period, top-performing Heartland was also
the most acquisitive. Nor could we conclude that a
propensity toward M&A was a consistently positive
factor in other industries, because in confectionery,
for example, Wrigley, the Miracle Worker, and Rocky
Mountain Chocolate Factory, the Average Joe, had
grown organically, whereas Tootsie Roll, the Long
Runner, largely bought its growth.

Idea in Brief
A statistical study of thousands
of companies identified several
hundred that have been good
enough long enough to qualify as
truly exceptional. It also revealed
that their strategic choices over
decades of success have been
consistent with three elementary
rules:

Better before cheaper (it’s best to compete on differentiators other than price).
Revenue before cost (prioritize increasing
revenue over reducing costs).
There are no other rules (change anything
you must to follow the first two).
With few exceptions, the best companies behave as though these principles
guide them through all their important
decisions, from acquisitions to diversification to resource allocation to pricing.

Was customer focus the key? Nope. Innovation?
Risk taking? Nope and nope. All these factors were
associated with great, good, or average performance
in pretty much equal measure. We found ourselves
reduced to a two-word sentence of surrender: “It
depends.”
Maybe, we thought, the lesson was that companies could be successful only if they did the right
deals, pursued the right innovations, or took the right
risks in the right sorts of ways. But those are truisms,
and thus as useless as the advice businesspeople so
typically get from what might be called the Do the
Right Thing School of Management: Get the right
people on the bus! (Did anyone ever want the wrong
people?) Have a clear strategy! (Does anyone ever set
out to create a confusing one?) Give customers what
they want! (Who deliberately gives them what they
don’t want?) All these are taken from well-read success studies.
So we pressed on.
A useful explanatory frame began to emerge
only after we shifted our emphasis away from what
these companies did to hypotheses about how they
thought. That allowed us to see past what the exceptional companies were doing, which was endlessly
variable, to how they apparently decided what to do,
which proved highly consistent. When considering
acquisitions, for example, Miracle Workers acted as
though they were following our rules, going for deals
that would enhance their nonprice positions and allow them to bring in disproportionately higher revenues. The same was true for all other behavioral factors, from diversifying to taking a narrow focus, from
globalizing to staying at home. The only factor that
seemed to matter was adherence to the rules.
And the rules are most assuredly not truisms. It
could have turned out that price-based competition
was systematically more profitable, or that cost leadership took precedence as a driver of superior performance—but it didn’t.

The rules can serve as an antidote to
leaders’ all-too-fallible intuition. When
income is declining, for example, it can be
tempting to make the company’s results
look better by slashing assets and investment to reduce costs. But great companies
typically accept higher costs as the price
of excellence, putting significant resources,
over long periods of time, into creating
nonprice value and generating higher
revenue.

Every company faces a choice: It can compete
mainly by offering superior nonprice benefits such
as a great brand, an exciting style, or excellent functionality, durability, or convenience; or it can meet
some minimal acceptable standard along these dimensions and try to attract customers with lower
prices. Miracle Workers overwhelmingly adopt the
former position. Average Joes typically compete on
price. Long Runners show no clear tendency one
way or the other. (See the exhibit “Following the
Rules [Mostly].”)
For example, in 1980, when trucking companies
had to differentiate themselves after deregulation,
a host of new growth opportunities opened up. Yet
Heartland, the Miracle Worker, chose to keep its
geographic footprint and number of customers relatively small in order to provide reliable and on-time
service, no matter how complex or unpredictable its
customers’ requirements. This nonprice differentiation earned Heartland the approximately 10% price
premium that was key to its consistently superior
profitability.

In contrast, Werner Enterprises, the Long Runner
in our trucking trio, expanded in both scale—serving
essentially the entire continental U.S.—and scope,
providing a wide range of services. This approach
imposed trade-offs. First, Werner’s vast reach and
diversity of markets prevented it from achieving
Heartland’s level of service differentiation and commanding a similar price premium. Second, its pursuit of economies of scale meant that the company
occasionally had to accept less-profitable business in
order to keep its vehicles rolling and thus maintain
an adequate level of asset utilization. Its first-rate execution enabled Werner to achieve exceptional performance—it is a Long Runner, after all—but it never
rose to Miracle Worker status.
P.A.M. Transportation Services (PAM), the Average Joe of the three, focused on a narrower range of
customers and services than Werner did, but sought
high volume through lower prices. Oddly enough,
as demand outstripped supply in the industry, PAM
found itself short of drivers and burdened with
idle assets. To restore profitability, the company
switched to contract trucking, choosing to target the
auto sector. When carmakers ran into tough times,
so did PAM. There was nothing inherently wrong
with PAM’s strategy of taking a narrow focus—after
all, Heartland was narrowly focused too. But PAM
took a low-price position. It didn’t follow the rules.
When exceptional companies abandon nonprice positions, their performance typically falters.
Maytag, for example, is one of our Miracle Workers,
but only in one distinct era. From 1966 through the
mid-1980s, its ROA was unfailingly in the top 10%—
thanks to industry-leading products; a unique brand
image built around “Ol’ Lonely,” the iconic Maytag
repairman; and a high-touch distribution channel
that relied on tens of thousands of independent
dealers.
But as big-box stores came to dominate the retail
landscape, Maytag responded by diversifying its
product line and price points, which compromised
its nonprice position and price premiums. Performance declined substantially, and the company was
bought by Whirlpool in 2006. Again, there’s nothing
necessarily wrong with diversifying a product range
in response to changes in an industry, but Maytag
lost its nonprice position—and pressed on in this direction despite the negative consequences of its new
strategy.
We don’t mean to suggest that a company can
afford to ignore its relative price position, any more

A useful explanatory frame began

than one that competes through low prices can afford to ignore product or service quality. We mean
only that in most cases, outstanding performance is
caused by greater value and not by lower price. Companies seeking sustained, exceptional profitability
should pursue strategies that are consistent with this
rule and avoid those that aren’t.
Bear in mind the before in “better before cheaper.”
When the competitive landscape changes, as it did
for Maytag, you can lower your prices and still adhere to the rule. What matters is not whether your
prices are lower than they used to be but that they
remain higher than your rivals’. Maytag could have
diversified into only those segments where it could
establish a superior nonprice position, even if the
segments demanded lower price points than those
the company had historically offered.
For all its virtues, a nonprice position isn’t without danger. Typically, a company that competes on
dimensions other than price must constantly battle
rivals that have figured out its formula. At the very
least, me-too competitors may confuse customers
and blur an incumbent’s hard-won differentiation.
At worst, they may find even better formulas for success. (See the sidebar “The Perils and Promise of a
Nonprice Position.”)
Don’t forget to keep an eye out for disruptive
threats. Charging higher prices in pursuit of higher
gross margins is what creates opportunities in lessdemanding market segments and provides oxygen
for would-be disruptors with cheaper, good-enough
products. But disruption is now well enough understood that it’s possible to determine pretty accurately when alternative solutions have disruptive potential and warrant rearguard counterattacks. And a
word to would-be disruptors: The most effective and
profitable among you follow the rules when launching disruptive attacks.

<-----Page 7----->Three Rules for Making a Company Truly Great

Companies must not only create value but also
capture it in the form of profits. By an overwhelming margin, exceptional companies garner superior
profits by achieving higher revenue than their rivals, through either higher prices or greater volume.
Very rarely is cost leadership a driver of superior
profitability.
There’s nothing startling about the notion that
higher prices can lead to higher profits, but we were
impressed by the range of contexts in which companies have built businesses on this idea. Take, for
example, the U.S. discounter Family Dollar Stores,
a Miracle Worker, which has bested the legends in
discount retailing since the mid-1970s. Considering
that many of the company’s customers are poor, it’s
perhaps surprising that Family Dollar’s success has
resulted from higher prices, which it can charge because it offers superior convenience and selection.
Its smaller stores are in locations that are easier for
customers to get to, and many shoppers buy small
amounts of a wide variety of goods. Running these
stores is unavoidably costly—in fact, the company
tolerates higher costs and lower efficiency than
would many of its larger competitors. But its consistently higher prices have enabled Family Dollar to
enjoy a gross-margin advantage and, consequently,
superior ROA for decades.
For eight of the nine Miracle Workers in our sample, revenue was the main driver of performance.
(The ninth is the Pennsylvania-based grocery chain
Weis Markets, which competes on price and drives
profitability through lower costs; more on this company below.) Six of these eight relied mainly on
higher prices to achieve their revenue levels; the
other two relied largely or entirely on volume.

One of the two volume-focused companies is
Merck, which globalized earlier, more successfully,
and more aggressively than the Long Runner in the
pharmaceutical trio, Eli Lilly. Merck followed the
better-before-cheaper rule, refusing to compete
on price relative to the alternatives in global markets. But the lower price ceilings in those markets
prevented the company from using gross margins
as its primary source of advantage. Instead Merck
drove volume by relying on the clinical effectiveness of its patent-protected medications. Higher
volume allowed Merck to achieve superior profitability through better asset utilization than Eli Lilly
enjoyed, which was the main reason for the company’s higher ROA. (See the sidebar “Many Paths to
Improvement.”) Just as you can lower prices while
adhering to better before cheaper, you can drive
out inefficiencies and lower your costs while following the revenue-before-cost rule. But don’t try
to achieve a profitability advantage through cost
leadership.

This rule underscores the uncomfortable (or liberating) truth that in the pursuit of exceptional profitability, everything but the first two rules should
be on the table. When considering all the other determinants of company performance—operational
excellence, talent development, leadership style,
corporate culture, reward systems, you name it—we
saw wide variation among companies of all performance types. There’s no doubt that these and other
factors matter to corporate performance—how could

The Perils and Promise of a Nonprice Position
Our retail grocery trio was intriguing—first
because the Miracle Worker of the bunch,
Weis, was a price-based competitor that
captured profits through low costs, but
also because Whole Foods, a high-profile
purveyor of organic products, clearly
practices better before cheaper and
revenue before cost, yet turns out to be
an Average Joe. During its more than 20
years as a public company, its ROA has
sometimes been worse than the majority
of companies’.
Whole Foods may very well be en route
to becoming a Long Runner or a Miracle

Worker, but it might just as easily get
submerged in a wave of competition. Its
high costs—sourcing specialty items is
expensive, and the company provides
high levels of customer service (“Excuse
me, how do I cook quinoa?”)—have kept
competitors at bay, but with supply-chain
costs falling, mainstream grocers are
already starting to mimic its competitive
position (you can get quinoa just about
everywhere these days).
This example highlights an important
limitation of our work: Following our rules
doesn’t guarantee Miracle Worker status.

they not?—but we couldn’t find consistent patterns
of how they mattered.
More telling still, we found individual companies
that had remained exceptional despite changing
their approaches to a number of critical determinants of performance. The reason? The changes they
made kept them aligned with the first two rules. In
other words, top-performing companies are doggedly persistent in seeking a position unrelated to
low prices and adopting a revenue-driven profitability formula, while everything else is up for grabs.
The absence of other rules doesn’t give you permission to shut down your thinking. You are still
responsible for searching actively—and flexibly—for
ways to follow the rules in the face of what may be
wrenching competitive change. It takes enormous
creativity to remain true to the first two rules.
For example, Abercrombie & Fitch has stayed on
top of a constantly changing retail clothing market
by being willing to invent new images for itself and
new product lines—the abercrombie kids brand
is aimed at grade-schoolers, while Hollister is for
14-to-18-year-olds, and Gilly Hicks is for young
women—without wavering in its dedication to a position based on brand-intensive value and a higherprice-driven profitability formula. A&F has avoided
promotions and steep markdowns, and has typically
sold its clothing at about 70% of full price, which is
higher than the comparable figure at many apparel
retailers. When the recession hit, in 2008, A&F resisted following other clothing companies down the
discount path—a choice that earned it much criticism from analysts as its same-store sales dropped
more than its competitors’ did. But the company’s
persistence has preserved its brand cachet, and with
the recent economic recovery, A&F is returning to
a level of profitability that its competitors find hard

to match, having revealed to their customers that
T-shirts don’t have to cost $30 after all.
In pharmaceuticals the top companies have successfully moved from in-house to joint-venture to
open innovation, while in semiconductors we’ve
seen increased capital investment and an expanding
portfolio of customers, all in support of better before
cheaper. In confectionery the top performers have
shifted from domestic to global distribution, and in
medical devices M&A has become a cornerstone of
growth. When these changes have led to superior
profitability, it has been because they contributed to
greater volume more than to lower costs.
We should point out that there’s no necessary relationship between how you create value and how
you capture it. Although it would be nonsensical
for companies that compete through lower prices
to capture value through higher prices, every other
combination of position and profitability formula is
at least theoretically possible. Nonprice positions,
as we’ve said, are typically associated with higher
prices or greater volume. Conceptually, companies
that don’t focus on price could still drive profitability
through lower costs, but we never saw this. Arithmetically, a low-price position (cheaper before better) could drive sufficient volume to keep asset utilization high enough to secure superior profitability
(revenue before cost), but we never saw this, either.
Our research shows that companies with lowerprice positions tend to rely on lower costs to achieve
profitability.
The success of the grocery chain Weis shows how
a lower-price position and a lower-cost profitability
formula can work. This Miracle Worker was decades
ahead of its competitors in introducing house-label
products, which are sold at lower prices but are
much less costly to produce and thus yield higher

<-----Page 9----->Three Rules for Making a Company Truly Great

Many Paths to Improvement
Don’t be misled by the simplicity of the rules.
Long-term success in any industry is a rare
and difficult achievement, and finding a
workable strategy that stays within the rules requires
enormous creativity and flexibility.
Take Merck and Eli Lilly: They have long histories and are well
known as leading research-based drug companies, but Merck was
able to become a Miracle Worker, while Eli Lilly remained a Long
Runner. Why?
Past executives have told us that the primary driver of Merck’s
superior performance was its research excellence, which yielded
higher-value therapies. It’s true that Merck was early among
pharmaceutical companies to shift the focus of its research from
chemistry-based screening—isolating new compounds and testing them in vivo to assess the effects—to biology-based “rational
discovery.” But Eli Lilly had great research too. And in any case,
higher prices weren’t the main reason for Merck’s higher profitability: Barely a third of its ROA advantage can be attributed to superior
gross margins.
We found that Merck’s profitability rested on better asset utilization, which was a function of revenue growth through higher unit
volumes. For example, Merck’s command of the mechanisms of action for various compounds allowed scientists to develop variations
on established drugs in order to attenuate side effects or mitigate
interactions with other drugs, making a compound’s basic therapeutic effects available to a larger population of patients. As a result,
Merck was introducing three times as many products across twice
as many therapeutic areas, yet enjoying economies of scope in both
discovery and manufacture that stemmed from similarities among
core compounds.
The company was also a leader in international expansion, which
further increased unit volumes and asset utilization. Both its global
expansion and its greater product diversification were driven by
demand, born of the value of Merck’s unique medicines. By 2010 its
pharmaceutical business was more than twice the size of Eli Lilly’s—
up from about 8% larger in 1985.
Merck’s story shows that there are various routes to better before
cheaper and revenue before cost, and they should all be under
consideration all the time.

margins. Its resulting 28 consecutive years in the top
10% of ROA make Weis a clear exception to our Rules
1 and 2.
But when you compete on price, a faster gun always seems to come to town eventually. Weis’s advantage began to slip in the 1980s, as other grocers
adopted private-label programs and discount retailers expanded into the grocery segment. Weis proved
unable to adapt, and since 1996 it has not been in
the top 10% even once. Unlike our Long Runner,
Publix, which has enjoyed increasing profitability,
Weis didn’t shift aggressively enough to differentiation through in-store delis, pharmacies, organic
products, or ethnic-food-focused store formats. The
bottom line is that if you want to beat the odds, you
should concentrate on creating value using better
before cheaper and on capturing value with revenue
before cost.

Choosing to Be Exceptional

The first step in making use of the rules is to get a
clear picture of your company’s competitive position
and profitability formula. Our experience shows that
many senior leaders lack that clarity, primarily because companies tend to put too much emphasis on
comparing their present selves with their past selves
and too often declare victory if they’ve improved.
What they forget is that you compete only with your
current rivals. Benchmarking may help, but in many
instances it devolves into a comparison of single dimensions—Is our product more durable? Is our R&D
higher?—rather than a sophisticated analysis of the
interplay of all performance dimensions and their relationship to the sometimes subtle trade-offs among
the many drivers of profitability.
Here’s how to put the rules into operation: The
next time you find yourself having to allocate scarce
resources among competing priorities, think about
which initiatives will contribute most to enhancing
the nonprice elements of your position and which
will allow you to charge higher prices or to sell in
greater volume. Then give those the nod.
If your operational-effectiveness program is
mostly about cutting costs, whereas your innovation efforts are mostly about separating you from
the pack, go with innovation. But if pushing the
envelope on operations is about delivering levels
of customer service way above your competition’s,
whereas innovation seems geared to doing the same
for less, then your operations folks deserve the additional care and feeding.

Finding the Signal in the Noise
In our quest to identify top-performing
companies and
figure out why they were among
the best, we spent almost two
years developing and working
through appropriate statistical methods and another three
years identifying the behaviors
common to the best.
We started by digging
through Compustat’s database
of more than 25,000 companies publicly traded in U.S.
markets from 1966 to 2010.
With the help of Andrew D.
Henderson, of the University of
Texas at Austin, we used quantile regression—which allowed
us to strip out extraneous

factors such as survivor bias,
company size, and financial
leverage—to rank companies
according to their relative
performance on return on
assets (income divided by the
book value of assets), a metric
that reliably reflects managerial efforts rather than simply
changes in investor expectations, which are the primary
driver of shareholder returns.
Then we used advanced
simulation techniques to
determine which companies
had achieved high performance
long enough that the chance
their results were due to luck
was less than 10%. The qualifying length of time depended on

Are executives in your company justifying an acquisition in terms of economies of scale? Or are they
talking about an opportunity to expand and thereby
realize the growth potential of a nonprice position
that your company has already earned in the markets it currently serves? If the former, the acquisition
may well be a good idea—perhaps even essential to
keeping the company in the game—but you’re not
likely to see exceptional performance unless the latter applies as well.
An understanding of the rules can be a useful
antidote to intuition, whether that takes the form
of a single leader’s vision or the collective hunch of
a top management team (which often comes with a
veneer of post hoc rationalization). When circumstances are muddy and the data ambiguous, as they
so often are, you need rules to help ensure that your
interpretation of the data is more likely to lead to the
outcomes you seek.
The rules are especially powerful when it comes
to dealing with those dreaded financial ratios that
govern so many lives and lead so often to pathological consequences. In ratios such as ROA, cash flow
return on investment, and economic value added,
the numerator is some measure of income and
the denominator is some measure of assets. When
customers are no longer willing to pay for your latest innovation and income starts to decline, it’s too
easy to try to make those ratios go up by shrinking
the denominator. Many managers have long felt
that this is a mistake, but they do it anyway, mis-

life span: For example, to be
a Miracle Worker, a company
with 10 years of data had to
have been in the top 10% for
all of them, but a firm with
45 years of data needed just
16 years in the top 10%.
To figure out what made
these companies special, we
selected a Miracle Worker, a
Long Runner, and an Average
Joe in each of nine industries
and then made pairwise comparisons among the three. In
each comparison, we figured
out how much of the ROA
difference arose from each of
the components of ROA—return on sales (ROS) and total
asset turnover (TAT), aka asset

utilization. Then we figured out
how much of the ROS difference was due to differences in
gross margins and a number
of expense categories, which
included R&D, SG&A (selling,
general, and administrative),
and several others (depreciation, extraordinary items, and
so on). Similarly, we figured out
how much of the TAT difference
was due to current asset turnover and fixed asset turnover.
We sought behaviors that could
plausibly explain exceptional
companies’ performance
advantages, and where possible, we assessed the impact
of those behaviors by creating
financial models.

The rules are especially powerful
when it comes to dealing with
those dreaded financial ratios
that govern so many lives and
lead so often to pathological
consequences.
led by the equally compelling intuition that cutting
costs has faster, more dramatic, more predictable
consequences.
When you feel pressure to follow that path, use
our research to make the case that by and large, companies don’t become truly great by reducing costs or
assets; they earn their way to greatness. Exceptional
companies often, even typically, accept higher costs
as the price of excellence. In fact, many of them have
developed quite a taste for spending and investment.
These organizations put significant resources, over
long periods of time, into creating nonprice value
and generating higher revenue. Point out that when
successful companies are led astray by the seeming
certainties of short-run cost cutting or disinvestment,
they are more likely to destroy what they most want
to enhance.  
