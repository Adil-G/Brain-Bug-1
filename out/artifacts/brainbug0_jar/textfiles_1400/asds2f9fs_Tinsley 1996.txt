supervisor. If we put this relationship in its actual social context, the
repercussions to the supervisor are only one consequence, and consequences for the organization cannot be left out, even to understand trust
of a manager and his or her risk behavior.
Mayer and colleagues (1995: 727) argued that trust should be analyzed
from a longitudinal perspective, and "a more complete understanding of
trust would come from consideration of its evolution within relationships."
From a cooperative perspective, these relationships would have to be
placed in their social context of processes and structures that are outside
the trustor-trustee dyad. In all examples of longitudinal research on trust
provided by these authors (Mayer et al., 1995), the social context is not
really considered. Research that includes the game paradigm is a perfect
example of purposeful elimination of any social context. It is assumed
that the only important process is what is happening between two or more
players. Other processes and social structures are not present in such
experimental designs.
In sum, the new model of trust remains in the old tradition of desocialized (Wexler, 1983) social phenomena. I have doubts if the research based
on this model can contribute to our understanding of trust as a social
phemomenon that is interwoven in organizational processes.

Trust Plus Capabilities
Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman (1995) considered integrity, benevolence, and ability as the basic factors that underlie trust. However, integrity
and benevolence both have ethical connotations, which ability does not
possess. Integrity and benevolence should be separated from ability and
combined with other ethical factors into an ethically based concept of
trust. Viewing trust in ethical terms is congruent with other concepts of
trust that were developed by Hosmer (1995) and Jones (1995).

Once separated from the concept of trust, ability can be integrated into
a concept of capabilities. This facilitates analyses of personal competence
factors, including innate ability and developed capabilities, such as expertise and judgment. The importance of developing capabilities is well recognized (e.g., "learning" organizations).
Separating capabilities from trust is also useful in dealing with organizational stakeholders. Certain people with high capabilities are not to
be trusted. Conversely, some trustworthy people have low capabilities
and are ineffective. Evaluating a person's capabilities can be difficult, but
even more difficult is evaluating trustworthiness. Development of capabilities is more understood, used, and accepted than is ethical development.
This further justifies modifying the concept of trust in Mayer and colleagues' article to reflect an ethical nature. Separation of trustworthiness
(ethics) and capabilities (personal competence) is useful for research, theory, and application.
As the natures of trustworthiness and capabilities become realistically defined, they can be integrated together. Such an integration will
link organizational trust and capabilities to source credibility. A number of
factors influence source credibility, especially as context varies. Research
reveals, however, that trustworthiness and expertise emerge consistently
(Perloff, 1993: 139). For business analyses, expertise can be included in
the capabilities concept, allowing trustworthiness and capabilities to be
seen as the basic factors in source credibility.
Hosmer's trust linkage between philosophical ethics and organizational theory can be enhanced by using credibility as a concept that
integrates capabilities with trust. For example, philosophical ethics might
be linked to specific aspects of communication theory and technique. In
Jones's (1995) article, credibility would help to explicitly include capabilities. Jones approached effectiveness as a function of ethical behavior
that reduces costs. Cost reductions, however, cannot offer success if the
organization's members lack reasonable levels of personal capability. An
obvious question arises, "What minimum level of capabilities must be
present in order for cost reduction to offer competitive advantage?"
Considering trust in terms of source credibility for communication
would also improve the concepts of trust that were developed in all three
of the articles. In all three, trust is seen as a reliance upon ethical behavior
by others. These definitions, however, do not explicitly mention reliance
on source messages in the receiver's own activities. Specifying credibility
as the relevant concept means that all messages will include correct and
complete information on which the receiver may act with confidence. This
is explicitly more proactive. Managers, employees, and other stakeholders
can judge messages by asking, "Is the sender both competent and trustworthy?" In other words, "Is there enough credibility for me to rely on this
message and act upon it?"
Other insights are promised from extending the theories of trust and
capabilities to include credibility's value in persuasion. Learning involves

change that leads to more effective behavior. Such change may require
persuasive communication (i.e., achieving organizational synergy requires more than dispassionate transmission of information). Stakeholders' communication often involves persuasion that stimulates understanding, creativity, and insight.
These articles also need a stronger analysis of the problems of extending trust to organizations and groups rather than only to specific people.
Trust implies confidence that some member (or several members) of a
group or an organization will take initiatives to fulfill expectations. Trust
in an organization or a group is trust that specific people will perform. The
chances of fulfilling expectations will vary, depending on which specific
individuals in the organization or group are charged with performance.
If the responsible individuals are changed, then trust levels may need to
be changed.

Organizational Trust: Philosophical
Conceptual Definitions

Perspectives

and

In this dialogue, we address two dialogue comments about our recent
article on trust in organizations. The first comment by Wekselberg deals
with our choice of philosophical perspective and the resulting implications
for accurately representing the social context of trust. In the second,
Tinsley raises questions about conceptual definitions in a model of trust,
the relationships among variables, and the utility of alternate definitions.
Given the lack of overlap in these dialogues, we will address each in turn.
Social Influence, Social Interaction, and Social Psychology in the Study
of Trust
Wekselberg's dialogue raises questions about our model of organizational trust at both a philosophical level and a practical level. At a philosophical level, Wekselberg correctly observes that we use a social influence perspective and argues that we should have adopted a social
