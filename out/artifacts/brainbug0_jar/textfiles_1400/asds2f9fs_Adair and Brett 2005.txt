e propose a normative model of transactional negotiation in which cooperative and competitive behaviors wax and
wane across four stages: relational positioning, identifying the problem, generating solutions, and reaching agreement.
Based on a classic proposition of communicative ﬂexibility in high-context cultures, we propose culture-speciﬁc dyadic
movements within and across these stages. Our sample included 102 high-context dyads from Russia, Japan, Hong Kong,
and Thailand; 89 low-context dyads from Germany, Israel, Sweden, and the United States; and 45 United States–Hong
Kong and United States–Japan mixed-context dyads. Dyads negotiated a complex, 90-minute transaction with integrative
potential. We audiotaped, transcribed, and coded their negotiations for sequences of information and inﬂuence behaviors.
The unit of analysis was the action-response sequence. Results conﬁrmed that the pattern of sequences varied across the
four stages and the frequency of particular sequences varied with culture. We suggest that negotiators can use this model
to manage the evolution and strategic focus of their negotiation, especially during the ﬁrst two stages, when the use of
inﬂuence-information sequences and reciprocal-information sequences generate the groundwork for joint gains.
Key words: negotiation; culture; time; behavioral sequences

of its task: They hear the same music and understand the
general progression and adjustments their movements
must make as the music changes. However, because each
dancer is accustomed to distinct steps, the pairs may
have difﬁculty synchronizing their movements. Although
with adjustments they may be able to complete the
dance, it is likely to lack the polish of the same culture
dancing.
We predict that like dancers from different cultures,
negotiators from different cultures will share a holistic
view of the negotiation process that will lead them
through similar cooperative and competitive stages. Like
dancers from different cultures, we also expect negotiators from different cultures to enact different behavioral
sequences at the bargaining table, leading to difﬁculty
in synchronization and inefﬁcient deals. Our research
tests these ideas in four ways. First, we develop a fourstage model of negotiation that captures the progression of competitive and cooperative elements over time
in mixed-motive negotiation. Second, we consider that
the particular behaviors that negotiators enact in each of
the stages are shaped, in part, by negotiators’ cultural
backgrounds. Third, we predict the particular stages and
behavioral sequences that should generate efﬁcient deals.
Finally, we test the universalizability of our hypotheses
with a culturally diverse sample of negotiating dyads representing high-context and low-context cultures, which
have very different styles of communication.

Unfolding before my very eyes was a perpetual ballet.
Each culture, of course, was choreographed in its own
way with its own beat, tempo, and rhythm. Beyond this
there were individual performances, pairs dancing out
their own dramas    (Hall 1983, p. 155).

Hall was standing in a Mexican marketplace, watching
people from three different cultural backgrounds interacting with one another. Although he does not refer explicitly to bargaining, it seems likely that the “perpetual ballet”
that he observed involved bargaining. And although all
pairs were haggling over goods in the marketplace, the
particulars of their negotiations—or, in Hall’s words,
the choreography of the dance—varied depending on
the cultural backgrounds of the actors. We take up where
Hall left off by explicitly using the metaphor of dance
to illustrate how negotiation is a universal (etic) phenomenon, yet the rhythms and movements involved are
speciﬁc to the culture of the bargainers (emic).
Consider two pairs of skilled ballroom dancers, one
American, the other Cuban. Both pairs enact beautifully
synchronized patterns of steps that move their dance
through stages until it reaches a dramatic climax; yet
the two dances are likely to look very different. Latin
ballroom dance is built on rapid, staircase movements,
whereas American ballroom dance, like the waltz and
foxtrot, is based on smooth gliding movements (Allen
1998). Now imagine the pairs switching partners to form
intercultural pairs. Each pair has a similar holistic view

Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation

With the remarkable growth in cross-border ventures
and the effects of increased global trade, researchers
are building a systematic knowledge base devoted to
understanding cultural differences and their effects on
organizations and management (e.g., Tsui et al. 2004).
What has received far less attention in the literature
are the microprocesses, like negotiations, that give rise
to these ventures. To date, much of the research on
cross-border negotiations has focused on identifying the
differences in behaviors that stem from negotiators’ cultural backgrounds. In this paper we move beyond that
emphasis to present a general model of the progression
of negotiators’ behaviors over time, which we examine
by studying the transcripts of negotiating dyads from
four high-context cultures (Hong Kong, Japan, Russia,
and Thailand), four low-context cultures (the United
States, Germany, Israel, and Sweden), and two mixed
cultures (United States–Hong Kong and United States–
Japan). These data provide unprecedented scope for
testing hypotheses about culture, time, and negotiator
behavior. Moreover, because such a design inevitably
generates within-group variance, it provides a very conservative test of our hypotheses.
On the practical side, our ﬁndings will help managers
understand how to prepare for and execute successful
global business transactions. An understanding of the
etic negotiation dance coupled with an understanding of
the emic behavioral sequences of the dance in different types of cultures will allow cross-cultural negotiators
to advance a negotiation strategically from one stage to
another and ultimately to an optimal conclusion.

Time, Behavioral Sequences, and a
Four-Stage Negotiation Model

Transactional negotiation is mixed-motive: On the cooperative or integrative side, parties are interdependent and
must work together to discover a mutually acceptable
solution; on the competitive or distributive side, parties
represent distinct entities and want to get a good deal
for themselves (Walton and McKersie 1965). Several
lines of negotiation research attempt to understand the
complex and dynamic interplay between cooperation and
competition at the negotiation table. We propose that
two of these research streams, negotiation evolution and
negotiation process, offer evidence suggesting that transactional negotiations typically pass through four key
stages: relational positioning, identifying the problem,
generating solutions, and reaching agreement. Below, we
review and integrate prior work in these areas to propose
and support a four-stage negotiation model.
Early theorists hypothesized that most negotiations
begin with a focus on power, with one negotiator trying
to sway the other party (Stevens 1963). Empirical studies, however, showed that successful negotiators eventually move away from power and focus their efforts

Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

on coordination and cooperation (Pruitt 1971, 1981).
In a simple two-stage model, the ﬁrst half of negotiation seemed to be more competitive, characterized
by high demands and posturing, and the second half
was more cooperative, characterized by lower demands
and quicker concessions. In recent years, more complex, multi-issue negotiation situations and more precise
behavioral measurement tools have prompted researchers
to expand upon the two-stage competition-cooperation
model. Advocates of a three-stage model describe periods of spirited conﬂict, tactical maneuvers, and reducing
alternatives to ﬁnal agreement (Putnam and Jones 1982b,
Morley and Stephenson 1977). Empirical investigations
of these models indicate a gradual progression from a
more competitive to a more cooperative focus.
However, widely accepted theory that negotiation is
mixed-motive (Walton and McKersie 1965, Lax and
Sebenius 1986) suggests that negotiators do not just
become more cooperative over time. Even after getting
information on the table, negotiators engaged in problem
solving will continue to use competitive inﬂuence tactics
as they try to claim value for themselves (Lytle et al.
1999). Recent empirical work suggests that negotiators
do in fact move back and forth from a more competitive
to a more cooperative focus throughout the negotiation
(Olekalns et al. 1996, 2004), which argues in favor of
further expanding the three-stage model.
We propose a four-stage model that portrays a more
nuanced account of transactional negotiations than these
previous models. It allows a more ﬁnely grained analysis
of the evolution of negotiations as well as the identiﬁcation of cultural differences in negotiators’ behaviors at
different time periods.
The model we propose is a sequential-stage model,
a prototype representing the evolutionary progression
of complex, integrative transactional negotiations. In a
sequential-stage model, change occurs when actors move
between stages and is evident in behavioral frequency
changes (Arrow et al. 2004). To study the content of
stages and the transition between stages, researchers
have used both event-driven and interval-driven aggregation strategies to determine breakpoints between stages
(Zaheer et al. 1999). Because each approach has beneﬁts
and liabilities, the research question is the best guide to
choosing the most appropriate approach.
Researchers using an event-driven approach identify
clusters of similar behaviors within a dyad and mark
a transition when one cluster ends and another begins
(Holmes 1992, Putnam and Jones 1982b) or look at
group decision paths and subsequent group processes
(Poole and Roth 1989a, b; Olekalns et al. 2004). The
strength of the event-driven approach is that it captures both similarities and differences between groups.
The three-stage negotiation model of problem initiation,
problem solving, and problem resolution was developed
using an event-driven approach. One limitation of the

<-----Page 2----->Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation
Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

event-driven approach is the inability to test general
models. The event approach divides the negotiation into
many phases based on content, and phases can repeat
themselves. Thus, each negotiation has its own unique
progression of phases. The only way a general model
can be built is if content phases evolve similarly across
many different negotiations. Yet the very nature of the
event-driven approach, which inextricably links phase
and content, makes it difﬁcult to identify general phases
across negotiations or to test for differences in betweengroup processes.
In contrast, researchers using the interval approach
rely on theory to identify the number of stages and transition points a priori and then test whether the content
of these intervals ﬁts their theory. This approach typically uses time or number of speaking turns as the unit
to divide into equal stages. The interval approach, therefore, separates stage and content, such that any stage
may be deﬁned by any content. The approach takes
into account negotiations of different length; ﬁrst quarters of interactions are ﬁrst quarters regardless of the
how long the interactions take. The interval approach
is also powerful in testing between-group differences
because it allows comparison within and across comparable stages. Since our research question asks whether
we can characterize negotiations with a four-stage model
and then identify culture-speciﬁc patterns within those
stages, the interval-driven approach is most appropriate
for this study.
We propose that negotiators have normative models
of the negotiation process that both inﬂuence how they
begin a negotiation and serve as a benchmark for monitoring their progress. Speciﬁcally, we expect that negotiators will have a more competitive focus both in the
initial stage, when they deﬁne relationships and power,
and again in the third stage, when they make taskoriented arguments to support their offers and claim
value. Negotiators will have a more cooperative focus
both when they are bringing information about preferences, needs, and priorities to light and when they
are in the process of exchanging offers to close a deal.
Thus, we propose a four-stage model of complex transactional negotiations in which behaviors representing
relational positioning, identifying the problem, generating solutions, and reaching agreement will peak in this
sequential order. In the next sections, we build on prior
empirical ﬁndings of negotiation processes over time to
argue that these stages are deﬁned by distinct behavioral
sequences, and follow an evolutionary norm.
Prior research has identiﬁed three types of behavioral
sequences that capture whether negotiators are moving
in sync: reciprocal sequences, complementary sequences,
and structural sequences (Donohue 1981, Olekalns and
Smith 2000, Putnam and Jones 1982a, Weingart et al.
1990). As the name suggests, reciprocal sequences
occur when a negotiator responds to a cooperative

35

or competitive behavior with a very similar behavior.
For example, one negotiator asks for sympathy (a
competitive-inﬂuence behavior) and the other responds
with his or her own plea for sympathy. Reciprocity of
competitive behavior indicates a more distributive focus,
and reciprocity of cooperative behavior indicates a more
integrative focus (Weingart et al. 1999, Putnam 1990).
Sequences are deﬁned as complementary when a negotiator responds to a cooperative or competitive behavior with a different but functionally similar behavior.
For example, one negotiator provides some information about a priority (a cooperative-information behavior) and the other responds by using that information
in a proposal (also an information behavior). Complementary sequences indicate similar strategic focus,
particularly in international negotiations when parties
enact similar intentions with different normative kinds
of behavior (Adair et al. 2001). Structural sequences
occur when negotiators use behaviors from different
strategic groups. For example, one negotiator makes a
threat (a competitive-inﬂuence behavior) and the other
responds with an offer (a cooperative-information behavior). Structural sequences often indicate one negotiator’s attempt to refocus the other. For example, it is not
unusual for negotiators to use an interest-based cooperative response to a power-based competitive behavior to redirect a distributive-minded negotiator (Brett
et al. 1998, Putnam and Jones 1982a). We use reciprocal,
structural, and complementary sequences to deﬁne four
distinct stages that we propose characterize the evolution
of transactional negotiations.
First Stage: Relational Positioning
Empirical studies document the presence of both competitive posturing (Simons 1993, Lytle et al. 1999) and
relationship building (McGinn and Keros 2002, Moore
et al. 1999) in the ﬁrst quarter of a negotiation interaction. At the outset, most negotiators know what they
want and assume the other party wants the opposite (the
ﬁxed-pie bias) (Thompson and Hastie 1990). Therefore,
it is not surprising that negotiators begin negotiations by
testing whether the other party is going to be competitive or cooperative before they begin revealing information about positions and interests that should move them
toward agreement but could make them vulnerable if the
other is competitive. There are two general approaches
to determining relationship in negotiations: Parties can
disclose a little sensitive information about their preferences and priorities to signal cooperation and the willingness to develop trust. Alternatively, parties can exert
inﬂuence and establish position to signal a competitive
negotiation.
All of the two- and three-stage negotiation models
cited above (Morley and Stephenson 1977, Pruitt 1981,
Putnam and Jones 1982b) concur that most negotiations
begin with competitive, spirited posturing that should

<-----Page 3----->36

Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation

be characterized more by inﬂuence than by information exchange. Efforts to establish a powerful negotiation
position should be evident in persuasion and inﬂuence
communications. Because negotiators do not yet have an
understanding of the other side’s positions, needs, and
interests, it would be difﬁcult at this stage to make persuasive arguments that draw on rational argument about
the issues. Thus, at this early stage, negotiators should
focus on inﬂuence with respect to status and power.
Affective persuasion is an inﬂuence appeal based on status, relationships, and normative or other contextual factors (Adair and Brett 2004, Glenn et al. 1977). This kind
of inﬂuence is particularly characteristic of posturing at
the start of transactional negotiations when negotiators
lack detailed information that can be used in rational
argument.
Reciprocal sequences of affective persuasion are
indicative of posturing and positioning when negotiators are trying to establish power. Even if most negotiations begin this way, if negotiations are to progress, the
emphasis on power and position must wane over time.
To continue to engage in reciprocal persuasion risks taking the negotiation into a no-win conﬂict spiral (Brett
et al. 1998). As the futility of reciprocating affective persuasion inevitably becomes clearer, negotiators should
abandon reciprocity and turn to structural sequences
linking persuasion to search for information about each
other’s preferences and priorities. We expect this transition to structural sequences to begin in the ﬁrst stage of
the negotiation. A structural sequence that sends a strong
signal—“I am not willing to cooperate. This is a competitive game for me.”—would be when one party discloses
a little sensitive information about his or her preferences among the issues and the other party responds with
a persuasive argument. A structural sequence signaling
cooperation would be when one party refers to status
and the other responds by divulging private information.
The message that is conveyed is, “I am willing to risk
sharing information to initiate some cooperation here.”
We expect these structural sequences of affective persuasion and priority information to occur most frequently
in the ﬁrst stage of negotiation, when negotiators try to
transition from a determination of the cooperative versus
competitive nature of their negotiation relationship and
who is more powerful to a focus on the substance of
their negotiation.
Hypothesis 1. Reciprocal sequences of affective persuasion will be more common in the ﬁrst stage of a
negotiation than in the other three stages.
Hypothesis 2. Structural sequences of affective persuasion and priority information will be more common
in the ﬁrst stage of a negotiation than in the other three
stages.

Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

Second Stage: Identifying the Problem
As noted above, the ﬁrst negotiation stage is characterized primarily by relational posturing. Yet, when
negotiators inevitably sense that they are not making
progress, they should shift gears and turn their attention
to the issues at hand. Thus, the second stage is marked
by a detailed discussion of the issues. Exchanging information about issues and interests is an integral part of
integrative negotiation. In fact, prior research has found
an early focus on information exchange (Donohue 1989)
and interests in disputing dyads (Lytle et al. 1999) is
an essential precursor to agreement. Frustration with the
posturing and lack of progress that is characteristic of
the ﬁrst stage should move negotiators into the second
stage.
We expect the second stage of negotiation, identifying the problem, to be characterized by reciprocal
exchange of priority information as negotiators focus on
the negotiation issues, options, and underlying interests;
build trust; and begin a serious search for an agreement.
Reciprocal sequences of priority information should
decrease after the second stage, because once information about interests and priorities is available, negotiators can turn to structuring a deal and claiming value
(Olekalns and Smith 2000).
Hypothesis 3. Reciprocal sequences of priority
information will be more common in the second stage
than the other three stages of the negotiation.
Third Stage: Generating Solutions
Again, we expect the evolution of the negotiation itself
to trigger a transition to the third stage. By now negotiators should have some understanding of the other side’s
preferences and priorities and a good sense of whether
agreement is possible. At this point we expect negotiators to begin to make offers. However, we do not
expect that negotiations will remain purely cooperative
until agreement is reached, as suggested by the two- and
three-stage negotiation models. If they did, the majority
of negotiations would result with something close to
the pareto-optimal solution, which we know is not typically the case (Thompson 1990, 1991). Negotiators are
concerned with both value creation and value claiming
(Lax and Sebenius 1986). And they must balance the
interplay between cooperative and competitive tactics
throughout the negotiation (Olekalns et al. 1996). Therefore, we expect that after priorities and interests have
been revealed in Stage 2, negotiators will turn again to
more competitive-inﬂuence strategies, positioning themselves to claim more of the ultimate agreement (Olekalns
and Smith 2000, Wilson and Putnam 1990).
We propose that the third stage of negotiation will be
a distinct, energetic, even passionate stage, with parties
shifting between a focus on integrating information and
inﬂuencing the outcome. Our characterization of Stage 3

<-----Page 4----->Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation
Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

is supported by empirical ﬁndings that positional strategies peak two-thirds of the way through a negotiation
(Olekalns et al. 1996). At this stage of the negotiation,
parties begin crafting offers based on their own interests
and priorities and the information they gathered about
the other party’s interests and priorities in Stage 2. Faced
with an offer from the other party, negotiators’ attention
turns back to their power and position. They compare the
offer on the table with their goal, their limit, and their
alternatives, deciding whether to accept or reject the
offer, and—if the latter—how to persuade the other party
to improve the offer. We expect persuasion in Stage 3
will rely on rational inﬂuence that appeals to facts or
alternatives (Adair and Brett 2004, Glenn et al. 1977).
The reason is that by this stage negotiators have sufﬁcient information about the other party’s interests and
priorities to use in rational persuasion. For example, a
seller might say, “Your offer is too low—our ﬁnancial
reports and market rankings for the past three years show
the company is worth much more.” Thus, we expect
the “spirited conﬂict” (Putnam and Jones 1982b) of the
third negotiation stage to be characterized by structural
sequences of offers and rational inﬂuence.
Structural sequences can send different signals.
A structural sequence of an offer followed by rational
inﬂuence may signal negotiators’ attempts to continue
searching or to delay settlement (Olekalns and Smith
2000). However, a rational argument followed by an
offer may signal the opposite: “Let’s stop arguing and
get this thing settled. Here is my offer.” To use these
sequences, negotiators must have enough information to
make reasonable offers, but not so much information that
all rational arguments have been stated. Therefore, these
rational inﬂuence-offer sequences should follow the second stage of priority information exchange but precede
the ﬁnal negotiation stage, when negotiators hammer out
a deal through the exchange of offers and counter-offers.
Hypothesis 4. Structural sequences of rational inﬂuence and offers will be more common in the third quarter
of a negotiation than in the other three quarters.
Fourth Stage: Reaching Agreement
By the time negotiators reach the fourth stage, the end—
whether agreement or no agreement—is in sight. At
this point, parties work to reduce alternatives and move
toward a ﬁnal decision (Morley and Stephenson 1977,
Putnam and Jones 1982b). They have exhausted rational persuasive arguments for why they should get more
value, but they are still focused on getting a good deal.
Thus, as deadlines loom, negotiators make more offers
and more concessions (Olekalns et al. 1996, Lim and
Murnighan 1994, Moore 2004). In this stage negotiators
reject the other party’s offer by making a counter-offer
rather than engaging in persuasion. The exchange of single and multi-issue offers in reciprocal sequence in the

37

fourth and ﬁnal stage of negotiation serves two purposes.
By this time negotiators should have sufﬁcient information to construct offers and to be reasonably conﬁdent
that an agreement is possible. So offers in the fourth
stage serve both to reach an agreement and to try to get
as much out of that agreement for oneself as possible.
Hypothesis 5. Reciprocal sequences of offers will be
more common in the fourth stage of a negotiation than
in the other three stages.

Culture and the Negotiation Dance

Culture is a socially shared meaning system (Geertz
1973, Triandis 1972). Culture is complex; it consists of
a group’s subjective characteristics, for example, values
and norms, and objective characteristics, for example,
artifacts and institutions (Brett 2001, Lytle et al. 1995).
The many sides of culture are evident in implicit theories
about negotiation that guide what strategies and avenues
are available to negotiators (Brett and Okumura 1998,
Gelfand and McCusker 2001, Morris and Gelfand 2004).
For example, both cultural values and norms are evident in a negotiator’s implicit theory that distinguishes
the relative priority of individual versus organizational
goals or the appropriateness of asking the other party
for sympathy. Therefore, although the functional stages
of a normative negotiation model may be universal (or
etic), we expect some of the behavioral content of stages
to be culture-speciﬁc (or emic). To predict the culturespeciﬁc aspects of the negotiation model, we turn to
Hall’s (1976) theory of low/high-context communication
and especially communicative ﬂexibility in high context
cultures.
Communication norms in Western cultures emphasize
direct communication and are thus, considered low context. In contrast, communication norms in Eastern cultures are indirect and high context (Hall 1976, Gibson
1998). Low-context communication is more explicit,
with meaning clearly contained in the words or the surface of a message. High-context communication is more
implicit, with subtle meaning embedded behind and
around the spoken or written words. Extracting meaning
from high-context communication requires second-level
inferential skills. For example, if I make a multi-issue
proposal, a low-context negotiation partner will hear my
explicit words and extract direct information about what
I want. In contrast, a high-context negotiation partner
may use information in my multi-issue proposal along
with information in my previous proposals and my reactions to her proposals to extract indirect information
about what my relative priorities are. Social interaction
in high-context cultures hones these second-level inferential skills to a degree unnecessary in a low-context
culture, when people may be willing to ask and answer
questions directly. It takes no special inferential skills to
understand meaning in low-context cultures.

<-----Page 5----->38

Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation

In addition to having different preferences for direct
and indirect communication, low- and high-context cultures differ in the ease with which they can switch from
one form of communication to the other (Hall 1976). We
expect that negotiators from high-context cultures will
be facile with both high- and low-context communication, whereas negotiators from low-context cultures will
be comfortable with low-context, but not high-context
communication. We propose that this variance in communication ﬂexibility will be evident in complementary
sequences of strategically similar behaviors that vary
in level of directness. For example, a complementaryinﬂuence sequence might include affective persuasion,
which is indirect and refers to contextual factors, and
rational inﬂuence, which is more direct, referring to facts
and information.
Complementary sequences deﬁne a culture-speciﬁc
rhythm of the four-stage negotiation dance. If the ﬁrst
negotiation stage is characterized by positional arguments, high-context negotiators are more likely than lowcontext negotiators to combine both direct, rational inﬂuence and indirect, affective inﬂuence in their positional
sequences. If the second negotiation stage is characterized by getting information on the table, high-context
negotiators are more likely to combine both direct priority statements and indirect information through offers
in information sequences than low-context negotiators
are. In fact, we expect complementary sequences to be a
signature rhythm of the high-context negotiation dance.
High-context dyads should use complementary information and inﬂuence sequences more frequently than
low-context dyads throughout the negotiation. In mixedcontext dyads, both negotiators are comfortable with lowcontext communication, but the low-context negotiator
is not accustomed to using or interpreting high-context
communication. Thus, we expect that high-context negotiators should refrain from using indirect, high-context
communication and should rely on direct, low-context
communication, the dyad’s common denominator. Consequently, high-context dyads should also use more complementary information and inﬂuence sequences than
mixed-context dyads.
Hypothesis 6. Negotiators in high-context dyads will
use more complementary information sequences than
negotiators in low-context or mixed-context dyads.
Hypothesis 7. Negotiators in high-context dyads will
use more complementary inﬂuence sequences than negotiators in low-context or mixed-context dyads.

Concluding the Negotiation

One way to measure success in transactional negotiation
is to tally the net value of the deal for the buyer and
seller to calculate joint gains (Tripp and Sondak 1992).
Joint gains are a measure of the entire pool of resources
negotiators created, not just how well one party did.

Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

Prior research suggests two etic steps in the negotiation dance that may help generate joint gains: reciprocal priority information sharing and structural sequences
of affective persuasion and priority information. We go
further to propose two emic elements that are likely to
facilitate joint gains in high-context cultures: reciprocal
offers and complementary information sequences.
Researchers have found that joint gains go hand in
hand with reciprocal information sharing about preferences and priorities (Olekalns and Smith 2000, Weingart
et al. 1999). We reﬁne this hypothesis based on our theorizing about the way the negotiation process evolves
over time. We believe that reciprocity of preferences and
priorities is particularly important in the second stage of
negotiations. Recall that during the second stage, parties disclose the information that will eventually allow
them to create joint gains. Postponing reciprocal information sharing to later in the negotiation may mean
that negotiators spend too much time positioning to
develop trust and that even when information is shared
reciprocally, it is less complete or less well understood.
Further, reciprocal priority information sharing should
generate joint gains regardless of a dyad’s cultural composition, because both low- and high-context negotiators
can understand and use information contained in direct
priority statements.
Hypothesis 8. Joint gains will be higher among
dyads that engage in more reciprocal information sharing in the second quarter of the negotiation than among
dyads that engage in less reciprocal information sharing
in the second quarter.
Another behavioral sequence that should contribute
to the creation of joint gains is the structural sequence
of affective persuasion and priority information. This
proposition is supported by prior research showing that
successful negotiators are able to turn negotiations from
power to interests (Brett et al. 1998). If our hypothesizing about the emphasis on inﬂuence in the ﬁrst stage is
correct, then negotiators who refocus their negotiation
from inﬂuence to priorities in the ﬁrst stage will be the
most likely to create joint gains. Again, we argue for an
etic effect: Structural sequences of inﬂuence and priority
information early in the negotiation should be positively
related to joint gains regardless of a dyad’s cultural composition, because both low- and high-context negotiators
need to move away from inﬂuence and share information
to reach an optimal solution.
Hypothesis 9. Joint gains will be higher among
dyads that use more structural sequences of affective
persuasion and priority information during the ﬁrst
quarter than among dyads that use these sequences less
frequently in the ﬁrst quarter.
A third behavioral sequence that should contribute
to the creation of joint gains involves sequences using

<-----Page 6----->Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation
Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

offers as information in high-context cultures. Research
indicates that U.S. and Japanese negotiators generate
equivalent joint gains, but that the Japanese make offers
more frequently than the U.S. negotiators (Adair et al.
2001, Brett and Okumura 1998). This research suggests
that high-context negotiators who reciprocate offers or
use offers in conjunction with priority information can
gain an understanding of each others’ preferences and
priorities. As with direct, priority information, we argue
that using reciprocal offers or complementary offerpriority information sequences to generate information
must occur early in the negotiation, moving negotiators away from the Stage 1 positional bargaining that
could jeopardize trust and cooperation. Therefore, we
hypothesize that high-context negotiators who engage
in reciprocal offers or complementary offer and priority
information in the second stage of the negotiation are
more likely to create joint gains.
Hypothesis 10. Joint gains will be higher for highcontext dyads that exchange more reciprocal offers in
the second quarter of the negotiation than high-context
dyads that exchange fewer reciprocal offers in the second quarter.
Hypothesis 11. Joint gains will be higher for highcontext dyads that use more complementary priority
information-offer sequences in the second quarter of the
negotiation than for high-context dyads that use fewer
complementary priority information-offer sequences in
the second quarter.

Methods

Recall that we are interested in testing both the etic
and emic aspects of a four-stage evolutionary negotiation model. To do this, we parsed each dyad’s negotiation into four equal-length stages, where the length of
a stage was determined by the number of interactions
divided by four. The dyad was the level of analysis. To
measure negotiator focus within each negotiation stage,
we used the frequency of different types of interacts
(A’s behavior–B’s response) as the unit of analysis.
Interacts, contingent response patterns, are the fundamental unit of social behavior (Weick 1969). In negotiations, one party acts and the other party reacts, and the
reaction serves as the stimulus action for the ﬁrst party’s
subsequent reaction, and so on (Weick 1969). Theoretically, interacts are a more appropriate unit of analysis
than behaviors because they reﬂect patterns of negotiation behavior between members of the dyad (Brett et al.
2004, Donohue 1981, Putnam and Jones 1982a).1
Sample and Data Collection
Tables 1 and 2 describe the three samples used in the
study. The low-context sample consists of dyads from
four cultures that have been classiﬁed theoretically and
empirically as low context: Germany (N = 20 dyads),
Israel (N = 18 dyads), Sweden (N = 24 dyads), and the

39

United States (N = 27 dyads). The high-context sample consists of dyads from four cultures that have been
classiﬁed theoretically and empirically as high context:
Hong Kong Chinese (N = 18 dyads), Japan (N = 24
dyads), Russia (N = 36 dyads), and Thailand (N =
24 dyads). The mixed-context sample consists of dyads
from one low-context and two high-context cultures
(United States–Japan (N = 24 dyads), U.S.–Hong Kong
Chinese (N = 21 dyads)).
We collected data as part of the ﬁrst exercise in a
negotiation training program. The negotiation simulation, Cartoon, is a deal-making exercise with integrative
potential. It is a multi cultural version of the Moms.com
exercise (Tenbrunsel and Bazerman 1995) about the
sale of syndication (rerun) rights for 100 episodes of
a children’s cartoon, Ultra Rangers. The syndication of
cartoons across national borders is common, because
cartoon characters transcend ethnic identity and speech
is easily dubbed. There were three necessary components to a deal: price of each episode, ﬁnancing terms,
and runs (the number of times each episode may be
shown during the ﬁxed ﬁve-year contract). Price was
a distributive issue. Financing and runs were issues to
trade off (the seller wants payment up front and the
buyer wants more runs). In addition, there were two hidden creative issues: (a) a second cartoon, Strums, was a
compatible issue offering value to both parties; and (b)
different rating expectations offered an opportunity for
a bet or contingent contract (full details on the parties’
positions, limits, and alternatives are available in Adair
et al. 2001).
We assigned participants to roles and gave them
90 minutes to prepare with someone from their own culture playing the same role. We then assigned participants
to one-on-one dyads, and they had up to 90 minutes to
negotiate. Participants audio recorded their discussion.
Some dyads reached agreement prior to the 90-minute
deadline. After the negotiation, participants reported
their results and we debriefed the exercise in conjunction
with a lecture on negotiation strategy.
Coding and Analyses
As negotiation tapes were transcribed, they were organized by speaking turn (all of one person’s speech until
the next person began speaking). Foreign language tapes
(Russian and Japanese) were translated and transcribed
by one person, and a person ﬂuent in the pertinent
language monitored this process. Four coders trained
together, then calibrated and recalibrated themselves
as they coded the data over a two-year time period.
Coders unitized the data by coding up to ﬁve unique
thought units (subject-verb phrase) in each speaking turn
but did not assign more than one code per thought unit
(Weingart et al. 1993). Differences in the number of
thought units coded within a speaking turn were reconciled in training and were accounted for in reliability
testing.

Case materials were translated and back translated; transcripts were transcribed and translated into English and checked by
an independent reader.

From the theoretical perspective we were studying a
mixed-motive, deal-making negotiation task with both
distributive and integrative elements (McGrath 1984).
Because we were interested in how negotiators exchange
information (relevant to the integrative element of the
task) and exert inﬂuence (relevant to the distributive element of the task), we coded transcripts for information and inﬂuence behaviors. We used the code that
Adair and colleagues (2001) developed from prior transactional negotiation coding schemes (e.g. Weingart et
al. 1990) to capture high- and low-context communication in mixed-motive transactional negotiation. For the
present study, we were interested in four strategic groups
of behaviors: priority information, offers, affective persuasion, and rational inﬂuence. To operationalize these
four strategies we selected behavioral codes that ﬁt with

our theoretical conceptualization of these four strategies (see the appendix).2 The average inter-rater reliability across the codes used to operationalize this study’s
four strategic categories was kappa = 071, which is in
the “good” range according to Bakeman and Gottman
(1997).
Priority information is deﬁned as information that
reveals negotiators’ preferences for an issue or priorities
among issues. We operationalized priority information
with three indicators. Direct statements about preferences and priorities explicitly convey priority information to the other party. “Yes” and “no” reactions to the
other parties’ offers also provide information on one’s
priorities, especially if these reactions are tracked over
time. Noting common interests or areas where parties
have different objectives is a third means of conveying

information on preferences and priorities to the other
party.
Offers are deﬁned as a proposal to the other party and
were operationalized with two indicators. Single-issue
offers included any proposal representing only one of the
ﬁve possible issues in the negotiation simulation. Multiissue offers included any proposal representing two or
more of the ﬁve possible issues.
Affective persuasion is deﬁned as contextual (i.e.,
referring to social norms or information from the external environment, as opposed to facts about the task) or
emotional appeals. We operationalized affective persuasion with three codes. First, asking for sympathy is an
appeal to the other party’s emotions or norms for fairness.
Second, referring to the status or prestige of oneself or
one’s company appeals to social norms to defer to those
with high power or status. Third, referring to the status
of one’s competitors is also a relational power argument
relying on contextual rather than task-related factors.
Rational persuasion is deﬁned as appeals based on
task-relevant factors, for example, market data supporting the strength of one’s position. We operationalized
rational persuasion with three indicators. References to
limits with respect to negotiation issues conveys one’s
inability to make more concessions, and references to
the presence of alternatives (i.e., other potential buyers or sellers) conveys one’s power to walk away from
the table. Argument included informational persuasion
about why one party needed something. Substantiation
included informational persuasion about why the other
party needed something.
The dependent variables were the hypothesized strategic sequences, or pairs of actions and responses.
Details on methods for constructing and measuring

reciprocal sequences are reported in Adair (2003). We
used the same method to code reciprocal priority information, reciprocal offers, reciprocal affective persuasion,
complementary information, complementary persuasion,
structural priority information—affective persuasion—
and structural offers—rational inﬂuence. In constructing
these sequences, we did not distinguish which behavior was the action and which the response, since our
hypotheses focus on patterns and are not directional.
There were relatively few speaking turns with multiple
thought units (6.8%). However, because a speaking turn
could have up to ﬁve thought units, two speaking turns
were occasionally coded as more than one type of
sequence (0.66%). For example, a speaking turn that
contained both rational persuasion and an offer, followed
by a speaking turn that contained an offer, was coded
as both reciprocal offer and structural offer—rational
persuasion.
We aggregated the time series sequence data for each
dyad into four quarters based on the total number of
speaking turns in each dyad’s negotiation. This approach
dealt with the fact that some dyads took much more
time to reach agreement than others. It also relied on the
number of interactions rather than communication content to divide the negotiation into stages. In the resulting
data ﬁle, the dyad was the level of analysis, and for each
dyad we had the total count of each type of reciprocal,
complementary, and structural sequence in each of four
time periods. For example, the total number of reciprocal
priority information sequences was calculated for each
dyad in the ﬁrst, second, third, and fourth quarters of
their own negotiation. We transformed frequency counts
into proportions by dividing the total number of each
type of sequence in each time period by the total number

of speaking turns in that time period minus one (i.e., the
total number of possible behavioral sequences). Because
some sequences occurred with very low frequency, we
log transformed the proportions to stretch the tails of the
distribution (Tukey 1977).
We used repeated-measures multivariate analysis of
variance to test Hypotheses 1–7. Time was the repeated
measure or within-subjects (dyads) factor, and Culture
(high context, low context, mixed context) was the
between-subjects (dyads) factor. Hypotheses 8–11 were
tested with hierarchical regression analysis. The dependent variable was joint gains. In Model 1, we entered
the hypothesized main effect behavioral sequence frequency for the hypothesized time period. In Model 2,
we entered dummy variables for low-context and highcontext Culture (mixed-context was the reference category). In Model 3, we entered the Culture multiplied by
sequence frequency interaction.

A summary of the statistical results for Hypotheses 1–7
is in Table 3. Figures 1–7 illustrate the ﬁndings. Because
the dependent variables were logged proportions, for
visual clarity we added a constant of four before presenting the data in the ﬁgures.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that reciprocal sequences of
affective persuasion would decrease linearly over the
four stages of the negotiation. Hypothesis 1 was partially supported. There was a signiﬁcant main effect
for Time on reciprocal affective persuasion (F 3231 =
1336 p ≤ 001). The results are illustrated in Figure 1.
The contrast, however, revealed that the pattern was
quadratic, not linear, as expected. Figure 1 shows that
as predicted, reciprocal affective persuasion started high
in the ﬁrst quarter, dropped off during the second, and

then remained relatively constant for the rest of the
negotiation. There were no differences between cultural
samples, but there was a signiﬁcant Time multiplied by
Culture interaction (F 6464 = 229 p ≤ 005) capturing the higher levels of reciprocal affective persuasion
by low-context dyads in the ﬁrst quarter.
Hypothesis 2 predicted that structural sequences of
affective persuasion and priority information would
be most common in the ﬁrst stage of a negotiation.
Hypothesis 2 was supported for negotiators from lowcontext dyads and mixed-context dyads (see Figure 2).
There was a signiﬁcant main effect for Time on structural sequences between affective persuasion and priority
information (F 3231 = 1107 p ≤ 001). The contrast
tests conﬁrmed a linear relationship. There were relatively high levels of these structural sequences in the
ﬁrst quarter, decreasing levels over time until the third
quarter, and then fairly constant levels in the fourth quarter for negotiators from low-context and mixed-context
dyads. Rates were relatively constant and signiﬁcantly

lower for negotiators from high-context dyads (Time
multiplied by Culture F 6464 = 275 p ≤ 005).
Hypothesis 3 predicted that reciprocal patterns of
priority information would be most common in the
second stage of the negotiation. The main effect for
Time on reciprocal priority information was signiﬁcant (F 3231 = 533 p ≤ 001). The contrast tests
revealed a signiﬁcant cubic relationship, with reciprocal
priority information peaking during the second quarter
of negotiations for all dyads. The Culture main effect
was signiﬁcant, indicating overall higher levels of reciprocal priority information in low-context and mixedcontext dyads than in high-context dyads (F 2232 =
4072 p ≤ 001). The Time multiplied by Culture interaction was not signiﬁcant.
Hypothesis 4 predicted that structural sequences of
rational inﬂuence and offers would be more common in
the third stage of a negotiation. There was a signiﬁcant
main effect for Time on structural sequences of rational

inﬂuence and offers (F 3231 = 1475 p ≤ 001). Figure 4 shows that the overall relationship was linear, with
structural sequences increasing over time for all culture
groups. As with Hypothesis 3, the Time multiplied by
Culture interaction was not signiﬁcant, but the Culture
main effect was signiﬁcant, indicating overall greater use
of structural sequences of rational inﬂuence and offers in
high-context dyads than in low-context or mixed-context
dyads (F 2 232 = 948 p ≤ 001).
Hypothesis 5 predicted that reciprocal sequences of
offers would be most common in the last stage of
negotiations. Hypothesis 5 was supported. Figure 5
illustrates the signiﬁcant main effect for Time on reciprocal offers (F 3231 = 4663 p ≤ 001). The contrast
tests revealed a signiﬁcant linear relationship, with reciprocal offers peaking during the fourth quarter of negotiations for all culture groups. There was also a main
effect for Culture: Overall reciprocal offers were used

more frequently in high-context dyads than low-context
or mixed-context dyads and more frequently in lowcontext dyads than in mixed-context dyads (F 2232 =
2035 p ≤ 001).
Hypothesis 6 predicted that complementary information sequences would be more common for negotiators in high-context dyads than low-context or mixedcontext dyads. Results conﬁrm a main effect for
Culture (F 2232 = 1430 p ≤ 001). The post hoc
Bonferroni contrasts revealed that negotiators from highcontext dyads used more complementary informationoffer sequences than either low-context or mixed-context
dyads (see Figure 6). There was also a main effect of
Time (F 3231 = 3063 p ≤ 001) and a signiﬁcant
Time multiplied by Culture interaction (F 6464 =
364, p ≤ 001). The use of complementary information
sequences increased over time, and high-context dyads
used more complementary sequences than low-context
or mixed-context dyads in the ﬁrst, second, and fourth
stages of the negotiation.
Hypothesis 7 predicted that complementary inﬂuence
sequences would be more common for negotiators
in high-context dyads than in low-context or mixedcontext dyads. The hypothesis was not supported
(F 2232 = 106. However, there was a main effect of
Time (F 3231 = 278 p ≤ 005) that contrast effects
revealed was quadratic. In general, complementary inﬂuence sequences increased from Stage 1 to 2 and then
decreased over time (Figure 7).
Hypothesis 8 predicted that dyads that reciprocated
priority information in the second stage would create
greater joint gains than those that did not. We tested this
hypothesis with hierarchical regression analysis, adding
ﬁrst main effects for reciprocal priority information in
Stage 2, low-context dyad composition, and high-context
dyad composition (mixed-context was the reference category). Then we added the reciprocity multiplied by

Culture interactions. The hypothesized main effect for
reciprocal priority information in Stage 2 was signiﬁcant
(B = 014; p ≤ 005). There were no signiﬁcant Culture or interaction effects. Also, exploratory analyses
revealed that reciprocal priority information in the other
three quarters was not related to joint gains.
Hypothesis 9 predicted that dyads that turned the
negotiation from affective persuasion to priority information sharing in the ﬁrst stage would create greater
joint gains than those that did not. We used the same
analysis as for Hypothesis 8. The hypothesized main
effect for structural sequences of affective persuasion
and priority information in Stage 1 was signiﬁcant
(B = 017	 p ≤ 001). There were no signiﬁcant Culture or interaction effects. Also, exploratory analyses
revealed that structural sequences of affective persuasion
and priority information in the other three quarters were
not related to joint gains.
Hypotheses 10 and 11 predicted that high-context
dyads that reciprocated more offers or used more complementary sequences of offers and priority information
in the second stage would create greater joint gains than
high-context dyads that used these sequences less frequently. We used regression analyses, as we did testing Hypotheses 8 and 9, adding ﬁrst the hypothesized
sequence frequencies, then the Culture dummy variables,
and ﬁnally the sequence multiplied by Culture interaction. Results indicated no signiﬁcant main effect or
interactions of reciprocal offers or complementary offerpriority information sequences on joint gains. Therefore,
Hypotheses 10 and 11 were not conﬁrmed.

Discussion

We proposed a normative four-stage model for transactional negotiations: relational positioning; identifying
the problem; generating solutions; and reaching agreement. Results suggest that several aspects of these four

<-----Page 12----->Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation
Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

sequential stages are common across cultures (etic).
What is more, structural affective inﬂuence-information
sequences in the ﬁrst stage and reciprocal priority information sequences in the second stage predicted joint
gains across cultures. Further, as proposed, we identiﬁed several culture-speciﬁc (emic) elements in how lowand high-context negotiators enact the four negotiation
stages.
These ﬁndings contribute to negotiation research as
well as to emerging research on culture and communication in the context of interpersonal interaction. The
results extend theory on the evolution of negotiation by
supporting a four-stage model that captures the complex interplay of cooperative and competitive behavioral
sequences that characterize mixed-motive negotiation
and by demonstrating linkages between behavioral
sequences in the ﬁrst two stages of the model and negotiation performance (i.e., joint gains). The results also
extend the theory of culture and communication in the
context of negotiation by providing empirical conﬁrmation of predictions based on Hall’s (1976) theory about
the ﬂexibility of high-context communication. Below, we
discuss these contributions and show how our results
support Hall’s (1976) observation that negotiation, like
dance, has a universal ﬂow that is enacted with culturespeciﬁc behavioral sequences.
Contribution to the Theory of Negotiation Stages
By dividing negotiations into four quarters and using
functional sequences as the unit of analysis, we were
able to identify four distinct negotiation stages. The
focus of the ﬁrst stage was more competitive than later
stages as negotiators contended for power and inﬂuence
using relatively more sequences involving affective persuasion than in other stages. The focus of the second
stage was more cooperative than the ﬁrst, as negotiators
turned to the issues and reciprocated priority information
about what issues were more and less important to them.
The focus of the third stage returned to competition,
as negotiators engaged in a dance of offering solutions
and supporting or rejecting them using rational arguments. The focus of the fourth stage was similar to that
of the third stage but decidedly more intense, as negotiators worked toward agreement by building on each
other’s offers. Negotiators increased their use of reciprocal offers and structural sequences of offers and rational
inﬂuence in the fourth quarter.
Our data generally support the four-stage model we
proposed but also suggest some strategic and cultural
complexities that we did and did not anticipate.
Results that did not fully support the four-stage
model we predicted related primarily to the fourth stage.
For example, we predicted that structural sequences of
rational persuasion and offers would increase in a more
competitive third quarter and drop off in a more cooperative fourth quarter. The third-quarter prediction was supported, but contrary to expectations, structural sequences

45

of rational persuasion and offers continued to increase
along with reciprocal offer sequences in the fourth
quarter. Thus, both the third and forth quarters were
characterized by structural sequences involving rational
persuasion and reciprocal offers; the difference was that
these sequences occurred with greater frequency, i.e.,
represented a greater portion of the overall interactions
in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. It appears that
the distinction between the third and fourth quarters is
less in terms of content of communication than in terms
of the intensity of communications.
We also found some cultural differences that suggest
emic or culture-speciﬁc aspects of our four-stage negotiation model. For example, the increasing frequency of
structural sequences of rational persuasion-offers across
Stages 3 and 4 was primarily evident in low-context
and mixed-context dyads; in high-context dyads levels
of these structural sequences decreased in the fourth
stage (supporting our original prediction). Also, the frequency of reciprocal priority information that peaked
in the second quarter for all dyads increased again
in the fourth quarter for low-context dyads. Thus, the
etic characteristics of the fourth stage are an increase
in reciprocal offers; the emic aspects are a decrease
in structural rational persuasion-offers in high-context
dyads and an increase in reciprocal priority information
in low-context dyads. These more culture speciﬁc, or
emic, enactments of our four-stage negotiation model
support prior research suggesting that some types of
interaction are more appropriate for high-context interactions and others are more appropriate for low-context
interactions (Adair 2003).
It should also be noted that the strategies we coded
did not clearly distinguish a ﬁrst stage for high-context
dyads. There was not one type of interaction that
was signiﬁcantly more common in Stage 1 than in
subsequent stages for high-context dyads. We offer
two possible explanations for this empirical ﬁnding: In
Stage 1, high-context dyads may have engaged in a lot
of different behaviors without a particular strategic focus
or sequencing pattern, or they may have focused on a
strategy that was not captured by our code. In other
words, we may need different, culture-speciﬁc codes to
capture the indirect and relational interaction patterns we
expect from high-context dyads at the onset of negotiation. For example, the ﬁrst stage of negotiations for
high-context dyads may be characterized more by relational trust building than by affective persuasion. Such
“getting-to-know-you” rhetoric would not be captured
with the code we used and should be considered in
future research.
Although our results indicate some qualiﬁcations and
areas for future research, they also generally support
our sequential four-stage negotiation model. Negotiators
moved through these four stages regardless of how much
time they spent negotiating, supporting our argument

<-----Page 13----->46

Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation

for a normative, functional stage model of negotiations.
Although negotiators had a deadline of 90 minutes, some
dyads completed the negotiation in 60 minutes. Because
negotiations progressed from Stage 3 to Stage 4 regardless of whether the dyad was close to the temporal
deadline, the shift should not have been driven by a
deadline effect, i.e., attention to time running out. In contrast to a shift in focus at a temporal midpoint driven by
attention to task deadlines (Gersick 1988, 1989) or an
increase in offers as the negotiation deadline approaches
(deadline-concession effect, Lim and Murnighan 1994),
our data suggest a sequential model driven by functional
stages rather than time. Our ﬁndings suggest that the
prototype we identiﬁed should apply to complex, mixedmotive negotiations, regardless of how long the negotiations last.
Our results show that, as predicted, the frequency of
certain behavior sequences waxes and wanes over time.
For example, reciprocal sequences of affective persuasion occurred most often in the ﬁrst negotiation stage.
That is not to say that negotiators relied exclusively on
these sequences. Nor do we claim that the ﬁrst stage
is dominated by these sequences. In fact, overall negotiators spend more time exchanging information than
engaging in attempts to inﬂuence the other side. Nevertheless, the data reveal that negotiators’ focus shifts
throughout the negotiation. Rather than a gradual shift
from competition to cooperation as predicted in previous models (e.g., Putnam and Jones 1982b, Morley and
Stevenson 1977), we documented that the use of cooperative and competitive strategies shifts throughout the
negotiation. In this way, the four-stage model we proposed captures the struggle that negotiators experience
as they balance their desire to reach agreement with getting a good deal for themselves.
We suggest that this fundamental four-stage negotiation model is a norm or a prototype that guides negotiators through an evolutionary process, just as music
and choreography guide dancers through stages to a climax. Dance often follows an ABA or ABAB format
that represents movement between contrasting themes.
Negotiations too have distinct stages that lead to a
climax (Holmes 1992), and negotiators visit contrasting themes as they move between the four negotiation
stages. Empirical support of a four-stage negotiation
model bolsters our understanding of the dynamic interplay between competition and cooperation in mixedmotive negotiation.
Culture in the Negotiation Dance
Based on Hall’s (1976) account that high-context communicators are skilled in both direct and indirect forms
of communication, we hypothesized and found that
high-context negotiators used more ﬂexible, complementary information sequences than low-context negotiators. Thus, the distinction between low- and high-context

Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

communication in negotiation is not just in the frequency
of what is said (Adair et al. 2001), but also in the
scope and ﬂexibility of how negotiators communicate.
By gleaning information on the other party’s interests
both directly from priority information statements and
indirectly from offers over time, high-context negotiators have more choices in how they enact the cooperative stages of the negotiation dance. This suggests that
they may be more able than low-context negotiators to
gather information without signaling pure cooperation to
the other party through reciprocal priority information
statements.
In addition to our ﬁndings with respect to complementary information sequences, we found that high-context
negotiators reciprocated offers, a culturally normative
behavior (Adair et al. 2001), more and priority information less than low-context negotiators throughout
all four stages of the negotiation. Last, high-context
negotiators used fewer structural affective persuasionpriority information sequences than low-context negotiators. These ﬁndings support our prediction that indirect,
high-context negotiators are less likely than direct, lowcontext negotiators to engage in priority information
sharing.
Our results revealing culturally emic elements of the
evolution of negotiations across four stages and cultural differences in how negotiators glean information
in negotiations suggest that negotiators, like dancers,
move in sequences of steps that are associated with a
cultural milieu. “A student of East Indian dance would
not dream of trying to learn the intricate steps, the
complex hand gestures, the myriad rhythms of Bharata
Natyam    without knowing something about the Hindu
religion, some words in Sanskrit and Hindi, and how
to wear a sari” (Terry 1982). Because some negotiation processes are also culture speciﬁc, negotiating with
someone from another culture requires understanding
the other party’s communication and interaction norms.
Negotiators in high-context cultures use more diverse
and ﬂuid strategic sequences than negotiators in lowcontext cultures. Just as it will take time for a Cuban,
who is accustomed to the rapid, staircase movements of
Latin social dancing, and an American—accustomed to
smooth walking dances like the waltz—to get in sync, it
will take time for cross-cultural negotiators to synchronize their movements. In fact, our data show that mixedcontext dyads took longer than same-context dyads to
develop patterned behaviors.
Another question for dancers and negotiators from
different cultures is who will adapt to whom. Our
results showed that mixed-context dyads’ sequential patterns looked more like the patterns of low- than highcontext dyads, which we attributed to the less-ﬂexible
low-context negotiators. Their lack of familiarity with
the sequences that are normative in high-context negotiations means that their repertoires may not contain

<-----Page 14----->Adair and Brett: The Negotiation Dance: Time, Culture, and Behavioral Sequences in Negotiation
Organization Science 16(1), pp. 33–51, © 2005 INFORMS

these patterns. Thus, when confronted with normative
high-context behavior, they responded in unpatterned
ways. We suggest that negotiators’ repertoires of strategic sequences in negotiation are like implicit theories,
and in a mixed-culture setting, both individual ﬂexibility
and dyadic similarity will likely inﬂuence how negotiators enact and/or adjust their behaviors (Resnick et al.
1991).
Negotiation Outcome
What negotiators do in the ﬁrst half of the negotiation
has a signiﬁcant impact on their ability to generate integrative solutions with high joint gains. These ﬁndings
contribute to our knowledge of processes leading to successful negotiation outcomes in two ways. First, we have
identiﬁed a particular type of structural sequence that
produces high-quality outcomes, namely affective persuasion and priority information. Second, we have pinpointed when these structural sequences and reciprocal
priority information sequences should occur to generate the desired outcome effect. That negotiators must
pass through these stages and enact these behaviors early
in the negotiation is an important and novel ﬁnding.
If negotiators do not get to priority information sharing
by the negotiation midpoint, joint gains may be elusive.
A four-stage negotiation model therefore offers important predictors of joint gains within distinct stages of the
ﬁrst half of a negotiation interaction.
The results also demonstrate that across cultures,
direct priority information sharing is superior to indirect
information sharing via offers for generating joint gains.
Across all four negotiation stages, even high-context
dyads did not glean enough information from reciprocal offers or complementary offer-priority information
sequences to maximize their joint gains.
Study Strengths and Limitations and
Opportunities for Further Research
The design choices for this study, including how we operationalized time, culture, and strategic sequences, provided a conservative test of the hypotheses. We divided
the total number of interactions into quarters based on
the objective standard of the length of the negotiation,
rather than on the content of negotiators’ discussion. This
allowed us to test hypotheses about changing patterns in
the content of strategic sequences. Because we did not
use events to mark transition shifts and some dyads probably moved through the stages at slightly different paces,
our interval approach offers a conservative test of the
sequential four-stage model. We placed negotiators from
different national cultures into high- and low-context
categories based on others’ research and theorizing. This
undoubtedly generated substantial within-group variance.
Nevertheless, the data show clear differences between
the frequency of use of sequential strategies that are consistent with the theorizing and hypotheses. We used theory, not empiricism, to group negotiator behaviors into

47

four strategic functional categories. This choice also no
doubt generated within-category variance. The conceptually meaningful results demonstrate the utility of the
functional sequences we employed.
There are several other ways of measuring group
processes and conceptualizing time (see McGrath and
Rotchford 1983, Arrow et al. 2004) that we believe could
support and expand our sequential four-stage model.
Here we mention three: an event-based aggregation
approach, individual conceptualization of time, and
holistic views of time. Negotiators with a longstanding
relationship may move through the ﬁrst stage or relational positioning more quickly than negotiators meeting
for the ﬁrst time. An event-based aggregation approach
(e.g., Poole and Roth 1989a, b) could be used to test
factors such as prior relationship that cause dyads to
move through these four sequences with different paces
and/or rhythms. There are also differences in how individuals view time; for example, monochronic cultures
have a more short-term and linear view of time than
polychronic cultures (Hall 1983). Particularly in crosscultural negotiations, how people conceptualize time
may affect the organization and ﬂow of stages in group
processes (Waller et al. 2001). Also, because stage models of time assume that change is a function of people’s internal clocks, they do not account for external forces that may affect processes and transitions.
For example, in models of entrainment, individuals and
groups respond to organizational and environment cycles
(Ancona and Chong 1996). Some of these more holistic views of time might help account for variation in
the four-stage model in different organizational contexts. Also, we hope that future research will empirically
demonstrate whether a four-stage model describes the
same negotiation process better than a three- or twostage model—analyses that went beyond the scope of
this research.
Although we concluded that our mixed-context dyads
did a low-context dance because the high-context negotiators were more ﬂexible communicators than lowcontext negotiators, we cannot rule out the facts that
these negotiations occurred in a low-context environment and in the English language. These factors could
have contributed to cuing low-context communication
patterns. It would certainly be appropriate to take a look
at the mixed-context negotiation dance embedded in a
high-context environment and/or in a high-context language. We would look particularly at the reciprocation
of offers over time for evidence that in a high-context
culture, mixed-context negotiators appear to negotiate
like high-context negotiators. Future research might also
investigate universal and culture-speciﬁc patterns of individual negotiators’ sequence initiation and response in
mixed-context dyads.

Implications for Negotiators
Conceptualizing negotiation as dance is a powerful tool
to help negotiators understand the interdependent and
temporal nature of the negotiation process. Negotiators
who understand the choreography of the negotiation
dance should be able to use it as a standard to judge the
quality and progress of the negotiation. Just as negotiators use their best alternative to a negotiated agreement
to judge the quality of a settlement proposal, they should
be able to judge, or even manipulate, the progress of
the negotiation by evaluating the type of response their
strategic behaviors are eliciting. For example, a negotiator offering priority information that is answered by
affective persuasion will know that the other party is not
yet ready to move to Stage 2. A negotiator making a
settlement offer that is answered by rational inﬂuence
will know that the other party is not yet ready to move
to Stage 4. On the other hand, a negotiator may be able
to move the negotiation to Stage 4 by reciprocating an
offer with a counter offer rather than responding with
rational inﬂuence.
It may be challenging for a single person to negotiate and monitor the progress of the negotiation simultaneously. Yet a designated negotiation strategist, like
in hostage negotiations (Misino and Contu 2002), could
monitor the communication and convey to the primary
negotiator the types of sequences being used: reciprocal,
complementary, or structural; the strategies underlying
those sequences: information or inﬂuence; and how much
time has elapsed using those sequences and strategies.

Negotiators who understand the choreography may use
it to identify when a negotiation is headed in the wrong
direction so they can take measures to redirect the conversation. Negotiators may also rely on the choreography to tell them if they are spending too much time in
a particular stage.
We think that negotiators from low-context cultures
will be disadvantaged in the global marketplace by
their inability to communicate in or understand highcontext communication. The question is whether we
can teach low-context negotiators to master the steps
and sequences of a high-context negotiation dance. Can
a negotiator who has been acculturated to low-context
communication learn to infer information from the progression of offers? Certainly awareness and practice with
high-context communication is called for, but will learning and ﬂexibility ensue? Although the literature on
training negotiators to overcome their cognitive biases
does not provide a basis for optimism (Thompson et al.
2000), unless low-context negotiators learn how to draw
inferences from high-context communications, they will
be at a disadvantage in the global marketplace.

Larger patterned units of behavior may also be deﬁned.
A double interact (Weick 1969) would consist of three units
of behavior: A’s behavior, B’s response, and A’s response
to B’s behavior. However, as the length of the sequence
increases, so does the number of different sequences possible, and with a comprehensive behavioral code the number of possible sequence combinations increases exponentially and the frequency of occurrence of any one type of
sequence goes down. Therefore, the unit of analysis for studying the evolutionary development of a negotiation is a trade-off
against the frequency with which a unit can possibly occur
and the length of the pattern captured by that unit and the
number of different behaviors coded. Using the interact as a
unit of analysis is standard convention in negotiation process
research, and even methods exploring longer chains of behavior have found the interact the most powerful and parsimonious method of measuring dyadic behavior (Weingart et al.
1999).
2
There are, of course, other options for operationalizing variables from available data. We chose this theoretically grounded
approach because our strategic categories were theoretically
grounded in the distinction between high- and low-context
communication. A theoretical approach is at the same time a
direct and conservative test of theory, since categorization does
not take advantage of empirical similarity in the frequency
of use.
