Abstract
Imagine that you own a five-outcome gamble with the following payoffs and probabilities: ($100, .20; $50, .20;
$0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). What happens when the opportunity to improve such a gamble is provided by a
manipulation that adds value to one outcome versus another outcome, particularly when the opportunity to add
value to one outcome versus another outcome changes the overall probability of a gain or the overall probability of
a loss? Such a choice provides a simple test of the expected utility model (EU), original prospect theory (OPT), and
cumulative prospect theory (CPT). A study of risky choices involving 375 respondents indicates that respondents
were most sensitive to changes in outcome values that either increased the overall probability of a strict gain or
decreased the overall probability of a strict loss. These results indicate more support for OPT rather than CPT and
EU under various assumptions about the shape of the utility and value and weighting functions. Most importantly,
the main difference between the various expectation models of risky choice occurs for outcomes near the reference
value. A second study of risky choice involving 151 respondents again demonstrated the sensitivity of subjects to
reducing the probability of a strict loss even at the cost of reduced expected value. Consequently, we argue that
theories of how people choose among gambles that involve three or more consequences with both gains and losses
need to include measures of the overall probabilities of a gain and of a loss.

The past fifty years have seen much theoretical and empirical work devoted to developing
and testing models of risky choice behavior. However, developing a descriptive model of
risky decision-making has proven much more difficult than originally assumed. In particular,
“the issue of a suitable descriptive theory for gambles with three or more consequences is
very much up in the air” (Luce, 2000, p. 286). This is unfortunate, since many important
decisions involve risky options with multiple outcomes.
This paper provides evidence that any descriptive theory of choice among gambles with
multiple outcomes will need to include measures of the overall probability of a gain and
the overall probability of a loss. Although the psychological meaningfulness of constructs
reflecting the overall probabilities of winning or losing may seem obvious, such constructs
are not part of the traditional expected utility model nor of more recent nonlinear expectation

models such as Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) or Cumulative Prospect
theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). Thus, at a minimum, the traditional expectation
models of risky choice will need to be modified, when applied to multi-outcome gambles,
to include a component that reflects the overall likelihood that one wins or loses with a
gamble.
The paper is organized as follows. First, some notation used throughout the paper is
introduced, along with a discussion of various expectation models of risky choice behavior.
Next, results by Fennema and Wakker (1997), Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (1980, 1981),
and Lopes and Oden (1999) using experimental tests related to that used in the present paper
are discussed. Third, two experimental tests of risky choice behavior where participants
choose which outcome’s value to augment are described. The paper concludes with a brief
discussion of the implications of the results for model building and the methods used to
examine multi-outcome risky decision-making.

1.1. The risky choice task
Imagine that you are faced with a set of two or more gambles (prospects or lotteries) of the
form g j = (x1 , p1 ; . . .; xn , pn ), denoting an option that yields outcome $xi with probability
pi , i = 1, . . . , n, n > 2. Further, arrange the prospect so that the outcomes are ranked from
least to best in terms of preference order, x1 ≤ · · · ≤ xn . Finally, define a special outcome
ri such that outcomes below ri are perceived (coded) as losses and outcomes at or above
ri are perceived as gains. One conclusion that has been reached from the past two or more
decades of decision research is the almost universal tendency for people to distinguish gains
from losses. It is usual to set ri = 0 (a status quo or no change in wealth outcome). Thus,
a gamble might have the form (x1 , p1 ; . . . ; xr , pr ; . . . ; xn , p j ), where x7 < x2 < · · · <xr <
xk < . . . <xn , and where the reference outcome xr may or may not be a realizable outcome.
A gamble that has at least one outcome above r and at least one outcome below r is typically
referred to as a mixed gamble. When faced with a decision involving the choice between
two or more multi-outcome mixed gambles, how do people decide which gamble to choose?
1.1.1. The expected utility model. The classic answer to the question of how people should
select among gambles is based on some form of expectation theory, such as the expected
utility model (EU). At a process level, the EU model assumes that the decision maker
proceeds as if he or she first assesses the attractiveness (utility) of a potential consequence of
a gamble, then weights the utility of that potential consequence of a gamble by its likelihood
of occurrence, then repeats that same process separately for all possible outcomes, summing
the weighted utilities over all possible consequences to arrive at an overall (expectation)
utility for each gamble in the choice set, and then chooses that gamble with the largest
expected utility.1 The idea of separable valuation implies that the contribution of a “branch”
of the decision tree (a specific probability-outcome combination) should be independent of
the properties of the other branches (Weber, Anderson, and Birnbaum, 1992).
The classic assumption is that the utility function used in the maximization of expected
utility is one based on total wealth and is one that is concave (risk averse) everywhere. A
value (utility) function that is based on changes in wealth and that is risk seeking for losses

<-----Page 2----->IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

7

(convex) and risk averse for gains (concave) is assumed by Prospect theory (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1979), discussed next.2
1.1.2. Prospect theory. The main “behavioral” alternative to the expected utility model
has been Prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), denoted OPT for original prospect
theory. As noted, OPT assumes a value function for outcomes that exhibits diminishing
sensitivity as one moves away from a reference point in either direction (a positive change
or a negative change), implying a concave function for gains and a convex function for
losses. In addition, OPT assumes that the value of each outcome is weighted by a decision
weight π(p) that is a nonlinear function of the probabilities of each outcome. Similar to the
EU model, OPT assumes that the combination of values and decision weights follows the
general bilinear form.
Prospect theory was originally formulated for simple mixed prospects with at most two
nonzero outcomes. A variation of OPT designed to apply to multiple outcome gambles is
discussed next.
1.1.3. Cumulative prospect theory. In 1992, Tversky and Kahneman introduced Cumulative Prospect theory (CPT). The key difference between cumulative prospect theory (CPT)
and original prospect theory (OPT) is the use of cumulative (rank-dependent) rather than
separable decision weights. That is, instead of transforming each probability separately,
cumulative prospect theory transforms the entire cumulative distribution for gains and for
losses separately and adds the results of the gains and losses valuations together to obtain
an overall valuation for a mixed gamble. Note that cumulative prospect theory and other
rank-dependent utility models (Quiggin, 1982) and configural weighting models (Weber,
Anderson, and Birnbaum, 1992) depart from models like EU and OPT by arguing that the
attention (weight) given to an outcome “depends not only on the probability of the outcome
but also on the favorability of the outcome in comparison to the other possible outcomes”
of the gamble (p. 284, Diecidue and Wakker, 2001). Thus, the valuation of each outcome
of a gamble is no longer a completely separable process.

1.2. A test of OPT vs. CPT
Fennema and Wakker (1997) point out that cumulative prospect theory makes some different empirical predictions in the case of multiple outcome gambles when compared to
original prospect theory. In particular, they argue that original prospect theory (OPT) and
cumulative prospect theory (CPT) make different predictions for how people will respond
to an opportunity to improve a prospect by moving probability mass from a poorer outcome
to a better outcome. To illustrate, consider the following gamble, originally developed by
Lopes (1993) and discussed by Fennema and Wakker in their experiment 2: The seven
possible outcomes of the gamble are to be determined by the draw of one of twenty-one
lottery tickets. If tickets numbered 1, 2, or 3 are drawn, one loses $300; if tickets 4, 5, or
6 are drawn, one loses $200; and so forth up to a gain of $300 if tickets 19, 20, or 21 are
drawn. In other words, the outcomes and associated probabilities in terms of the number of
possible tickets are (−$300, 3 of 21; −$200, 3 of 21; −$100, 3 of 21; $0, 3 of 21; $100,

<-----Page 3----->8

PAYNE

3 of 21; $200, 3 of 21; $300, 3 of 21). Now imagine that you have the opportunity of moving
one ticket (1 of 21) from any lower outcome to an adjacent higher outcome. A change of
the highest outcome was not included, so six changes are possible. Which move would
you prefer to make? Subjects were presented with all 15 possible pairs of such moves and
asked to indicate which move of the two they would prefer. Fennema and Wakker point out
that OPT predicts that more subjects will prefer moving the middle outcomes than moving
the extreme outcomes given the assumed shape of the value function. For instance, the
diminishing sensitivity of the loss value function implies that the −100 move is preferred
to the −200 move which is preferred to the −300 move. For gain outcomes, the implication
of OPT’s value function is that the 0 move is most preferred and the extreme move from
200 to 300 is least preferred.
In contrast, the weighting function of CPT predicts that extreme-outcome moves will be
preferred. Since the cumulative form of prospect theory leads to greater decision weight for
equivalent probabilities if they are associated with the extreme outcomes, this implies that
moving probability mass from the −300 outcome to the −200 outcome and from the 200
outcome to the 300 outcome will be most attractive. However, given that CPT incorporates
both the value function of OPT as well as the new form of the weighting function, the
predictions of CPT will depend on the relative curvature of the two functions. Fennema and
Wakker argue that for the small amounts involved it is likely that the effects of the weighting
function will be stronger.
The results presented by Fennema and Wakker (1997) favor CPT rather than OPT. The
majority of subjects preferred the extreme-outcome moves for both gains and losses, thereby
supporting both the need to incorporate a weighting function based on cumulative probability differences and the assumption that for small to moderate amounts the weighting
function properties would have a stronger impact on preferences.
The manipulation in Fennema and Wakker involved changes in the probabilities of the
outcomes and thus draws attention to those probabilities. What happens when the opportunity to improve a prospect is provided by a manipulation that adds value to one outcome
versus another outcome? A manipulation that adds value to one outcome versus another
outcome is likely to make the gain versus loss distinction of prospect theory more salient.
The focus of our studies, however, is on the more specific question of what happens when
the opportunity to add value to one outcome versus another outcome changes the overall
probability of a gain or the overall probability of a loss.
1.3. Prior tests of adding value to outcomes
The effects on risky choice behavior of adding value to outcomes have been studied several
times over the past decades, e.g., a series of experiments by Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum
(1980, 1981) and by Lopes and Oden (1999). In the Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum studies,
choice was studied when both gambles in a pair were translated (shifted) by adding constants
(positive and negative) to all outcomes (a related procedure was used by Lopes and Oden).
For example, a typical choice was between the following two gambles: G1 = (−$85, .4;
−$30, .1; $14, .5) and G2 = (−$45, .2; −$30, .5; −$20, .3). Note that in this pair of gambles,
gamble G2 is not a mixed gamble. In such a case, most people prefer G1. That is, people

<-----Page 4----->IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

9

avoided the gamble (G2) that had no probability of a gain. Now add $60 to all outcomes,
yielding the two translated gambles G1’ = (−$25, .4; $30, .1; $74, .5) and G2’ = ($15, .2;
$30, .5; $40, .3). In this case, gamble G2’ is not a mixed gamble. The responses shifted
towards being strongly in favor of G2,’ the option that had no probability of a loss.
More recently, Lopes and Oden (1999) found that adding a constant to all the outcomes
of a pair of lotteries shifted preferences because the new gambles within a pair had only
positive outcomes. In particular, people were willing to take greater risks when all the
outcomes were positive. Thus, Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (1980, 1981) and Lopes and
Oden (1999) suggest the need to include the probability of a gain or a loss in models of
risky choice for multi-outcome gambles.
To summarize, cumulative prospect theory is an impressive intellectual achievement that
clearly fits some data, e.g., those of Lopes (1993) and Fennema and Wakker (1997), better than original prospect theory. CPT also provides reasons for some degree of both risk
aversion and risk seeking in both the domain of gains and the domain of losses, which
has been observed. However, although it may be mathematically straightforward to extend prospect theory and other forms of expectation theories to more complex gambles
with multiple outcomes by simply extending the summation operation to include all possible outcomes, such an extension misses an important psychological concept, namely the
overall probability of winning (receiving any gain outcome) and the overall probability
of losing (experiencing any loss outcome) offered by a gamble. With two or more outcomes above and below a referent outcome, the overall probability of a loss is given by
p(x1 ) + · · · + p(x j ) for values of x j < r = the referent outcome, and the overall probability
of a gain is given by p(xk ) + · · · + p(xn ) for values of xk ≥ r . Over several decades, studies
by Payne, Laughhunn, and Crum (1980, 1981), Lopes and Oden (1999), and Langer and
Weber (2001), among others, provide some evidence for the need to incorporate the overall
probabilities of a gain or a loss into models of risky choice for multi-outcome gambles. The
studies reported in this paper extend previous work by adding value to outcomes for pairs
of complex, mixed, gambles.
The first study reported below investigates where people prefer to add value to an outcome
when they can only add value to one outcome of a multi-outcome gamble. As we argue
below this task provides a way to examine the importance of the overall probability of a
gain or the overall probability of a loss on risky choice behavior, and a way to distinguish
among different expectation models of risky choice under various assumptions about the
form of the value function and the form of the probability-weighting function.
2. Study 1
2.1. Method
2.1.1. Stimuli. The gambles used in the present study involve five outcomes, with at least
two of the outcomes being gains and two of the outcomes being losses. Thus, the weighting
function for the gains and the weighting function for the losses will clearly differ depending
on whether the function is assessed on a cumulative basis (CPT) or separately for each
outcome (OPT).

To illustrate, imagine that you own a five-outcome gamble with the following payoffs
and probabilities: ($100, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). How attractive would
you find that gamble if you had to play it for real money? Now imagine that I tell you that
you can change the gamble above in one of two ways. You can add $38 to the outcome that
pays $100 or you can add $38 to the outcome that pays $0. That is, you can have either one
of the two new gambles: ($138, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20) or ($100, .20;
$50, .20; $38, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). Where would you add the $38? That is, which
of the two new gambles would you prefer if you had to play one of the two new gambles?
Notice that with an addition of value to the $0 outcome, you also change the probability of
winning some positive amount of money from .40 to .60 without creating the opportunity
for a sure gain.
Now consider the same base gamble ($100, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20),
and imagine that you can change the gamble above in one of two different ways. You can
add $38 to the outcome that pays $100 or you can add $38 to the outcome that pays $50.
That is, you can have either one of the two new gambles: ($138, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$25,
.20; −$50, .20) or ($100, .20; $88, .20; $0, .20; −$25, .20; −$50, .20). Where would you
add the $38? That is, which of the two new gambles would you prefer if you had to play
one of the two new gambles? While the change from $50 to $88 might be more attractive
than a change from $100 to $138 in the sense of diminishing marginal value, the proposed
change does not change the overall probability of a positive outcome.
Now turn to a slightly less attractive gamble, again a mixed gamble with five distinct
outcomes. Consider that you own the gamble with the following payoffs and probabilities:
($100, .20; $50, .20; −$15, .20; −$40, .20; −$65, .20). How attractive would you find that
gamble? Imagine that I tell you that you can change this gamble in one of two ways. You
can add $15 to the outcome where you lose $65 or you can $15 to the outcome where you
lose $15. That is, you can have either one of the two new gambles: ($100, .20; $50, .20;
−$15, .20; −$40, .20; −$50, .20) or ($100, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; −$40, .20; −$65, .20).
Where would you add the $15? Notice that in this case the probability of a loss remains at
.60 in the first case and moves from .60 to .40 in the second case.
Lastly, imagine that you own the same base gamble ($100, .20; $50, .20; −$15, .20; −$40,
.20; −$65, .20) and can add $15 to either the worst outcome (−$65) or the intermediate
loss outcome (−$40). Where would you add the $15? While the change from a loss of $65
to a loss of $50 might be more attractive than a change from a loss of $40 to a loss of $25 in
terms of more weight placed on extreme outcomes, the proposed change does not change
the overall probability of a positive outcome.
In general, classic EU theory, with the assumption of a concave (risk averse) utility
function everywhere, suggests that you would add to the lower valued outcome in either
the gain or loss domain. OPT suggests that you would add to the intermediate ($0 or
−$15) outcomes. CPT suggests that you would add value to the most extreme outcome
(worst, −$65, or best, $100) given the parameters for the weighting and value functions
reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). More generally, this prediction for CPT will
be true as long as the curvature of the weight function is greater than the curvature of
the value function.3 Thus, EU, OPT, and CPT make unique predictions across the gain
and loss domains assuming commonly used parameter values. Whatever the shapes of the

<-----Page 6----->IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

11

value function and the weighting function, however, the hypothesized importance of overall
probability of a gain or the overall probability of a loss suggests that any change moving
a zero outcome to a gain or a negative outcome to a zero outcome will be particularly
attractive.
2.1.2. Subjects. The 375 respondents were a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students from Duke University and the University of Pennsylvania who were compensated for
their participation in the study. However, there was no compensation directly tied to their
choices. The design was between subjects, with the respondents randomly assigned to one
of four conditions (groups) described in more detail below.
2.1.3. Procedure. First each subject was presented with a single risky option and asked to
rate that option on a scale ranging from −10 (an extremely unattractive gamble) to +10 (an
extremely attractive gamble) in terms of how attractive the prospect of playing the gamble
for real was to the respondent. Scale values of −3, −2, and −1, and of 1, 2, and 3 were
labeled “slightly unattractive” and “slightly attractive” respectively. The purpose of this
procedure was simply to ensure that the respondent would have thought about the base
gamble when they were asked to consider how to change the gamble. The respondent then
turned to the next page in the survey and read that he or she had the opportunity to change
the previous gamble in one of two ways.
For one group of respondents this involved a gain base gamble with the following five
outcomes: $100, $50, $0, −$25, −$50, each outcome having an equal probability of .20.
Respondents in group 1 then had a choice between adding $38 to the outcome that was a
win of $100 or adding $38 to the outcome that was a neither a win nor a loss ($0). The
two modified gambles were shown to the respondent on the page and he or she was asked
which gamble he or she would prefer to play. Respondents were told that there is no right or
wrong answer and that the experimenter was interested only in their opinion about which
gamble of the pair they would prefer to play if they had to play one of the two gambles for
real money. Thus, the basic response of interest was a single choice between two gambles.
The order of the gambles within a pair on the page was counterbalanced across subjects. A
second group of respondents did a similar task except that the addition of a value of $38 was
either to the $100 outcome or the $50 outcome (group 2, same base gamble as group 1).
The base gamble for groups 3 and 4 differed in from that in groups 1 and 2 in that the
five outcomes were $100, $50, −$15, −$40, and −$65, and therefore this loss base gamble
was stochastically dominated by the first base gamble. Groups 3 and 4 did tasks with the
addition of a value of $15 to either the −$65 outcome or the −$15 outcome (group 3); or
the addition of a value of $15 to either the −$65 outcome or the −$40 outcome (group 4).
2.2. Results
2.2.1. Ratings of the base gambles. First, since the subjects provided a rating of either
the gain or loss base gamble, it is possible to examine whether the principle of stochastic
dominance was supported across subjects. The mean rating for the gamble with zero as the
middle outcome (the stochastically dominating alternative) was 2.78 (n = 217) on a −10 to

<-----Page 7----->12

PAYNE

+10 scale. The mean rating for the gamble with a −$15 middle outcome (the dominated
gamble) was .78 (n = 161), a significant difference (t = 4.04, p < .01). The percentage of
positive ratings for the gain gamble was 77%. The percentage of positive ratings for the
loss gamble was 59%. The fact that the percentage of positive ratings and the overall rating
for the stochastically dominated gamble was below the rating for the dominating gamble
is reassuring. This difference in ratings for the two base gambles suggests that the subjects
exhibited at least some care when they answered the questions.
2.2.2. Choice of where to add value. Figure 1 provides a summary of the results on
where people prefer to add value. The values in the four cells of Figure 1 for each of the
four groups of respondents are the proportion of choices in each pair of gambles of the
gamble that should have been preferred under the assumptions of CPT and the parameters
for the weighting and value functions reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1992). Also
reported in each cell in Figure 1 are the numbers of respondents for each condition (groups
1, 2, 3, and 4).
Consider the cell in the upper left hand corner, reflecting the responses of group 1. When
asked whether they preferred the gamble where $38 was added to the $100 outcome or
the gamble where $38 was added to the $0 outcome, the clear majority of the respondents
indicated the latter. Only 32% of the 105 respondents preferred the gamble consistent
with Cumulative Prospect Theory. Similarly, when respondents in group 3 were asked
whether they preferred the gamble where $15 was added to the loss of $65 outcome or
the gamble where the $15 was added to the loss of $15 outcome (the lower left hand
corner of Figure 1), the clear majority indicated the latter. That is, only 33% of the 92
respondents in this condition chose consistent with CPT. Both choice proportions (32% and
33%) are significantly different from .50 ( p < .01, binomial test). This pattern of responses
is also not consistent with the EU model under the assumption that the utility function is

<-----Page 8----->IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

13

concave everywhere. Neither is the pattern of results consistent with the EU model under the
alternative assumption of a convex utility function for gains and a concave utility function
for losses. On the other hand, the pattern of responses is consistent with Original Prospect
Theory.
Now consider the cells on the right-hand side of Figure 1 for groups 2 and 4. Cumulative
Prospect Theory predicts a clear preference for adding value to the outcome that is the
extreme gain or the extreme loss. The choice proportions are close to .50 in both cases.
Although both Original Prospect Theory and the Expected Utility model, with the assumption of a concave utility function, make slightly different predictions in these two cases,
both theories predict preferences that are much closer to indifferent, which is basically
what was observed. The value differences between the gambles according to Cumulative
prospect theory are actually slightly greater in the case of the choices facing groups 2 and
4 as compared to the other two groups of respondents. However, the deviations from CPT
implied by the choices in the cells on the right-hand side of Figure 1 for groups 2 and 4 are
weaker and harder to interpret statistically.
A Chi-square test of likelihood of choosing the gamble consistent with the predictions
of CPT (the more extreme outcome improvement) shows that the pattern of responses was
significantly different if the addition of value was to an outcome at or near a reference value
of $0 as compared to when it was either a more moderate strict gain or a more moderate
strict loss outcome (χ 2 = 12.76, p < .01). Adding a value to one gamble in such as way as
to either increase the probability of a strict gain from .40 to .60 or to decrease the probability
of a strict loss from .60 to .40 seems to have been attractive to the respondents in groups 1
and 3. Adding values to outcomes in such a way as not to impact the overall probabilities
of a strict gain or a strict loss was not as meaningful to the respondents in groups 2 and 4.
Finally, there was no indication that it mattered whether one was dealing with adding to
a gain outcome or adding to a loss outcome. A Chi-square test of the likelihood of choosing
a gamble consistent with the predictions of CPT showed no significant difference for gains
versus losses (χ 2 = .21).
To summarize, the results from this study clearly support the importance of adding value
to outcomes in such a way as to impact the overall probabilities of a strict gain or a strict
loss. The next study investigates whether the results from study 1 generalize to complex
gambles that do not involve the same probabilities for all five outcomes. Another question
is whether people will still prefer to add value to one gamble in such as way as to decrease
the overall probability of a strict loss even when there is a cost to such behavior in terms of
loss of expected value.
3. Study 2
3.1. Method
3.1.1. Stimuli. The gambles used involved five outcomes, with at least two of the outcomes
being gains and two of the outcomes being losses. Thus, the weighting function for the gains
and the weighting function for the losses will again clearly differ depending on whether the
function is assessed on a cumulative basis (CPT) or separately for each outcome (OPT).

The first gamble presented to the subjects in this study was similar to that used in study 1.
That is, subjects were presented with the following gamble and asked to rate it on a scale
ranging from −10 (an extremely unattractive gamble) to +10 (an extremely attractive
gamble) in terms of how attractive the prospect of playing the gamble for real was to the
respondent. The payoff and probability values the five outcomes in the base gamble were
as follows: ($85, .30; $65, .05; −$25, .25; −$55, .15; −$90, .25). Subjects were then asked
where they would prefer to add $25 if they could add that amount to one and only one of
two possible outcomes. The choice presented to the subjects was to add $25 to the −$90
outcome or to add $25 to the −$25 outcome. Note that in this first task both outcomes
have the same probabilities (.25) even through the other three outcomes have different
probabilities. Thus, the subjects were asked to choose between the following two gambles:
G1 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; −$25, .25; −$55, .15; −$65, .25), or G2 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; $0,
.25; −$55, .15; −$90, .25). The focus was on changes in value in the loss domain since that
is where the differences between CPT, OPT, and EU theory are likely to be the greatest. For
instance, given the parameters for the weighting and value functions reported by Tversky
and Kahneman (1992), CPT suggests that you would add value to the most extreme bad
outcome (changing a loss of $90 to a loss of $65). EU theory with the assumption of a
concave utility function everywhere would also predict a preference for adding $25 to the
more extreme −$90 outcome. On the other hand, adding $25 to the least bad outcome
changes the overall probability of losing from .65 to .40. A preference for gamble G2 also
would be a response more consistent with OPT.
The second task used in this study was a simple choice between the following two
gambles: G3 = ($90, .10; $70, .25; −$20, .20; −$30, .30, −$80, .15) and G4 = ($90, .10;
$70, .25; $0, .20; −$50, .30; −$80, .15). Note that with gamble G3 you have an intermediate
loss outcome that is $20 better than the same outcome for gamble G4, and the probabilities
of those two intermediate outcomes for gambles G3 and G4 are both .30. The expected
value of G3 is $1.50. With gamble G4 you reduce the middle outcome to $0 and thus the
overall probability of a strict loss from .65 to .45. However, since the probabilities of the
middle outcomes for both gambles are only .20, you are giving up $2 in expected value if
you select gamble G4 over G3. The expected value of G4 is −$.50. Given the parameters
for the weighting and value functions reported by Tversky and Kahneman (1992), CPT
suggests that you would prefer the added value be associated with the more probable, and
more extreme bad outcome (changing a loss of $50 to a loss of $30), i.e., G3. A concern with
the overall probability of a loss, on the other hand, suggests a preference for gamble G4.
3.1.2. Subjects. The 151 respondents were a mixture of undergraduate and graduate students from Duke University who were compensated for their participation in the study. All
subjects responded to both of the choice problems described above.
3.1.3. Procedure. The task for the subjects or respondents was again very simple. For
the added value task that was similar to the task used in study 1 (choice between gamble
G1 and G2), the procedure was essentially the same. For the problem involving choice
between gambles G3 and G4, the procedure differed slightly in that the subjects were not
first presented with a single risky option and asked to rate that option on a scale. Instead,
the task presented to subjects involving gambles G3 and G4 was a simple choice between

<-----Page 10----->IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

15

two options. This was done to see if a similar pattern of results would be found using a
procedure that is more like that used in the many previous studies of risky choice behavior.
The position of the gambles in a pair of gambles representing a particular choice problem
was counterbalanced across subjects.

3.2. Results
First consider the responses to the adding value task that was most similar to that used in
study 1. When asked to choose where they would prefer to add value, a significant majority
of the respondents (59%, N = 151, p < .05, binomial test) preferred to add value to the
middle outcome near the likely reference value of neither winning nor losing ($0).4 That is,
gamble G2 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; $0, .25; −$55, .15; −$90, .25), was preferred to gamble
G1 = ($85, .30; $65, .05; −$25, .25; −$55, .15; −$65, .25). This pattern of choice is similar
to that reported for the task in study 1 where the probabilities for all the outcomes of the
gamble were equal. Adding a value to one gamble in such as way as to decrease the overall
probability of a strict loss from .65 to .40 seems to have been preferred to adding the same
value to the more extreme bad outcome with an equal probability of occurrence.
Next, consider the responses to gambles G3 and G4. A strong majority of the subjects
(71%, N = 147, p < .01, binomial test) preferred gamble G4 over gamble G3. That is,
subjects preferred the gamble (G4) with a middle outcome of $0, and thus lowering the
overall probability of a strict loss from .65 to .45. Gamble G3, on the other hand, was not
preferred even though it had the higher expected value and the higher payoff on both the
more probable and the more extreme bad outcome.
4. Discussion
Overall, the results from both studies clearly indicated that respondents were highly sensitive
to changes in outcome values that either increased the overall probability of a strict gain or
decreased the overall probability of a strict loss. The simple test of EU, OPT, and CPT that
is offered by giving a respondent a choice of where to add value to one of two outcomes
indicated more support for OPT than CPT and EU, under various assumptions about the
shape of the utility and value and weighting functions. However, it is clear that the main
difference between the various expectation models of risky choice occurs for outcomes near
the reference value.
As noted earlier, Fennema and Wakker (1997) concluded that their data favored cumulative prospect theory over original prospect theory. Why the difference between those results
and the current results? As suggested earlier, the answer may be found in terms of a procedural difference between the two studies. Fennema and Wakker’s (1997) experiments
involved moving probability mass from one outcome to another outcome. It is likely that
the Fennema and Wakker procedure focused attention on probabilities. Thus, any preference for making the probabilities of the extreme outcomes better might have been salient.
In contrast, the present experiment involved adding value to one outcome or another. This
procedure may have focused attention more on the payoffs and their associated values,

<-----Page 11----->16

PAYNE

particularly whether the outcomes were gains versus losses. However, while there are clear
differences between the results of Fennema and Wakker (1997) and the present results, it is
worth noting that the present results are consistent with the findings Fennema and Wakker
report (see their notes 4 and 5) that the preference for shifting probability mass from the
more extreme outcome was noticeably less when there was an opportunity to lower the
overall probability of a loss or increase the overall probability of a gain. Also, the results
reported in the present study 2 showed that sensitivity to the overall probability of losing can
be found where the probabilities of the outcomes of a gamble are different, and therefore
more likely to be salient. In addition, the results of study 2 indicated a willingness to give up
some expected value (and Cumulative Prospect Theory value) in order to lower the overall
probability of a strict loss. Thus, the present results and the results reported by Fennema
and Wakker both point to the importance of the overall probability of a gain or a loss on
risky preferences.

4.1. The zero or reference outcome
It is clear from the present results and those of other researchers that the distinction between
a strict gain and a strict loss is important. What is less clear is what to do about a reference
outcome that is neither a strict gain nor a strict loss. A reviewer of this paper argued that
because the value function in CPT assigns 0 to the reference outcome, it does not matter what
weight is attached to the reference outcome. On the other hand, Luce and Weber (1986) have
proposed a model of perceived risk that distinguishes between the probability of breaking
even, the probability of a positive outcome, and the probability of a negative outcome. In
addition, Lopes and Oden (1999) report findings that suggest people distinguish between a
zero outcome and a strict gain. Weber, Anderson, and Birnbaum (1992) also suggest that
people treat zero outcomes as distinct. However, more study is needed to determine when,
and how, a zero outcome might impact the assessed overall odds of winning or losing.

4.2. Implications for model building
In terms of models of risky choice, the present results are most consistent with SP/A theory
(Lopes and Oden, 1999). A key concept in that theory is the probability of achieving an
aspiration level if a particular option is chosen. That overall probability of a “gain” is coupled
with a dual-criteria decision rule that incorporates a weighted value component (denoted
SP for a balancing of security (fear) with potential (greed)) with a probability of achieving
an aspiration level component (denoted A). One might also be able to incorporate the
importance of the overall probabilities of a gain or a loss into contingent weighting models
such as rank-dependent or configural weight models (Weber, Anderson, and Birnbaum,
1992), although this does not seem straightforward. In particular, the present results suggest
that effect of the rank order preference of outcomes on decision weights is not clear cut.
It is not the case that the lowest ranked outcome is given the greatest weight nor is it the
case that the most extreme ranked outcome is given the greatest weight, particularly when
outcomes are near the reference value. At a more general level, the present results provide

<-----Page 12----->IT IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE

17

another set of findings suggesting that the valuation of gambles is not a separable process
for each branch of the decision tree. Beyond rank order of outcome effects, people do seem
sensitive to the combined probabilities of a gain or a loss.

4.3. Limits and directions for future research
Given the multiple studies of risky choice behavior that have been undertaken over the
past five decades, any single set of experiments such as the present one is limited simply
because it is not possible in any single set of experiments to cover all the factors that
have been shown to influence risky choice behavior. For example, one obvious question is
whether or not the effects shown in the present study would persist in the face of substantial
incentives. While providing positive payoffs is fairly straightforward, allowing subjects
to lose money is more difficult. In addition, a review of the literature on incentives by
Camerer and Hogarth (1999) suggests that for relatively easy decisions like those studied
in the present studies, real incentives are not very important. Nonetheless, repeating this
experiment with the opportunity for “real” gains and losses is clearly one direction for
future research. Another area for future research is whether the extremity focus captured
by models such as CPT increases with the number of outcomes defining a multi-outcome
mixed gamble. A hypothesis consistent with the general notion of limited attention capacity
is that the fit of CPT compared to OPT and EU will increase as the number of outcomes is
increased, particularly when adding value to intermediate versus extreme outcomes without
changing the overall probabilities of a gain or a loss.
5. Conclusion
Much research on risky decision behavior has focused on the simplest types of “pure” risky
choice options of the form ($x, p, 0), where with probability p one receives $x > 0 (a gain)
or $x < 0 (a loss) or with probability 1 – p one receives 0 or on simple mixed gambles of
the form ($x, p, −$y). Obviously, with just one non-zero gain or loss outcome there is no
distinction to be drawn between the probability of an outcome (gain or loss) and the overall
probabilities of gain or loss outcomes.
Although responses to simple gambles provide insights (see Fox and See, 2003, for
a recent review) it is becoming clear that descriptively the extension from the simplest
gambles to even slightly more complex types of gambles is not straightforward. This is
unfortunate in that many (most?) real world decisions under risk involve gambles that are
likely to be mixed and to involve three or more non-zero outcomes. With multi-outcome
and mixed gambles, e.g., (−$x1 , p1 ; −$x2 p2 ; $x3 = 0, p3 ; $x4 , p4 ; $x5 , p5 ), the present
research demonstrates that people are highly sensitive to the combined probabilities of
winning (e.g., p4 + p5 ) and the combined probabilities of a loss (e.g., p1 + p2 ).
Clearly there is a value in investigating gambles that are no more complex than necessary to capture key psychological mechanisms; however, simple two outcome gambles
that are either purely gains or losses may not be complex enough, as Lopes (1995) has
strongly argued. Gambles involving four or five-outcomes with at least two outcomes that

<-----Page 13----->18

PAYNE

are preferred to a reference value and at least two outcomes that are not preferred to a
reference value are still relatively simple while allowing for more direct tests of models.
With five-outcome gambles, the fifth outcome can be at the reference value. The increased
use of mixed multi-outcome gambles in studies of risky choice behavior may bring our
descriptive theories for such choices more in line with human behavior in realistic decision
problems involving risk and uncertainty.

Notes
1. The proceeding provides a “process” story for risky choice behavior. Luce (2000), among others, has argued
that the expected utility model and its many variants are simply mathematical representations for observed
decisions that imply nothing about how the decision was made. However, one can make predictions from the
EU model about how choice will or will not change as a function of changes in the probabilities or payoffs
of the gambles in a decision set.
2. Recently, Levy and Levy (2002) argue for a utility or value function that is also based on changes in wealth
and is risk averse (concave) for losses and risk seeking (convex) for gains.
3. More specifically, this is true as long as the relationship π (xn )/(π (xn−1 + xn ) − π (xn )) is greater than
(V (xn−1 + a) − V (xn−1 ))/(V (xn + a) − V (xn )) holds for a positive amount a and one is in the domain
of gains. Given the parameters for the weighting functions and value functions reported by Tversky and
Kahneman (1992), the π ratio is about 2.39 and the value ratio is about 1.07. A related condition holds for
the loss domain, where the π ratio is about 1.90 and the value ratio is about 1.07.
4. The number of subjects reported for each task differs slightly due to a few missing responses.
