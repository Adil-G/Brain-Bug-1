doors in 1891.He graduated with a de

his career in China, but he had to flee
that country during the Boxer Rebel
lion. By 1902, he was based in London
and practicing as a mining engineer
on an international scale. When World
War I broke out, he was still inLondon
and organized efforts to get stranded
Americans back home. He stayed on
to organize relief efforts, and accord
ing to one reporter, from 1914 to 1922
"he got money from governments and
charity, sailed his own fleetwhich flew

Here, in a mere 66 words, Hoover
captured the essence of engineering
and its contributions to society and
culture. Works of engineering, like all
creative works, do indeed begin in
the imagination, perhaps sparked by
some ineffable leap from the existing
universe of thoughts and things to
some new conception for a machine,

Visual artists also use science (in the
sense of knowledge)
in fleshing out
their ideas. They must know the nature
and durability of themedia inwhich
they plan to work. They must make
informed judgments about the scale
of their creation and must be aware of
precedent in the genre. There ismuch
more consciousness in art than in engi

following his celebration
of the profession's positive contribu

he acknowledged
that there is a dark
side also:
The great liability of the engineer
compared tomen of other profes

the open where all can see them.
His acts, step by step, are in hard
substance. He cannot bury his
mistakes in the grave like doctors.
He cannot argue them into thin
air or blame the judge like the
lawyers. He cannot, like the archi
tects, cover his failures with trees
and vines. He cannot, like the
politicians, screen his shortcom
ings by blaming his opponents
and hope that the people will for

deny that he did it. If his works
do not work, he is damned. That
is thephantasmagoria thathaunts
his nights and dogs his days. He

as people walk, theymove sideways
as well as up and down and forward.
This lateralmotion is evident in those
who proceed with a swagger, slither or
sway to their step, and the engineer is
responsible forgeneralizing from such
exaggerations to the cumulative effect

of a tangle of tourists wending
way across the bridge. Unfortunately,
as haunting as the thought can be that
something has been overlooked in cal
culations, engineers relying on science
and experience to turn a figment of
their or another's imagination into a
plan on paper cannot always see the
reality behind the phantasmagoria.
Indeed, the engineer may even dis
miss in themorning as silly the note

The engineer is damned ifhe does
and damned ifhe doesn't. Charles El

again and again the forces in the tow

of the project, was impatient to finalize

and the engineer with themost expe

design.
Moisseiff did not think Ellis needed
to calculate it again, and so Ellis was
sent packing by Strauss. The design of
the bridge's towers was tested on scale
models, and construction proceeded.
The Golden Gate has, of course,
been an enormously successful bridge
by most aesthetic and functional cri

bridge design was not to do so. Even if
Ellis had expressed a desire to do so, it
is unlikely thatMoisseiff and Strauss
would have gone along with addition
al calculations that, in theirmind, were
unnecessary.

It is easy to criticize engineering de
cisions or non-decisions after the fact,
especially if that fact is the collapse
of a structure "out in the open where
all can see." That iswhat happened to
the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, of course.
At first, its roadway moved and un
dulated in thewind in a manner not
unlike that of the Golden Gate and
other long-span suspension bridges
built in the late 1930s. Since a number
of such structures were acting simi
larly but none was actually collapsing,
therewas a sense of concern but not of
urgency. Like its sister structures, the
Tacoma Narrows was retrofittedwith
cables and guys to check itsmotion,
but there was no general agreement
about the root cause of themotion or
the means by which to eliminate it.
About fourmonths after itwas com
pleted, the bridge began tomove in
a new way, and the twisting action
caused the roadway to break up and
fall into the water. Only then did in
vestigations of the devastating effects
of thewind begin in earnest.
An early design for a bridge across
the Tacoma Narrows had been pro
duced byWashington state transporta
tion engineers, and Moisseiff had been
called in as a consultant on it.He criti
cized the original state design on sev
eral grounds, including the fact that its
roadway was not level and the struc
turewas lacking in aesthetic appeal.
He directed its redesign along what
he considered to be more aesthetically
