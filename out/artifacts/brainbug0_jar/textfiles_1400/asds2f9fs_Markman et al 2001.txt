Abstract
We challenge the implicit assumption that entrepreneurs are the sole owners of their young firms
and we suggest that because cutting-edge innovation projects are complex, they create substantial
information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and their investors. Linking previous research on
governance, entrepreneurship, and innovation, we ask what forms of governance and incentive
systems are conducive to spur and implement innovation among young entrepreneurial firms. Using
agency theory and building on the rich literature on governance, we make eight practical suggestions
regarding the governance of young entrepreneurial firms. We suggest that early and effective
governance systems may help entrepreneurs and investors work in alignment with each other’s best
interests. D 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

dominant drivers of competition and strategic advantage, the burgeoning of information and
communication technologies and the globalization of industries have blurred industry
confines and made competitive innovation extremely challenging to assess and govern
(Prahalad & Hamel, 1994). For example, television, telecommunications, and utility companies are blending into one mega-industry (Hitt, Keats, & DeMarie, 1998). Such trend is a
reality among many software firms who provide financial services, airline companies who
sell mutual funds and mortgage services, automobile makers who become retail outlets for
insurance and financing, and toy manufacturers who now compete also in the aerospace
industry with decoy radio-controlled miniature aircraft. As industry boundaries and the
competitive landscape continue to evolve, they intensify uncertainty, ambiguity, and strategic
discontinuities. From a governance perspective, management of innovation projects under
such dynamism is highly complex and uncertain.
In this paper, we examine the relationship between corporate governance and the process
of innovation in entrepreneurial firms with a focus on those in the high technology industry.
While the formation of a well specified corporate governance system is usually given
greater consideration after the occurrence of a major company milestone, such as an initial
public offering (IPO), to represent the interests of diverse shareholders (Monks & Minow,
1996), we contend that in younger, privately held firms prior to going public, effective
corporate governance procedures can add value to innovation projects and their outcomes.
By utilizing appropriate governance systems in an entrepreneurial firm, in terms of the
procedures, size, and quality of membership of the board of directors, as well as the
application of incentive systems, innovation projects should have a greater likelihood of
achieving their desired results.
Research on new business formation defines entrepreneurship as the process by which
new organizations come into existence (Gartner, Carland, Hoy, & Carland, 1988).
Consistent with this filed, we define entrepreneurial firms as new start-up businesses
formed by one or by a group of founding entrepreneurs. We suggest that, due to their
young age and limited resources, to succeed at creating value, entrepreneurial firms must
out-innovate their competitor and vie effectively against diverse rivals including mature
and resourceful companies. Innovation is most critical to achieving a competitive
advantage if the entrepreneurship is developing a high technology product or service.
It must quickly establish legitimacy, create synergistic alliances, excel in quality at low
cost, and satisfy increasingly diverse, yet informed, customers with distinct needs.
Although many entrepreneurial firms develop unique and what appears to be promising
products, in the long run it is firms that repeatedly exceed customers needs and that
allocate their developmental resources effectively that succeed. To survive and thrive,
entrepreneurial firms must have high completion rates of new products that meet not
only their budget constraints and sales objectives, but their scheduled timeline as well
(Schilling & Hill, 1998).
Unfortunately, research on both innovation and entrepreneurship take a multitude of
forms; the literature on innovation and entrepreneurship is fragmented, there is limited
integration, and cumulative knowledge is less than its parts (Damanpour, 1991). Hence, our
discussion of governance of entrepreneurial firms focuses on the growth stage of the

<-----Page 2----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

275

organization life cycle — prior to IPO and in which governance structure is rapidly
changing (Kanzanjian, 1988). The growth stage of the organizational life cycle is of
particular interest since it is closely related to the act of entering new or established markets
(Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). At this stage, firms are involved in building their foundation,
which includes formalizing the organization, searching for additional capital and allies, and
developing a product or service. Many firms during the period of interest are approximately
7 years old and are experiencing rapid growth with concrete plans for an IPO. Our
discussion also centers on entrepreneurship in high technology industries where the process
of innovation is critical to achieving competitive advantage.
If competitive advantage is a function of valuable, scarce, and difficult-to-imitate
innovation projects (Barney, 1991), the critical question we examine is what forms of
governance and incentive systems are best suited to spur and implement successful
innovation projects among entrepreneurial firms? To answer this question, we review the
literature on innovation management. Recognizing that not all innovation projects lead to
successful products or services, we argue that two striking features of many innovation
projects — successful or not — is information complexity and asymmetry. The more ground
breaking the innovation efforts firms undertake, the greater the information asymmetry that
are formed between entrepreneurs and their investors. We also assume that since many
entrepreneurs — particularly during the growth stage and after capital infusion — own only a
small share of their firm, it is theoretically misleading to infer that they are the only owners of
their young firms or that agency conflicts are negligible.
Section 1.1 commences with a discussion on information asymmetry commonly observed
between entrepreneurs and their investors. We then discuss the peculiar relationships between
innovation, complexity, and information asymmetry as they relate to entrepreneurship.
Finally, we review the governance literature and outline rationales for eight implications
regarding the governance of entrepreneurial firms.
1.1. Entrepreneurial innovation and information asymmetry
The notion of information asymmetry between entrepreneurs and their investors is not new
(cf. Cable & Shane, 1997). Entrepreneurs have unique knowledge concerning opportunities
and about combining intangible and tangible resources to exploit these opportunities in a
novel fashion (Kirzner, 1997). They also have private knowledge about the day-to-day work
of their business activities and better information about the future technology. Investors, on
the other hand, have access to capital, pertinent connection to potential customers and
suppliers, and can establish venture credibility and legitimacy. This suggests that the
management of information and knowledge asymmetries may play an influential role in
whether investors provide entrepreneurs with the necessary capital to continue building their
new ventures.
The success of new ventures hinges not only on entrepreneurs’ ability to discover, develop,
produce, and sell their innovation, but also on their aptitude to harness investors’ support.
Despite the fact that cooperation and information symmetry between entrepreneurs and
investors seem desirable, parties to a venture frequently act uncooperatively. Asymmetric

<-----Page 3----->276

information and diverging perceptions thereof lead entrepreneurs and others who deal with
them to make different judgments about the venture’s present and future objectives and
asymmetric expectations may create and exacerbate future conflicts such as during additional
rounds of money-raising initiatives. This is so since stakeholders make decisions based on
imperfect information regarding future estimates of the venture’s probability of success
(Cable & Shane, 1997). We therefore suggest that building entrepreneurial ventures require
entrepreneurs and investors to work very closely with each other, to share knowledge, and to
reduce information dissonance.
Notwithstanding that in order to adequately evaluate a venture’s growth potential and
probability of success, investors must have complete access to timely and accurate information,
many refuse to sign nondisclosure agreements. To protect themselves against careless or even
opportunistic investors, entrepreneurs react by withholding information about their discoveries.
Imperfect intellectual and property laws and the prospect of costly litigations further motivate
entrepreneurs to share some, but not all, pertinent technical details with their investors. Thus, as
suggested by Sapienza and Korsgaard (1996), entrepreneurs are goaded to obscure, conceal, or
even to manipulate information. This means that entrepreneurs — particularly when they seek
capital — try to strike a delicate balance between disclosing all knowledge about their
innovation and keeping key technological knowledge as asymmetric as possible.
Since capital investments are tied to technological projections of innovation initiatives
and entrepreneurs want to acquire as much funding as possible, they frequently manipulate
information; they overproject their venture’s future performance and underreport their
expected obstacles and competition. For example, entrepreneurs may not disclose bad
news about test marketing and product innovation obstacles. More importantly, poor
venture performance can shift ownership control away from entrepreneurs, bring in
professional management, and dilute the entrepreneurs’ ownership. Antidilution clauses
protect the investors; the cost of additional financing may be born by the entrepreneurs
when the new stocks are issued at a lower price (Cable & Shane, 1997). Similarly,
entrepreneurs’ behaviors also create further information asymmetry. Company cars, travel,
lodging, and meals that entrepreneurs may perceive as necessities, investors may view as
frivolous or misused. Finally, new ventures also demand a high degree of expertise,
dedication, and personal sacrifices, all of which put physical, emotional, and social tolls on
entrepreneurs and their families (Baron, 1998). Although entrepreneurs prefer their
ventures to succeed, many circumstances threaten entrepreneurs’ conscientiousness and
devotion to the ventures’ goals. Promises of dedication and achievement that were made in
earnest when securing capital may become obsolete when the venture demands priceless
personal sacrifices.
In sum, entrepreneurs and their investors may appraise a venture’s technological and
innovation potential differently. This suggests that there are many forces that impel
entrepreneurs to manipulate information and actively create knowledge asymmetry regarding
their technological discoveries. Yet, perception asymmetry — regardless whether true or not
— damages entrepreneur–investor relationships. As will become clear shortly, we suggest
that early governance considerations may mitigate some of the information asymmetry
problems typically incurred during innovation undertakings.

2. Innovation and complexity: an overview
This section describes the strong association between innovation and complexity. It
emphasizes that the more involved and ground breaking the innovation efforts firms
undertake, the greater the complexity and information asymmetry that are formed between
entrepreneurs and their stakeholders.
Innovation that links market and technological opportunities is central to entrepreneurship
(Drucker, 1985; Kirzner, 1997). Multidimensional in nature, innovation is the creation of
new products or processes that create value. The strategic importance of both product and
process innovation has long been known to have a strong influence on performance,
particularly, though clearly not exclusively, for entrepreneurial firms. Successful innovation
management is crucial for global competitiveness and has important national implications.
Franko (1989) had observed that in 1960, US firms held more than two-thirds of the world
market in 10 of the top 15 major industries. While in 1970, the US firms still dominated 9
of those 15 industries, by 1980 their domination was limited to only 3 (Franko, 1989). Since
high-performing firms also tended to invest more heavily on R&D, diminished industry
share is due to the fact that the US firms reduced their investments in innovation (Hitt,
Hoskisson, Ireland, & Harrison, 1991a, 1991b). Declined innovation may also be due to
managers’ disinclination to bear the costs and risks of uncertain long-term development of
product and process innovation (Hoskisson & Hitt, 1994). We concur, but we suspect that
implementation failure (e.g., failure of the governance system) — not only innovation
failure per se — also keeps firms from deriving adequate competitive benefits from their
product and process innovations.
High tech firms can introduce new products or services that embody novel technologies
and attain first-mover advantage when they effectively compress cycle times of various
innovation and production projects. In turn, first-mover advantage can be sustained when
firms harvest experience curve economies ahead of competitors, usurp scarce assets, create
switching costs to consumers, and build brand recognition and loyalty. It has been argued
elsewhere that brand loyalty is particularly important in industries characterized by rapid
technological innovation (Schilling & Hill, 1998). Early adopters, technology enthusiasts,
assume that a brand — in the absence of objective assessment of the technology — is a
surrogate for product quality and features. We suggest that despite brand-name recognition
and economies of scale, entrepreneurial firms can still compete effectively against larger and
more resourceful companies. For example, lean manufacturing techniques allow shorter
production runs and thus reduce the importance of economies of scale (Schilling & Hill,
1998). Similarly, Internet-banking has allowed a score of community banks to create global
presence and to compete rather effectively against national banks (Bowe, 1999).
Complexity and innovation are codependent: the more extensive a firm’s degree of
innovation, the greater the complexity entrepreneurs, their top management team (TMT),
and their investors face. As firms increase their innovation undertaking, interdisciplinary
tasks, interdependent actions, and coordination demands increase the intricacy placed on the
young firms and on their investors. Many technological discoveries and innovation projects
— particularly long-term intentions — are at odds with investors’ mindsets, which exacerbate

<-----Page 5----->278

G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

information asymmetry between the entrepreneurs and their investors. Likewise, diverse
customer base, high number of competitors, and industry regulations increase the volume,
variety, and disunity of the information that executives must process (Weick & Van Orden,
1990). Since there is a tremendous pressure for innovation projects and technological
discoveries to strike synergies across existing products, processes, or services, they simultaneously increase entrepreneurial complexity and investors’ perceived information asymmetry.
In sum, the blurring of industry boundaries and the new competitive landscape motivates
many firms, particularly entrepreneurial firms, to innovate. However, as the level and extent
of innovation projects increase, they create higher complexity and greater information
asymmetry between the entrepreneurs and their stakeholders. We next examine more closely
the relationships between governance and innovation.

3. Governance, innovation, and entrepreneurship: is there a problem?
Although effective governance of young entrepreneurial ventures is of interest to the
investment community (venture capitalists, business angels, bankers, etc.), to consultants,
academics, and, of course, to entrepreneurs, most governance research is focused on large and
mature organizations. For example, Ward (1997) suggests that governance mechanisms
frequently fail to adequately monitor and control top-level managers’ strategic decisions
(Ward, 1997). Others point that well-functioning governance can result in a competitive
advantage (Kroll, Wright, Toombs, & Leavell, 1997). Westphal and Zajac (1997) have stated
that the board of directors is rapidly evolving into a major strategic force. Controlling the
strategic direction and performance of their firms, organizational governance ensures that
decisions follow strategic paradigms (Davis, Schoorman, & Donaldson, 1997). Governance is
also used to establish the line of command among agents whose interests may be in conflict
(Williamson, 1996).
While media exposure of and research regarding inadequate governance brought certain
modifications, some governance advocates point that too harsh or unfair criticism would
inhibit risk-taking initiatives and uncertain innovation projects. Much of a firm’s wrongheadedness, the argument goes, is an honest strategic mistake and not a substantive
governance problem. Others argued that it is overly pessimistic to assume that mangers act
primarily based on their own self-interest as opposed to their firm’s best interest (Finkelstein
& D’Aveni, 1994). While the fear of overcorrecting for executives’ passivity is valid,
empirical evidence continues to support the thesis that failure to govern strategic decisions
results in significant negative effects on the firm’s performance as measured by strategic
competitiveness and financial data (Comment & Jarrell, 1995).
And yet, despite the wide research effort on corporate governance, little of that rich
knowledge spilled over — let alone applied — to the entrepreneurship domain. This is so, at
least in part, due to the implicit assumption that an entrepreneur is the primary owner of his or
her venture and thus, the sole decision-maker. While this assumption may be true during the
early and seed stages, it is doubtfully the case during the growth stage, which may include
pre- and post-IPO phases, and in which investors actively monitor the strategic posture of the

<-----Page 6----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

279

new venture. We suggest, therefore, that information asymmetry and complexity impact the
relationships between entrepreneurs and their investors, and that the simplified view that
entrepreneurs — particularly during the growth stage — are ‘‘sole owners’’ ignores many
agency perils. Since entrepreneurs, members of boards of directors, and professional
managers and investors may have different perceptions, motives, and interests, the use of
early and well structured governance may help alleviate several agency hazards.
Ignoring this important link between governance, entrepreneurship, and innovation is
surprising; it has long been recognized that innovation is a key to competitive advantage
(D’Aveni, 1994; Hitt, Hoskisson, & Kim, 1997). As the innovations by rivals quickly make
existing products obsolete, many products’ life cycles are compressed thus demonstrating
Schumpeterian creative destruction. The assumption is that successful innovation is the basis
for competitive advantage, which in turn, leads to above-average rents, growth, and further
innovation. Thus, a young firm’s ability to manage innovation could lead to sustainable
competitive advantage, whereas low or failed innovation may mean early failure and bankruptcy.
Nourishing the innovation process, however, requires entrepreneurs’ confidence and vision
to make sizeable investments in R&D projects and take substantial risks by launching a
steady stream of new — sometimes revolutionary and frequently uncertain — products to the
market. Innovation may also require entrepreneurial firms to consider acquisitions, alliances
(even with their own rivals), and/or the creation of novel management initiatives. It also
involves learning from mistakes and failures that are an unavoidable part of the innovation
process (Maidique & Hayes, 1984). For example, Apple Computer’s Newton, a palm top
computer, resulted in a high visibility market failure when consumers rejected it. Yet the
knowledge that is gained even from failures can be applied to improve products that may
eventually be embraced by the market.
3.1. A model of governance and the innovation process
A model of governance and the innovation process in entrepreneurial firms is shown in
Fig. 1. The model suggests that the following factors influence innovation project characteristics and/or the success of the innovation project: (1) the application of long-term pay such as
equity-based compensation; (2) the lack of duality of the CEO and chairperson of the board of
directors; (3) reduction of information asymmetry between founding team members; (4) size
and quality of the founding team; (5) lack of seniority of the founding team members; (6)
ratio of outside board members to internal board members; and (7) size and composition of
the board of directors. The model also suggests that (8) the presence of governance and longterm incentive systems are likely to influence whether innovation is produced internally or
bought from external suppliers. Fig. 1 suggests eight theoretical propositions that will be
explained in the remainder of the paper.
In the next sections, we describe the role of governance in the context of young entrepreneurial firms’ innovation undertaking and develop eight propositions regarding such associations. We begin with a discussion of pay as a tool to align entrepreneurs with their investors and
explain the implications of CEO duality. We then review the purpose of the TMT, board of
directors, and finally, we conclude with a discussion of acquisitions and in-house innovation.

Fig. 1. Governing the innovation process in entrepreneurial firms.

3.2. Incentive structure and innovation
Both agency theory and the information-processing perspective are concerned with the
efficient arrangement and distribution of information as well as the various incentives or
mechanisms to reduce information asymmetry. Agency theory assumes that certain governance mechanisms and monetary incentives facilitate the process and transfer of information
(Jensen & Meckling, 1976); the information-processing perspective suggests that the ability
to effectively process and transfer information is rare and valuable. Taken together, these
views suggest a relationship between innovation and complexity, and the way to govern both.
The appropriate incentive structure may act as a surrogate form of governance in situations
where it is costly or difficult to monitor the behavior of an entrepreneur. Although we now
have substantial knowledge regarding the effective use of incentives such as cash (e.g., salary
and bonus) and long-term contingent pay (e.g., stock options) and how they can substantially
lessen monitoring costs (Beatty & Zajac, 1994), little of that knowledge has been transferred
to the entrepreneurship literature. In this section, then, we will make theoretically based
recommendations regarding pay as a substitute for monitoring.
Since entrepreneurs tend to invest most of their nondiversifiable and nontradable capital in
their young firms and since their wealth is derived primarily from such undertaking, we
suspect that they are more risk-averse than their investors who normally diversify their wealth
portfolios. For example, venture capitalists tend to spread their investment portfolio across
several different entrepreneurial ventures representing diverse technologies. Thus, unless
monitored by their investors or given the appropriate incentives, entrepreneurs are more likely
to avoid undertaking risky innovation projects compared to the preferences of the investors.
Because new venture success is highly uncertain and innovation projects exacerbate
monitoring problems, we predict that increased innovation will be associated with increased
use of long-term forms of pay that is tied to the firm’s financial performance. Specifically, the
spatial complexity associated with the development of new and highly uncertain products or

<-----Page 8----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

281

services makes information gathering and monitoring of entrepreneurs more difficult.
Consequently, as investment in long-term innovation increases, the difficulty and thus cost
of monitoring increases. To overcome such monitoring challenges, to reduce uncertainty, and
to maintain control, investors can increase the use of long-term pay (or reduce the use of
short-term pay) in the mix of total compensation. Since long-term pay that is tied to firm
performance rewards entrepreneurs for maximizing investors’ wealth, they are less likely to
take advantage of the increased information asymmetry resulting from long-term innovation
projects. Doing so will also motivate entrepreneurs to converge their interests with the firm’s
innovation goals.
Because the difficulty of monitoring increases with the complexity of innovation,
entrepreneurial firms with a high degree of innovation would be inclined to resort to longterm compensation as an incentive alignment device. For example, Gomez-Mejia, Balkin, and
Welbourne (1990) reported that venture capitalists recommend allocating equity-based
compensation to the TMT in high tech firms that receive funding so that equity equals a
significant portion of the team’s total pay. By increasing entrepreneurs’ long-term pay,
investors reduce their own risk, converge entrepreneurs’ interests with their own, and thus
offer entrepreneurs incentives to monitor themselves. Finally, from a signaling perspective,
when entrepreneurs accept stock options, even if inefficient from a risk-bearing perspective, it
signals to investors the firm’s innovation potential. We therefore expect that the application of
long-term pay for the entrepreneur will motivate further investment in long-term innovation
projects. This rationale is summarized as follows:
Proposition 1: Ceteris paribus, an entrepreneurial firm’s degree and intensity of
investment in innovation is positively related to an increase in the proportion of longterm pay in the pay mix for an entrepreneur.
3.3. Separation of the CEO and chairperson of the board positions
Duality — when an entrepreneur simultaneously holds the positions of both the CEO and
chairman of the board — is widespread in both large and emerging firms (Boyd, 1995). Some
suggested that duality establishes unity of command and clarifies decision-making authority
(Daily & Dalton, 1997; Finkelstein & D’Aveni, 1994). Since under duality the CEO is the
chairman and vice versa, duality eliminates the peril of information asymmetry between these
two roles. We suggest, however, that the separation of these positions decentralizes power and
authority, fractures organizational rigidity, and allows unstructured innovation to take place.
Brown and Eisenhardt (1998) provide many examples of companies that leverage successfully on the delicate structure–chaos interplay, including Intel’s MMX processor for highspeed graphics, Gillette’s new shaving designs; Miramax’s new movies; and Sun’s JAVA
strategy. We suggest that complex environments, like those of young firms that invest heavily
in uncertain innovation, additional specialization, delegation of authority, and division of
responsibility, may more than compensate for reduced unity in decision-making. That is,
intensive investment in innovation may necessitate young firms to sacrifice some perception
of unity of command and tolerate certain information asymmetries in exchange for greater

<-----Page 9----->282

G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

dispersion of power and authority regarding their innovation projects. The presence of an
outside board chairman — who is not the CEO — represents additional monitoring of the
entrepreneurs (Beatty & Zajac, 1994). It also allows young firms to capitalize on higher
brainpower and to empower the board. Consequently, we suggest that young firms that do not
consolidate the positions of the CEO and chairman of the board will invest more heavily in
their innovation projects. This logic is reiterated as follows:
Proposition 2: An entrepreneurial firm’s level of investment in innovation is
positively related to the practice of separation of the CEO and the chairperson of the
board positions.
3.4. The composition of the founding team of entrepreneurs
As suggested earlier, we assume that many new high tech ventures are built around
founding teams — individuals who identify the initial opportunity and develop a strategy to
exploit it (Cooper & Daily, 1997). This is not surprising because teams help reduce cycle
time in new product development (Ancona & Caldwell, 1992); increase innovation
(Eisenhardt & Tabrizi, 1995); span organizational boundaries (Ancona, 1990); and improve
product and service qualities (Lawler, Mohrman, & Ledford, 1995). Entrepreneurial teams
help attain strategic maneuvers including attaining first-mover advantages, forming strategic
alliances, or developing discontinuous innovations (Tushman & Anderson, 1986). We
suggest that entrepreneurial teams also allow firms greater agility to enter markets quickly
and maintain responsiveness to changing market conditions. Teams are particularly crucial
in the context of technological entrepreneurship because investment decisions are based, at
least in part, on the quality of the founding team (Gupta & Sapienza, 1992). Such founding
members are the repositories of much of the technical and management knowledge, skills,
and ability that make up the intangible assets of the firm (Cooper & Daily, 1997). The
founding team is the firm’s strategic apex and information-processing center (Sanders &
Carpenter, 1998).
Research suggests that team members with diverse backgrounds have several advantages,
including a broader knowledge base that allows innovation projects to draw on more
information sources (Schilling & Hill, 1998). By teaming members of different functional
areas into one innovation project, cross-fertilization of ideas occurs and a wide variety of
knowledge is gathered (Damanpour, 1991). The founding team is responsible for critical
resource allocation and decisions regarding investments in new products and technologies
(Burgelman, 1991), competitive maneuvers such as thrusts, feints, and gambits (McGrath,
Chen, & McMillan, 1998), and decisions regarding entry into new markets and acquisitions
(Hitt et al., 1991a, 1991b).
Just as innovation and information asymmetry heighten the agency issues between
entrepreneurs and their investors, the same may also occur among multiple members of a
founding team of entrepreneurs. For example, specialization and complexity of various
innovation projects may require members of the founding team to allocate critical
responsibilities or otherwise rely on their subordinates (Weick & Van Orden, 1990). Such

<-----Page 10----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

283

a shift is consistent with the information-processing view whereby a team has greater and
better processing capacity and is able to attend to a greater number of cues than any one
person individually (Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1993). American Airlines’ frequent-flyer
program in the early 1980s has been attributed to TMT diversity (Labich, 1990). Likewise,
diversity in cognitive style of TMTs in the US banking industry accounted for a large
variance in technical and administrative innovations (Bantel & Jackson, 1989). Yet from the
agency perspective, reliance on multiple team members is likely to increase the information
asymmetry, perceived by any member of the founding team and to some extent by their
investors. Moreover, the more intensively firms invest in innovation projects, the greater the
delegation and division of labor among team members. This means that as members’
specialized knowledge increases, so does the agency challenge due to information asymmetry. We suggest, therefore, that excellence in cutting-edge innovation may incur some
levels of information asymmetry between diversely competent team players. This suggestion
is echoed in the following proposition:
Proposition 3: Investment in innovation and success thereof are a function of team
members’ ability to reduce information asymmetry and thus fully capitalize on their
diverse and complementary skills.
Due to their strategic role, founding entrepreneurs, personally and as a group, deal with the
utmost complexity the firms face (Hambrick, Cho, & Chen, 1996). They must quickly
process large amounts of diverse and conflicting information, and their ability to do so is both
valuable and rare (Henderson & Fredrickson, 1996). Given the increased complexity arising
from innovation in the context of emerging firms, entrepreneurs are tasked with many
information-processing requirements, which we suggest, can be facilitated by effective
governance arrangements.
Because the capacity of teams to deal with complexity is superior to that of individuals
(Dutton & Duncan, 1987), their cumulative knowledge, skill, and abilities may be important
ingredients to a young firm’s success. Past research used team composition and size (i.e., as
proxies for skills’ quality and quantity, respectively) as control variables in strategy regarding
TMTs. Sanders and Carpenter (1998), for example, found that a larger TMT was positively
associated with its degree of internationalization. Others suggested that because larger teams
have greater information-processing capacity, they can solve more complex problems
(Jackson, 1992). Firms with larger teams — as compared with smaller teams — and who
operate in complex environment tend to perform better (Haleblian & Finkelstein, 1993).
Likewise, if a firm’s management team is, at least to some extent, a scarce resource, then
larger and more competent teams are key to the firm’s success (Hambrick & D’Aveni, 1988).
Since a firm’s degree of innovation is associated with the complexity its TMT faces, we
suggest that increased investment in innovation will be proportional to the size and quality of
its founding entrepreneurs. This reasoning is summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition 4: An entrepreneurial firm’s degree of investment in innovation and success
thereof is a function of the size and quality of the founding team of entrepreneurs.

While many activities are strewn with impediments demanding effort, ingenuity, and
endurance, the paths to innovative achievements in entrepreneurial pursuits are particularly
scattered with snags and inherent short-term disincentives. Innovation projects levy heavy
personal sacrifices; they demand that entrepreneurs exert emotional, physical, and intellectual
effort, while the benefits — if and when they are finally materialized — go through a
serendipitous process of developmental refinement with numerous setbacks (Markman,
Balkin, & Baron, 2000). Resistance and negative market reactions to unconventional thinking
and sanctions thereof that entrepreneurs may endure also represent disincentive. Since new
inventions clash with existing products and services, they threat constituencies who have a
vested interest in preserving the status quo. As innovative efforts frequently bring social and
market rejection before they bring fame and fortune, innovators must endure hardships and
persevere against tough odds. For example, after Gillette acquired Braun — mainly for its
electric shaver technology — Mockler, Gillette’s chairman, advocated — despite stiff internal
resistance — capitalizing on Braun’s quality and innovation reputation to make Gillette a
leader in small appliance markets. Although in 1990, Braun had led only the hand blenders’
market, which accounted for 6% of its sales, 6 years later it had dominated other domains
such as oral care appliances, epilators, and hair dryers. In other words, unyielding to skeptics
brought Gillette a US$1.7 billion and world leadership in products that generated 82% of its
sales (Cottrill, 1998).
Top mangers’ success and seniority may affect their propensity to initiate change and
innovation (Hill & Phan, 1991). Research shows that as TMTs excel, their tenure increases,
and as their tenure increases, past courses of action are increasingly used to guide future
decisions and actions. Also, as group norms and pressures for conformity are created,
candidates with similar experiences and perspectives are hired into the TMT, and greater
attachment to established policies and practices is exhibited (Boeker, 1997). Such behaviors
increase the likelihood that rather than being a catalyst for change and innovation,
experienced TMTs may become a weighty source of organizational inertia. The challenge
is that success and succession can simultaneously lead to strategic myopia and inflexibility.
That is, organizational rigidities and inertia prevail when the strengths that lead to competitive
advantage and strategic competitiveness are emphasized despite the fact that they are no
longer competitively relevant. We therefore propose that:
Proposition 5: Increased seniority of the TMT will be negatively associated with the
level of investment in innovation activities in entrepreneurial firms.
3.5. The board of directors
Although imperfect, the board of directors is an important and formal mechanism for
monitoring top managers (Fama, 1980; Fama & Jensen, 1983). A fundamental responsibility
of the board of directors in new ventures, many of whom are investors, is to monitor and
ascertain that entrepreneurs’ decision-making provides good value for the shareholders — the
company’s legal owners. However, the diffusion of ownership often gives rise to agency
problems and managerial opportunism (Williamson, 1993), whereby certain strategic deci-

<-----Page 12----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

285

sions may serve the interests of the entrepreneurs while diluting the owners’ gains (Amihud &
Lev, 1981). Because entrepreneurs have access to superior information regarding firms’
resources and performance, they can take advantage of such information asymmetry and
curtail investors’ gains (Fama & Jensen, 1983). When organizational structure and size
increase in complexity, a critical characteristic of board members — from the investor’s
viewpoint — is that they should be independent of the entrepreneurs. Board members are
supposed to provide positive oversight of strategies, including rigorously scrutinizing all
decisions, actions, and maneuvers against performance standards. Although board members
should act in the investors’ best interest, many boards fail to challenge the entrepreneurs’
policies and directives when the latter fall short of market expectations. Robert Holland, Ben
and Jerry’s CEO, is a case in point. He resigned after a relatively brief tenure following
disagreements with the powerful founders over broad social agenda that frequently did not
align with shareholders’ interests.
Diffusion of ownership among a large number of shareholders increases the need for the
board of directors to monitor entrepreneurs’ activities. While all board members are expected
to protect the interests of investors, under certain circumstances, inside and outside directors
act differently. For example, assuming that outside directors have incentives not to collude
with founding entrepreneurs (Fama & Jensen, 1983), they can ratify major strategic
initiatives, hire, fire, and set the compensation of these entrepreneurs. A heavy use of
insiders on the other hand suggests relatively weak monitoring (Beatty & Zajac, 1994). Since
entrepreneurs are normally in a position to influence an inside director’s career advancement
in their new venture, insider-dominated boards imply problematic self-monitoring and
particularly weak monitoring of the founding team. Although some governance scholars
assert that insiders — because they are indebted to their entrepreneurs — interfere with
vigilant monitoring, others have argued that insiders positively affect entrepreneurs’ ability to
process complex information about the young firm and thus to make strategic decisions
(Baysinger & Hoskisson, 1990). Nonetheless, when innovation projects are at odds with a
short-term objective championed by the entrepreneurs, inside directors are more likely to
close ranks behind them than outside directors. Accordingly, in the presence of a higher ratio
of outside to inside directors, we would expect the percentage of outside directors on the
board to represent a stronger force towards innovation. Entrepreneurs are assumed to be more
risk-averse than the investors are because the former assets are more closely tied to the
performance of the new venture. Outside directors represent the risk preferences of investors
to the board. Likewise, outside directors (e.g., investors), in addition to their monitoring role,
are likely to be providers of cash, know-how expertise, or external contacts to a new venture.
Our proposition therefore is that:
Proposition 6: A higher ratio of outside to inside directors will be associated with
higher risk taking and more extensive levels of investment in innovation in
entrepreneurial firms.
Increased innovation undertaking exposes boards to more diverse and complex governance
and strategic challenges. Research suggests that the board size and composition may be a

<-----Page 13----->286

G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

function of the complexity of the firm’s environment (Sanders & Carpenter, 1998). Since
multimember teams increase the overall information-processing capacity of the group
(Jackson, 1992), entrepreneurial firms may manage increased complexity due to newness
by recruiting and adding board members who have complementary expertise in the respective
innovation projects. For example, Stephen S. Kahng, who founded Power Computing in 1993
to produce and sell clones of Macintosh computers, recruited Dell’s marketing executive, Joel
J. Kocher. It is believed that Kocher’s expertise in direct sales was one of the key factors
enabling Kahng to reached US$700 million in sales in 1997 (Burrows, 1997). Thus, one
response to the complexity associated with innovation is to — selectively and complementarily — add qualified members to the board.
However, and despite Haleblian and Finkelstein’s (1993) suggestion that group size is
positively related to information-processing capability, large groups can become quite
unwieldy (Sanders & Carpenter, 1998). For example, if board size increases to accommodate
environmental complexity, newness, and legitimacy, how will firms avoid succumbing to the
dysfunctional problems involved with managing large groups? We speculate that it is in just
such complex situations that the interaction (and the adequate balance) between board size,
composition (e.g., inside to outside ratio as well as members’ knowledge, skills, and abilities),
and access to timely and accurate information matters. That is, extremely small boards may
have accurate and timely information, but only about a limited set of innovation projects. On
the other hand, members of excessively large boards may have substantial amount of
cumulative information regarding their young firm’s innovation project, but will be
challenged to adequately communicate this among them in a timely manner. Insiders tend
to have better access to timely and accurate information, but their loyalty to the lead
entrepreneur may restrain their acceptance of immediate changes such as being frequently
associated with both ground-breaking innovation and young entrepreneurial undertaking. On
the other hand, outsiders tend to be more daring in their sponsorship of innovation initiatives,
but suffer from limited and untimely information at best and information asymmetry at worst.
This leads to the following proposition:
Proposition 7: Entrepreneurial firms’ investment in innovation activity is positively
related to board size and board composition.
4. Innovation: to make or buy?
Commitment to in-house innovation is a factor of managerial willingness to allocate
resources to and champion activities in research and development that lead to new
technologies, processes, products, and services. Although there is a consensus that entrepreneurs appreciate innovation and see it as crucial to their company’s survival and growth, there
are disagreements regarding strategies to achieve innovation. Venkataraman and McMillan
(1997) suggest that new business formation occurs through internal development, mergers
and acquisitions, or through cooperative strategies. After their inception and particularly
during the growth stage, entrepreneurial firms can develop innovations in-house (i.e., through
direct investment in internal R&D or strategic alliances) or — when the technology is

<-----Page 14----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

287

available elsewhere — they can acquire or license it. Thus, certain acquisitions or license
agreements may substitute for in-house innovation. Unfortunately, and due to obvious
resource constraints associated with innovation undertaking during the growth stage,
entrepreneurial firms are more likely to emphasize either acquisitions or internally based
innovations — but rarely both (Hitt et al., 1991a, 1991b). From the governance perspective,
each innovation strategy (acquisition and in-house investment in R&D) is associated with
different risks and benefits.
Pro-acquisition advocates argue that in-house innovation projects do not guarantee actual
product innovation or firm competitiveness and growth. Many new products never reach
commercialization and many — and frequently most — of those that do reach the market still
fail to generate an economic return (Schilling & Hill, 1998). NetTV, a 5-million venture, is a
case in point. Customers rejected the venture’s WorldVison, a US$3,000 system that
combined 29-in. monitor with an advanced PC to allow Web surfing and TV-watching
despite CompUSA’s attempt to sell it. This suggests that frequently, a young firm’s scarce
resources are wasted on expensive R&D equipment and facilities as well as on highly
uncertain and time-consuming projects (Gomes, 1998). Since time is an integral component
of financial returns — every venture performance is measured by total returns over a time
period — it, too, can impact innovation management. Time represents an even larger
challenge to entrepreneurs as they must identify a high-return opportunity, attract financial
resources, quickly move products to market, and grow the venture to profitable stages before
the window of opportunity vanishes. Also, many innovative ventures are based on timesensitive information, where original ideas and processes soon may be replicated if not totally
replaced by other ventures (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, & Lyman, 1990). Given the importance of first-mover advantages to subsequent innovation and business success, new ventures
often depend on the speed of implementation, which to a large extent may be a function of
complementary acquisitions. For example, Amazon.com, through a series of acquisitions, is
now offering not only books, but also music, video, gifts, greeting cards, and auctions. In
short, acquisitions are more tuned to the ephemeral window of opportunity, offer immediate
entrance to new or existing markets, and thus allow faster growth than can be achieved
through only internally generated innovation projects. Despite the fact that they are not riskfree, acquisitions — due to the acquired firms’ established product lines and financial
statement — are perceived as easier to forecast than internally based product innovation.
Pro-acquisition arguments also suggest that acquisition-related debt can exert positive
and disciplinary pressure on entrepreneurs to be more efficient and to transfer funds from
questionable operations to wealth-generating activities. Well-planned acquisitions may
actually enhance firm innovation, growth, and overall value, particularly when used to
complement or enhance R&D projects, patent rights, and innovative processes not owned
by the acquiring firm. For example, Chaudhuri and Tabrizi (1999) report that Advanced
Micro Devices (AMD) and NexGen assessed each other very carefully before the former
acquired the latter in 1996. The two companies operated in engineering-team-dominated
environments, rather open and communicative cultures, and shared a common vision to
beat Intel. NexGen passionately shared AMD’s vision of beating Intel. Their due diligence
and smooth integration paved the way for a successful redesign and launch of the K6 and

<-----Page 15----->288

G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

K7 microprocessors. Also, many innovation projects now require the complementary assets
of more than one company (Schilling & Hill, 1998). This suggests that some acquisitions
fail not because they inherently lacked innovation value, but because the acquiring firms
mismanaged them.
We, however, suggest that acquisitions require extensive preparations (e.g., search and
analysis), laborious negotiations, and finally, after the acquisition — particularly when they
turn south — painstaking coordination. That is, acquisitions place substantial toll on
entrepreneurs’ time, cognitive stamina, and energy, and may lead to dangerous escalation
of commitment (McCarthy, Schoorman, & Cooper, 1993). Evidence suggests that acquisitions may result in reductions in basic research, R&D budgets, number of patents owned by
the firm, and in competitiveness (Hitt et al., 1991a, 1991b). Likewise, excessive acquisitions
can potentially dilute a young company’s brand recognition. Interestingly, R&D investments,
returns on assets, and liquidity in the post-acquisition era are frequently lower than the preacquisition period. Innovation through acquisitions rather than in-house research and product
development may subject entrepreneurs to increased managerial commitment to the acquisition, particularly after the acquisition is consummated. And as their commitment to the
acquisition increases — mainly when unexpected problems arise — entrepreneurs may even
de-emphasize in-house innovation undertaking, which may result in decreases in resource
allocations into long-term R&D projects.
Some entrepreneurs, if given a choice, may lack the vision and propensity to take the
necessary risks and will avoid long-term investment in innovation. For example, despite that
R&D projects are a precursor to commercial products and are necessary to further develop
cutting-edge technologies (Schilling & Hill, 1998), risk-averse entrepreneurs may redeploy
firm resources from R&D to projects or goals with shorter payback periods, such as mergers
and acquisitions. By implementing unrelated diversification strategies to expand their firms’
innovation portfolio, entrepreneurs reduce managerial employment risk and compromise the
long-term strategic competitiveness of their young firms. In fact, since it is more time
consuming, risky, and requires substantial intellectual capital to develop long-term innovation
in-house than to buy it via acquisitions, some entrepreneurs may overdiversify. They may
ignore the trade-off between short-term gains and the high possibility of an empty innovation
pipeline farther out in the future (Hitt et al., 1991a, 1991b).
The negative effect acquisitions can have on in-house investments in innovation may also
have an effect on the additional levels of debt that young firms absorb to complete and to
materialize their acquisitions. Not only debt leads to conservative innovation strategies, it also
constrains a firm’s operation, increases its financial risk, and weakens its ability to resist
hostile takeovers. In short, time, cognitive attention, and energy associated with acquisition
combined with managerial risk aversion may result in lower resource allocations to in-house
investment in innovation. Due to obvious resource constraints, most entrepreneurial firms
tend to either buy (e.g., acquisitions) or make (e.g., in-house innovation projects) their
innovations, but rarely do both. This leads to the following and last proposition:
Proposition 8: Since acquisitions provide immediate innovation benefits with less
certain capabilities, whereas in-house innovation projects represent more salient

<-----Page 16----->G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

289

financial and strategic risks (i.e., they are difficult, uncertain, and have long time
horizons) but with more potential for developing innovation capabilities, in the absence
of strong governance and adequate incentives, entrepreneurs will prefer to buy their
innovation rather than develop it.

5. Discussion
Although both governance and innovation have been central to strategic management,
theoretical and empirical links between the two and entrepreneurship are lacking. To address
this gap, we asked how various governance mechanisms affect young entrepreneurial firms’
innovation effort and challenged the assumption that the entrepreneurs — particularly after
the seed stage — are the sole governors of their firm’s innovation. Indeed, it is our view that
in reality, multiple stakeholders, including major investors, strategic partners, members of the
board of directors, customers, and even the end users of the innovation, continuously
negotiate the allocation of resources that lead to additional innovation. Like Sanders and
Carpenter (1998), our overarching theoretical framework linked innovation with governance
and it is based on the logic that as innovation increases, so does complexity and information
asymmetry. And since increased complexity and information asymmetry place higher
demands on information processing and give rise to agency problems, young firms should
manage such demands by instituting more efficient (in terms of information acquisition and
monitoring) governance arrangements. Taken together, the combination of information
processing and agency theories provides a richer context for the study of innovation
management than either perspective alone offers. By recognizing agency theory’s roots in
information economics and its theoretical ties to information processing, one can conceptualize a large set of governance arrangements (e.g., incentives, TMTs, board structures, and
acquisitions) in the context of growth-oriented entrepreneurial firms.
In the context of founding entrepreneurial teams, for example, a classic agency situation
emerges when innovation increases complexity, information-processing demands, and
information asymmetry thereof. Increased innovation is associated with increases in both
TMT’s specialized knowledge of a firm’s diffused markets and operations and the ambiguity
surrounding team members’ actions (Nohria & Ghoshal, 1994). This, of course, makes
monitoring of entrepreneurs more difficult. Despite that agency theory suggests that
monitoring problems may be resolved through governance arrangements that align the
interests of the entrepreneurs with the profit-maximizing intentions of investors, we indicate
that little is known about the governance of entrepreneurial firms at the growth stages of the
life cycle.
Most firms — and entrepreneurial firms are no exception — face multipoint competition and thus, their success is a function of their ability to manage complexity within their
competitive landscape. A critical determinant of a firm’s ability to successfully deal with
such complexity is a function of its governance (Daily & Schwenk, 1996). Entrepreneurial
firms manage and cope with information-processing demands and agency issues arising
from innovation through various governance mechanisms including — but not limited to

<-----Page 17----->290

G.D. Markman et al. / Journal of High Technology Management Research 12 (2001) 273–293

— longer-term pay to founding entrepreneurs, the separation of chairman and CEO
positions, larger and diverse founding teams, adequate composition of the board of
directors, and strategically derived decisions on the balance between in-house innovation
and acquisitions.
Innovation and its associated complexity have important implications for the agency
relationship and the monitoring of entrepreneurs, particularly in high technology firms. First,
since innovation spurs entrepreneurs to acquire highly specialized knowledge (Nohria &
Ghoshal, 1994) and since such knowledge increases information asymmetry between them
and their investors, innovation may compound the agency problem. Second, innovation is
also likely to increase the ambiguity surrounding cause–effect relationships, provide multiple
decision options, and thus result in greater agent discretion and even a source of principal–
agent discord. Taken together, information asymmetry and discretion due to innovation may
hinder direct monitoring of entrepreneurs. Thus, it should not be surprising that venture
capitalists usually avoid making investments in high technology firms outside of a 1-h driving
radius of their office. By maintaining close physical proximity to their investments, venture
capitalists are able to become active investors by working more closely with entrepreneurs in
their investment portfolio, which helps to manage some of the information asymmetries for
the venture capitalists.
We echo Hitt et al. (1991a, 1991b) who suggest that since in-house innovation in new
ventures may have long time horizons, uncertain outcomes, and their revocation has no
immediate negative outcomes, heavy debt frequently forces entrepreneurs to reallocate
payments away from such activities. Boards should be weary of and strive to restrain
entrepreneurs for whom discipline and motivation to innovate are a direct function of their
firm’s debt. We suggest that an emphasis on acquisitive growth and risk-averse mindset may
cause entrepreneurs to reduce their commitments to in-house innovation. While not all
acquisitions are a stumbling block for innovation, we take the position that many high-growth
entrepreneurial firms do use acquisitions as a substitute for innovation. Our message is that
while one can apply an acquisition strategy and still be innovative, continuous investment in
in-house innovation is crucial for a firm’s long-term longevity and viability. Hence, firms
should consider related and complementary acquisitions when their own in-house innovation
projects are thriving.
