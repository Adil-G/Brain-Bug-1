Accelerated Innovation Management

Learning-by-doing in action

A action-training management and team development programme

The new agenda for Irish business

Innovation in Action!
Sustaining competitive advantage in challenging times
Unlocking the creative potential of people at work
Innovation in Action is a unique training and development initiative in response to today’s current need for two parallel management
systems, one to manage existing operations (crisis priorities) without loss of momentum, and one to create, plan and manage the future
in a rapidly changing marketplace. Innovation in Action is a practical and flexible 'action-training' programme for managers and teams
designed to unlock the creative potential of people at work and focus talents and energies on innovation for value creation and
sustained competitive advantage. Sustaining competitive advantage (avoiding commodity status) implies continuous performance
improvement (CPI) and perpetual innovation. The programme encourages participants to recognise the limits of mimetics and
incrementalism and the dangers today's businesses face by simply pursuing incremental improvements (‘tinkering’) while competitors
rethink business models and deconstruct traditional value chains. At the end of this programme participants will have a clear
understanding of business innovation, a selected range of approaches to idea generation, evaluation and implementation and the key
factors for success in stimulating and managing innovation. The programme emphasises the business unit as an environment of
innovative opportunity where everything is capable of improvement and where nothing is ever as well done as it could be.
Note: We have more than thirty years experience in the design and presentation of training programmes to meet the specific needs of clients. We work in
partnership with a number of major organisations on the design and presentation of bespoke, in-house programmes, including: strategic planning,
leadership and team development, management development, change management, creativity and business innovation, business process improvement
and building advisory, consulting and personal effectiveness skills.

The real economic problems in any society arise from the phenomenon of unperceived opportunities - Kirzner

Innovation in Action! is a unique training and development initiative that recognises today’s current need for two parallel management systems, one to manage existing operations (crisis
priorities) without loss of momentum, and one to create, plan and manage the future in a fundamentally changed marketplace. Innovation in Action is a creative and focused response to
the latter. It is a highly practical and flexible 'action-training' programme designed to unlock the creative potential of people at work and focus the skills, knowledge, creativity, physical,
mental and emotional energies on applied innovation for value creation and sustained competitive advantage. This practical programme and process encourages participants to recognise
the limits of mimetics and incrementalism and the dangers today's businesses face by simply pursuing incremental improvements (tinkering) while competitors rethink business models and
reconfigure traditional value chains. The programme will also emphasise the organisation as an environment of innovative opportunity where everything is capable of improvement and
where nothing is ever as well done as it could be.
The future belongs to people who see possibilities before they become obvious - Levitt

Strategic acuity: Anticipating and dealing effectively and efficiently with competitive innovation and environmental change

Key Issue: The focus and the level of innovation (radical vs. incremental) required to maintain a strategic edge i.e. a significant competitive advantage in a rapidly
changing marketplace and dissuade emergent (or potential) competitors from entering your most profitable lines. Innovation needs to be encouraged when the
business is doing well. The greatest danger occurs when you are ahead and become complacent.
Darwin is a better guide to competition than economists - Henderson

Competing through knowledge leadership - the focus of the programme is on the practical and immediate application of learning
Innovation in Action is a highly practical, 'action training' programme designed to focus the talents, skills, knowledge, creativity, physical, mental and emotional energies of people for sustained competitive
advantage. The programme content and design are explicitly geared to help managers innovate in each of the core dimensions of their business and sustain competitive advantage in a rapidly changing environment.
It is an anecdote-rich and engaging programme challenging participants to generate and critically evaluate innovation options and opportunities rather than providing simplistic answers. The programme presents a
diverse range of business innovation concepts, tools, techniques and leading edge practices enabling participants to influence attitudes, change behaviours and creatively address and resolve priority business unit
issues.
Every organisation will have to learn to innovate - and innovation can now be organised and must be organised as a systematic process - Drucker
