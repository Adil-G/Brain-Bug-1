Many technology entrepreneurs start their companies by focusing on an innovation that
creates a market offer to attract their first customers. When the entrepreneur’s firm makes
its first sale, the dynamics of the organization change and the entrepreneur faces a new
challenge: how can the firm concurrently develop new products and support existing customers? This problem is of great concern to entrepreneurs who own small technology
firms and is the subject of this article.
In this article, we first address the innovate-versus-support dilemma that small technology
firms face early in their lifecycles. Next, we describe the paradigm of the ambidextrous organization. We conclude with a discussion of five mechanisms small firms can use to
achieve balance in their quest to concurrently satisfy the need to innovate while fulfilling
the demands of existing clients and products.

Introduction
Early in a technology firm’s lifecycle, most of the firm’s
time and resources are dedicated to the design and development of its first product. This is known as the
“honeymoon” stage for a startup. The entrepreneur can
afford to be extremely flexible with goals and decisions.
Once the firm begins to ship products and establishes a
group of customers, it must devote a portion of its resources to the maintenance of those products through
regular bug fixes and product updates (i.e., customer
support). This shift in priorities places a firm in an interesting dilemma: existing customers must be kept satisfied while pressures to continue innovation must be
addressed.
To survive and grow, the small technology firm needs
to find a balance between satisfying existing customers
and developing new products. If the entrepreneur fails
to properly balance the need for new product development and the need to keep existing customers satisfied,

then one of the following two outcomes may happen.
First, the small technology firm may no longer be able
to innovate at the pace required to stay ahead of the larger incumbents, resulting in the firm becoming irrelevant and ripe for replacement by an incumbent. Second,
the small firm may develop a poor reputation, resulting
in unhappy customers who go elsewhere.
The search for the appropriate balance is at the heart of
a research paradigm known as organizational ambidexterity (Raisch et al., 2009; tinyurl.com/84jzpbn). An ambidextrous organization is one that is capable of
simultaneously exploiting existing competencies (e.g.,
satisfying existing customers) and exploring new opportunities (e.g., developing new products). However, exploration and exploitation are quite different activities
and require different abilities within the firm. In the
case of exploration, “firms must regularly assess their
vision, encourage innovation and must be willing to adjust or change strategies, products and markets and
more” (Dover and Dierk, 2010; tinyurl.com/7pcll3j). Ex-

ploitation requires a different approach; the firm must
focus on carrying out activities such as customer service and bug fixes as efficiently as possible. Exploration
employs more of a creative, dynamic approach necessary for innovating new products faster than the competition. This is much different than exploitation,
which employs a transactional approach with a focus
on ensuring customer satisfaction.
Ambidextrous organizations are expected to perform
better than others (Raisch et al., 2009; tinyurl.com/84jzpbn),
but the existing literature focuses on the mechanisms
required to enable ambidexterity and addresses the importance of the relationship between ambidexterity
and firm performance in mid- and large-scale organizations. The literature regarding ambidexterity within
small technology firms is not well developed. Entrepreneurs who own small technology firms should be
aware that the balance between exploration and exploitation is of crucial importance to the success of
their firms (Rosing et al., 2011; tinyurl.com/72eyvmv). They
must also be familiar with the mechanisms that can
help a small technology company become more ambidextrous.
The remainder of this article describes five mechanisms
that entrepreneurs can use to design and operate ambidextrous small technology firms:
1. Adopt an ambidextrous leadership style.
2. Outsource one of the two functions.
3. Attract and retain employees who can both explore
and exploit.
4. Attract executives who can act as leaders, managers,
and entrepreneurs.
5. Shift resources across projects regardless of whether
their goals are to explore or exploit.
Adopt an ambidextrous leadership style
Leadership affects innovation and organizational development. Rosing, Frese, and Bausch (2011; tinyurl.com/
72eyvmv) identify three leadership styles found within a
technology company: transformational, transactional,
and ambidextrous. These leadership styles are described below to illustrate their roles at different phases
in the lifecycles of companies.
A transformational leader strives to make changes within the organization for the purpose of moulding it into

something different. This is done to prepare the organization for challenges, such as handling new technologies or new incumbents. This style of leadership tends
to result in unconventional thinking and solutions that
go beyond existing knowledge. For the entrepreneur
starting a technology business, this leadership style generally works best. Typically, an entrepreneur starts with
an idea, then transforms it into an opportunity, and
then it becomes a small operating business. Later, the
entrepreneur is faced with the dilemma of having to
shift their leadership style as the firm evolves.
A transactional leader focuses on maintaining day-today operations, assuring the firm runs as efficiently as
possible. This leadership style tends to focus on correcting issues that impact the effectiveness of the firm’s
day-to-day operations. It is less concerned with transforming the organization to handle future changes in
the market. The transactional leadership style is most
evident in large firms with well established brands.
These firms invest mainly in initiatives to promote their
brands and ensure their existing customer base is satisfied. When an organization focuses exclusively on transactional leadership, however, it finds it difficult to
develop novel new products and services. This leaves
the larger firm vulnerable to smaller, less well-known
firms that are free to devote their time to innovation
(Rosing et al., 2011; tinyurl.com/72eyvmv). The reverse
seems true for small companies that have fewer customers and are focused primarily on product development. Once their product development begins to pay
off, the small company must integrate transactional
leadership into the organization to provide support for
their growing customer base.
Ambidextrous leadership is a combination of both the
transformational and transactional leadership styles.
Ambidextrous leaders have mastered the ability to alternate between the two styles depending on the needs
of the company. Ambidextrous leadership successfully
establishes the right balance in order to promote
growth within the company. Leaders of startups must
be able to efficiently change from one leadership style
to the next depending upon the innovation requirements. Simply keeping up with both styles does not
lead to higher innovation (Rosing et al., 2011).
An example of ambidextrous leadership comes from International Safety Research Incorporated (i-s-r.ca), which
is a small firm committed to providing safety management solutions in the fields of nuclear power and radiation protection. The company consists of a small
collection of licensed safety inspectors and software de-

velopers who can switch efficiently between re-certification tasks for existing customers and new product development related to their exercise simulation product
(i-s-r.ca/products_e.html) or other innovations. To effectively balance the nature of these responsibilities, the
staff must continuously shift from customer support to
new product development. The ability to alternate
between explorative and exploitative work benefits International Safety Research Incorporated; it creates an
efficient system where lessons learned from customer
support can be incorporated into the improvement of
upcoming products. Due to the size of ISR, leaders within the company must shift their focus from customer
service to product development along with the rest of
the staff. In fact, it is due to the ambidextrous nature of
its leadership that ISR employees can themselves be
ambidextrous.
Outsource one of the two functions
A small company that wishes to strike a balance
between supporting customers and developing innovating new products can enter into partnerships with other companies to perform one of these two functions.
When engaging a partner to perform one of the two
functions, and for externalization to work properly, the
small firm must maintain strong ties with the partner
and integrate the externally acquired knowledge base
back into the organization (Raisch et al., 2009;
tinyurl.com/84jzpbn).
An example is Blindside Networks (blindsidenetworks.com),
a Carleton University spin-off company that produces
open source web conferencing solutions for universities
and colleges. Blindside generates revenue supporting existing customers (exploitation) and innovates by collaborating with the global BigBlueButton (bigbluebutton.org)
open source community (exploration) (Dixon, 2011;
timreview.ca/article/441). It was the strategic decision to outsource exploration activity that allowed the startup to develop a complex web application and quickly deploy it to
customers. Another example is InGenius (ingenius.com),
which provides telecommunication software solutions.
InGenius entered into an agreement with Mitel Networks (www.mitel.ca) to develop components for Mitel’s
MCD platform. In turn, Mitel assumes the responsibility of handling customer support tasks. Through this arrangement, InGenius can focus aggressively on new
product development while its partner can focus on
providing a unified customer support experience. In
this situation, a small company has partnered with a larger one to create an ambidextrous collaboration for mutual advantage.

Attract and retain employees who can both explore and
exploit
Researchers have focused on firm-level mechanisms to
enable ambidexterity. Many employees of smaller
firms, however, are forced to take on both exploitative
and explorative tasks. Individual-level mechanisms that
enable ambidexterity assume that ambidextrous capability is rooted in the individual or small team, not the
overall organization. In the case of a small company,
resources may not be available to hire people specifically for the development and support functions.
Ideally, these employees should learn to perform tasks
that support both functions. A single team may become
ambidextrous by allocating different roles to each individual (Raisch et al., 2009; tinyurl.com/84jzpbn).
Consider Met Inspiratie (metinspiratie.nl), a small web
design firm operating in the Netherlands. The firm consistently secures customer contracts because their
design team develops innovative products and provides
customer support. Due to its size, designers at Met Inspiratie take care of clients through the whole lifecycle
of product design from inception to final deployment.
This gives customers the “personal touch” they do not
receive from larger firms. This ambidexterity gives designers more direct access to their customers and allows
them to develop the relationships that enable them to
anticipate their customers’ needs. By having these
strong relationships cemented early in the design phase
of a project, designers can ensure all requirements are
incorporated into the final design and the customer’s
needs are always considered. Another example is the Zope Europe Association (ZEA; zeapartners.org), which is a
network of small firms of one or more employees that
collaborate to operate as an ambidextrous organization
(Weiss, 2011; http://www.timreview.ca/article/436).
The network enables its members to partition tasks so
they can innovate as well as provide customer support.
These examples illustrate that it is important to attract
employees who possess the skills and breath of prior
knowledge and understanding necessary to perform
both exploitation and exploration tasks (Raisch et al.
2009; tinyurl.com/84jzpbn).
Attract executives with balanced capabilities
Executives who can view a firm’s problems from the
perspective of a leader, a manager, and an entrepreneur add to the firm’s ambidextrous capability. Dover
and Dierk (2010; tinyurl.com/7pcll3j) defined an index
whereby executives can be ranked in terms of their effectiveness on three separate scales: manager, entrepreneur, and leader. Executives with high scores in the

19

manager dimension are driven by short-term objectives
and clear metrics, and they tend to be risk averse. Executives with high scores as entrepreneurs are risk takers.
Executives with high scores in the leadership dimension take a middle course; through vision and future orientation, they show a propensity for risk, while at the
same time, they carefully search for a balanced portfolio of innovation opportunities.
The ability to balance managerial, entrepreneurial, and
leadership effectiveness optimizes a firm’s capability to
incorporate customer inputs generated by support
activities into product development. Achieving this balance also encourages the entrepreneur to assume more
risk based on their knowledge of what customers need,
because they are strongly linked to the market. Executives who can effectively integrate exploitative and explorative activities have the ability and power to
transform a small company into an ambidextrous one
(Raisch et al., 2009; tinyurl.com/84jzpbn). This will allow
the small company to better handle contradictions and
conflicting goals (Smith and Tushman, 2005;
tinyurl.com/8xcd9bn), engage in paradoxical thinking, and
fulfil multiple roles (Raisch et al., 2009).
Shift resources across projects
Some researchers suggest that ambidexterity can be obtained by shifting resources from one project to the
next, regardless of whether the project goals are explorative or exploitative in nature. These resources can include: cash, talent, expertise, customers, and
technologies
(O’Reilly
and
Tushman,
2004;
tinyurl.com/6uavbe6). In its ability to effectively shift resources from one project to the next, the small technology firm benefits in the following ways:
1. Increased customer satisfaction during periods of increased demand for support
2. Reduced time required to allocate resources to take
advantage of a new market opportunity and remove resources used to support products in declining markets
3. Increased ability to respond to environmental
changes such as the arrival of a new incumbent or
new technology
A technology startup that can easily move resources
from development to customer support improves its
ability to compete. The firm can innovate effectively

www.timreview.ca

since those who are familiar with the designs of the
product are also familiar with the needs, complaints,
and expectations of customers. This customer-driven
knowledge can potentially translate into better requirements, more comprehensive testing, and simpler customer deployment.
The ability for a startup to quickly shift from development to support and back again is crucial to responding to environmental changes. Consider the company
thinkRF (thinkrf.com), a small firm specializing in the development of software-enabled radio frequency analysis tools. The company consists of less than a dozen
hardware and software engineers who perform both
development and customer support tasks. To help with
its growth, thinkRF has partnered with the large investment firm Wesley Clover (wesleyclover.com), which specializes in telecommunication companies and
provides thinkRF with sales contacts and partnerships
that leads directly to new business opportunities. This
structuring allows thinkRF to focus on switching
between customer support and product development
without having to divert resources to marketing and
sales. This arrangement between a small and large
company allows the small company to remain lean
and agile by focusing on what it does best: solving
technical problems.

Conclusion
The challenges of survival and growth are a constant
concern for the small business entrepreneur. Frequently, a startup must compete in a market dominated by larger companies that have more staff and
resources at their disposal. The small company’s advantage is that it is more agile than its competitors. If
properly managed, a startup can have an advantage
over its larger competitors by more efficiently providing
customer support and simultaneously working on new
product development
Balancing support and research activities – both simultaneously and effectively – is what the ambidextrous organization strives to accomplish. In this article, we
identified five mechanisms that can be used to improve
a technology company’s ability to juggle support and
development tasks. These mechanisms offer a useful
set of guidelines an entrepreneur can consider when
planning growth strategies for a market environment
that demands multitasking.
