The view that emotional intelligence should be included within the traditional cognitive abilities
framework was explored in 3 studies (total N = 530) by investigating the relations among measures
of emotional intelligence, traditional human cognitive abilities, and personality. The studies suggest
that the status of the emotional intelligence construct is limited by measurement properties of its
tests. Measures based on consensual scoring exhibited low reliability. Self-report measures had salient
loadings on well-established personality factors, indicating a lack of divergent validity. These data
provide controvertible evidence for the existence of a separate Emotion Perception factor that (perhaps) represents the ability to monitor another individual's emotions. This factor is narrower than
that postulated within current models of emotional intelligence.

unique abilities that involve the processing of affective information, then this construct is of obvious psychological importance.
However, the equivocal nature of emotional intelligence may
be demonstrated through consideration of two rather different
research traditions. On the one hand, it would appear that emotionally adept individuals have certain personality traits that are
known to share no particular relation with cognitive abilities
(see, e.g., Boyle, Stankov, & Cattell, 1995; H. J. Eysenck,
1994a, 1994b; Saklofske & Zeidner, 1995; Stankov & Crawford,
1998). On the other hand, emotional intelligence appears, conceptually at the very least, to show some important convergence
with other types of abilities, particularly social and crystallized
intelligence. Extensive research aimed at demonstrating that social intelligence is an empirically coherent domain of cognitive
ability, independent from other types of intelligence (and most
especially crystallized abilities), has met with disappointing
results (see, e.g., Carroll, 1993; Cronbach, 1960; Ford & Tisak,
1983; see also Brown & Anthony, 1990). Nevertheless, it has
been suggested that emotional intelligence has the discriminant
validity lacking in measures of social (and crystallized) intelligence (see Mayer et al., 1997; Mayer & Salovey, 1993).

There have been several recent attempts to incorporate emotional intelligence within the broad framework provided by theories of human cognitive abilities (see Goleman, 1996; Mayer,
Caruso, & Salovey, 1997; Mayer & Geher, 1996; Mayer & Salovey, 1993; Salovey & Mayer, 1994). Emotional intelligence has
been defined as "the ability [italics added] to monitor one's
own and others' emotions, to discriminate among them, and
to use the information to guide one's thinking and actions"
(Salovey & Mayer, 1990, p. 189). A number of researchers thus
view the capacity to process affective information as a ' 'mental
ability" or "aptitude" in the conventional sense. If there are

OVERVIEW OF THE INVESTIGATION
To investigate the psychometric status of emotional intelligence and determine whether it serves as a unique type of human
ability, it is necessary to (a) have an adequate methodology for
this construct's assessment and (b) demonstrate its partial (or
complete) independence from other, seemingly analogous, concepts. The present series of three studies systematically addressed the foregoing issues. For this purpose, each study evaluated the status of tasks that, in the experimental literature, are
claimed to measure psychological components underlying emo-

tional intelligence (e.g., empathy). The three studies also examined empirical relations between measures of emotional intelligence and well-replicated indexes of human cognitive abilities,
personality traits, and social intelligence.
The measures of emotional intelligence and associated constructs used in the design differed somewhat from study to study
because it was deemed expedient to assess not only disparate
conceptualizations of emotional intelligence itself but its various
hypothetical correlates. To this end, Study 1 reports the results
based on a battery of measures that may be divided under rive
main groupings: (a) self-report indexes of emotional intelligence, (b) "objective" indexes of emotional intelligence, (c)
personality questionnaires, (d) fluid and crystallized intelligence
tests, and (e) social intelligence measures. In Study 2, we used
tests of (mostly crystallized) intelligence and personality. The
main aim was to replicate the findings of Study 1 regarding the
relation between self-report assessments of emotional intelligence and indexes of personality and ability traits using slightly
different measures of the latter two domains. Study 3 involved
a battery of fluid and crystallized intelligence tests similar to
that used in the first study. However, still further measures of
personality and social intelligence were used. The main aim of
this study was to examine the nature of objective measures of
emotional intelligence that were shown to have some construct
validity in Study 1. Particularly important in Study 3 was an
empirical investigation of the effects of novel ways of scoring
objective emotional intelligence tests, that is, determining the
role and empirical status of consensual responding. Participants
in Studies 1 and 3 were students from the University of Sydney;
those in Study 2 were U.S. Air Force recruits tested at the
Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. These notably
disparate samples allow the present results to be extended beyond the confines of specific gender groups (the studies conducted in Australia contained a large percentage of women, and
the studies conducted in the United States included a higher
percentage of men) as well as obvious sociocultural boundaries.

EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE:
CONCEPTUAL ISSUES
The construct of emotional intelligence encompasses a set
of conceptually related psychological processes involving the
processing of affective information. These processes include (a)
the verbal and nonverbal appraisal and expression of emotion
in oneself and others, (b) the regulation of emotion in oneself
and others, and (c) the use of emotion to facilitate thought (see
Mayer & Geher, 1996; Mayer & Salovey, in press; Salovey &
Mayer. 1990, 1994).
Although various authors have proposed that emotional intelligence is a type of intelligence, in the traditional sense, contemporary research and theorizing lack any conceptual model of
intelligence within which the construct might be placed. The
theory of fluid and crystallized ability proposed by Cattell
(1987), Horn (1988), and their associates (see, e.g., Horn &
Noll, 1994; Horn & Stankov, 1982) is arguably the most efficacious empirically based psychometric model of intelligence (see
Stankov, Boyle, & Cattell, 1995). It may be speculated that,
within this theory, emotional intelligence will constitute an additional aspect of (possibly one or more primary mental abilities

underlying) crystallized ability. This assertion is based on the
assumption that the appraisal, expression, regulation, and use
of emotion develop through experience and social interaction in
much the same way as do other psychological processes constituting crystallized intelligence.
The concept of emotional intelligence also overlaps with
Gardner's (1983, chap. 10) notion of social intelligence, which
he refers to as a type of "personal intelligence." Part of Gardner's definition focuses specifically on the processing of affective information. Interpersonal intelligence includes the ability to understand other people and know what they feel. Intrapersonal intelligence involves access to one's own feelings, the
capacity to effect discriminations among these feelings and draw
on them as a means of guiding behavior. In attempting to locate
these "intelligences" within the traditional psychometric domain, Carroll (1993) suggested that interpersonal intelligence
is a specialized type of acquired knowledge (i.e., crystallized
ability). However, Gardner's intrapersonal intelligence (access
to one's own feelings) finds no counterpart in Carroll's taxonomic model. Arguably, this situation has arisen because adequate assessment of this type of ability has never appeared in
the extant factor-analytic literature.
COMPONENTS OF EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE:
EMPIRICAL STATUS
The available evidence tends to suggest that emotional intelligence is composed of a number of components that are akin to
"lower order" (i.e., primary) factors. At the conceptual level,
this structure would appear to make sense, particularly if emotional intelligence is to be viewed as a broad (i.e., secondstratum; see Carroll, 1993) intellective factor similar to fluid or
crystallized intelligence. In the sections that follow, the status
of the empirical constructs hypothesized to constitute emotional
intelligence is discussed. An attempt is also made to evaluate
some of the self-report instruments that have been identified by
Salovey and Mayer (1990) as measuring aspects of the emotional intelligence construct.
Appraisal and Expression of Emotion in the Self
This aspect of emotional intelligence involves individuals being aware both of their mood and of their thoughts concerning
that mood (Booth-Butterfield & Booth-Butterfield, 1990;
Mayer & Stevens, 1994; Swinkels & Giuliano, 1995). Much of
the research examining the ability to appraise and express emotion relates to alexithymia, a psychiatric term describing a condition in which people are unable to evaluate and then verbally
express their emotions. The Toronto Alexithymia Scale provides
a valid indicator of this clinical disorder (Bagby, Taylor, &
Parker, 1994). Bagby, Taylor, and Parker's (1994) analysis of the
scale produced three factors: Difficulty in Identifying Feelings,
Difficulty in Describing Feelings, and Externally Oriented
Thinking. Plausibly, the latent traits identified by this scale are
an aspect of emotional intelligence. Thus, scores from the three
separate subscales of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale should be
included in a systematic evaluation of the emotional intelligence
construct.
Similarly, the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (Salovey, Mayer, Gold-

<-----Page 2----->EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN ELUSIVE CONSTRUCT?

man, Turvey, & Palfai, 1995) has been constructed to measure
appraisal of emotion in the self and, in particular, the reflective
aspect of mood experience. The instrument contains two subscales relevant to the present concerns: Attention and Clarity.
These subscales purportedly measure the degree to which individuals notice their feelings and the ability to understand these
feelings (respectively). Scores from both subscales are predicted, in turn, to be negatively correlated with measures of
alexithymia.
Within current models of emotional intelligence, nonverbal
expressiveness is also postulated to be an important element.
Thus, the Affective Communication Test (Friedman, Prince, Riggio, & DiMatteo, 1980) has been proposed as a valid measure
of this component of the emotional intelligence construct. This
psychometric instrument is a self-report inventory that assesses
the degree to which individuals are able to express themselves
(nonverbally) in a variety of situations.
Appraisal and Recognition of Emotion in Others
The perception of emotion has been found to be related to
the expression of emotion (see, e.g., Ekman, Friesen, & Ancoli,
1980). For example, individuals scoring high on the Toronto
Alexithymia Scale (particularly the Externally-Oriented Thinking subscale) are less able to recognize facial expressions of
emotion (Parker, Taylor, & Bagby, 1993). Both emotional appraisal (the ability to accurately identify another's emotions)
and emotional expression (the ability to reexperience these emotions oneself) also appear to be related to empathy (Salovey &
Mayer, 1990). Although empathy is viewed as an ability within
the emotional intelligence framework, much of the work on
empathy has treated it as a personality characteristic. Mehrabian
and Epstein's (1970) Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy is of interest to emotional intelligence research because
it measures the vicarious aspects of emotional empathy (see
Chlopan, McCain, Carbonell, & Hagen, 1985). Alexithymics
have reduced empathy because they are as confused about the
feelings of others as they are about their own emotional tone
(Mayer, Salovey, Gomberg-Kaufman, & Blainey, 1991). This
suggests that appraisal of one's own feelings and appraisal of
the feelings of others may be inseparable. Thus, empathy may
involve both one's ability to identify with the feelings of others
and general access to one's own feeling state.
Regulation of Emotion in the Self and Others
Regulation of emotion in the self refers to the meta-experience
of mood, or monitoring, evaluating, and acting to change one's
mood. A separate subscale of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (Salovey et al., 1995) has been designed expressly to measure this
reflective experience. Whereas the Attention and Clarity subscales concern monitoring and discriminating among emotions,
this third subscale (Repair) refers to the degree to which individuals moderate their own mood states. This emotion regulation
concerns attempts to repair unpleasant moods while maintaining
pleasant ones. Regulation of emotion also includes the ability
to alter the affective reactions of others (e.g., the ability to calm
distressing emotions in other individuals; Salovey & Mayer,
1990). This propensity has remained poorly operationalized,

991

although there is some evidence that it has been assessed (at
least in part) by an inventory described shortly (i.e., the EQ
Test).
Use of Emotion to Facilitate Performance
Marshaling emotions in the service of a goal is essential for
selective attention, self-motivation, and so forth. According to
Goleman (1996), emotional self-control and the delay of gratification underlie all human accomplishment. The Emotional
Control Questionnaire (Roger & Najarian, 1989) is thought to
measure this component of emotional intelligence. This instrument consists of four scales reflecting aspects of the control of
emotion in difficult or trying circumstances: Aggression Control, Rehearsal, Benign Control, and Emotional Inhibition. The
measure has not been used previously in relation to empirical
investigation of the emotional intelligence construct. Another
scale that would appear to assess how emotion interacts with
performance is the EQ Test recently developed by Goleman
(1995). It purportedly assesses all aspects of emotional intelligence. However, in terms of the preceding discussion, this scale
appears more precisely to measure the ability to regulate emotions in others and the use of emotion (e.g., the ability to delay
gratification).
EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: IN SEARCH OF
MEASURES THAT ARE MORE OBJECTIVE
Unlike typical cognitive ability measures, the preceding assessments of the components of emotional intelligence are all
based on self-report inventories. As Mayer and Salovey (in
press) have pointed out, if emotional intelligence resembles a
cognitive ability in the traditional sense, then it is important to
use tests of emotional intelligence that directly measure this
construct. This principle follows from the fact that it is obviously better to have direct, objective assessment techniques
"rather than [people's] self-description of how emotionally intelligent they are" (Mayer & Salovey, in press).
In an attempt to provide a more objective measure of knowledge of emotion in the self, Cattell, Horn, Sweney, and Radcliffe
(1964) constructed a test measuring self-insight into, or awareness of, one's own feelings. The Motivation Analysis Test provides an objective index of a person's needs or feelings. This
is not a self-report measure, and a rank order of 10 different
needs (e.g., the need for aggression) may be derived from the
test. An objective measure of self-insight can be obtained by
comparing individuals' "self-rank ings" of the importance of
each of the needs and the rank ordering derived from the test. A
greater correspondence between the two scores obtained should
indicate a greater degree of insight into one's own internal
motives.
Mayer, DiPaulo, and Salovey (1990) have constructed a measure of emotion recognition that does not rely on the self-report
protocol and is thus closer in format to traditional cognitive
ability measures. This index, which assesses the nonverbal perception of emotion, originated with the work of Ekman and his
associates regarding judgments of facial expressions of emotion
(see, e.g., Ekman & Friesen, 1975; Ekman et al., 1980; Ekman,
Friesan, & Elsworth, 1972). An important aspect of emotional

<-----Page 3----->992

DAVIES, STANKOV, AND ROBERTS

intelligence is the ability to recognize consensuaUy agreed on
emotional qualities of objects in the environment (Mayer &
Geher, 1996). Mayer et al. (1990) provided evidence that this
is a basic skill that accounts for individual differences in recognizing consensually judged emotion not only in faces but in
colors and abstract designs. These researchers also found that
people higher in this skill obtained higher scores on a scale of
empathy. Using these results, Mayer et al. (1990) concluded
that the components of emotional intelligence are essentially
abilities, analogous to the way in which this term has traditionally been used in the psychological literature.
Mayer et al. (1990) found that consensus in emotion perception generalized across three stimulus domains (faces, colors,
and abstract designs) to define a unifactorial construct. It would
be expected that the emotional perception of auditory stimuli
would also form part of this unifactorial construct. These results
were extended in the present studies by including newly constructed tests of auditory emotional intelligence. There is a wellestablished relation between music and emotion. A number of
studies have investigated affective responses to music (see, e.g.,
Clynes, 1977; De Vries, 1991). In particular, Terwogt and Van
Grinsven (1991), investigating the recogniz ability of four basic
emotions in musical excerpts, found a high degree of consensus
in the identification of emotion. Furthermore, the idea that various musical intervals express different emotions has a long history in the literature of aesthetics, music theory, and experimental psychology (Maher, 1980). For example, Cooke (1959) attempted to ascribe to various musical intervals specific
expressive functions ranging from "mournfulness" (for the minor 7th) to "joy" (for the major 3rd). Thus, although the
experimental literature has validated the relation between musical excerpts, intervals, and emotion to some degree, individual
differences in the perception of this affective content have not
been systematically investigated. An auxiliary aim of the present
investigation was to examine the hypothesis that accuracy of
emotion perception in one sensory modality is related to accuracy in others.

RELATION BETWEEN EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE AND PERSONALITY
If emotional intelligence is a type of intelligence, then its
distinguishability from various personality traits found in the
literature must be demonstrated (cf. H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck,
1991). As Mayer and Salovey (in press) have pointed out, "a
trait is a behavioral preference, rather than an ability" (p. 9).
As is the case with many measures of emotional intelligence,
the typical instruments for assessing personality rely on selfreport techniques. If emotional intelligence is to qualify as a
form of intelligence, it must be shown to be independent from
the personality traits assessed by these instruments. The inclusion of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised (EPQR), the Trait-Self Description Inventory (TSDI; Christal, 1994),
and the NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1985) in
each of the three studies (respectively) allowed this issue to be
addressed. These instruments have been shown to provide both
valid and reliable assessments of several personality constructs:
Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism (EPQ-R) and Ex-

traversion, Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and
Openness (NEO Personality Inventory and TSDI).
A number of tests measuring aspects of emotional intelligence
are already known to have moderate to high correlations with
personality constructs. Consider, for example, the four subscales
derived from the Emotional Control Questionnaire (Roger &
Najarian, 1989). Rehearsal (specifically, dissatisfaction with interpersonal encounters and an inability to resolve interpersonal
conflict) has been found to have a significant correlation with
Neuroticism. Similarly, Emotional Inhibition has been found
to have a noteworthy negative correlation with Extraversion.
Furthermore, Benign Control, which is viewed primarily as an
index of impulsivity, correlates with the Psychoticism scale of
the EPQ (Roger & Najarian, 1989). This finding is not surprising given that the Psychoticism scale contains items assessing
an individual's tendency to act impulsively.
Elsewhere, the various subscales of the Toronto Alexithymia
Scale (Bagby, Taylor, & Parker, 1994) have been shown to share
significant negative correlations with Neuroticism, Extraversion,
and Openness (Bagby, Parker, & Taylor, 1994). Note that the
direction of these relations is a function of the fact that this
scale assesses a pathological lack of emotional responsiveness.
Thus, in measuring more appropriate emotional responses, the
Affective Communication Test has been shown to have a significant positive correlation with Extraversion and a negative
correlation with Psychoticism (Friedman et al., 1980).
RELATION BETWEEN EMOTIONAL
INTELLIGENCE A N D SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE
Emotional intelligence is sometimes linked to social intelligence, but the status of the latter construct remains in dispute,
particularly in relation to broad, crystallized abilities. Both
Thorndike (1936) and Woodrow (1939, as cited in O'Sullivan &
Guilford, 1975) found that tests designed to measure social
intelligence had loadings on factors defined by verbal ability.
Moreover, several putative indexes of social intelligence are, in
fact, self-report measures. Considering the overlap in content
between measures of verbal and social intelligence, equivocal
findings would not be unusual. As Mayer and Salovey (1993)
pointed out, social knowledge is required in responding to items
on many verbal intelligence tests. Tn light of the preceding, it
is worth noting that two studies (not included in the data sets
examined by Carroll, 1993) have reported finding a factor of
social intelligence that is orthogonal to verbal abilities. Ford and
Tisak's (1983) results indicated that a social component could
be distinguished from general academic abilities. Marlowe and
Bedell (1982) also claimed that their results support the existence of an independent factor of social intelligence.
The present studies explored the status of emotional intelligence in relation to social intelligence. Clearly, "one's own
and others' emotions" frequently occur in social situations, and
evidence demonstrating a distinction between social and emotional aspects of behavior is required. Thus, the assessment
instruments that were used in the present investigation were
those used in studies in which social intelligence was found
to be independent of other types of intelligence (i.e., Hogan's
Empathy Scale [Ford & Tisak, 1983] and the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory's Social Introversion [Si]

scale [Marlowe & Bedell, 1982]). Furthermore, in Study 3, a
nonverbal test of social intelligence was used (the Interpersonal
Perception Test [Costanzo & Archer, 1993]), which circumvented problems related to shared verbal content.

SUMMARY O F AIMS

Trait Meta-Mood Scale. This instrument comprises 30 items (Salovey et al., 1995). Participants were required to rate the extent to which
they agreed with each item on a 5-point scale ranging from strongly
disagree (1) to strongly agree ( 5 ) . The subscales (and sample items)
are as follows: Attention (13 items; e.g., "The best way for me to handle
my feelings is to experience them to the fullest"), Repair (6 items; e.g.,
"When I become upset I remind myself of all the pleasures in life"),
and Clarity (11 items; e.g., " I almost always know exactly how 1 am
feeling").
Toronto Alexithymia Scale. This self-report scale required participants to provide a true or false response to 20 items (Bagby, Taylor, &
Parker, 1994). The subscales are Difficulty Identifying Feelings (7 items;
e.g., "When I am upset, I don't know if 1 am sad, frightened or angry"),
Difficulty Describing Feelings (5 items; e.g., "I find it hard to describe
how I feel about people"), and Externally Oriented Thinking (8 items;
e.g., "I prefer talking to people about their daily activities rather than
their feelings'').
Emotional Control Questionnaire (short form).
This scale consists
of 32 items selected from Roger and Najarian's (1989) Emotional Control Scale. The 8 items having the highest loadings on a given factor in
that study were chosen to form four subscales: Rehearsal (e.g., " I think
of a way of getting back at people who have made me angry long after
the event has happened"), Emotional Inhibition (e.g., "Expressing my
feelings makes me feel very anxious and vulnerable"), Benign Control
(e.g., "Almost everything I do is carefully thought o u t " ) , and Aggression Control (e.g., "If someone pushed me 1 would push back").
Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy. This scale consists
of 33 questions (Mehrabian & Epstein, 1970). Participants were required
to respond either yes or no to statements indicating whether they would
empathiz£ with a certain individual under a given set of circumstances
(e.g., "1 tend to get emotionally involved with a friend's problems").
EQ Test. In this self-report measure, participants were given 10
different scenarios from which they were required to endorse one of
four choice alternatives (Goleman, 1995). An example follows:

The main aims of the three studies were (a) to examine the
empirical status of both self-report and objective indexes of
emotional intelligence; (b) to determine the relations that emotional intelligence measures have with traditional cognitive abilities, including fluid and crystallized and social intelligence indexes; (c) and to examine the relation between the various sets
of emotional intelligence measures and personality variables,
including assessment of six personality types (Extraversion,
Neuroticism, Psychoticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness,
and Openness). The list of noncognitive constructs also included
those measured by instruments that are not typical tests of personality but nonetheless contained features related to emotional
experience, including measures of mood, thinking-feeling
(as postulated within Jungian terminology), anxiety, and
depression.
STUDY 1
Study 1 was designed to cover as broad a range of emotional
intelligence measures as possible. Consequently, the battery included the majority of self-report and objective indexes of emotional intelligence available in the literature (and on the Internet)
up to the first half of 1996. In this initial study, a strategic
selection of tests of ability and personality was also made. With
respect to human abilities, it was ensured that several measures
of the two major intellective factors of fluid and crystallized
intelligence were present (Horn & Noll, 1994). Most other factors of that theory appear less relevant to an understanding of
the construct of emotional intelligence.1 For personality assessment, one of the more popular self-report measures was used:
the EPQ-R. Finally, two verbal measures of social intelligence
were included within the design. This broad range of measures
should, in principle, allow for meaningful insights into the relations among disparate psychological constructs. All three aims
outlined in the preceding passage were addressed in this first
study.
Method

Participants
One hundred lst-year psychology students from the University of
Sydney participated in the study as part of dieir course requirements.
The sample was predominantly female, with only 13 male participants.
Participants ranged from 18 to 52 years of age (A/= 21.92, SD = 7.67).
The number of "mature age" students (i.e., those older than 25 years
of age) was 10, a figure that would be expected on the basis of University
of Sydney demographic data.

Emotional Intelligence Measures
In total, there were 18 emotional intelligence measures: 13 representing various tests (or subscales) derived from self-report inventories and
5 objective indexes. These tests are described briefly in the sections to

Self-Report Measures

Assume you're a college student who had hoped to get an 'A' in a
course, but you have just found out you got a ' C on the mid-term.
What do you do?
a. Sketch out a specific plan for ways to improve your grade
and resolve to follow through on your plans.
b. Resolve to do better in the future.
c. Tell yourself it really doesn't matter much how you do in the
course, and concentrate instead on other classes where your grades
are higher.
d. Go to see the professor and try to talk her into giving you a
better grade.
Affective Communication Test. This self-report measure contains 13
items (Friedman et al., 1980). For each item, participants indicated, on
a 9-point scale, the extent to which a given statement was either true or
false of them (e.g., " I can easily express emotion over the telephone").

1
The only other potentially interesting broad factor of fluid-crystallized intelligence theory that could be of relevance to emotional intelligence is the tertiary storage and retrieval function (or verbal fluency).
Measures of this ability were not included in our studies to save on
experimental time.

Objective Emotional Intelligence Measures
Self-Awareness Questionnaire. Strictly speaking, this is a non-selfreport measure of motivation, although Catteli used the term objective
for this measure in his writings (see Boyle et al., 1995). Participants
were required to rank order a list of 10 needs (motives) taken from
Cattell et al.'s (1964) Motivation Analysis Test. As a means of avoiding
misunderstanding on the respondents' part, the list replaced Cattell et
al.'s terminology (such as "pugnacity erg") with the following needs:
career success, attachment to parents, alertness to danger, self-indulgent
satisfactions, fulfilling demands of conscience, maintaining social repute,
sexual satisfaction, expressing aggressiveness, social assertiveness, and
affectionate attachment with others. Participants were then required to
complete the Paired Words Test (from Cattell et al.'s [1964] Motivation
Analysis Test). This subtest consists of 48 items. In it, participants were
required to choose, from two words, the word that they believed "went
best" with another word (e.g., position PERMANENT wave).
From their responses on these items, participants received a score for
10 different needs. Because of the differences in item number, these
scores were converted to standard (STEN) scores to enable needs to be
rank ordered. These rank-ordered scores were then compared with the
self-reported rank ordering via Spearman's rank order correlation (rho).
A constant of 1.0 was added to each coefficient to avoid negative correlations. This score was used as an index of self-insight. It was assumed
that the higher the correlation between the paired-word scores and the
self-appraisal scores, the greater the person's insight into his or her own
pattern of needs.
Emotion perception tests. In these tests, originating in the work of
Mayer et al. (1990), participants were presented with 12 facial images,
12colors, 12 excerpts of music, and 12 sound intervals. For each stimulus, participants were provided with a list of six different "emotion
scales": happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust Participants were required to provide ratings, on a 5-point scale ranging from
no emotion present (1) to emotion definitely present (5), of the extent
to which they perceived each emotion to be present in a given stimulus.
All other values were intermediate to these endpoints.
The scoring protocol adopted in these tests is explained in a separate
section. A description of the items composing each test follows.
For the Emotion Perception in Faces Test, six of the facial images
were those used in the Mayer et al. (1990) study. These stimuli were
reproduced from Ekman and Friesen (1975) and were chosen on the
basis that each portrayed one of the six basic emotional expressions
identified by Ekman et al. (1972). References to exact images (corresponding to those provided in Ekman & Friesen, 1975) were as follows:
surprise (Figure 11-A, p. 45), fear (Figure 22-B, p. 62), disgust (Figure
30-B, p. 76), anger (Figure 42-A, p. 97), happiness (Figure 50-B, p.
112), and sadness (Figure D, p. 193). As a means of improving reliability, six additional faces were chosen from Ekman's (1976) Pictures of
Facial Affect to represent each of the underlying emotions. References
to exact images were as follows: anger (WF3-4), disgust (WF3-11),
happiness (JB1-9), sadness (EM4-24), fear (JJ5-13), and surprise
(JJ4-13).
The Emotion Perception in Colors Test consisted of 12 colored A4
cardboard pages presented for 5 s each. Of these stimuli, 6 were chosen
to be as close as possible to those used in the study conducted by Mayer
et al. (1990): brick red, sky blue, emerald green, bright yellow, black,
and white. Six additional colors were selected to obtain more reliable
measures than those obtained previously: purple, fluorescent orange,
lime green, dark blue, dove gray, and hot pink.
For the Emotion Perception in Musical Excerpts Test, musical excerpts
were recorded on an audiocassette and then played through a portable
tape player. The musical excerpts varied in length from 5 to 15 s. Five
of these stimuli were selected from Terwogt and Van Grinsven's (1991)
study. The musical excerpts were the opening bars of Liszt's Totentanz
(anger); part of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, where the "wolf

snapped angrily" (anger); the opening bars of Moussorgsky's Night on
Bare Mountain (fear); the opening bars from the finale of Tchaikovsky's
Swan Lake (sadness); and the opening bars from Bruch's Kol Nidrei
(sadness). Seven additional musical excerpts were selected on the basis
of judgments made by two professional musicians and four nonmusicians. These stimuli were judged to express happiness, fear, disgust, and
surprise. The excerpts were the opening bars of "Peter's Theme" from
Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf (happiness); the opening bars of the
Cruel Sea's "Four" (happiness); Bars 24-32 of the theme from the
movie Psycho (fear); part of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, where
"the wolf is caught by the tail" (surprise); the opening bars of SaintSaens's Persons with Long Ears (surprise); the opening bars from
Aphex TWins' Ventolin (disgust); and the opening from the Revolting
Cocks' Gilacopter (disgust).
In the Emotion Perception in Sound Intervals Test, various sound
intervals were played on a Sony synthesizer by a professional musician
who recorded each interval to audiocassette. The average length of these
intervals was 1 s. The 12 sound intervals selected for investigation were
perfect 5th, perfect 4th, major 2nd, major 3rd, major 6th, major 7th,
diminished 5th, octave, augmented 6th, minor 2nd, augmented 5th, and
minor 3rd.

Cognitive Ability Measures
These measures were derived from the fluid-crystallized intelligence
Quickie Test Battery developed by Lazar Stankov at the University of
Sydney. This test battery has been used extensively with student populations in a series of recent studies (see, e.g., Roberts, Beh, Spilsbury, &
Stankov, 1991; Roberts, Pallier, & Stankov, 1996; Roberts, Stankov,
Pallier, & Dolph, 1997; Stankov & Crawford, 1993; Stankov & Cregan,
1993). Tests from the two subscales representing fluid intelligence and
crystallized intelligence (rather than the entire test battery) were included in the present design. These tests are described subsequently.

Fluid Intelligence Measures
Cattell's Matrices. Participants were required to complete a picture
pattern with the correct solution from a series of six alternatives. Participants were allowed 4 min to complete the 11 items composing the short
form of this test. At the first order of analysis, this test serves as an
index of the Cognition of Figural Relations factor.
Letter Counting Test. In this test, the letters R, S, and T were presented several times on an audiocassette with a delay of 1 s between
each stimulus. Participants were required to mentally count the number
of times each letter was presented and to recall this number at the end
of each trial. The test comprised 12 items. At the first order of analysis,
this task serves as a measure of the Temporal Tracking factor.
Letter Series Test. In this test, which operates as a marker for the
Induction primary factor, the participant's task was to complete a sequence of letters (e.g., "A, B, C, D . . . What comes next?"). The test
consisted of 15 such items.

Crystallized Intelligence
Vocabulary Test. In this test, which is a well-known measure of
the Verbal Comprehension primary factor, participants were required to
choose, from among five alternatives, the word (or phrases) closest in
meaning to a given stimulus item. Participants were allowed 4 min to
complete the 18 items composing this test.
Esoteric Analogies Test. In this test, designed to assess the Cognition
of Semantic Relations primary factor, participants were required to complete a series of verbal analogies. Each item contained four choice alternatives. Participants were given 4 min to complete the 24 items composing this test.
General Knowledge Test. This lest required participants to answer

<-----Page 6----->995

EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN ELUSIVE CONSTRUCT?
a series of 20 multiple-choice questions designed to assess the extent
of their acquired knowledge, particularly in the domains of science, the
humanities, and social sciences. It thus served as a measure of the
General Information primary factor.

Personality Measure: Eysenck's Personality
Questionnaire—Revised
(EPQ-R)
This questionnaire is composed of 106 items. Participants were required to answer yes or no to a series of statements designed to evaluate
various aspects of their personality. The EPQ-R contains four scales
assessing psychoticism, extraversion, neuroticism, and dissimulation
(i.e., Lie).

Measures of Social Intelligence
Hogan's Empathy Scale (abridged). This test, derived from Hogan's Empathy Scale (1968), included 27 of the items selected by Hogan
from Gough's (1964) California Psychological Inventory and 7 items
chosen by Hogan from another pool. Participants were required to respond either true or false to the series of 34 questions (e.g., " I usually
don't like to talk much unless I am with other people I know very
well").
Social Introversion Scale (abridged).
Participants were required to
respond true or false to a series of 66 questions. The test was adopted
from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (Hathaway &
McKinley, 1967). The scale used in the present battery excluded two
items that overlapped with the Hogan Empathy Scale. (These shared
items actually were derived from the California Psychological Inventory). An example is "Most people are honest chiefly through fear of
being caught."'

Scoring Methods for Emotion Perception Tests
Altogether, 288 responses (i.e., ratings on 6 emotion scales for each
of 12 stimuli involving faces, colors, music, or sounds) were obtained
from each participant on the emotion perception tests. These responses
were used to derive four different emotion perception measures by way
of two different scoring methods.
Method A: Degree of convergence with modal response. For the
faces, colors, and music emotion perception tests, the scoring methods
outlined by Mayer et al. (1990) were used to obtain a single measure
representing the degree of accurate emotional perception a participant
exhibited in each content domain. These measures were obtained by
summing the number of times the participant agreed with the modal
(consensual) response. A consensual response on a given emotion scale
was one in which the participant responded within one scale point (on
either side) of the group's modal response.
Three procedures were implemented in an attempt to make these
measures both more valid and reliable. The rationale underlying these
procedures, along with examples that highlight their efficacy, is described subsequently.
First, any items that resulted in more than 50% of the sample not
endorsing the modal response (or values on either side of it) were
excluded. Without implementing this procedure, it would be possible,
under certain circumstances, for consensus to tend toward the direction
of an emotion that was not necessarily endorsed as the modal response.
This procedure ensured that responses involving ambiguous consensual
response were excluded. In turn, this was likely to increase the measure's
reliability. For example, suppose 27 participants respond with 5 to an
anger scale, whereas 9 respond with 4, 13 respond with 3, 26 respond
with 2, and 25 respond with 1. Although 5 would be the modal response,
there are 51 responses of 1 or 2. In this situation, it is obviously questionable whether the modal response is necessarily the consensual response.

Second, stimuli in which a modal response of 1 was obtained on
every emotion scale were discarded (cf. Mayer et al., 1990). The logic
underlying this procedure followed from the fact that the purpose of a
given stimulus was to invoke a certain emotional response. A modal
response of "no emotion present" could thus be construed as a situation
in which that stimulus had not met this requirement.
Third, as a means of allowing greater differentiation between people,
items were excluded whenever there was 100% agreement with the
modal response. For example, an item on which 70 people responded
with a modal response of 2 and 30 participants responded with either a
1 or a 3 does not reveal any individual differences on that scale. Although
Uiis would not affect reliability, such an ilem should nonetheless be
discarded.
After implemention of these culling procedures, the Emotion Perception in Faces Test had a total of 38 items assessing all 12 faces: 2 scored
on two of the emotion scales, 7 scored on three of the emotion scales,
2 scored on four of the emotion scales, and 1 scored on five of the six
emotion scales. However, because of these considerations, only 28 items,
involving six colors, remained of the Emotion Perception in Colors Test:
2 scored on four emotion scales and 4 scored on five emotion scales.
The Emotion Perception in Musical Excerpts Test had a total of 41
items, including 10 musical excerpts: 2 scored on two emotion scales,
1 scored on three emotion scales, 3 scored on four emotion scales, 2
scored on five emotion scales, and 2 scored on all six scales. Finally,
all items of the Emotion Perception in Sound Intervals Test were excluded on the basis of the preceding rationale, because all sound intervals
resulted in a modal response of 1 (no emotion present) across all six
scales. Nevertheless, a separate scoring protocol was adopted for this
test. This protocol is discussed in detail in the section to follow.
Method B: Degree of divergence from "no emotion present." Instead
of assessing degree of consensus, Method B scoring was designed to
assess participants' ability to perceive the presence of emotion on items
in which the consensus was ' 'no emotion present'' but this response was
ambiguous. Thus, with this method, emotion scales from the Emotion
Perception in Sound Intervals lest were included whenever there was
greater than 50% disagreement with the modal response of 1. An answer
of 1 was scored as 0, an answer of 2 was scored as 2, an answer of 3
was scored as 3, and so forth. Consequently, participants who judged
that emotion was definitely present in the sounds scored higher than
participants who were unsure or gave a response of 1 (no emotion
present). A total of 22 items (on which participants could score 0, 2,
3, 4, or 5) remained. Scores on this test ranged from 0 to 110.

Procedure
The tests were generally administered to a group of between 10 and 20
participants over a 2-hr experimental session. All tests were administered
under the direction of Michaela Davies. Objective emotional tests were
scored according to the methods described previously. The data were
analyzed with the SPSS statistical package (Norusis, 1990).

Results
Summary Statistics
The means and standard deviations calculated for each variable are presented in Table 1. In general, the means and standard
deviations for all variables were in agreement with what has
been obtained with the same measures in the past. This was
particularly true of both the cognitive ability and personality
measures that have been used extensively in our own laboratory
(see, e.g., Roberts et al., 1996, 1997; Stankov & Crawford,
1998), as well as abroad (Horn, 1988; Horn & Noll, 1994;
Horn & Stankov, 1982).

Correlations Among Variables
Intercorrelations among the 30 variables are given in Table
2. Inspection of this table reveals that many of the correlations
were consistent with those anticipated. With respect to the emotional intelligence constructs, the correlations were in the expected direction and generally significant. For example, the subscales of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (i.e., Difficulty Identifying Feelings, Difficulty Describing Feelings, and Externally
Oriented Thinking) exhibited negative correlations (ranging between — .02 and —.61) with the subscales of the Trait MetaMood Scale (i.e., Attention, Repair, and Clarity) and positive

correlations with Emotional Inhibition (rs = .08, .46, and .50,
respectively). The Self-Awareness Questionnaire, included as an
objective measure of awareness of one's own feelings evidenced
positive correlations with both Attention (r — .20) and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy (r = .28) and a negative correlation with the Difficulty Identifying Feelings scale (r
— —.20). Attention is a measure of awareness of one's own
emotions, and empathy involves emotional memory and vicariously experiencing another's emotions. Thus, these correlations
validate this new, more objective measure to some degree.
Consideration of these variables in relation to personality
measures indicates that the two domains share a considerable
amount of variance. Neuroticism correlated significantly with
several of the emotional intelligence measures, particularly the
Repair (r = -.46) and Rehearsal (r ~ .47) scales. The order
of magnitude of these correlations was comparable to that found
previously in the literature (e.g., Roger & Najarian, 1989). Similarly, the Affective Communication Test shared a significant correlation with Extraversion (r = .59), a finding consistent with
that observed by Friedman et al. (1980). Furthermore, the Psychoticism scale had significant negative correlations with both
the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy {r = -.30)
and the Benign Control scale (r = .35). These correlations were
as predicted from research postulating relations among empathy,
impulsivity, and Psychoticism (cf. H. J, Eysenck & Eysenck,
1991). Finally, the Aggression Control scale correlated with
Extraversion (r — —.34), a finding having ready parallels in
the available literature (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991). In
sum, each of the correlation coefficients was of a sufficient
magnitude to suggest that emotional intelligence may not be
entirely distinct from personality constructs.
It may also be observed from Table 2 that the magnitudes of
the intercorrelations among each of the four objective emotion
perception measures support Mayer et al.'s (1990) hypothesis
that the perception of consensually judged emotion generalizes
across stimulus domains. However, in outlining the rationale
of the present studies, it was suggested that more emotionally
intelligent participants might be particularly sensitive to emotional content in ambiguous stimuli and disagree with the consensual response when this response w a s ' 'no emotion present.''
If this is the case, then the Emotion Perception in Sound Intervals
Test, for example, would be expected to correlate significantly
and positively with the self-report measures of emotional intelligence. No such pattern of correlations was found in the present
study. Indeed, all of the emotion perception tests failed to correlate with the self-report emotional intelligence measures.2 Inspection of Table 2 indicates that these indexes are independent
from self-report measures of emotional intelligence, as well as
cognitive abilities and personality variables. Taken together, the
pattern and magnitude of correlations currently obtained fail
2
In the Mayer et al. (1990) study, a noteworthy correlation was
reported between the sum of all of the emotional ability measures and
empathy. In this study, the correlations were between each individual
measure and personality (including empathy). Although it would appear
that a composite measure would give a different correlation with a
criterion than its components, this is highly unlikely given the overall
pattern of correlations reported in Table 2 and the results of the factor
analysis reported in Table 3.

<-----Page 8----->EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN ELUSIVE CONSTRUCT?
to support Mayer et al.'s (1990) specific hypothesis that the
components of emotional intelligence form a set of conceptually
interrelated skills.

Exploratory Factor Analysis
A principal-axis exploratory factor analysis with direct
oblimin rotation was performed on the 30 variables shown in
Table 2. The first latent root accounted for approximately 15%
of the total variance in these data, suggesting that the general
factor is very weak. Root 1 criterion suggested that nine factors
might be extracted, but there was a pronounced dip in the plot
of eigenvalues between the eighth and ninth factors. Thus, eight
factors appeared to provide the most parsimonious modeling of
the data. In turn, these eight factors accounted for 64% of the
total variance. The oblimin factor pattern matrix corresponding
to this factor solution is presented in Table 3. Factor interpretation of this solution follows.

Factor 1: Neuroticism
The Neuroticism score from the EPQ-R had a high salient
loading on this factor. In addition, the Repair scale of the Trait
Meta-Mood Scale exhibited a negative loading, whereas the Rehearsal scale from the Emotional Control Questionnaire (short
form) had a salient positive loading. These latter scales measure
aspects of emotional stability and instability, respectively. In
short, the magnitude of each loading suggests that this factor is
undoubtedly Neuroticism. The loading of the Lie scale on this
factor was not entirely unexpected. Elsewhere, Michaelis and
Eysenck (1971) noted that, under conditions in which the Lie
scale exhibits a high negative loading with neuroticism, the scale
is functioning as it should (i.e., serving its intended purpose as
a measure of "faking good").

Factor 2: Psychoticism
The Psychoticism score from the EPQ-R loaded on this factor, and there were negative loadings from the Questionnaire
Measure of Emotional Empathy, the Benign Control and Aggression Control scales, and the EQ Test. Psychoticism captures
aspects of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness (H. J. Eysenck,
1992, 1994a, 1994b), and the former has clear links to interpersonal interactions and therefore to emotional experiences. The
Lie scale also had a low salient (negative) loading on this factor.
This scale may denote some degree of social conformity as well
as dissimulation (S. B. G. Eysenck, Nias, & Eysenck, 1971).
This outcome may, in turn, explain why the Lie scale was factorially complex in the present data set. Because the latent trait
underlying Factor 2 was related to lack of empathy, impulsivity,
and antisocial behavior (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991), the
overall pattern of loadings made interpretation of this factor as
Psychoticism relatively straightforward.

ciability) loaded positively. The positive loading of the Affective
Communication Test, which is thought to be a measure of nonverbal expressiveness, also supports this interpretation of the
extracted factor (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991). These results
have interesting implications for previous studies that claim to
have measured social intelligence independent of verbal abilities. Perhaps this is because social intelligence measures in the
present battery are proxies for extraversion (which, as mentioned previously, is postulated to be orthogonal to the major
human cognitive abilities).

Factor 4: Emotional Clarity
Both emotional clarity (from Salovey et al.'s, 1995, Trait
Meta-Mood Scale) and the Difficulty Identifying Feelings scale
(from Bagby, Taylor, & Parker's, 1994, Toronto Alexithymia
Scale) had salient loadings on this factor. These measures assess
the extent to which individuals both understand and identify
their own emotional state. The salient negative loading of the
Difficulty Describing Feelings scale was not unexpected, considering that one's feelings must be understood if they are to
be described. An inability to understand one's emotions is most
likely also associated with poor control of one's underlying
emotional state (hence the negative loading of the Aggression
Control scale). In addition, Neuroticism had a low loading on
this factor, indicating that neurotics lack insight into their emotional tone and therefore have no clear notion of certain emotional dynamics (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1991).

Factor 5: Emotional Awareness
The Attention subscale (from Salovey et al.'s, 1995, Trait
Meta-Mood Scale) had the highest loading on this factor. This
subscale measures the degree to which individuals notice and
think about their feelings. The Self-Awareness Questionnaire
helped to define this factor in still clearer detail. This outcome
was true also of both the Emotional Inhibition scale (from the
modified Emotional Control Questionnaire) and the ExternallyOriented Thinking scale (from the Toronto Alexythimia Scale),
which had negative loadings. These scales measure inability to
express and to pay attention to one's own emotions (respectively). The pattern and magnitude of loadings from each of
these measures suggest that this factor represents the degree to
which individuals think about and express their feelings. Mehrabian and Epstein's (1970) Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy similarly had a salient loading on this factor.
This result is consistent with a literature suggesting that empathy
involves reexperiencing another's emotions through the self (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). The salient negative loading of the Difficulty Describing Feelings scale lends further support to the present interpretation of this factor. Neuroticism too loaded on Factor
5, indicating that highly neurotic people possess some emotional
insight.

Factor 3: Extroversion
The high loading of the Extraversion score from the EPQ-R
on this factor made its interpretation as Extraversion particularly
unequivocal. The Social Introversion Scale had a negative loading, whereas Hogan's Empathy Scale (measuring degree of so-

Factor 6: Emotion Perception
Salient loadings from all four emotion perception tests on
this factor made its interpretation as Emotion Perception
straightforward. Note that the Emotion Perception in Sound

Intervals Test had a negative loading, because the test involves
the perception of emotion that is not consensually judged to
be present rather than the perception of consensually judged
emotion.

Factor 7: Crystallized Intelligence
This factor was defined by salient loadings from three cognitive ability measures included in the current battery: Vocabulary,
Esoteric Analogies, and General Knowledge.

Factor 8: Fluid Intelligence
This factor was denned by salient loadings from all three
fluid intelligence measures: Letter Counting, Letter Series, and
Cattell's Matrices.

Summary of Factor Analysis
Two factors corresponded to the appraisal and expression of
emotion in the self: Emotional Clarity (Factor 4) and Emotional
Awareness (Factor 5). These two factors are not completely
independent of Neurolicism. A factor was also identified that
corresponds to the perception of consensually judged emotion

in external stimuli (i.e., faces, colors, music, and sounds). On
the basis of the available literature, this factor was interpreted
as Emotion Perception (Factor 6). As hypothesized, the perception of consensually judged emotion generalized across sensory
modalities to define a unifactorial construct. Interestingly, the
objective measures of emotional intelligence (i.e., those defining
the Emotion Perception factor) had no loadings on any other
factors, nor did any other measures have salient loadings on this
factor.
Intercorrelations among each of the eight factors are presented in Table 4. It remains plausible that, if emotional intelligence is akin to intelligence, the three factors defining this construct at the first order will cluster together to form a higher
stratum factor. However, the data presented in Table 4 indicate
low correlations among all factors, such that none exceed .20.
This questions the empirical status of the emotional intelligence
construct as presently defined. Notwithstanding, this result is
somewhat unusual with respect to the two cognitive ability constructs. Moderate correlations between fluid and crystallized
intelligence are generally reported in the literature (Stankov el
al., 1995). The present factor intercorrelation (r = .14) was
certainly at the lower end of this range but not outside that
reported in some studies (e.g., see Horn, 1988). On the basis

of this outcome, it remains plausible that correlations among
all factors will be higher in future studies. Nevertheless, it is
equally plausible that correlations between all variables (except
those between fluid and crystallized intelligence) will remain low.
Discussion
As stated at the outset, the aim of this study was to obtain a
factor or factors corresponding to the components of emotional
intelligence postulated by Salovey and Mayer (1990, 1994; see
also Mayer & Salovey, in press; Mayer et al., 1997; Salovey et
al., 1995). As a means of demonstrating the independence of
the emotional intelligence construct, a collection of measures
from two well-established domains of psychological investigation (i.e., personality and intelligence research) was included
in the design.
Three factors correspond to certain aspects of emotional intelligence outlined by Salovey and Mayer (1990); appraisal of
emotion in the self (i.e., the Emotional Awareness and Emotional
Clarity factors) and appraisal of emotion in external stimuli (i.e.,
the Emotion Perception factor). These emotional intelligence
factors are independent of fluid and crystallized abilities. This
outcome lends tentative support to Mayer and Salovey's (1993)

contention that the set of skills constituting the emotional intelligence domain is conceptually distinct from other types of
intelligence.
The results also indicate that several critical components of
emotional intelligence postulated by Salovey, Mayer, and their
associates might be conceptualized in terms of personality dimensions. For example, regulation of emotion can be understood
in terms of the Neuroticism-Emotional Stability dimension
rather than as an aspect of emotional intelligence. Similarly,
the Affective Communication Test (a putative measure of the
expression of emotion) appears to be measuring an aspect of
Extraversion. Finally, Eysenck's Psychoticism scale encompasses both impulsivity and empathy and, thus, several of the
measures of emotional intelligence currently assessed. Because
extensive research has confirmed the independence of each of
these personality traits from cognitive abilities (see, e.g., Carroll, 1997; H. J. Eysenck, 1994a, 1994b; Saklofske & Zeidner,
1995; Stankov & Crawford, 1998), it could be argued that these
emotional intelligence constructs are not providing anything that
is substantively new to the discipline of psychology.
In the present study, the Extraversion factor encompassed
social intelligence. The high loadings of the social intelligence
measures on the Extraversion factor cast previous findings re-

porting the existence of an independent social intelligence construct in doubt (cf. fluffier, 1997; Guilford, 1967; O'Sullivan &
Guilford, 1975). A limitation of several such studies was the
exclusion of personality measures from the experimental design.
Further research directed toward the adequate assessment of the
social intelligence construct is required before its relation to
emotional intelligence can be considered in a meaningful light.
The perception of consensually judged emotion in external
stimuli clearly defines a unifactorial construct (i.e., Emotion
Perception) that is distinct from all other measures of the current
battery. Although Carroll (1993) regarded the appraisal of emotional content in external stimuli as a type of acquired knowledge, this aspect of emotional intelligence is clearly independent
from crystallized ability. With some reservations (as a result
of the presence of substantial loadings from Neuroticism), the
Emotional Awareness and Emotional Clarity factors also stand
on their own, independent of cognitive abilities, at the very least.
Taken together, the results extend understanding of the emotional intelligence construct (e.g., Mayer et al., 1997; Mayer &
Geher, 1996; Mayer & Salovey, in press; Salovey & Mayer,
1990). Mayer and colleagues' postulation of emotional intelligence suggests that it comprises a set of conceptually related
skills or abilities. The present results demonstrate no relation
between emotion perception (the perception of affective content
in faces and other stimuli) and appraisal of emotion in the self.
Indeed, indexes of emotion perception had near-zero correlations with all other measures of the test battery. Such an outcome
is in direct contrast to previously reported findings by Mayer
and Geher (1996) and Mayer et al. (1990). These authors found
significant correlations among perception of emotional content
and measures of other aspects of emotional intelligence (e.g.,
empathy), but they used a notably smaller battery of tests than
currently used. The present results are in agreement with a more
recent study that failed to find a strong relation between empathy
and the nonverbal identification of emotion (Heng, 1996). If the
emotional intelligence framework comprises a set of conceptually related skills, then such measures should be correlated,
which is clearly not the case.
Under a suitably conservative interpretation, the construct of
emotional intelligence diminishes to include only the Emotion
Perception factor. As operationalized by current measures, this
factor refers to the ability to perceive emotional information in
visual and auditory stimuli. This definition is a more restrictive
one than postulated by proponents of the emotional intelligence
framework. Even here, however, the outcome is not entirely

positive. Indeed, two methodological problems associated with
the measurement of the Emotion Perception trait are readily
apparent.
The first problem is confounding between emotional content
and consensual scoring. In their experiment, Mayer et al. (1990)
were concerned with the ability to perceive consensually judged
emotion, so the criterion for judging correctness of response was
the modal response derived from the total pool of participants.
If emotional intelligence involves the "accurate" appraisal of
emotion (Salovey & Mayer, 1990, p. 185), it might be objected
that a consensual response is not necessarily the most accurate
response. However, research indicates that a consensually judged
emotion is generally that which the target (i.e., the person who
experiences that emotion) is feeling. For instance, when people
are requested to model an angry face, this is typically identified
as anger by judges (Ekman et al., 1972). Although this correspondence between target and consensus tentatively supports the
selection of consensual response as a scoring criterion, it may
also be important to consider responses that are based on consensual scoring but do not involve judgments of emotional
states. In other words, it is important to examine the possibility
that the emergence of the Emotion Perception factor is due to
consensual scoring rather than to the emotional characteristics
of the items included in objective tests of emotional intelligence.
The second problem is that emotion perception measures have
low internal consistency. Although the emergence of the Emotion
Perception factor indicates that a sufficient amount of common
variance exists between the tests that define this factor, there is
a serious possibility that it may be impossible to replicate the
present findings in future studies. This is because Cronbach
alpha coefficients for three of four tests of this factor were low 3 :
.58 for the Emotion Perception in Faces Test, .55 for the Emotion
Perception in Musical Excerpts Test, and .36 for the Emotion
Perception in Colors Test. Because the measurement properties
of these instruments have important implications for the status
of an empirically coherent domain of Emotion Perception, issues
surrounding target and consensual responding were addressed
in Study 3.

STUDY 2
The results of Study 1 point to limitations in the construct
of emotional intelligence, particularly with respect to its mea3
The reliability of the Emotion Perception in Sound Intervals Test
was not calculated because the scoring of this test was notably different
from the other three measures used in Study 1.

surement through self-report instruments. The majority of subjective measures do not appear to assess anything new; they
tend to define factors that are encapsulated by well-established
(and construct-valid) personality inventories. The only exceptions may be the Emotional Awareness and Emotional Clarity
factors, which, although sharing some variance with Neuroticism, have large, salient loadings from self-report measures of
emotional intelligence. The present attempt at replication of this
series of results used 10 self-report emotional intelligence scales
from Study 1. Personality and ability tests, however, were entirely different from those used previously.
A possible limitation of the research conducted in Study 1 is
that personality was examined exclusively with respect to the
Eysenckian paradigm. A competing paradigm views this model
as overly restrictive and, as such, serving as a rather poor representation of the available empirical evidence (Boyle et al., 1995;
Christal, 1994; Costa & McCrae, 1985, 1992; Digman & Inouye,
1986; Goldberg, 1992). This alternative framework postulates five
factors, and hence it is usually referred to as the Big Five model.
New Personality Traits and Instruments
As a means of assessing personality constructs underlying the
Big Five model, Christal*s (1994) TSDI was used in the present
study, whereas the NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae,
1985) was used in Study 3.4 These personality inventories include
scales measuring Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness,
Extraversion, and Neuroticism. Interestingly, some of the items
measuring Openness closely resemble both the Emotional Awareness and Emotional Clarity factors identified in Study 1. For example, there is an obvious similarity between Openness items such as
* 'I seldom notice the moods or feelings that different environments
produce" or "When I am reading poetry or looking at a work of
art I feel a wave of excitement" and items included in both the
Attention scale of the Trait Meta-Mood Scale and the Toronto
Alexithymia Scale. Two of the subscales of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Externally Oriented Thinking and Difficulty Describing reelings), which shared salient loadings on the Emotional
Awareness factor in Study 1, have been reported to correlate
significantly with the Openness dimension (particularly Externally
Oriented Thinking, which shared a correlation of .61). The Difficulty Identifying Feelings scale, which loads on the Emotional
Clarity factor, also correlates with Openness (Bagby, Parker, &
Taylor, 1994). Moreover, higher emotional intelligence is frequently said to covary with internal openness (Mayer & Geher,
1996). It is likely that the Openness dimension of personality may
encompass the reflective aspect of mood experience included in
the emotional intelligence framework. The trait of Agreeableness
also has emotional overtones in that it is frequently interpreted as
a "tendency*' in interpersonal relationships (see, in particular,
Costa, McCrae, & Dye, 1991).
The TSDI was constructed in a way that allows for the measurement of five major dimensions of personality with several
(three to five) subscales each. As a means of examining possible
relations between the self-report emotional intelligence measures and personality in a more detailed way, the present analyses were conducted with the subscales (or facet scales) rather
than the composites frequently calculated from these subscales.
This approach was justified by the findings from Study 1, which

indicate that emotional intelligence constructs may be facets of
personality (and therefore similar to these subscales) on a lower
strata than the five "superfactors" (see Carroll, 1997).
The classical personality dimensions captured by the TSDI
were supplemented in this study by the following instruments
deemed to tap emotion-related aspects of personality from a
perspective not present among the Big Five personality dimensions: Watson, Clark, andTellegen's (1988) Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule-Revised (PANAS-R) and a subscale from
the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (Myers & Myers, 1977). The
first of these two instruments is a measure of momentary mood
(i.e., mood at the time of testing) that is relevant to emotional
intelligence. The latter, on the other hand, assesses participants'
preferences toward rational (thinking) or compassionate (feeling) approaches to life events.
New Ability Tests
Instead of the six marker tests of fluid and crystallized intelligence that were used in Study 1, this study included subscales
of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB),
developed for use by the U.S. Department of Defense. This
battery consists of 10 subtests that, when included within a wide
sample of cognitive tests, appear largely to tap processes of
crystallized intelligence (see Roberts & Goff, 1997). However,
factor analysis of the ASVAB battery on its own often produces
three or four subfactors: acculturated reasoning, quantitative
reasoning, mechanical-practical aptitude, and cognitive speed.
The use of a different set of cognitive ability measures in this
design establishes a reasonably strong argument if the results
from Study 1 are replicated.
Method

Participants
Three hundred U.S. Air Force recruits (97 women) participated in
this study. Participants ranged from 17 to 30 years of age (M = 19.51
SD = 2.11). Sixty-five participants did not have their AS YAH scores
available. For the analyses that follow, their scores were replaced by the
arithmetic mean (as calculated across the remaining participants).5

Emotional Intelligence Measures
In total, there were 10 emotional intelligence measures representing
various tests (subscales) derived from self-report inventories: the Attention,
Repair, and Clarity scales from the Trait Meta-Mood Scale; the Difficulty
Identifying Feelings, Difficulty Describing Feelings, and Externally-Oriented Thinking scales from the Toronto Alexithymia Scale; the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy; the EQ Test; the Affective

4
It should be kept in mind that, even though the TSDI and the NEO
Personality Inventory ostensibly measure the same Big Five factors, the
actual personality models underlying the two inventories may in fact
differ in a nontrivial manner. The issue of similarities and differences
between the inventories is not of major importance in this study, although
there is some evidence indicating that the former has greater construct
and predictive validity (Christal, 1994; P. C. Kyllonen, personal communication, January 1998),

Note that fitting the data to this reduced sample does little to alter
the resulting solution reported in Table 6.

Communication Test; and the Self-Awareness Questionnaire (see the
Method section of Study 1 for descriptions). Note that Toronto Alexithymia
Scale subscale items and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy
were dichotomously scored in Study 1. In the present study, a more sensitive
5-point rating scale replaced this scoring system.

Cognitive Ability Measures: ASVAB Subscales
After informed consent had been obtained from each Air Force enlistee
participating in the investigation, data from the ASVAB (U.S. Department of Defense, 1984) were made available. This test battery had been
administered 2 - 6 months earlier as part of each enlistee's formal Air
Force admission requirements (i.e., applicants are selected on the basis
of their score on the ASVAB). The ASVAB consists of 10 subtests.
The Coding Speed measure is an 8-min, speeded test. An item consisted
of a word followed by five 4-digit number strings, for example, "green
(a) 6456; (b) 7150; (c) 8385; (d) 8930; (e) 9645." The participant's
task was to look up the word's number code in a key consisting of 10
word-code pairs placed at the top of the page and then select the letter
associated with that number code. Coding speed consisted of 84 such
items.
The Numerical Operations measure is a 3-min, speeded test. The participant's task was to respond to 50 (simple) number-fact items, for example,
" 2 x 6 = ? (a) 4; (b) 8; (c) 3; (d) 12." The General Science test consists
of 25 science-fact items, such as "Which of the following foods contain
the most iron? (a) eggs, (b) liver, (c) candy, or (d) cucumber."
The Word Knowledge test contains 35 standard vocabulary items,
such as "The wind is variable today, (a) mild, (b) steady, (c) shifting,
or (d) chilling." In the Paragraph Comprehension test, participants are
presented with 15 paragraphs, each one to three sentences long, followed
by a multiple-choice response question about the paragraph's content
(see U.S. Department of Defense, 1984, for an example from the test).
The Mathematics Knowledge test consists of 25 arithmetic word problems (primarily algebra but also questions concerning area, square roots,
percentages, and simple geometry), for example, "If 3x = - 5 , then x
= (a) - 2 , (b) - 5 / 3 , (c) - 3 / 5 , or (d) 3/5." The Arithmetic Reasoning
test consisted of 30 arithmetic word problems, for example, "Pat put
in a total of 16 hours on a job during 5 days of the past week. How
long is Pat's average workday? (a) 3 hours, (b) 3 hours, 2 minutes, (c)
3 hours, 18 minutes, or (d) 3 hours, 25 minutes."
The Mechanical Comprehension test comprises 25 questions, normally accompanied by drawings. These questions relate to general mechanical and physical principles.
The Electrical Information test contains 20 questions relating to electrical, radio, and electronics information. Finally, the Auto and Shop
Information (Autoshop) test consists of 25 questions about automobiles,
shop practices, and the conventional use of mechanical tools.

Personality Measures
Trait-Self Description Inventory
This two-section inventory was designed to assess the Big Five personality factors. In the first part, 64 trait names (e.g., "thorough") are
presented one after the other. Participants were required to indicate, on
a Likert scale, how characteristic the trait was of themselves as compared
with other individuals of the same sex and age. Nine possibilities were
given (ranging from extremely not characteristic of me to extremely
characteristic of me). In the second part, participants were given 99
behavioral statements and asked to indicate the extent to which they
disagreed (or agreed) with each assertion (e.g., "I like parties where
there are lots of people"). As was the case with trait names, responses
ranged along a 9-point scale (very strongly disagree to very strongly

agree).
Thereafter, trait and behavioral responses were used (in various theo-

retically based "mixtures" that, in turn, have been supported by exploratory factor analysis of several large data sets) to generate five composites. These composites represent the superfactors of Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Openness, and Neuroticism. It was also
possible to derive subcomposites representing lower order facets of these
higher order constructs. These subcomposites of the Big Five (which
were used in subsequent analyses) were as follows: nervous and stressed,
worrying, irritable, envious and jealous (Neuroticism); shy and bashful,
talkative, socially active, assertive, unsociable (Extraversion); philosophical, scientific interest, creative, reflective, cultured (Openness);
efficient and dependable, hard working, organized (Conscientiousness);
and warm and sympathetic, friendly, considerate, cold and insensitive,
helpful (Agreeableness). A validation study of 2,853 Air Force enlistees
provided a large reference group with which isolated studies (such as
the present one) may be compared (Christal, 1994).

Self-Report Psychopathy Scale
This scale, developed by Hare (1980), consists of 60 items. Participants were required to rate each statement on a 7-point scale ranging
from disagree

strongly

( 1 ) to agree strongly

( 7 ) . An example is " I

almost never feel guilty over something I've done." This scale exhibited
relatively low reliability in the present data set (a - .562). Accordingly,
it was not used in further analyses of the current test battery.

Myers-Briggs

Type Indicator: Thinking/Feeling Scale

This scale, developed by Myers and Myers (1977), comprises 23
items. In Part 1 (16 items), participants were required to choose the
word in each pair that appealed to them more (e.g., firm-minded or
warm-hearted. In Part 2 (7 items), participants were required to choose
which one of two responses came closer to describing how they usually
feel or act (e.g., "Do you feel it is worse to be: A. unsympathetic, or
B. unreasonable?").

Mood Measure: PANAS-R
This self-report schedule required participants to denote the extent to
which, at the time of testing, they perceived themselves to be experiencing certain mood (i.e., affective) states (e.g., "At this moment, how
alone do you feel?"). The test was adapted for present administration
from the original PANAS developed by Watson et al. (1988; see Christal,
1994). The schedule consists of 45 items presented one after the other.
Participants were required to indicate their response on a 5-point rating
scale (slightly or not at all to extremely).
The PANAS-R provided scores on four scales of negative affect (Guilt,
Fear, Hostility, and Sadness) and three scales of positive affect (Joviality,
Self-Assurance, and Attentiveness). It also contained a number of filler
statements that were not scored in the protocol (e.g., "At this moment,
how interested do you feel?"). In addition, composites from each of
the scales, representing positive and negative mood stale (present), were
obtained. These two (total) scores were used in the present study.

Procedure
The tests were generally administered to groups of 40 participants
over a 2-hr experimental session. Rest periods of 5 min were given after
40 min of work.

Note. Dashes indicate that reliability was not obtained for a particular test.
The Self-Awareness Questionnaire was used to derive a score reflecting selfinsight. The Cronbach alpha value for this test could not be calculated.
Statistics for the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale have been omitted because
of the low reliability found for this test (see text). Note also that discrepancies
in means between Table 1 and Table 5 reflect differences in the way common
tests were scored. PANAS = Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule.

we calculated Cronbach alpha coefficients for 9 of 10 self-report
measures of emotional intelligence. These values, along with
means and standard deviations, are presented in Table 5.
Clearly, three of the nine questionnaire measures of emotional
intelligence exhibited unsatisfactory reliabilities: Difficulty Describing Feelings, Externally Oriented Thinking, and the EQ
Test. Of interest, both Difficulty Describing Feelings and Externally Oriented Thinking had loadings on the Emotional Awareness factor of Study 1, and Difficulty Describing Feelings had
a loading on the Emotional Clarity factor. The present results
cast doubt on the veracity of these earlier findings. Because of
the questionable psychometric properties of these three scales,
each was omitted from subsequent factor analysis.

Factor Analysis
The correlational matrix for the remaining 43 variables was
analyzed using the maximum-likelihood procedure and PROMAX rotation.6 Root 1 criterion suggested 10 factors, but there
was a pronounced dip in the plot of eigenvalues between the
9th and 10th factors. Thus, 9 factors appeared to provide the
most parsimonious account of the data. All factor pattern coefficients from that solution are presented in Tables 6 and 7.
The nine factors divided naturally into two major groupings.
The first five factors were clearly related to personality dimensions. These factors were interpreted as Neuroticism (Factor 1),
Extraversion (Factor 2 ) , Agreeableness (Factor 3), Openness
(Factor 4 ) , and Conscientiousness (Factor 5). High loadings
from the subscales that entered the corresponding composites
allowed clear interpretation of personality constructs. With respect to measures of emotional intelligence, Factors 1 - 3 shared
some common variance, but Factors 4 and 5 did not. It is worth
noting that the Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness
factors differ from those in Study 1 in the sense that the highest
loading for each was on a personality subscale. Thus, no Emotional Clarity or Emotional Awareness factors could be identified
within this solution.
Cumulatively, the results examined to this point suggest that
self-report measures of emotional intelligence are related to
Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Psychoticism (Study 1), as well
as Agreeableness (Study 2). As mentioned earlier, Agreeableness represents a part of Eysenck's Psychoticism factor. Despite
expectations to the contrary. Openness was not related lo Emotional Awareness in this study (however, see Study 3). The
present finding may be due to the fact that two measures of the
Emotional Awareness factor in Study 1 were unreliable in this
study and were therefore excluded from factor analysis. Alternatively, it must be recalled that the present battery contained a
wider sampling of the personality domain.
The ASVAB defined four factors in this study. These factors
were similar to those frequently reported in the literature in
analyses of this battery (see Carroll, 1993, pp. 698-699; Roberts & Goff, 1997). Thus, Factor 6 is best interpreted as Technical Knowledge, resembling the mechanical-practical factor
(k:m) in Vernon's (1950) theory of intelligence. Factor 7 is

EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN ELUSIVE CONSTRUCT?

Perceptual Speed, although it may also be interpreted as broad
speediness function (see Roberts & Goff, 1997). Factor 8 represents Quantitative Ability (Horn & Noll, 1994), and Factor 9 is
a Verbal Ability factor. Among the four ASV\B-related factors,
only this last factor had loadings from the emotional intelligence
measures. It should be noted, however, that this was a rather
weak factor in the sense that all salient loadings were below
.50. If anything, emotional intelligence was related to verbal
ability, but, as with the personality factors, the magnitude of
loadings from ASV\B variables was broadly similar to the magnitude of loadings from the emotional intelligence measures.
Thus, understanding some of the concepts composing the emotional intelligence tests seemingly requires a high level of crystallized ability. Interestingly, this outcome could emanate from
knowledge of the meanings of words rather than being dependent on shared pathways for processing verbal and emotionally
laden information.
Discussion
The majority of self-report measures of emotional intelligence
(six of nine) demonstrated satisfactory reliability. Those measures that lacked sufficient reliability were excluded from further consideration. The exclusion of unreliable variables reduced
the chance of replicating at least one of the previously elucidated
emotional intelligence factors (i.e., Emotional Awareness; see
Study 1, particularly Table 3).
The present series of results indicates what emotional intelligence is likely not. Self-report measures of emotional intelligence are not related to either the Openness or Conscientiousness dimensions of personality, nor do they appear to be related
to the mechanical-practical, perceptual speed, or quantitative
abilities of the ASVAB. They are related to Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and verbal ability. Only one of the nine
extracted factors (verbal ability) of this study exhibited high
salient loadings from emotional intelligence measures. In contrast to Study 1, both the Emotional Clarity and Emotional
Awareness constructs had lower loadings from the personality
traits than they did from emotional intelligence measures. This
result may be a consequence of the wider sampling of personality constructs undertaken in Study 2.
The absence of a meaningful relation between emotional and
crystallized intelligence in Study 1, along with generally low
salient loadings on the verbal ability factor of this study, suggests
that the linkage between cognitive abilities and emotional intelligence is weak. On the other hand, both studies show that questionnaire measures of emotional intelligence are related to personality traits.

then tests in which a consensual response is required, but emotional content is minimized, should not define (i.e., share salient
loadings on) the same factor.
In Study 1, participants were required to rate the extent to
which each emotion was present in each stimulus on a 5-point
rating scale. It is possible that the subjectivity involved in judging the extent to which each of the six emotions was present in
a given stimulus may have contributed to the unsatisfactory
reliability of Emotion Perception measures in Study 1. As a
means of eliminating this potential artifact, the participants involved in Study 3 judged which one of the six emotions was
present in a given stimulus.
Furthermore, to avoid the problems associated with using
consensual response as a scoring criterion, we used a different
(i.e., "target") scoring protocol for two of the measures included in the current design. A correspondence among target,
consensus, and expert judgment may provide a way of increasing the accuracy of the scoring criterion, although this is not
always possible to achieve (see Mayer & Geher, 1996). A new
measure—the Voices Test—comprised a series of statements
in which actors expressed different emotions. Agreement with
the emotion that the actors themselves felt they were expressing
was used as the correctness of response criterion. If the consensual response is the accurate response, then correspondence between consensus and target (the person experiencing the emotion) should be high. For the Faces Test, agreement with emotions given by Ekman and Friesen (1975) was used as the
criterion. Thus, it was assumed that scoring with respect to a
target rather than consensus provides a potentially better criterion for a correct solution. Both tests were also scored in the
consensual manner.
Method

Participants
One hundred thirty-one 1 st-year psychology students from the University of Sydney participated in the study as part of their course requirements. Thirty-three of these participants were men. The sample ranged
from 17 to 55 years of age (M = 21.06, SD = 6.10). The number of
"mature age" students (i.e., those older than 25 years) was 20.

Emotion Perception Measures
In total, four measures of Emotion Perception were used in this study.
For each of these measures, participants were required to choose which
of the six emotions was most strongly present in each stimulus. The
various methods used to score each test are described later.

Faces Test
STUDY 3
Given the largely negative findings with self-report measures,
the primary purpose of Study 3 was to assess whether the Emotion Perception factor defined in Study 1 represented anything
other than a method factor produced by using consensual response in the scoring protocol. To this end, four new tests were
included in which participants were required to make nonemotional judgments about neutral stimuli (e.g., identify the leadership style characterizing a particular country). If emotional content is the critical feature defining the Emotion Perception factor,

In this test, 24 faces, portraying the aforementioned six emotions,
were each presented on a computer screen for a period of 2 s. Twelve
of these faces were those used in the Emotion Perception in Faces Test
of Study 1. Tb improve the reliability of measurement of these emotional
expressions, we chose 12 additional faces from Ekman (1976).

Voices Test
In this test, 36 emotional statements expressed by professional actors
were presented through headphones on a computer. All six emotional
states were represented in these stimuli to an equal extent. R>r 12 items,

Raven, 1979). The crystallized intelligence measures were tests used
in Study 1: the Vocabulary Test, Esoteric Analogies Test, and General
Knowledge Test.

Scoring Methods for the Emotion Perception and
Consensual Response Tests

Personality Measure: NEO Personality Inventory

Note that the Clothing Test and, more strongly, the Leadership Styles
and Taste tests contain elements that may provide a culturally sanctioned
correct answer. They are therefore similar to measures of crystallized
abilities. However, because too many items in these tests are ambiguous
(and could not yield a single correct score), the consensual method of
scoring was the method singularly used in all of these tests.

Method A: Degree of Convergence With Modal
Response
A participant's score on each of the eight measures just described
was obtained by summing the number of times the participant agreed
with the modal (consensual) response identifying which emotion was
most strongly present in each stimulus. Items in which the difference
between the modal response and the second most frequent response
was less than 5% were excluded, ensuring the exclusion of ambiguous
consensual responses. After implementation of this procedure, the Rices
Test (consensus) had a total of 24 items, the Voices Test (consensus)
had 19 items, the Colors Test had 8 items, the Musical Excerpts Test
had 6 items, the Professions Test had 10 items, the Clothing Test had 9
items, the Leadership Styles Test had 10 items, and the Taste Test had
12 items.

Method B: Degree of Convergence With Target
Response
Another measure was derived from the Faces and Voices tests in which
a participant's score was obtained by summing the number of times the
participant agreed with the target response. For the Voices Test (36
items), the target response was the emotion the actors felt themselves
to be expressing in each statement. For the Faces Test (24 items), the
target was the emotion listed in Ekman and Friesen's (1975) Pictures
of Facial Affect Test.

This questionnaire, developed by Costa and McCrae (1985), is composed of 106 items. Participants were required to answer a series of
statements designed to evaluate various aspects of their personality on
a 5-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The
inventory contains five scales measuring the superfactors (Neuroticism,
Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness). To examine the relation between the emotion perception measures and measures of constructs that contain emotional content but are not captured
adequately by the personality subscales just listed, we included seven
additional questionnaires.7

Social Intelligence: The Interpersonal Perception Task
In this test, developed by Costanzo and Archer (1993), participants
watched a 20-min videotape containing 15 brief scenes. Participants
were required to answer the multiple-choice question corresponding to
each scene, for example, a videotaped scene showing two adults having
a conversation with two 7-year-old children paired with the question
"Who is the child of the two adults?" (only the little boy, only the little
girl, or neither child).

Self-Report Measures of Emotional Intelligence
Trait Meta-Mood Scale and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional
Empathy (see Study I) were used as self-report measures.

Additional Measures of Personality Traits
Two other personality measures were used: the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (Hare, 1980) and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Thinking/
Feeling scale. The former, although administered to participants in Study
3, was not included in statistical analyses as a result of its poor reliability
(see Study 2).

State Anxiety and Depression Measures
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y-I

Cognitive Ability Measures
To retain comparability with the first two studies, we included a
battery of four ability tests. Three previously used measures of crystallized intelligence and one measure of fluid intelligence were included.
The fluid intelligence measure was Raven's Progressive Matrices Test,
a popular nonverbal measure of fluid intelligence (see Raven, Court, &

they felt "right now, at this moment" in terms of each statement on a

example is "I feel tense."

Crystallized intelligence measures

The means and standard deviations for all scores and the
reliabilities of each of the emotion perception measures (scored
with respect to target emotion and consensus) are presented in
Table 8. Table 8 also includes reliabilities for each of the measures involving consensual judgment of stimuli that do not contain a strong emotional component.
It is evident from Table 8 that the only measure having an
acceptable level of reliability was the Faces Test, in particular,
as measured under conditions of target agreement (a = .71).
Under the consensual scoring condition, this test had a lower
reliability (a — .66), one similar to that obtained in Study 1
(a - .55). Mayer et al. (1990) reported a reliability coefficient
of .63 for this test, indicating that its poor reliability is not
simply constrained to the present sample(s). The reliability of
the Voices Test (under the target condition of scoring) increased
from .45 to .63 when 12 items (one third of all items composing
this test) were discarded. This was the only test in the battery
that might benefit from the exclusion of items in such a post
hoc manner. The correlations between target and consensual
agreement scoring were .99 for the Faces Test and a rather lowly
.48 for the Voices Test. It appears that, possibly as a result of
lower reliabilities evidenced in the component scores, the two
forms of scoring share much less common variance for the
Voices Test than for the Faces Test.

Correlations
Correlations between all variables are given in Table 9. The
measures with unsatisfactory reliabilities were excluded from
this analysis. In general, the correlations were in accordance
with those reported in the literature. For example, Mayer et al.
(1990) reported that the Faces Test correlates moderately with
empathy, a finding having ready parallels in the present correlation matrix in which the Faces Test (target) and the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy shared a significant correlation (i.e., r — .24).

Factor Analysis
Given the fact that most measures of the (putative) Emotion
Perception factor and nonemotional measures scored in a consensual manner had to be excluded because of poor reliability,
the aim of factor analysis in this study was not to seek evidence
for the existence of interpretable factors. Rather, the aim was to
examine a possible location of the only reasonably reliable emotion perception test (i.e., the Faces Test) within the personality
and ability domains. Two outcomes were possible: (a) The Faces
Test may load on a factor defined by the other measures of the
battery or (b) the Faces Test may have low communality. In the
latter case, the existence of a trait of Emotion Perception remains
viable if reliable measures become available. The results of

factor analysis (principal axis followed by PROMAX rotation)
are presented in Tables 10 and 11. Although the Root 1 criterion
indicated six factors, we report a five-factor solution, because
the six-factor solution produced a singlet. It is apparent from
Table 10 that the communality of the Faces Test is low (only
.16), and therefore a large amount of its variance remains unaccounted for. Most of its common variance was accounted for
by Factor 5. That is, the possibility remains that a valid construct
of Emotion Perception might be identified, on the proviso that
additional, reliable measures of this trait are capable of being
constructed. Interpretation of each factor follows.

Factor 1: Neuroticism-Introversion
Neuroticism had a high positive loading on this factor, and
Extraversion had a high negative loading. Agreeableness and
Conscientiousness also had loadings on this factor. In addition,
the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Trait Meta-Mood Scale measure aspects of mood
and emotionality. Taken together, these loadings suggest that this
factor may represent a mood factor mediated by personality
variables. Alternatively, of course, this may be a broad "personality" factor, because four of the five personality scales had
salient loadings on Factor 1 (see Carroll, 1997).

emotional intelligence have much common variance with established personality traits.

Factor 3: Crystallized Intelligence
The Vocabulary, Esoteric Analogies, and General Knowledge
Tests had salient loadings on this factor. Given that these tests
define three distinct primary abilities composing a second-stratum crystallized intelligence construct, interpretation of this factor as measuring depth and breadth of acculturated intelligence
would appear unequivocal. This result replicates a similar factor
in Study 1.

Factor 4: Fluid Intelligence
Raven's Progressive Matrices Test had the most salient loading on this factor, with the Esoteric Analogies Test showing
some overlap. This is a very common finding in our work indicating that the factor is, indeed, a cognitive ability. The presence
of Openness here was not unexpected either; among the Big
Five personality traits, Openness (or Intellect, as it is sometimes
called) shares the most pronounced relation with cognitive abilities (see McCrae, 1996). In Study 2, for example, the "creative' ' subscale of Openness had a significant loading on the
Technical Knowledge factor.

Factor 2: Thinking-Feeling
The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator thinking and feeling dimensions had high positive and negative loadings on this factor.
In Study 2, these two measures loaded on the Agreeableness
factor. In this study, however, Conscientiousness shared some
communality with these two indexes. The loading of the Questionnaire Measure of Emotional Empathy on this factor replicated the major finding of Study 2: Self-report measures of

Factor 5: Social Intelligence
This was the weakest factor of this study, with no loadings
above .50. Indeed, the two measures (the Faces Test and the
Interpersonal Perception Task) demonstrating the lowest communalities within the battery loaded on this factor. Note from
Table 9, however, that the actual correlation between these measures was - . 0 9 , indicating that the factor captured an extremely

weak empirical relation among the variables in question. The
Interpersonal Perception Task is usually seen as a new measure
of social intelligence (Costanzo & Archer, 1993), and it is possible that the ability to detect emotions in photographs is relevant
for the identification of the relation between individuals in social
situations. In fact, given the negative correlation and different
signs of factor loadings, poor perception of emotions in photographs seems to be associated with good performance on the
test. The present interpretation of this factor is very tentative at
this stage.8
Discussion
Replication of the findings of Study 1, in which a distinct
Emotion Perception factor was found, could not be achieved in
the present study. The reason for this outcome was implied in
the initial study and became more readily apparent within the
current data set: Consensually scored tests have low reliability.
This finding constitutes a major difficulty for proponents wishing to claim that emotional intelligence is either a personality
trait or a type of ability. If it is either, it cannot yet be measured
in a dependable way. Of the two tests that could be scored with
respect to the target emotion, one (Faces Test) has satisfactory

reliability. The other (Voices Test) has low reliability and, hence,
can be improved only by excluding more than one third of the
items. Although it is possible that the items that remained in
the test will show higher reliability in cross validation with
another sample of participants, it would appear injudicious to
assume that this outcome will necessarily occur. Our concern
is that, with a different sample of participants, even the items
remaining in the test will be unreliable. Extending the logic of
this argument, the Voices Test was excluded from consideration
in the factor analysis currently reported.
When factor analyzed together with a selection of personality
and ability measures, the Faces Test had both low communality
and a low salient loading on a factor tentatively interpreted as
Social Intelligence. These findings suggest that perhaps, when
reliable measures of emotion perception have been developed,
it will be possible to identify an Emotion Perception factor.
Interestingly, the only putative measure of social intelligence in
this study, the Interpersonal Perception Task, also had rather low
communality.
Both raw correlations and factor intercorrelations presented
in Tables 10 and 11 indicate that there may be problems in
interpreting the Faces Test as a measure of ability. In particular,
this test (as well as the Social Intelligence factor on which it
loaded) has correlations with the traditional measures of ability
that differ in sign. Positive manifold, therefore, may be violated
with the Emotion Perception measures.
The other factors identified in this study were as expected
given the composition of the test battery. Indeed, the factors of
fluid and crystallized intelligence replicated the findings of
Study 1, and the Thinking-Feel ing factor represents a replicas

social intelligence factor.

tion of a similar factor in Study 2. The Neuroticism-Introversion (or broad personality) factor did not appear in the previous
studies, because the pattern of correlation with personality tests
usually points to relative independence between these traits. In
accordance with the findings of Study 1, this personality factor
had no relation to the Faces Test.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
There has been intense media interest in emotional intelligence during the 1990s. This article represents an attempt to
separate certain facts from fiction in the emotional intelligence
debate. The pivotal question is: What remains of emotional intelligence when both intelligence and personality are also assessed?
In this section, an attempt is made to bring together the findings from all three studies so as to reach a conclusion regarding
the status of emotional intelligence. The findings are based on
a relatively large number of participants (JV = 531) who differed
in terms of educational experiences (university students vs. Air
Force recruits), gender, and country of origin (United States vs.
Australia). Our findings are also based on a comprehensive set
of instruments that have been proposed for the study of emotional intelligence and on a varied sample of measures of personality and human abilities. Nevertheless, the results are remarkably consistent. It is convenient to summarize our findings in
relation to the self-report and objective measures. This division
emerged in Study 1 and was reinforced further by the results
of two subsequent studies. Although the empirical evidence with
these two vehicles of measurement led to a conclusion that the
empirical status of emotional intelligence is questionable, the
reasons for such a conclusion differ depending on the types of
instruments used. After considering the overall empirical evidence, an attempt is made to relate theoretical accounts endorsed
by those proponents who see emotional intelligence as a type
of ability.

What Is the Status of Self-Report Measures of
Emotional Intelligence?
Studies 1 and 2 indicate that all proposed self-report measures
of emotional intelligence are problematic for one of the following two reasons. First, some of the self-report measures have
poor reliability. Two measures from the popular Toronto Alexithymia Scale (Difficulty Describing Feelings and ExternallyOriented Thinking; Bagby, Taylor, & Parker, 1994), as well as
the EQ Test (Goleman, 1995), are unreliable. All other selfreport measures used in these two studies exhibit satisfactory
reliability. Second, all self-report measures having satisfactory
reliabilities tend to load on well-known personality factors. For
example, after the exclusion of the unreliable measures in Study
2, the Emotional Awareness and Emotional Clarity factors that
were identified in Study 1 disappeared. Therefore, if emotional
intelligence were to be defined only in terms of the self-report
measures used in the present series of studies, it would be
concluded that emotional intelligence is indistinguishable from
established personality traits. This finding is not surprising. After
all, because most self-report personality (see Saklofske &
Zeidner, 1995) scales fail to correlate with intelligence, why

should self-report measures of emotion-related personality attributes correlate with intelligence?
What Is the Status of the Objective Measures That
Define the Emotion Perception Factor?
It has been suggested, from the outset, that to investigate the
emotional intelligence construct, it is necessary to develop tests
that directly measure this construct, rather than tests measuring
self-descriptions of how emotionally intelligent a given individual assesses himself or herself to be. Studies 1 and 3 indicate
that most objective measures of the Emotion Perception factor
have extremely low reliabilities and do not satisfy accepted
psychometric standards. The reason appears to be related to
the consensual scoring procedure used with such measures. In
particular, the Faces Test of Study 3, based on target rather
than consensual scoring, is the only test that shows reliability
approaching an acceptable level. One test is not enough to define
a factor. In the absence of additional reliable measures, it cannot
even be concluded, unequivocally, that an independent Emotion
Perception factor exists.9
Although the problem of reliable measurement appears to be
more severe with objective (rather than self-report) measures,
identification of the aforementioned Emotion Perception factor
provides some hope for proponents of the emotional intelligence
framework. Thus, in spite of low reliabilities, a separate Emotion
Perception factor did appear in Study 1, whereas the Faces Test
shared only a very small amount of common variance with the
rest of the test battery of Study 3. The work of other researchers
(see Mayer et al., 1990, 1997) also suggests that such measures
may compose a distinct factor. Thus, if new, reliable tests were
to be constructed, a stronger factor might emerge. It is important
to note, however, that scoring based on the more reliable target
procedure is possible only with a limited number of tasks. Some
of the tasks currently used (e.g., colors and tonal intervals)
cannot be scored according to any form of target criterion. In
fact, seeing emotions in colors and sounds is different from
knowing what another person feels. This criterion is available
only if an actor, an author, or the like produces a stimulus that
contains a particular emotional state.
It is difficult to assess the status of other aspects of emotional
intelligence until more objective measures are developed. However, determining what is the correct response to an emotional
intelligence test item presents practical and theoretical difficulties. In a recent study attempting to address this issue, Mayer
and Geher (1996) investigated the relations among consensus,
target, and expert judgment. Although high correlations among
the three scoring criteria are frequently reported for the faces

9
Tt is necessary to mention that Mayer et al. (1997) reported higher
reliabilities for the consensually scored tests (including the Faces Test
and the Musical Excerpts Test) than those obtained in the present series
of studies. Apart from differences in the stimuli used and participants
involved, there was also a subtle difference in the methods used for
consensual scoring. Because scoring formulas generally do not lead to
an improvement in reliability (the increase in the number of items does),
the differences in reliabilities between Mayer et al.'s (1997) and the
present studies have to be attributed to variations in the stimuli used
and participants taking part.

<-----Page 24----->EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE: AN ELUSIVE CONSTRUCT?

stimuli used in the present investigation (Ekman et al., 1972),
Mayer and Geher (1996) found them to be uncorrelated. However, the stimulus used in their study was textual, and the ability
was referred to as Emotion Identification (not Perception). The
task is to evaluate a self-report protocol given by a person (target) conveying how she or he felt about a particular event. Such
a test is similar in content to the social intelligence measures
criticized by Cronbach (1960) as measuring nothing more than
verbal knowledge.
Is Emotion Perception a Potential Ability?
In a recent article, Mayer et al. (1997) argued that emotional
intelligence meets traditional criteria for an intelligence. They
used three criteria for an ability: (a) the existence of a correct
solution to a given task, (b) positive correlations among measures, and (c) developmental change (i.e., the abilities of an
intelligence should develop with age and experience). The present data speak to the first two criteria only. In addition, given
the results of the present studies, discussion needs to be limited
to the Emotion Perception factor, not emotional intelligence in
a broader sense.
To some, cognition and emotion are contradictory, and therefore a claim that emotional intelligence is an ability is construed
as theoretically indefensible. This attitude is questionable, because Salovey and Mayer's (1990) definition, at least in relation
to monitoring other people's emotions and discriminating
among them, satisfies a commonly held position on what is
meant by the term ability. Ability (cognitive or physical) refers
to variations in performance among individuals who are given
tasks that vary in difficulty. A cognitive task is "any task in
which correct or appropriate processing of mental information
is critical to successful performance" (Carroll, 1993, p. 10).
In principle, therefore, emotion perception would appear to constitute an ability. However, other aspects of emotional intelligence (e.g., monitoring one's own emotions and the use of
information on emotional state to guide thinking and actions)
may be difficult to measure as a result of problems in defining
a correct response.
Because the processing of affective information is considered
to be an ability, the Emotion Perception factor might be expected
to share moderate correlation with other cognitive ability factors.
Nevertheless, as pointed out by Mayer et al. (1997), it should
also retain some unique variance. However, this proposition is
difficult to assess with the data from Studies 1 and 3. In Study
1, even allowing for inevitable range restriction, relatively low
correlations were obtained between the traditional fluid and
crystallized intelligence factors. Because all of the correlations
were unusually low in Study 1, definitive conclusions cannot be
drawn from the low correlation between fluid and the crystallized intelligence factors and the Emotion Perception factor.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that the emotion perception and
cognitive ability measures do not have a significant correlation.
In Study 3, the Faces Test showed low correlations with the
other cognitive ability measures. Interestingly, however, the signs
of the correlation coefficients differed; the crystallized intelligence tasks resulted in negative correlations, whereas the fluid
intelligence task showed a positive correlation. This outcome
would appear contrary to Gunman's (1992; see also Guttman &

1013

Levy, 1991) "first law of intelligence," which claims that all
ability measures are positively correlated (i.e., exhibit positive
manifold). In turn, this suggests that the Emotion Perception
tests may not be measuring cognitive abilities in the traditional
sense. Again, to resolve this issue more fully, researchers must
await the development of additional, more reliable tests of Emotion Perception.
Finally, if Emotion Perception is all that may remain of emotional intelligence, what does one use it for? An answer to this
question will depend on further validity studies. Two potentially
important uses readily come to mind. First, Emotion Perception
may provide a clue about the reasons for discrepancy between
human behavior under conditions of uncertainty and "normative
theory," at least for some tasks that show bias in human reasoning (see Stanovich & West, 1998). Second, there is a need to
use emotional information in many types of problem-solving
situations, particularly in jobs requiring interaction with the
public (e.g., sales, advertising, or hospitality). The fact that
predictive validity is an important corollary of an intelligence,
after all, has seemingly escaped present conceptualizations of
emotional intelligence (cf. Mayer et al., 1997).
CONCLUSION
The three studies reported here converge on a conclusion that,
as presently postulated, little remains of emotional intelligence
that is unique and psychometrically sound. Thus, questionnaire
measures are too closely related to "established" personality
traits, whereas objective measures of emotional intelligence suffer from poor reliability. A caveat to this conclusion is, however,
required. The present results suggest that an Emotion Perception
factor having some construct validity may be possible to identify
in the future. This undertaking is dependent on the development
of objective measures having satisfactory reliability, a particularly complex and arduous undertaking if the lessons learned
from attempts to isolate such measures in the social intelligence
and divergent thinking literature are any guide (see Guilford,
1967). Even allowing for the development of better instruments,
such a construct would appear narrower than proponents of the
emotional intelligence construct have envisaged.
