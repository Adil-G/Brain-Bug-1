Intervention to address the equity gap has traditionally concentrated on supply-side initiatives. However, it is now
recognized that demand side de ciencies are a signi cant
reason why small and medium enterprises (S M Es) are unsuccessful in raising venture capital. This reinterpretation is
re ected in recent documents from the U K government –
most recently a Consultative Paper from HM Treasury and
the Small Business Service – which have highlighted the
need for SMEs to become ‘investment ready’ in order to
take advantage of the increased supply of venture capital that
is now available. This article provides a critique of the
Consultative Document’s de nition of investment readiness
and outlines a programme to enhance investment readiness
amongst SMEs.

Introduction
There has been a longstanding debate in the UK, and
more recently in the European Union and elsewhere,
about the availability of risk capital for businesses at
their seed, start-up and early growth stages. In the UK
this debate has surfaced on frequent occasions since the
‘equity gap’ was  rst identi ed in the 1930s. For most
of this period the concern has been about de ciencies
in the supply of capital, with various initiatives introduced with the objective of increasing the availability
of capital in small amounts for business start-up and
growth (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 1991). Examples
include the creation of IC FC (the predecessor of
3i plc), the Loan Guarantee Scheme, the Business
Expansion Scheme, its successor the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS), and Venture Capital Trusts
(VCTs). The present Labour government has continued this approach with its Enterprise Fund, tax
incentives to encourage corporate venturing and a
reduction in capital gains tax to encourage business
angels.
However, towards the end of 2000 there was a
welcome recognition from policy makers that weaknesses on the demand side also contribute to the exis-

663

tence of a start-up and early growth stage equity gap.
This shift in the nature of the policy debate re ects
two developments:  rst, an increase in the pool of early
stage venture capital; and second, evidence that existing
early stage investors cannot  nd suYcient investment
opportunities.
There has been a signi cant increase in the pool of
early stage  nance in the UK in recent years. Because
of the high rates of return achieved in the mid and late
1990s, linked to the buoyant IPO markets in this
period, venture capital funds have been able to raise
record amounts of new investment from  nancial institutions. As a result, the amounts invested by the UK
venture capital industry have increased from just over
£1 bn in 1995 to £8 bn in 2000 (B R I T I S H V EN T U R E
C A P I T A L A S S OC I A T IO N , 2000, 2001). Although a
high proportion of these funds have been invested in
later stage businesses and management buy-outs and
buy-ins, the absolute amounts invested in early stage
companies has dramatically increased, from £85 m in
1995 to £487 m in 2000 (B VCA, 2000, 2001).
Government has added to this supply with the creation
of an Enterprise Fund in order to address biases in the
size, stage and geographical distribution of investment
activity of venture capital funds (W R IG HT et al., 1998).
The Enterprise Fund comprises two elements: a
national ‘fund-of-funds’ that will invest in venture
capital funds specializing in early-stage, high technology businesses; and support for a network of regional
venture capital funds specializing in small scale equity
for businesses with growth potential. In addition, there
has been an expansion in the amount of capital available
from the informal venture capital market. This can be
attributed, in part, to the generous tax incentives now
available to business angels via the E IS, VC Ts and the
introduction of a four year capital gains tax taper.2 It is
estimated that there are 20,000–40,000 active business
angels in the UK who annually invest £0·5 bn to £1 bn
in 3,000–6,000 companies (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N ,
2000b).
In addition, there is evidence from the informal
venture capital market that investors are unable to invest
as frequently or as much as they would like because of
the quality of the opportunities that they see (M A S O N
and H A R R I S O N , 1999, 2001). For example, a survey
of business angels registered with the National Business
Angel Network found that investors were willing, in
aggregate, to see their investment portfolio of unquoted
company investments increase by a factor of two to
four if deal  ow permitted. Indeed, over 90% were
looking to make more investments. However, most
reported that they were unable to  nd suYcient investments that met their investment criteria. The diYculty
that business angels encounter in  nding investment
opportunities is con rmed by the observations of
practitioners (e.g. N I C H OL S ON , 2000).
These considerations – and the latter point in particular – has prompted the government to consider the

need to complement its supply side measures to
improve the  nancing environment for growthoriented small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with
initiatives to address demand side de ciencies. This
shift in policy direction was  agged in the November
2000 pre-Budget statement:

ment is fundamentally  awed because it mis-speci es
‘investment readiness’. This mis-speci cation, in turn,
is likely to lead to the development of  awed or even
inappropriate forms of intervention.

To take advantage of this increased supply [of equity
 nance], more SMEs with growth potential need greater
understanding of venture capital and specialist advice on
how to structure business plans to secure external  nance,
to make themselves ‘investment ready’. There is evidence
of a gap in this market, akin to the classic ‘equity gap’.
The Government has therefore asked the Small Business
Service, working with the Regional Development Agencies and in consultation with the Small Business Investment Taskforce and market practitioners, to make early
progress in identifying measures to bridge this gap, with
a view to harnessing the experience of the private sector
as rapidly as possible. (H M T R EA SU RY, 2000, para 3.63)

‘Investment readiness’ incorporates three distinctive
dimensions, of which only two are addressed in the
Consultative Paper. The  rst is the entrepreneur’s attitude towards equity  nance. The Consultative Paper
quite correctly notes that equity aversion is a problem
amongst SM Es, although we have argued elsewhere
that the extent of equity aversion my be smaller than
commonly thought (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 1996).
On the other hand, there is anecdotal evidence that
four out of every  ve  rms that are referred by banks
to LINC Scotland do not go because they do not
want to share ownership and control with an external
investor (D. Grahame, personal communication). Helping entrepreneurs to understand diVerent forms of
 nancing should lead to an increase in the  ow of
investment opportunities. However, the eVectiveness
of trying to change attitudes through exhortation and
education may be limited and it has been argued that
the most eVective way of changing attitudes to equity
is to oVer tax incentives to businesses raising equity
capital (M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 1995) – in exactly
the same way that investors receive tax incentives to
oVset their reluctance to invest in unquoted companies.
A second dimension of investment readiness is
presentational failings. These include both shortcomings in business plans and other written documents
that are aimed at investors and also de ciencies in oral
presentations at investment forums. We have demonstrated elsewhere that presentational de ciencies –
notably, incomplete information, preoccupation with
the product/technology rather than the business case
and failure to ‘sell the sizzle’ – are signi cant reasons
why  rms are unsuccessful in raising  nance (M A S O N
and R O G ER S , 1997; M A S O N and H A R R I S O N ,
2000c).
The third, and arguably most fundamental, dimension of investment readiness relates to the ‘investability’
of the project (M A R S DE N J A C OB S A S S O C I A T ES ,
1995; E R NS T & Y O U NG /C EN T R E FO R I NN O VA T I O N A N D E N T ER P R I S E , 1997). Does the business
meet the requirements of external investors? These
requirements revolve around the capability of the entrepreneur/management team, the business and market
position and the potential return and exit expectations.
At its heart, becoming ‘investment ready’ is therefore
about business development. However, this aspect of
investment readiness is ignored in the Consultative
Document. Moreover, the examples that are cited of
organizations delivering investment ready services are
not addressing this fundamental issue of ‘investability’.
Investors choose not to invest because of short-

The Department of Trade and Industry followed up
on this initial proposal in its White Paper on enterprise,
skills and innovation which was published in February
2001. This document made the following statement:
Besides ensuring that  rms have access to the  nance they
need at all levels, it is equally important for  rms to know
what external investment is on oVer and what it means
for them to take the plunge. Some  rms may hold back
from seeking external  nance because they are unsure
about the practicalities and worried about the complications. Others may not be aware that they are in a position
where external  nance can help them out or can facilitate
a new level or dimension of operation. The Small Business
Service (SB S) will therefore launch, by the summer, a set
of initiatives to help small businesses understand external
investment better and become better prepared to take it
on. We will be looking for innovative approaches to assist
small  rms on this issue and will encourage interested
parties to come forward with a range of ideas on how the
SBS can support, build on and spread best practice, using
the Business Link network as appropriate. (D EPA RT M EN T O F T RA D E A N D I N D U ST RY, 2001)

This strand of thinking was developed further in a
Consultative Document produced jointly by HM
Treasury and the Small Business Service in March
2001 (HM T R EA S U R Y /S M A L L B U S I N ES S S E R VI C E ,
2001). This document argued that  rms were unable
to raise  nance because they were not ‘investment
ready’: speci cally,  rms do not know what  nancing
options are available, do not understand the expectations and requirements of investors and do not know
how to make their business proposals into attractive
investment opportunities. This is exacerbated by equity
aversion, that is, a lack of ambition to use equity
 nance because of a reluctance to share ownership and
control with an outside investor. As a consequence
many SMEs are unable to take advantage of the pool
of  nance that is currently available.
We argue in this article that the Consultative Docu-

by business angels registered with the National Business
Angels Network

comings of the entrepreneur and shortcomings of the
business (F EE NE Y et al., 1999). Shortcomings in the
attributes of entrepreneurs include: lack of knowledge
and expertise to turn the idea into a viable business;
unrealistic expectations (e.g. overly optimistic, unsubstantiated); and personal qualities (lack of integrity,
vision or commitment, high need for control of the
business). Shortcomings of the business include: poor
management team (e.g. balance, experience, discipline,
teamwork); poor pro t potential for the level of risk;
undercapitalized; and insuYcient information provided.
A UK study of the approach of business angels to
the initial screening of investment opportunities has
highlighted many of the same issues (M A S O N and
R O G ER S , 1997). Investors are turned oV by businesses
that lack focus; where comprehensive and credible
market information is lacking; highly competitive
markets; and lack a USP (i.e. ‘me too’ products and
services). They want to understand the way that the
product or service is distinctive or superior to that of
the competition and how any competitive advantage
will be sustained. They also place considerable emphasis
on the experience and track-record of the entrepreneur,
his/her commitment, the upside potential of the business, and the use to which the  nance that is sought
will be put.
According to business angels registered with the
National Business Angels Network (NBAN) the main
de ciencies in the proposals that they see are:  rst,
business plans which contain unrealistic assumptions or
information that is not credible; and second, entrepreneur/management teams which lack credibility
(M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 2001). Signi cant,
although less frequently cited weaknesses include:
insuYcient information provided; business concept
requires further development; and limited growth
prospects of the business (Table 1).
The experience of the Eastern Scotland Investments
Limited Partnership, an E RD F-supported fund that
was set up in July 1999 to address the ‘equity gap’ is
very similar. It has rejected 99 applicants. The most
common reasons for rejection were a suspect business
plan or business model, with the most common characteristic being the inability to demonstrate a credible
revenue model, inability to demonstrate any unique
selling point, the inability to demonstrate a route to
market and the inability to demonstrate that there
were suYcient potential customers to warrant the new
business. Many plans concentrated on the product or
technology developed by the applicant but little or no
consideration had been given to the costs of marketing,
distribution or customer selling (E A S T ER N S C O T L A ND I NV ES T M E NT S L I M I T ED P A R T NE R S , 2001).

 nance, and presentation, which were addressed in the
Consultation Report; and also investability, which was
not. An intervention that is designed to enhance investment readiness amongst the SME population must
therefore address both equity aversion and presentational issues to develop businesses to the point at which
they are attractive to investors. The central objective of
an investment ready programme must therefore be to
raise the quality of investment opportunities,  rst by
confronting entrepreneurs with the criteria that
investors use to assess investment opportunities (i.e.
education) and second by helping entrepreneurs to
meet these standards (i.e. support). The failure of
businesses to be investment ready is primarily due to
information failure (M A R S D EN J A C O B S A S S O C I A T ES ,
1995). Entrepreneurs do not know about the advantages of equity  nance, and hence what is required to
attract equity investors, nor how to sell their investment
proposal to investors. A programme to enhance ‘investment readiness’ amongst the SME population should
therefore take the form of a series of seminars, workshops and one-to-one consultancy sessions encompassing the following  ve elements (Fig. 1):3
information seminar
investment ready review
investment ready development programme

investment networking.

risk and return aspects of equity investment and the
determination of ‘value’.

Fig. 1. A model of an Investment Ready Programme

These seminars would be targeted at businesses that are
seeking to grow or are already growing, and those that
are seeking to commercialize an innovative process or
technology.
There is a need to reach entrepreneurs at an early
stage to enable them to incorporate equity funding in
their planning process; identifying and planning for the
most appropriate  nancial and ownership structure for
the business is critical to the potential future success of
the business. However, as noted earlier, there may be a
need to provide incentives to create a more pro-equity
culture amongst SM Es. This lack of understanding of
how to be investment ready also exists within the SM E
small business support network, both private and public,
particularly local, small scale advisers and service providers. Their knowledge tends to be con ned to debt
funding options and therefore reinforces the aversion
to equity amongst their clients (E R N S T & Y O U NG /
C E NT R E FO R I N NO VA T I O N A N D E NT E R P R I S E ,
1997). The Eastern Scotland Investments Limited Partnership (ESILP) similarly notes that there is little
assistance available for business plan preparation and
few public sector business advisers have been trained
in, or have experience of, the work required to make
companies investor ready. ESILP makes the further
observation that advisers are reluctant to properly challenge the entrepreneur on the basic assumptions of
their business plan. As a result, their plan is not properly
scrutinized and tested until it is received by a prospective funder, at which point it is found wanting. These
seminars should therefore also be open to small business
service providers (accountants, lawyers, consultants) to
bring them up to the standard needed to be capable of
supporting high growth ventures (E A ST ER N S CO T LA N D I N VE S T ME NT S L I M IT ED P A RT N ER S (ESILP),
2001).
The second element involves focusing on those
attendees at the basic seminars/workshops who put
themselves forward as candidates for equity  nance.
These businesses would undergo an Investment Ready
Review at which they would be benchmarked on a
one-to-one basis for their suitability to raise equity
 nance. This would cover such issues as (following
E R N S T & Y O U NG /C EN T R E FO R I N NOVAT I O N A ND

and development and diVerent classes of investor (e.g.
business angel vs. venture capital fund).
The  rst element is a broadly targeted Information
Seminar that is designed to  ll the knowledge gap
about equity as an alternative source of  nance for
SM Es at all stages of development. This would address
the following issues (following E R N S T & Y O U N G /
C E NT R E F OR I N NO V A T I O N A ND E N T ER P R I S E ,
1997):
what equity is and the bene ts it may bring
the limitations of debt funding
the circumstances in which it should be considered
the diVerent types of equity providers in the market
place and their speci c focus
how to access the right investor and who are the
intermediaries who may provide assistance in  nding
appropriate investors
equity investors’ evaluation process and decisionmaking criteria
how to present information which focuses on the
investor perspective of the opportunity

Businesses which do not receive a positive assessment
will be directed to appropriate forms of support; they
will have the opportunity to re-join the programme
once the speci c de ciencies have been addressed.
Those businesses that receive a positive assessment
will proceed to the third element which is an Investment Ready Development Programme which is intended to address issues raised by the review. This stage,
which is likely to take several months, will cover issues
such as the management team, intellectual property,
market analysis, market positioning and market validation, and  nancial planning, and could involve
accessing other forms of support (e.g. SMAR T award).
The objective is to accelerate companies to the stage
of positive cash  ow as soon as possible on the grounds
that such companies are easier to ‘sell’ to investors than
those that are still at the ideas stage.
The fourth element is an Investment Presentation
Review to assist companies to prepare a ‘winning’
investment presentation. Knowing how to present an
opportunity eVectively to potential investors can be
regarded as one speci c aspect of being ‘investor ready’
as it requires an understanding of what (diVerent types
of ) investors look for in an opportunity and an ability
to anticipate and address the concerns of investors.
Central to this presentation is the use of information
which demonstrates and signals personal and organizational competence and the entrepreneur’s abilities and
motivations. Our previous research into investment
decision making by business angels has drawn attention
to presentational failings as an important reason why
opportunities are rejected by investors. Key factors are
not providing suYcient information and failing to
address the concerns that investors have (M A S O N and
R O G ER S , 1997; M A S O N and H A R R I S O N , 2000c).
Providing coaching in this area is therefore critical to
eVective equity  nance raising.
The  nal element is Investment Networking to
provide a link between the businesses that have completed the programme and potential investors. This
may be built on the existing network of business angel
networks across the country, and could be extended to
include networks based on university and business

school alumni associations (as is done at London Business School and Warwick University), or as part of the
university sector challenge to commercialize technology and research. It may also require, and be supported
by, additional investor–entrepreneur networking events
such as investment breakfasts, C ONNECT-type
meetings and First Tuesday-type events.
There are a number of requirements for an eVective
programme to enhance investment readiness, such as
the one outlined above:

·

·

First, in view of the need to change both culture
and practice, it needs to be long term; developing
investment ready businesses is not a short term
process either for the businesses themselves or for
the programme as a whole.
Second, such a programme will be expensive.
Government cannot expect the businesses that are
the target audience for the programme to be able
to aVord the full costs. We recommend that the
introductory seminar is free and that the remainder
of the programme is heavily subsidized.
Third, in view of the importance of competent
delivery, we further recommend that the programme
is delivered by consultants and experienced practitioners who have close familiarity with the requirements and expectations of business angels and other
early stage investors rather than by bureaucrats (or
those perceived as such).
Conclusion
As the early stage venture capital market has developed
in the UK, partly as a result of a series of policy
interventions to stimulate the  ow of early stage equity
capital and partly as the result of a process of natural
evolution and change, it has become increasingly clear
that there is no eVective shortage of capital for investment. Although the informal venture capital market
remains, in large measure, an invisible market, the
increased number and visibility of business angel networks and the wider awareness and discussion of business angel  nancing in the media and among business
advisers has gone some way to closing the information
gap in the market which has prevented investors and
entrepreneurs connecting. It is now clear that the major
problem is not the supply of early stage equity  nance,
nor is it simply an information and connection problem; business angels in particular report that they have
considerable funds available for investment and see an
increasing number of business plans.
However, they also report a reduction in the quality
of the investment opportunities coming forward, which
prevents them from investing as frequently as they
would like. Against this background, the shift in oYcial
policy towards demand-side initiatives, as represented
by the HM Treasury/Small Business Service consultation paper on investment readiness, is welcome. How-

ever, for this new emphasis in policy to be eVective,
the concept of investment readiness itself needs to
be de ned and understood in much greater detail.
Furthermore, the challenge of developing an eVective
integrated programme of support for companies seeking to become investment ready, and hence realize their
development potential through an appropriate funding
structure, will require more than simply minor ‘bolton’ adjustments to the existing package of support
measures and policy delivery structures. Given that
there is now extensive experience of developing and
running such programmes in, for example Australia
and Canada, there is an opportunity to identify and
learn from best practice elsewhere in addressing the
demand-side de ciencies in the early stage equity
market.
Notes
1. We are grateful to Bob Beaumont (Victoria Employers’
Chamber of Commerce and Industry), David Grahame
(LI NC Scotland) and Martin Hughes (Scottish Enterprise) for stimulating our thinking on this issue.
2. The willingness of business angels to invest is particularly
sensitive to the tax regime. The introduction of various
tax reliefs for private investors investing in unquoted
companies is therefore likely to have increased the pool
of  nance that business angels have available to invest
(M A SO N and H A R RI SO N , 1999, 2000a).
3. This proposal is modelled on the State of Victoria’s
(Australia) Investment Ready programme (http:www.
home.vicnet.au/ ~ entimp/nies/investready.html). This
programme has also been adopted by South Australia.
