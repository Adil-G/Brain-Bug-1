TRUSTIS CRITICAL IN NEW ORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS where the traditional
social controls based on authority give way to self-direction and self-control [26].
Trust is reported to reduce transactioncosts [2, lo], increase confidence andsecurity
in the relationship, and promote open, substantive, and influential information exchange [4, 17,401.
A global virtual team is an example ofnew
a organizationform, where atemporary
team is assembled on an as-needed basis for the duration of a task, and staffed by
members fromthe far comers of the world [ 1 1,20,25]. In such a team, members( I )
physicallyremain on different continents andindifferent countries, (2) interact
primarily through the use of computer-mediated communicationtechnologies (electronic mail, videoconferencing,etc.), and (3) rarely or never see each other in person
[ 13,271.
Although trust is important in any type of team, trust is pivotal in preventing
geographical distance from leading to psychological distance in a global team [33].
Trust is even more essentialin global virtual teams. Accordingto O’Hara-Devereaux
and Johansen [27],
“Trust is the glue ofthe global workspace-and technology doesn’t
do muchto create relationships”(pp.243-244). First, the global virtual
contextrenders
other forms of social control, such as direct supervision, inoperable. Second, other
factors known to contribute to social control andcoordination, such as geographical
proximity, similarity in backgrounds, and experience, are often absent.
The challenge is that both the virtual context and the global context constrain, or
perhaps even impede,the development of trust. Handy[IO] points outthat, in virtual
organizations, trust requires constant face-to-face interactiom-the very activity the
virtual form eliminates. This study explores,
in a virtual-team setting, the effect of factors
that havebeen identified as sources of trustin traditional face-to-face relationships.

Conceptual Foundations
Concept of Trust
TRUSTCAN BE VIEWED FROM A RATIONAL OR SOCIAL perspective. Most research on
trust takes a rational perspective [ 151. The rational perspectivecenters on the calculus
of self-interest. Increases in trust decrease transaction costs of relationships because
individuals havetoengageless
in self-protective actions in preparationfor the

<-----Page 2----->TRUST IN GLOBALVIRTUALTEAMS

31

possibility of others’ opportunisticbehavior [ 161. Thus, the existence oftrust enables
people to take risks. The social perspective of trust, alternatively, centers
on moral duty.
A social group holds values regarding one’s obligations to others. “Hence, people help
others and/or their group because they feel it is the morally appropriate[16,
action”
p.51.
Within the rational perspective, some authors have studied
asan individual
trust
personality
difference [7], others
as an institutional phenomenon[ 19,321, someas a crosscultural issue
[6], and most in terms of interpersonal relations
[3,22]. In this paper, we take the last view,
which allowsus to take an affective, cognitive, behavioral,
or “integrated” view of trust [2,
22,241. We will take an “integrated” view and adopt Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman’s [22]
another
definition of trust: “the willingness of to
a be vulnerable to the actions of party
basedon the expectation that the other
perform
willa particular action important
to the trustor,
irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party”
(p. 712). In short, trust is
based on the expectation that others will behave
as expected

paw

Antecedents of Trust
Trust in a dyadic relationship arises from attributes associated with a trustee and a
trustor [22]. The trustee attributes are hisor her perceived( I ) ability, (2) benevolence,
and (3) integrity.Abilityrefersto the group ofskills that enable trustee
a
to be perceived
competent within somespecific domain. Benevolence is the extent to which atrustee
is believed to feel interpersonal care and concern, and the willingness to do good to
the trustor beyond an egocentric profit motive. Integrity is adherence to a set of
principles (such as study/work habits) thought to make the trustee dependable and
reliable, according to the trustor.
In terms ofthe trustor attributes,propensityto trust is a generalpersonalitytrait that
conveys a generalexpectation of howtrusting one should be. This
trait is assumedto
be stable during the relationship as well as from one situation to another, and is
influenced by atrustor’s cultural, social, developmental experiences, and personality
type [22]. In terms oftrustor versus trustee attributes,prior research has found
that the
trustee attributes explain more of the variance in interpersonal trust than does the
trustor’s general propensity to trust [3 1 1.
Trust onacollective level (i.e., trust in a group, team, ororganizationalunit) is more
complicated than dyadictrust because there are multiple trustees, each withdifferent
attributes. Collective trust, as defined by Cummings and Bromiley[2, p. 3031, is “a
common belief among a group individuals
of
that another individul
or group (a) makes
. . . (b) is honestin
good-faith efforts to behave in accordance with any commitments
whatever negotiations preceded such commitments and(c) does not take excessive
advantage of another even when
the opportunityis available.” Extrapolatingfrom the
dyadic trust literature to the collective trust context, we explore trust antecedents in a
global virtual-team setting. Our baseline hypothesis is:
H I : In a global virtual team, team trust is a function of other team members’
perceived ability, integrity, and benevolence, as well as of the members’ own
propensity to trust.

<-----Page 3----->32

JARVENPAA, KNOLL, AND LEIDNER

Relative Importance of Trust Antecedents
In a traditional face-to-face context, trust takes time to evolve.Cummingsand
Bromiley [2] suggest thatcollective trust has an affective, cognitive, and behavioral
intent component.McAllister [24] foundcognitivelybased trust factors to bea
precursor to the development of affectively based trust. Mayer et al. [22] maintain
that, in the early stages of a relationship, integrity is more important than benevolence
to the formation of trust. Assessing benevolencerequires information, which takes
time to gather. Although Mayeret al. [22] do notcategorizethe antecedentsof ability,
integrity, and benevolence into
affective and emotional dimensions, they associate
do
benevolence withthe process ofrelationshipbuilding.
In a virtual-team context, we might expect integrity andability to be particularly
strong predictors of trust because thecontext is a barrierto relationship formation. In
this study’s context, team members were limited to asynchronous electronic mail
communication andto the occasional use of text-based synchronous
“chat” facilities.
According to Zack [42], “the degree to which the mode [electronic]
of
communication
allows participants to experience eachother as being psychologicallyclose” (p. 2 1 1)
depends onthe richness ofthe existing shared interpretativecontext. This finding was
reinforced by Markus [2 I ] who found that “lean”electronic mail can be rich in the
situationwhere the parties know eachother, but if the
parties are confined to electronic
communication for long periods of time, they expectedtheir relationshipsto be “cold
and impersonal” (p.520). Among strangers who do notshare a common past and
are
unfamiliarwith eachother’spersonalities, there is no sharedcontext. Hence, electronic
communicationcanbeexpected
to beimpersonalandtask-focused.
Trust in a
virtual-team context might therefore be morestrongly related to ability andintegrity,
and less to benevolence.
H2: In the early phases, a global virtual
team ’s trust is predicted more strongly
by team members ’perceptions of the other members’ integrityand ability than
by the other members’ benevolence.

In traditional relationships, Mayer et al. [22] predict that, with time, benevolence
should increase. The interactions will reveal information about the benevolence of
others. Recent work on computer-mediated teams suggests that benevolence might
predict team trust after the members have interacted for a while. Walther
[38] found
that geographically dispersed and culturally diverse partners, who relied totally on
computer-mediated communication and were neverable to meet each other physically, communicated more affection and reported higher of
levels
intimacy,as well as
social and physical attraction, than did colocated partners.In another study, Walther
[36] did not find computer-mediated communication groupsto be any more task-oriOn the basis ofhis studies, Walther [34,35,36,37,38]
ented than face-to-face teams.
developed a hyperpersonalization theory for groups limited to computer-supported
communication. The theory argues
that, because individuating information(cues that
help others understand if they are similar or different, for example, physically) is so
scarce in a virtual context, members assumesimilarity and tendto reveal factors and

<-----Page 4----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUAL TEAMS

33

cues about themselves that only reinforce
this similarity. In turn, this overattribution
of similarity may nurture perceptions of concern,care, and a belief in the virtue of a
team relationship. Hence, we predict:
H3: Over time in a global virtual team, team members ‘perceptions of others’
benevolence will have a stronger effect on team trust.

Team Building
To perceive integrity and ability, members must maketheir assessments of others on
the basis of pasthistory, namely, other’s track recordor recent performancein a team.
This inturn suggests that, for integrity to be rated high, a member has to have
information available on how consistentlyothers met their past commitments and how
closely their performance matchedexpectationsof fairness and normsof reciprocity
[24]. Likewise, to rate ability high, team members would have to have detailed
information on the other members’backgrounds,work experiences, and current
organizational contexts. To perceive benevolence,personalinformationmustbe
revealed by others to reinforce beliefs about shared goals, rewards, and interest in
establishing agoodrelationship.Thus,team
exercises that focus on increasing
information exchange among team members and encourage commitment and completionof tasks earlyin the collaborative process might be expected to have a
positively impact on perceptions of other members’ ability, integrity, and benevolence, as well as team trust overall. The effect on team trust is expected becausethe
exercises should not only reveal information about
the members, butalso help create
a teamidentity, which is an important facilitator of trust in a collective context [ 141.
Hence, we advancethe fourth hypothesis:
H4: The level of participation in the team-building exercises will be positively
associated with team trust as wellas with other team members ’perceived
ability,
integrity, and benevolence.

Figure 1 summarizes the research modeltested via the four hypotheses.

to leam about the Internet. This section describes the collaboration
participants, collaboration activities,data collection, and measurements.

Collaboration Participants
Potential participantswere recruitedthrough contacts with professors who hadparticipated in previous collaborations [ 131, correspondence with academic colleagues,

word-of-mouth inquiries, and advertising via a newsgroup servicing information
systems professionals and academicians. All professors received a common letter
explaining the conditions for student participation.
Although the letter explicitly stated that one of the conditions for participation
included havingthe exercise comprise 20 to 40 percent ofthe students' course grade,
the context of the students' participation varied. Mostprofessors folded the exercise
into one of their regularly scheduled courses where it counted for 20 percent to 75
percent oftheir course grade. In a fewcases, however, professors asked some
students
to participate in the project without any connection to a specific course. To further
motivate the students' participation,the professors were provided withreports on the
number of electronic mail messages their students sent after the first two and four
weeks. Also, a monetary reward ($600) was promised for the best web site. Finally,
all team members were asked
to rate each other's contributionto the final project.
Three hundred and eighty-five masters' students from twenty-eight universities
around the world elected to participate inthe exercise (appendix A lists the universities). Ofthese students, 350 studentssent at least one messageto their teammates. The
teams had the following characteristics: (1) Each member on a team resided on a
different continent or subcontinentof the world. (2) Each team hada mix of students
from low- and high-contextcultures.

Tasks
The teams were charged with completing
three tasks: two team-building
exercises and
a final project (see Table I for the timing of the exercises). The team-building
exercises
were voluntary. The students' course grade and the
$600 reward were basedsolely on
the successful completion ofthe final project.

The Team-BuildingExercises
The first two voluntary tasks encouraged participantsto exchange information about
themselves that would be relevantfor assessing one another’s project-related skills
(ability), their motivations forcontributingto the teameffort (benevolence),and their
work/study habits believed to be compatible witha successful effort (integrity). The
first exercise asked participants to send a description of themselves to their team
members. Thefirst paragraph wasto include a brief personal description.The second
paragraph wasto contain professional information-to describe past job experience,
their current focus of study and why they chose to study that subject, what their
aspirations were, and anyinternationalexperience they had. The
third paragraph was
to answer two questions: what they wanted
to learn fromthis project and whatskills
they hadthat would enable them
to contribute to the project. The final paragraph was
to describe what theyfelt would bethe challengesofworking in an internationalvirtual
environmentand to raise anyconcernstheyhadwithregard
to the successful
completion of the project.
The purpose ofthe second exercise was to enable the team membersto assess how
well their team members met their commitments and completed their work tasks
(integrity) before the final assignment commenced. Thisexercise required each team
member to locate one web site he or she felt was of relevance to business persons.
Each team member was to report the address of the site as well as a one-paragraph
explanation of what made the site relevant. Team members were asked to consider
information-related characteristics and features of the page that made it relevantdhe
quality of links, the accessibility
ofthe page, the options included
in the page, and so forth.
The World Wide Web Project
The third assignment, the final project, asked
the teams to propose a World Wide Web
site (or pages) providinga new service or offering to ISWorld Net (ISWorld Net
is an
organization committed to disseminating information to both IS practitioners and
academicians via the Internet and newsgroups). The teams to
were
present information
of interestto global information technology
practitionersworking in aglobal business
setting. The students had four weeksto complete this project. Each team member was
required to submit the same deliverable, representing the collective efforts of the
group, to his or her professor.

Technology
Students communicatedsolely through electronic means. The host institutionestablished a WWW site on the Internet(http: //uts.cc.utexas.edu/bgac313/index.html).
The purpose of this central repository of information was to ensure that allstudents
had access to the same information onthe assignments,a schedulefor completing the
voluntary team building exercises and the required final project, pointers to other
WWW sites containing relevant information, advice for virtual collaborators, decision-making methods and software tools, a list of time zones based on Greenwich
Mean Times, a bulletin board addressing technical and assignment issues, and a
research paperdescribing virtual collaborations.

Data Collection
The list processor archived students’ mail messages sent to the “team address.”
Students were notified at the start of the exercise that messages were being
collected.
Occasionally students used the reply function to respond to messages sent by individuals, thereby communicating with that individual
alone. In prior global virtual-team
collaborations,we learned from student interviews and fromquestionnaireresponses
that team members rarely sent individual messages, and when
did,they
they sent very
few [ 131. Furthermore, when teams held chatsessions (and invariably not everyone
could attend because of time zone constraints), our analysis of the electronic mail
archives suggests that attendees summarized the meeting results
for others.
Team members were sent anelectronic survey to complete immediately following
the deadline for the second trust-building exercise (after the first month). The team
members wereable to complete and submit the survey
electronically.A second survey
was sent to the team membersthe day following thedeadline for the completed final
project (after the second month).

Measurements
The items for each construct are reported in appendix B. The trust-buildingexercises
were codedto give a measure of theparticipation in the exercise. A team was given
one point for each member that contributed to an exercise. Thus, for a four-person
team, the maximum number of points waseight if each membercontributed to both
exercises. The total points were added per team and then normalized
to account for
the differences in team sizes.
Because trust was the central variable of concern, we used twoseparate scales for
trust that had been used before. Both were used because neither had been found
definitive by previous research. Thefirst measure was used by Pearceet al. [28,29]
to measure trustworthiness. The trustworthiness scales were modified to reflect the
team rather than the organization as the unit of analysis. The second measure wasa
modified version of the Schoorman, Mayer, and Davis [30] instrument on trust.
Schoorman et al.’s [30] measures werealso used to assess ability, benevolence, and

<-----Page 8----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUALTEAMS

37

integrity, and propensityto trust. Themodificationsto the Schoorman et al. instrument
involved adaptingthe questionsthat were originally designed
for a dyadicrelationship
to fit the context of multi-interdependenciesfound in a team
context. Individualswere
asked abouttheir perceptions of the attributes of the other members (as opposed to a
single other trustee). Wecouldhaveaskedeach
individual to respond to their
perceptions of each trustee (Le.,eachteammember),but
this would have been
excessively tedious and might have reducedthe response rate. In addition, trust in a
collective entity is possible even if one particular individual is deemed less capable,
benevolent, or honest thanthe others.The measure of propensity
to trust was modified
to take into account the internationalcontext. Becausetrust has anobject4ne trusts
in someone or somethingit is necessary to provide an object to the general propensity to trust. Wefelt that the international context might pose a major challenge
to the
teams becausecollective trust is suggested to be difficult to establishamong culturally
heterogeneous groups [ 121. The modified measure captured propensity-to-trust students from other countries (i.e.,foreign students). Allof the aboveitemswere
measured on afive-point scale ranging from I (to no extent) to 5 (to a great extent).

Analysis and Quantitative Results
165 OF THE 350 TEAM MEMBERS COMPLETEDTHEFIRST SURVEY fora response
rate of 47 percent. Two hundred and thirteen of the 350 team members completed the
second survey for a rate
of 6 1 percent. The response rates
are reasonable given that most
of the teams had one or two inactive members-members who did not send any messages
to their team. Inactive team members were not expelled from participationwesince
felt
that coping with such
lack of commitment was part
a of the learning process.
Of interest was teamtrust and trustantecedentsat a team levelof analysis. As such,
for each team,it was necessaryto collapsethe responses ofthe various team members
into a single team score. This was accomplished by averagingthe responses of the
individual members on each team. Before
so doing, teams with responses from fewer
than two members were
eliminated from the data set because single
a
respondent was
not a goodrepresentation of theteam.
In general, the factor analyses supported the proposed scales with someexceptions.
For example, one ofthe items of the benevolence scale, “The other team members
were very concerned about
the ability of the team to get along,” was notretained. The
items comprising eachof the constructs are shown, withtheir factor loadings, in Table
2. The reliability measures are also shown.
All variables exceeded 0.8 on the reliability score except the trust construct. Since trust and trustworthiness werehighly
correlated at time periodI (p = 0.0 19) and time period (p
2 = 0.003), we droppedtrust
from further analysis and usedthe measure oftrustworthinessto represent trust.

trust-building exercises. The second sectionof the table shows the responses to the
second survey administered upon completion of thefinal project. The third section
shows thedescriptive statistics for the teams havingat least two respondentson both
of the surveys. Table 4 shows thecorrelations among the variables. To computethe
correlations, the data set was composed of those teams that had or
two
more responsize to
dents on both the first and the second surveys. This reduced our sample
twenty-eight teams. Overall, trust and antecedents of trust increased over time. Of
seventy-fiveteams, one team was combined with another after
teamthe trust-building
exercises because the team had only oneactive member. All other teams had at least
two participating members. Only one of the remaining seventy-four teams did not
submit the final assignment.

Hypothesis Testing
Hypothesis 1 predicted that, within a global virtual team, teamtrust is a function of
members’ ratings of the other team members’ perceivedability, integrity, and benevolence, as well as of the members’ own propensity to trust students from other
countries. Hypothesis 2 predicted that early in the team’s formation the team’s trust
would bepredicted more strongly by perceptionsof the other team members’
integrity
and ability than byothers’ benevolence. Hypothesis3 predictedthat others’ perceived
benevolence would havea greater effect on trust overtime.
A MANOVA was run to test these hypotheses, followed byan ANOVA. The
MANOVA used trust at time period I and time period2 as the dependent variables
and the antecedents of trust (ability, integrity,benevolence, andpropensityto trust) as
the independent variables (F( 16, 28) = 12.28, p > 0.000). This first hypothesis was
partially supported. Ability ( b = 0.190, p > 0.043), integrity (b = 0.533, p > O.OOO),
and propensityto trust (b = 0.198,p > 0.033)at time period I were significant predictors
of trust taken directly after the team building (afterthe
exercisesfirst month). Benevolence
was not significant at time period
1. At the end
ofthe project (aftertwo months), integrity
(b= 0 . 4 4 3 , >
~ 0.004), benevolence (b= 0 . 3 3 3 , >
~ 0.004),and propensityto trust students
from other counties (b = 0.152, p > 0.044) were significant predictors of trust at time
period 2, but ability was not (see Table5). Hence, hypothesis2, which emphasized the
salience of integrity after the first month, was supported, as was hypothesis 3, which
predicted that the relative effect
OF benevolence on trust would increase with time.

Hypothesis 4 predicted that the level of participation in the team-building exercises
would be positively associated with ratings of other team members’ ability, integrity, and
benevolence, as well as overall team trust. The team-building exercises were designed to
encourage participants to share information concerning their abilities that wouldbe of
value to the team (ability), their motivation for participating
in the proiect (benevolence),
and their worWstudy habits (integrity). Correlations were used to test this hypothesis.
Hypothesis 4 was only partially supported. The exercise did significantly correlate with
(r= 0 . 3 7 7 ,>
~ 0.024),integrity (r = 0 . 3 0 0 ,>
~ 0.061), and
the antecedents of trust: ability
benevolence (r= 0 . 4 2 4 ,>
~ 0.012) at time period1. Surprisingly, though, the trust-building exercise did not positively and significantly correlate with thetrust
measure
at timeof
period 1 (r = 0.22IO, p > 0.109)or with the levelof trust measured at time period
2 (r =
0.2335, p > 0.095). Hence, it seems that the exercise did increase the team members’
knowledge of each other, but the exercise did not directly affect trust. Hence,
any effect
on trust appearedto occur indirectly throughthe antecedents.

In summary, the quantitativeresults suggest that the traditional antecedentsof trust
from the dyadic relationship literature were associated with team trust in a global
virtual-team context. It appears to take time for benevolence to affect trust. Ability
seems to be asignificantpredictor at the outset, but notafter two months followed
by
a majortask accomplishment. Mayeret al. [22], in discussing trust in dyadicface-toface relationships,predicted that integrity would be most
salient early inthe relationship and that benevolence would increase as the relationship among the parties
developed. Mayer et al.
[22] made nospecific predictionswith regardto the temporal
effects of ability on trust. Hence, our results are consistent with the predictions of
Mayer et al. [22] with the additional
caveat that the effect of ability on trust also seems

exercisesdid not appearto have
any direct effect on trust.

Qualitative Analysisof High- and Low-TrustTeams
Although the above results are interesting,they revealedlittle about the behaviors and
strategies that distinguished high-trust teams from low-trust teams. To explore this
question about behaviors andtrust, an analysis was conducted of
the communication
transcripts for the three teams with the highest final trust score and the three teams
with the lowest final trust score. The transcripts for each team were treated
as a case.
The data analysis followed guidelines proposed by Eisenhardt [ 5 ] . The goal was to

across the six cases. Table 6 reportson the number of

conveyed a sense of accomplishment and warm
feelings toward team mates(“I shall
be in touch soon, to congratulate us allon winning!!”; “It’s been greatfun as well as
rewarding, keep in touch”). This team seemed
to have trust from the start and
maintained it through an upbeat tone in communication.
The team was task-oriented and
rarely engaged in social comments ofany kind,
except for twicealluding to European football scores. The team hada clear sense
of task goals and was very aware of time constraints, reminding each other of
forthpoming deadlines.This team had their eye constantly on the clock even inthe
beginning weeks. For example, early during the project members stated, to
“We need
keep meetingthe deadlines or the project will slip,”“We don’t have a large amount
of time,” and “there is this deadline.” Compared with other teams, this team’s
communication was relatively free of excuses for not
contributing to the team.
Initially onemember attributed lack of
participation to access problems caused by
a strike at his university; another member attributed lack of to

to a recent moveto a new apartment. However, thethird quickly noted, “Do you know

content work. Moreover, the members exhibited confidence in their abilities andin

<-----Page 16----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUAL TEAMS

their own independent tasks and did not wait for the approval of the group before
embarking on their individual tasks. In several cases the strong individual initiative
led to redundancy, with two members having worked onessentially the same thing
unaware that someoneelse was working on it simultaneously:“Here is my weekend
masterpiece. . . . Again, I made this without being aware that Jim already made an
abstract. Butit’s okay . . .at least, now we’reall in full gear! All the best toour group.”
Often a third member would collate the work of the two members who had been
working independently and come up with a final version that merged the best ideas
from the two (e.g., “Dear Virtuals! Mike and Jim have ideas that I like and I have
things to add so I was going to do a cut and paste thing and add in my ownbits”).
In addition to independence of work, this team was characterized by rotating
leadership in the sense that individuals acted as leaders when they sawthe need. All
five members made process suggestions and content contributions. Never did one
person nag the other team members to give feedback, to complete their work, or to
volunteer for tasks. Indeed, this team began with Jim immediately volunteering,
“unless you prefer to have a vote,” to coordinate the team-building exercises. Later,
a member, Steven, suggestedthat the team have one member
as leader each week, but
that the leader rotate. He proposed a five-weeklfive-leader chart. The chart proved
needless as leadership responsibilities rotated smoothly as the need arose. At one
point, one member took the lead in preparing the final paper to be turned in, but a
different member sent a message to the team to encourage everyone to review the
document quicklyand provide feedback so that the first team membercould finalize
the document for submission.
The team also had internalized a clear mutual goal (“a winning proposal”) and kept
reminding each otherthat the goal was within their reach (“we cando this together.
Let’s not give up the fight now! GO-GO-GO Team xx!!!”). This seemed to have a
contagious motivationaleffect on members. At one point
a potentialproblem appeared
when Jim announced on April 19 that he wouldbe unavailable until April 28 because
he was tired and taking a trip. This would mean that he would be absent during the
majority of the project time. The problem was ignored by the other members who
continued working on the content of a draft proposal. Two
days later, he informed the
team that, having rereadthe contributionsto date, he decided to postpone his trip. Jim
then ended up contributing perhaps more than any other single team member as he
completed a proposal draft, the html code for their web page, and the final paper.
Finally, team A had a serious focus on substantive comments: Rarely did members
respond “looks good,” “ok,” “fine with me,” when reviewinganother member’s work.
Their feedback was specific, in-depth, and thoughtful, indicating a careful reading of
each submission and a concern to contributeto the improvement ofthe material. There
were in fact very fewquestions submitted among the 113 communicationevents-the
members worked, submittedwork, and responded to the work submitted by others.
Team members did not ask “shall I do this” but merely acted and then asked for
feedback. This is in marked contrast to some of the low-trust teamswhere individuals
would ask what needed be
to done, give very minorfeedback, and always state what
needed to be done not
butactually do it themselves. Team A, in
fact, wasted verylittle

<-----Page 17----->46

JARVENPAA,KNOLL,

AND LEIDNER

time actually deciding whatto do; on the contrary, individualmembers acted and then
shared their results for improvement.

Team B: High Trust
Team B was aboveall characterizedby frequent communication with positive
a
tone,
by a very explicit division of labor, by acute attention to time management, and by
proactive action. From the start, the team members sought to
establish clear goals for
the project and also to minimize redundantefforts. Compared with team A, this group
exchanged more messages on “how,” not
just “what.” That is, the members did not
just divide work and workindependently, but rather divided the work and gave each
other detailed comments on how to accomplish the work. Like team A, team B
communicated their excitement and optimism in their first messages (“I am very
excited about workingon the project with all of you. . .”; “I am really looking forward
to work with you . . . the assignments do look very interesting”). Also like team A,
team B engaged in very
little socializationoutside ofthe initialteam-building exercises
although short pleasantries were exchanged(e.g., “Happy Easter”).
Team B engaged in a continuous stream
of communication. This teamsent several
messages eachday. Indeed, one member wondered why
the other members wantedto
have chat sessions when e-mail was working so well. The team did, nevertheless,
engage inseveral chat sessions. In most cases not all members were able to connect.
In order not to exclude these members, detailed minutes were kept and e-mailed
to the
nonchatting members.
As with team A, the leadership role of team B was neither fixed nor constant.
Although the team discussed
the appointment of a teamleader and other roles given
their past group workexperience, each member was leader
a
of his or her portion of
the work, with process leadership shared among all members. One member took a
leadershiprole in termsof setting a schedule anddefiningprocedures (suchas agreeing
to check mailat least once aday); however, the other members revised her suggestions
until the entire group agreed.
This team was conscious of time and managed it repeatedly
by
setting milestones
and revising them accordingly. A team member wanted to prepare explicitly for
unexpected emergencies by including “buffer time” in the schedule. The team also
deliberately tried to accomplish parallel although highly interdependent activities
(e.g., design of the layout of the page andthe content of the page)to save time.
This team washighly proactive: At the outset, the team had decidedthat members
should push forward without waiting
for approval fromothers, although redundancies
should be minimized. The team also discussed how each should notify others of
upcoming constraints. This teamestablished early on anexpectation of participation.
This threatened the functioning of the team when a new member, Tom, was added
after the team-building exercises.After an initial flurry of messages,this new member
was silent for nine days. An active team member wrote, “Where is Tom?’ On the
following day, another team memberwrote: “Some ofus may havetrouble devoting
time, even if only an houror so, on a daily basis till project completion. Ifwe have

<-----Page 18----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUAL TEAMS

47

competing demands on our time, we should communicate our constraints and make
efforts to contribute in a meaningful matter at the same time.” Shortly after this
message, Joe sent a message aboutapossible chat session specifically includingTom’s
name and asking Tom what he thought. Then, several days later Tom responded, “I
am not missing. I am still chasing all your work. . . . You can thought [sic]that I am
an investigator, not your teammate.” Four days later, Anna remarked in the
message, “We don’t know what’s become of Tom.” Tom responded that the
group’s activities were beyond his ability. Seven days later, Anna again noted,
“Does anyone know whether Tom has dropped out or is he still part of this
team?” Joe responded, “I think he has dropped out: no participation in ‘chat’
session, no contribution, no news, no ideas . . . .” Then Anna sent a message to the
whole team asking Tom to withdraw. Tom responded, “No problem.” Although the
whole situation could have resulted in some
significant group disagreement,because
of the initiative taken by one of the members toremove him fromthe team, the group
norms of acceptable participation were reinforced.
response
In team B, successful team workwas associated with rapid and thorough
to the ideas of others in the group, whether they were procedural or content-based,
and whether they were in completeagreement or carefully stated disagreement. The
members were very cognizant ofletting others know when they would,
and when they
would not, be available. Indeed, the team grew so accustomed to rapidfeedback that
at one point a member seemed startled that no one had submitted comments to her
abstract-when she had sent the abstract less than twenty-four hours before!Rarely
did the members have toask for comments and even more rarelydid members only
cursorily peruse their teammates’ work; rather, their feedback gave evidence of
thorough and thoughtful reading oftheir teammates’ work. The members developed
close affinity with each other, and the final messages conveyed a strong expectation
of future interactions.

Team C: High Trust
Perhaps the mostunique aspect of team C was that this teamwent through a
metamorphosis or distinct transition halfway through the main task assignment.
Before the metamorphosis, the team was very unlike team A and B, but after the
transition, the team exhibited many of the characteristics of teamA and B. The early
C were lukewarm at best and charged social
with
messages from the members of team
content and anxiety (“Am I alone here?’). The members kept begging for feedback
and rarely received more than “GREAT”
or a one-line response. The team was
preoccupied with procedures about howmembers should label their messages, how
the team should makedecisions, how tobehave in a chat session, whoshould do what,
how much the project weighed toward a member’s grade, and so on. The team had
difficulty obtainingcontentfrom anyone-all the members seemed reluctant to
proceed forward without
approval from the others. One member
constantly reminded
the team of all of his workon the project, as if to imply that theywere not working
hard enough. Team membersdisappeared for days without prior notice, leading the

<-----Page 19----->48

JARVEN’AA, KNOLL,

AND LEIDNER

team to invent the notion of AWAL (“Absence Without Authorized Leave”). The
progress was slow and largely accomplished as a result of external crises (e.g., a
member hadto report on the team’s work inan organized class at his university).
Midway throughthe project, Kathy, aftera two-day delay, reviewed the work that
had been done and asked why her comments “so
werebluntly” included in the page
without discussion. She found this “a bit frustrating” and was
that her
“sad”
contribution was not
as much as the others.This seriously outraged another member, Jim, who
felt that he was doingso much work and what did he get in response, complaints.
The
incident, however, was handled very promptly. Before even receiving any responses
and only six minutes after her complaint, Kathy sent two messages stating that the
team was nevertheless very good and she was very pleased. Evidently, before reading
Kathy’s two follow-up messages, Jim responded with
his emotionally charged message, buthe also immediately sent two follow-up messages apologizing
(the fmt 25
minutes later and the second72 minutes later)--before he, too, had heard anyone’s
response. Within hours the third active member, Jeff, wrote that disagreements were
normal and that they were
still a great team and should continue with the work. The
incident, which easily could have permanently disrupted
this team, instead helpedto
focus them and encouraged them
to give feedbackon each other’s ideas.
After the incident, the members organized themselves, gave point-by-point feedback
to each others’ work, and
felt greater confidence in their
own portion of the workindicated by less direct request
for feedback. They also gave more positive feedback
and thanks to each other for the work they were doing, as wellas making remarks
about how well the team worked together. The members themselves noticed the
changein the team. AtonepointKathystatedthatsheliked

The team proactively excluded inactive team members. One member, who was
receiving no course creditfor the project, dropped off the team aafter

a long period and the members began

coordinator that Alex should be dropped from the team. Alex again reappeared but
this time was not forgiven.

of the other
members took the lead in keeping an eye on the deadlines. This team consistently
made promises of dates when they would
do certain things and consistently stuck
to
their promised dates. They
also made a point of notifying the membersdates
of when
they would be unavailable to check their mail. Nine messages contained information
concerning when they would not be available.
In summary, team C was ableto make a transition from a rather passive team
to one
of the most active teams in the face of disaster.
In the latter half of the main
project,
the team exhibited characteristics similar
to teams A and B. Like teamsA and B, the
members expected to have
future interactions, either virtual
or face-to-face, reflecting
the closeness that members had developed with one another.

Team D: Low Trust
Team D was characterized from the beginninglittle
by communication, few goals for
the project, and very
little feedback. The team began the collaboration by checking
to
see if others were already on-line and
ifthe system worked without
actually introducing themselves. However, even when responding to members that their messages were
received, the other members merely replied“ok, got the message” but neitherintroduced themselves nor greetedthe other members. In what could be interpretedas a
sarcastic reply, one member wrote “reply reply reply reply reply” in response
to
another member’s request
for a reply if his message was received. While
the message
may not have been intendedas sinister, the failureto include a greeting or a closing
as well as the fact thatit wasthe fvst message sent by this individual would
certainly
not be expected tocreate positive feelings among the recipients.
The first several messages indicateda lack of understanding of
the project and the
lack of task goals.In an early message, one member asks “what
the heck” they are
supposed to do. One response was
“I also don’t know what to do.” Anothersimilar.

The same individual repeated the question one week later. Another individual responded by givingthe URL address wherethe instructions couldbe located but did
not summarizefor the member what the project entailed.

on individual responsibility and be proactive. Ratherthan volunteer, members would ask who would

JARVENPAA, KNOLL, AND LEIDNJSR

location to the other members and asked for feedback. There was no feedback except
by a member who asked, “anyone out there?” Blake sent the address again, along
with a long description of thework he had done. The only reply was “Er. . . nice
page . . . should I know these words . .. ” There would be no further communication in team D from this point until the end of the project. In this message, the
leader responded to his own messages-“Hi Blake. No, I have no comment. Bye,
Blake”-in what can beinterpreted as a cynical reflection of the lack of feedback from
the other members. The leader completed the final assignment alone and submitted it
three weeks latera
from “TeamD” without mentioning inactive members. Ironically,
member sent a desperate requestfor the URL-he needed it to receive course credit.
There was no response.

Team E: Low Trust
Team E suffered fromso little communication that
it appeared as no
if one on the team
was willing to contribute, unlike teamD, where at least one member was willing to
work. The first word to describe teamE is blase; the secondis noncommittal. Each
member in his or her introduction stressed time pressures.
One member stated that
his
goal for the project was“to spend as little time
as necessary butstill get a decent grade.”
The other members had
no particular goals. The concern with other commitments was
evident throughout.One member asked each member to state how much the project
was worth toward their grade. She appeared to want
to know who should be mostly
responsible for the project (i.e., the one for whom
the project counted the most).
This
sort of logic appeared to be very destructive to the smooth functioning
a team. The
of
same member later statedin a message howmany projects she wasworkiig on. In a
following message from another member, he too stated
the number of different
projects he was working on as though to suggest that she deserved
specialno
leniency
just becauseshehadotherworktodo.Thenextmessagewasfromthethird
participating team member who stated that he had not checked his mail recently
because he had “so much work” to do.
This teamalso suffered from lack of leadership. One member did volunteer
to turn
in the fmt team-building assignment and one member volunteered to code the team’s
project into html form. However, the latter offer
a mixed
was blessing as
the member
refused to do any other work, including giving feedback on ideas,
aside from taking
a final proposal and converting
it to html form. The team was very task-oriented and
never engaged in social comments of any kind. Only
two instances of positive
feedback were given-both when one individual thanked another for turning in
the
material.
The team communication was astoundingly low. At one point there was an eight-day
lapse in communication (April5-13) at a critical juncture in the project where the
teams needed to choose their topic and define the parameters. On aApril
member
14,
gave two seemingly interesting possible topics but never received any feedback on
the ideas. On April 19 he asked again for feedback “even if you don’t have strong
feelings.” Three days later there awas
message-a team member volunteered
to code

<-----Page 22----->TRUST IN GLOBALVIRTUAL

TEAMS

51

the project into html. She said, “Can we PLEASE try to respond” but did not even
mention a word about
the previous member’sideas. On April 22, a member gave
four
more ideas, again without commenting on the original two ideas presented by a
member on April 14 and repeated on April 19. The contributor of the original ideas
did provide feedback on the new ideas and contributed one morepossible topic. The
third participating member preferred the latter topic and that was the topic chosen.
This member agreed to be responsible for two of the sections. He completed the
sections by the determined date but his material lacked depth. The same problem
occurred with the member responsible for the other three sections. Hence, the final
product was a weak proposal prepared by
individuals who divided the work and
commented on no one’s portions other than their own. This team did not choose
the
final topic until April 2 N w o days before the project wasdue!
Interestingly, this team had one nonactive member. One member asked what had
happened to this member butno one responded. The nonactive member was
ignored,
perhaps because eventhe “active” members were barelyactive.

Team F: Low Trust
Team F was characterizedby both lack of individualinitiative and an unwillingness
to give substantial feedback to others’ work. Like team E, team F suffered from
infrequent participation. Two individuals were primarily responsible for the total
output of the project and both of them refused
to put forth full individual effort given
the lack of commitment fromthe other members.
Although the team members expressed their interest and commitment in early
messages, no member was willingto take charge. Each time something was needed,
a member would ask who was going
to do theactivity rather than volunteering.This
beganwith the first exercise inwhichamembersaidthatsomeoneneeded
to
coordinate the activity and asked for a volunteer. No one volunteered. The member
who askedthe question eventuallyvolunteered himself.This same member
later asked
three times, “who is writing the paper?’ but did not contribute so much as a sentence
or an idea. Only oneindividualgave anyideas for the project itself. Another
individual
gave feedback on the ideas, essentially stating that they were all unfeasible because
said
oftheir scope or difficulty,but gaveno additional ideas himself. Another member
the ideas were too general but offered no suggestionson how to focus.
This team had participants who would give very minor contributions-such as a
URL site to be included in
the page-but would give no descriptionof the site, hence
leaving the work of deciding what
to call the link, and howto describe it inthe paper,
to someone else. That “someone else” was the member who stated early on that he
wanted to be responsiblefor coding and page layout. As the
withcoder in team
E, this
individualwas entirely unwilling to make anydecisions regarding content. Throughout the project, he reminded the others that he wasjust coding the information they
sent-they were supposedto tell him what to include and what notto include. Each
time a URL address was
sent, he replied, “am I supposed to include this?’ He neither
reviewed the link independently nor gave any comments concerning
its suitability.

<-----Page 23----->52

JARVENPAA, KNOLL, AND LEIDNJ?R

Rather than the messages full of content found in the high-trust teams, the messages
of this team were brief and full of questions.
At one pointa member asked ifit was
all right if he sent some site addresses he found, instead of just sending them and
describing them. The response
was: “alright, alright, alright.” Team
F members were
also unwilling todo anythmg beyond what they already knew. The person coding
the
pages was very experienced with page development and hence insisted onthedoing
coding but would do nothing else. Toward the end, the coder informed the other team
members that he was going on vacation and had “already done” his “share of the
work.”
At best, the members ofthis team, excluding the one member who did send some
ideas and wrote sections of the paper, be
candescribed as inactive. Onlythree instances
of positivefedback occurred, two of which were rather mixed,
“nice work, but. . .” The
team was unable to complete the final assignment.

Discussion
A PATTERN-MATCHINGAPPROACH[5,41] WASUSEDTOINFER behaviors and Strategies
common to the high-trust teams, but less common to, or nonexistent in, the low-trust
teams. Table 7 summarizes the results on the strategies. Strategies inferred were:
proactive action, task versus procedural orientation, positive tone, rotating leadership,
task goal clarity, role division, time management, nature of feedback, and frequent,
sometimes intense bursts
of interaction. The strategies
are reinforcing of each other.

Proactive Orientation
The case studies suggest that the members in high-trust teams exhibited individual
initiative, volunteered for roles, and met their commitments. The high-trust teams also
dealt decisively with members who were perceived
to be free-riders. The low-trust
teams were opposite in these respects. The low-trust teams suffered from inaction,
characterized by the asking of questions but rare delivery of any substantive work,
and by askingfor volunteers but rarely volunteering.
The team members also rarely
notified the team in advance of their absences.
On all three high-trust teams there were instances of members
stating in advance
that they would be out of townfor the weekend, or for as much as a week, and then
fmding a computer from which to log in and contribute. The exertion of extra effort
reinforced the level of perceived commitment the members had toward the team.
than ignoring or
The high-trust teams dealt with free-riders by confronting, rather
accepting, the problem. The teams took initiatives to inform the project coordinator
of any nonactive members. Even though the teams were unaware of whether or not
their complaints resulted in the official withdrawal of the nonactive member
the
from
project, they were more comfortableas a team if they identified the members who
were not contributing and redefined the team around the active members. By contrast,
the low-trust teams ignoref
the free-riders.

Task versus Procedural Orientation
In high-trust teams, the action orientation meant that team members were highly
focused on results. The communication almostexclusively rallied aroundthe assignments. Rarelydid the teams have time
for social dialogue. One of the high-trust teams
discussed topics unrelated to the assignments, but this was only in the early stages
when the team haddifficulty in making progress. Althoughthe communication in the
high-trust teams wastask-oriented,it is important to note that it wasstill empathetic.
The team membersdiscussed each others’ tasks and results in a very supportive and
amicable fashion,which inturn reinforced the team’s collectivecommitment and good
will.
Like the high-trust teams,the low trust teams engaged little
in social communication.
Yet, unlike the high-trust teams,the low-trust teams rarely expressed empathy: What
little emotion was expressed tended
to reflect uncertainty about whether anyone was
reading their messages or frustrationand disappointmentthat no one else was contributing.
Interestingly, the high-trust teams did not spend much time on group procedures,
except one teamin the early slowstages. Rather than being concernedthat someone
else was workingon preciselythe same thing, individualson the high-trustteams tried
to produce high-quality work and then
share the work withthe team for feedback and
improvement.Thelow-trustteams
spent relativelymoretime on procedures as
members tried to evade responsibilityand get others to do the work.

Positive Tone
The high-trust team members expressed excitement and showered
other members with
compliments and encouragement. On several occasions, the high-trust teams expressed how fortunate they were to have such a well-knctioning team. Even at the
end, the team members madeexplicit attempts to laud eachother for excellent work.

<-----Page 25----->54

JARVENPAA, KNOLL, AND LEIDNER

Two of the high-trust teams were convincedby the start of the third assignment that
they would bethe winning team.
The high-trust teams handled disagreementsso gently thatit was barelyperceptible
that a disagreement had occurred.
If a member made a suggestion with which another
member disagreed, such as the suggestion of a member
of team Cthat they should use
majority voteto determine the idea chosen for the final
project,the dissentingmember
responded not by directly addressing the point of disagreement but by offering an
alternative along with an explanation.
The low-trust teams lacked positive tonein their communications. Compared with
the high-trust teams, the low-trust teams exhibitedlittle emotion of any kind intheir
messages. Nor did the team members
express any interestin winning the $600 award;
rather, the low-trust teams focused on what they might
lose if they performed poorly
rather than on what they might gain if they performed well.addition,
In
the low-trust
teams wereinordinatelyconcerned withthe differencesin the course credit that team
members received for completing the final project. The low-trust teams had few
instancesof disagreement, but because they were giving
so little feedback on the other
members’ work,there was not much opportunityto disagree.

Rotating Leadership
The high-trust teams rotated leadership-the members each demonstrated certain
leadership traits during the course of the project but the actual leader was neither
chosen nor consistent throughout. As the perceived need for a member to press the
others to present ideas arose, a member filled the position. As the need arose for
someone to organize the remaining work, a memberfilled that position. In terms of
the output, the same would apply. The members were
leaders in their particular area
of skill andthe other members followed their directions.The members who tookon
responsibilityfor writing the html for theprojects directed theother teammates during
the coding period, whereas the members responsible for writing the draft made
suggestions to the other team members concerning what to do. By contrast, the
low-trust teams had noleadership or, in one case, a leader with no followers.

Task Goal Clarity
The high-trust teams discussed the goals of the assignments to a greater extent than
the low-trust teams. In case of ambiguity in the assignments, the members in the
high-trust teams did not hesitate
to contact the coordinatorwith questions rather than
making their own assumptions. Alreadyduringtheteam-building
exercises, the
high-trust teams exhibited knowledge of the assignment objectives and expressed
what their personal goals were in the context of the overall collaboration and the
assignments. Contrary to the high-trust teams, the low-trust teams undertook little
discussion of task goals. Most ofthe communication concerning taskgoals was inthe
context of a member not knowing what they were supposed
to do. In these instances,
a member inthe low-trust teams tendedto provide onlythe URL to the site where the

<-----Page 26----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUAL TEAMS

55

assignment information resided rather than summarizing the assignments him or
herself for the benefit of others. Members of the low-trust teams did not exhibit
knowledgeof the assignmentsanddidnot
tie their ownpersonal goals to the
assignments during the team-building
exercises beyond statementsof “spend as little
time as necessary.”

Role Division and Specificity
Although the role of an individual team member tended
to emerge after the individual
had produced something on his or her own, each of the high-trust teams exhibited
various roles for the team members. The fact that individuals were not assigned to
teams basedon their particular specializationor skill may havenecessitateda flexible
role arrangement wherebythe role was decidedafter an individual took initiative for
a certain task and produced a result (“You will be our webmaster”). Also
high-trust
in
teams, the division of work did not mean complete independence. Rather, one person
would comeup with the first iteration ofthe work and others would providedetailed
feedback. Hence, the high-trust teams associated roles with independence followed
by several iterations offeedbackandrework.Thelow-trustteamsappeared
to
associate division of work with complete independence of work. In summary, the
high-trust teams appearedto use roles so that they wereable to reduce teaminterdependence to moderate levels. The low-trust teams divided work so that they could
eliminate their interdependence.

Time Management
The high-trust teams explicitly discussed the assignment schedules, established
milestones, monitored the milestones, and kept a close eye on time, reminding
other members of impending deadlines. Furthermore, the high-trust teams were
more aware oftime zonedifferences and howto manage the global clock toreduce
the “downtime” when no one was working on the common parts. The low-trust
teams did not discuss time management apart from reminding others of the date
when the assignment was due. The low-trust teams only referred to the time zone
differences in the context of who should submit the completed assignments. The
low-trust teams werealso more likely to ask the coordinator for extra time. In short,
the low-trust teams exhibited neither a sense of urgency from impending deadlines
nor anotion of managingtime.

Nature of Feedback
In the high-trust teams, members gave substantial feedback
orientedtoward improving
the content of a fellow member’s work. The feedback
frequently involved some
content contributions to add to the work, as well as some organizing and editing
comments. In the low-trust teams, feedback was often a very minor “ok” or “looks
good to me” statement that added verylittle value to the actual work. Thus, evenif a

<-----Page 27----->56

JARVENPAA, KNOLL, AND LEIDNER

member specifically requested feedback on his or her work, he or she was likely to
get only an acknowledgment that the work was perused, however
cursorily.

Frequency and Patternof Interaction
Probably to reduce the uncertainty ofthe global context, high-trust teams engaged in
frequent communication, gave substantive feedback on fellow members’ work, and
notified each other of their absences and whereabouts.
Overall, some of the high-trust
teams had four times the message volume of a low-trust team. Frequent, and sometimes intense, bursts of interaction appearedto reinforce trust inthe high-trust teams.
Low-trust teams repeatedlyissued messages of“Is there anyone out there?’
In both high- and low-trust teams, individuals were reluctant to believe that their
messages wereactually successfullysent if they did not receive
fairly rapid feedback.
As a means
of appeasing the stress related to not knowing whether one’s message was
received and, if so, whether it was read, the members on the high-trust teams were
carefid to inform their teammates when they would, and when they would not, be
available to check their messages. This gavethe other members a degree ofcertainty
concerning when their messages would be viewed and answered. By contrast, the
low-trustteams sufferedfrom lengthy unexplained
lapses in communication followed
by sudden unexpected reemergences.

A Model of Trust in Global Virtual
Teams
Triangulation of ourqualitative results with the recentliterature on trust suggest that
the three high-trust teams might have
exhibiteda form of“swift” trust. Swift trust [2 I ]
was developedto explain behaviors inface-to-facetemporary teams. In a temporary
team, team members “have never worked
together and do not expectto work again”
[2 1, p. 1681. Members of such teams do not have thetotime
develop trustin a gradual
and cumulative fashion. Rather, the team members as
actif trust is present from the
start.
Whereas trust is typically conceptualized as either an affective or a cognitive
construct, swift trust is a form of depersonalized action. According to Meyerson,
Weick,andKramer [23], “There is less emphasis on feeling, commitment,and
exchange and moreon action, . . . and heavy absorption in the task” (p. 191); “swift
trust may be a by-product of a highly
active, proactive, enthusiastic,generative style
of action” (p. 180). The “swift trust” enables members to take action, and this action
will help the team maintain trust and deal with uncertainty,ambiguity, and vulnerability while workingon complex interdependent tasks withstrangers in a situation of
high timepressure.
Besides the action orientation, the other strategies associated with the three hightrust teamsseem to alignwiththeMeyerson
et al. [23] copingmechanismsof
temporary teams and henceto be associated with swifttrust. Meyerson et al. discuss
how there are few purely social exchanges in temporary teams because “anything
that
subtracts from task performance . . . should be a glaring threat” (p. 177). We found

<-----Page 28----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUAL TEAMS

57

the global virtual teams to be task-oriented. Meyersonet al. [23]also point to the need
to have a moderatelevel, not a highlevel, of dependence on anyparticular member
to reduce perceivedvulnerability.The strategy of rotating leadership reduced dependence on anyparticular person. The strategies of clear task goals, role division, and
specificity gave the teams a sense ofclear expectation and task systems and thereby
provided the illusion of reduced vulnerability. Thesense of limited time andexplicit
time managementis related to Meyerson et al.’s [23] comment that “temporary teams
rarely exhibit certain kinds of dysfunctional group dynamics” that deal “jealousy,
with
misunderstandings, and hurt feelings” (p. 190). According to Meyerson et al. [23],
“there is simply not enough time
for things to go wrong” (p. 190).Finally, high levels
of interactivity tend to reduce ambiguity and uncertainty and should
strengthen trust
in temporary teams [23]. In the three high-trustteams,memberscommunicated
frequently and providedextensive and substantive feedback to each other.
The high-trust teams appeared to exhibit swift trust from the outset. In particular,
the teams’ early messages contained traces of initiative and trustful actions. The
low-trust teams did not exhibit any overt lack oftrust in the beginning; hence, we can
only assumethat trust also existed ex ante in these teams. However, this trust decreased
almost immediately, becausethe members lacked action and initiative. By contrast,
the action orientationin the high-trust teams appeared
to reinforce andstrengthentrust.
Hence, action seems to be an important antecedent as well as an outcome of trust.
Action that went beyond thecall of dutystrengthenedtrust.
The current case analysis does not provide clear evidence on the relationship
between action and the other antecedentsof trust:integrity, ability, benevolence, and
propensity to trust. Boyle and Bonacich
[I] maintain thattrusting behavior willaffect
trust directly. By contrast, Mayer et al. [22] argue thattrusting behavior willinfluence
trust indirectly through the antecedentsof trust; that is, inactivitymight be interpreted
as a lack of goodwill (benevolence),a lack ofability to contribute (ability), andor a
lack of reliability and honesty(integrity).
In summary, trusting action is as much an antecedent of trustas an outcome of it.
The relationship between action and trust appears to be highly recursive in a virtualteam context. Figure 2 advances a model of trustglobal
for virtual teams.

Conclusion
THEPURPOSE OF THE REPORTED STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE the antecedents of trust
in global virtual teams. Althoughthe team-building exercises had a positive effect
on the perceptionsof other members’ integrity, ability, and benevolence, they did
not have a direct effect on trust. In the early phases of teamwork, team trust was
predicted more strongly by perceptions ofother team members’integrity, and least
strongly by the perceptions of
their benevolence. The salienceof other members’
perceived ability on trust decreased over time. The members’ own propensity to
trust had a significant, although unchanging, effect on trust. Perhaps the most
interesting finding was that the qualitative case analysis suggests that high-trust

teams exhibit swift trust [23]. Prior to discussing implications for researchand
practice, we consider some of thelimitations.

Limitations
Given thatthe teams did not have an opportunity
to meet in person or use telephone
or video conferencefacilities, one might argue that the
current context was contrived.
Nevertheless, from a practicalstandpoint, our study provides a glimpse ofthe future
where compressed time windows and project budgets do not allow people
to travel
for overseas team meetings. The study provides a rare opportunity to examine pure
virtual interaction free from anyinfluences of face-to-faceinteraction.
The study’s methodology can becriticized in several ways.First, the team-building
exercises might have been too brief or might have been consideredartificial by the
participants. Devising exercises to increase trust in teams is a potentially lucrative
project but was beyond the scope of the current study. Second, the tasks might not
have beenappropriate to all participants even though we hadno evidence suggesting
that certain participants found the project irrelevant to their studies. Third, the case
analyses relied on members’ usingthe team address rather thandirect their mail to the
individual members’ addresses. Hence, the team analyses might be basedon limited
information. Our prior studies [I31 suggest that teams send relatively infrequent
individuallydirectedmessages becauseit is mucheasierto use a team address.
Fourth,
the measurements of trust and the antecedents of trust were modified from a scale

<-----Page 30----->TRUST IN GLOBAL VIRTUALTEAMS

59

intended for dyadic, as opposed to team, relationships. Finally, although professors
whose studentswere invited to participatewere informedthat the collaborationshould
count for 20 to 40 percent ofa student’s course grade, there were widediscrepancies
in course credit and hencein participants’risk level.
The external validity of the results might be
faulted for the use of students as
participants. One should note, however, that
the students were in masters’ programs
and most of the students had significant work experience. The theory of swift trust
assumes that people are assigned
to teams on the basis of their ability. In the current
study this was notthe case because we did not this
startstudy by exploring swift trust.
Many transnational teams have an appointed project
leader. The current teams were
self-directed and, unless they appointedleader,
a
a leader emerged, or leadership was
shared, the teams were “leaderless.” In addition, some teams had only two active
members, where other teams had as many as four or five active members. Unfortunately, we were notable to ascertain whetheror not allactive members completedthe
survey. Hence, there is a potential bias in the responses in that some active team
members may not have completed
the surveys andwe cannot determine the reasons
for their failureto provide responses.Finally,the teams werelimitedto electronicmail
and occasional chat sessions: No video conferenceor telephone conferencefacilities
were available. Hence, the technology was of lower bandwidth than might be expected
in situations where team members do not
travel.

Implications for Research
The research on trust in global virtual teams is a wide open field. Future research
should examinethe relationship between trusting behavior andthe other antecedents
of trust. Our earlier study alluded to theimportance of structure andnorms in
well-functioningvirtual teams [ 131. Future work mightstudy how norms emerge and
how they are enacted. The current study suggests tentatively that, once the high-trust
teams agreed on, for example, the acceptable time lapse between messages, the
members adheredto this relatively well and those who did not were to
asked
leave the
team. It remains unclear whether
the existenceoftrust allowed these norms to emerge
or whether the consensus of norms reinforced the trust. We suspect both are true.
Future studies should also examine if
virtual teams go throughthe type of transition
between inertia and revolution in the work behaviors and themes found by Gersick
[8] in face-to-face teams. Such transition was only explicitly evident in team C, but
our qualitative analysis of three high- andthree low-trust teams might not have been
in-depth enough. Future research also needsto verify the current findings and more
rigorously assess swift trust and the means to maintain it. The initial list of strategies
may or may not be unique to our context. Also, future work needs to develop an
understanding ofthe relationship between swift trust and team behavior and should
explore distrust versus trust in a virtualcontext. Finally, future research should study
whether dyadic and team trustare substantiallydifferent and require fundamentally
different measures.
Finally, much work remains in
terms of the type oftasks, individuals,team size, and

<-----Page 31----->60

JARVENPAA, KNOLL, AND LEIDNER

the length of projectduration that are most suited to virtual collaboration.There isa
plethora of issues related to global clock management and
the best waysto divide and
integrate work in a team dispersed around the world. Future studies should assign
individuals to teams on the basis of skill or specialization and should examine the
concept ofroles in virtual teams.

Implications for Practice
For practicing global virtual teams, the study suggestsa number ofstrategiesthat they
might deployto reinforce trust and, in turn, to improve their team process outcomes.
These strategies include proactive behavior, empathetic task communication,
positive
tone, rotating team leadership, task goalclarity, role division, time management, and
frequent interactionwith acknowledged and detailed responses
to prior messages. The
study also points out the importance of havingas virtual membersthose who have a
high propensity to trust. But, perhaps most important, virtual members should have
high levels of initiative, results orientation,and integrity.

Concluding Note
The current paper has explored the emerging phenomenon of global virtual teams
where only virtual, not face-to-face, interaction is possible. The antecedents commonly associated with trust in face-to-face dyadic
relationships-trustor’s perceived
ability, benevolence, integrity,and trustee’spropensity to trust-were found to predict
trust in the virtual-team context. A number of behavioral strategies were identified
that appearedto distinguish the highest-trust teams from
the lowest-trust teams. These
strategies suggested the presence of swift trust. The paper proposed a preliminary
model of trust for global virtual teams.
Although the current analysis was on the team level, one might be able to infer
implications for individuals. Those individuals who perform best in global virtual
teams are not likely to be entirely different fromindividualswho perform bestalone:
individuals who are action-oriented,who are willing to take initiative on their own,
and whoare goal-driven. Latham and Lock[ 181 found that, in aninternationalsetting,
a team member skilled in self-management, ingoal setting, self-monitoring, and
self-assessment was critical for performance. Snow, Snell, and Davison [33] found
similar results: In successful transnational teams, team members were committedto
on to perform their respective tasks,
the team’s mission and norms, could be counted
and enjoyed working
in a team. When such capable
individualscommit to a team, they
are able successfully to manage the uncertainties and unknowns of aglobal virtualteam environment.
