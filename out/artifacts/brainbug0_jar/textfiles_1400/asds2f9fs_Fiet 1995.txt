RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES IN VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETS

ABSTRACT

This research compares risk avoidance strategies employed by business angels
and venture capital firm investors. It finds that differences in their approaches to
evaluating risk lead them to hold predictably different views of the dangers of
market and agency risk. The former tend to rely upon the entrepreneur to
protect them from losses due to market risk. Consequently, they are more concerned with agency risk than market risk. The latter are more concerned with
market risk because they have learned to protect themselves contractually from
agency risk using boilerplate contractual terms and conditions. A likely result of
their different approaches to avoiding risk is a segmentation of venture capital
markets, which has important implications for both entrepreneurs and future
research.

INTRODUCTION

The two most active US providers of capital to new and growing businesses are
venture capital firms and business angels. The former are professionally
managed, private, independent organizations that invest between $2.4 billion
(Gaston, 1989) and $4.18 billion in capital annually (Timmons and Sapienza,
1992). The latter are private individuals who invest non-institutional funds, often
their own, in amounts that are estimated to range annually between $5.0 billion
(Wetzel, 1983) and $56 billion (Gaston, 1989). Each of these groups has a significant impact upon the supply of new venture capital. Together, their
combined annual investments constitute the majority of external funding that is
available to entrepreneurs (Fiet, 1991a).
Because it is possible that entrepreneurs could contact either of these investors
(or venture capitalists) as they search for funding, it is important that they understand the types of deals that each prefers, if they are successfully to target their
search. This is quite a different issue from the one investigated by researchers
who have examined the stages in the venture capitalist's deal evaluation process
(Hall, 1989; Hall and Hofer, 1993; Silver, 1985; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984;
Wells, 1974). While these studies have clarified what venture capital investors
actually do to evaluate a deal, they do not address the question of whether there
are any underlying factors that tilt the funding decision toward one type of a

deal. Also, because they do not examine what Dubin (1978, p. 29) refers to as
'broad relationships', they tend to be exploratory and not easily utilized for
theory building and testing.
This research examined one aspect of a deal - its riskiness - and the possibility
that venture capitalists prefer to avoid investing in deals affected by a particular
type of risk. This research was based upon the informational economics assumption that information to reduce the riskiness of a deal can be acquired at a cost
(Hayek, 1945). Thus, the acquisition of risk-reducing information can be viewed
as an investment decision affecting the cost of the evaluation process. One way to
minimize the cost of investing in information is to specialize in assessing particular types of deals - in this case, deals affected by a particular form of risk. An
examination of all forms of venture capital risk was beyond the scope of the
present research. Hence, it limited itself to market and agency risk.
Market risk is due to unforeseen competitive conditions. It depends upon the
size, growth and accessibility of the market, and on the existence of a market
need.
Agency risk is the degree of uncertainty that either the entrepreneur or the
venture capitalist will pursue his or her own interests rather than comply with the
requirements of the contract for venture capital. Agency risk is caused by the
difficulty in monitoring the separate and possibly divergent interests of investors
and entrepreneurs. However, in this research, agency risk refers to the venture
capitalist's risk that the entrepreneur will pursue his or her own interests at the
expense of those of the venture capitalist.
The importance that venture capital investors attach to a particular type of
risk could be inversely related to the kind of risk they believe they are most competent to control. It is also possible that. the type of risk that they assess the most
is the risk that they most want to avoid affecting their deals. For example, if they
believed that they were especially qualified to monitor the entrepreneur, they
would not need to worry as much about making agency mistakes because they
would be confident that they make fewer of them and would be able to structure
the deal so that they would be protected. What they would need to avoid is
committing themselves to a deal where the market was unattractive, a factor
which they would be less adept at controlling. Thus, we would expect them to
specialize in assessing market risk factors and to avoid deals where there was any
doubt about their attractiveness. They would not be as confident they could
avoid market losses as they were that they could avoid losses due to agency risk.
On the other hand, they might be less confident they could avoid agency losses
and, as a consequence, view it as more threatening than market risk.

THE SPECIFIC NATURE OF RISK-REDUCING INFORMATION

If information is to be useful in reducing ~ deal's riskiness, it must pertain specifically to the deal under consideration. In fact, risk-reducing information is
characteristically specific information (Hayek, 1945). The most specific form of
information has little or no value for reducing risk in more than one deal
(Barney and Ouchi, 1986, pp. 21, 22; Klein et al., 1978). The degree of informational specificity is a critical dimension because it can vary between being only

relevant to a particular deal and being so general in nature that the signals that
it sends would be meaningless to an investor.
Hayek (1945, pp. 321, 322) noted that it is often specific information about the
particular circumstances of time and place that are most likely to affect a deal. It
may consist of knowledge of people, of local conditions and special circumstances. Examples of such information for venture capitalists are assessments of
the character and integrity of the entrepreneur, market studies to evaluate the
potential for a new product, and evaluations of potential sites to determine traffic
counts and development costs. In contrast, college educations, courses required
for state licences, and information about macro-economic trends fall into the
category of general information, rather than specific information, and provide
little if any risk-reducing information for a particular deal.
Because of the specificity of risk-reducing information, it is likely that business
angels and venture capital firms place more importance on one type of risk than
another. That is, they selectively acquire information about different types of risk
because it is 'not given to anyone in its totality' (Hayek, 1945, p. 320). If they
saw themselves as more qualified to manage a particular type of risk, they would
worry less about it and would acquire information about the specific aspects of
the deal in which they had less confidence. To advance this study it was necessary to consider how venture capitalists might evaluate specific information about
market and agency risk.

MARKET RISK

Market risk has been described in the strategy literature as the degree of uncertainty associated with gaining a competitive advantage due to environmental
factors (Barney et al., 1989; Fiet, 1991b; Porter, 1980). Although market risk has
been described in the literature, it cannot be directly observed. We can only
make inferences about it based upon how it affects indicator variables that are
observable. The following potential indicators of market risk were thought to be
among the most promising of those found in previous conceptual research:

1. Technical obsolescence can cause losses when entrepreneurs invest in specialized
assets. Once these specialized assets become obsolete, they have a lower value
when used for purposes other than those for which they were previously purchased (Klein et al., 1978; Williamson, 1985).
2. Many competitors (Mcgee, 1988; Scherer, 1980) increase the difficulty of colluding to increase the level of joint profits (Rumelt, 1988; Stigler, 1961). When
they cannot collude they are forced to compete for a share of a market that is
presumed to be finite, even if it is growing. Competition increases inter-firm
rivalry and lowers the level of prices that can be charged. Increased competition
forces down the level of industry profits and increases an entrepreneur's risk of
market losses.
3. Many potential, new competitors (Bain, 1956; Porter, 1980) increase the prospects that additional new firms will be bidding to provide more products/
services at lower, more competitive prices. Lower prices increase the level of
competitive rivalry which increases the risk of market losses.

4. Many substitute products!services (Porter, 1980; Scherer, 1980) blur any distinctions in output held by suppliers. When the cross-elasticities of substitutes are
positive, lowering the price of one substitute lowers the demand for the other
(Mcgee, 1988). Substitutes also increase the power of buyers to set prices. This
transfer of competitive power occurs when products can no longer be differentiated by buyers as distinctive. The result is an increase in competitive rivalry
and an increased risk of market losses.
5. Weak customer demand for a product or service (Porter, 1980) causes sellers to offer
concessions that increase the risk of market losses.
6. Market attractiveness (Day, 1986; Porter, 1980; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984;
Williamson, 1975) is a qualitative variable that summarizes those structural
characteristics of an industry that are peculiar and slow to change. It is a
function of its size, growth and accessibility and on the existence of a market
need. The more attractive a market, the lower will be the level of competitive
rivalry within it, the higher will be the profitability of its firms, and the lower will
be the level of risk to its firms due to market losses.

AGENCY RISK

The concept of agency risk has been described by financial economists, but only
a couple of known studies have attempted to apply it in the venture capital arena
(Barney, Busenitz, Fiet and Moesel, 1989; Fiet, 1991b). The following potential
indicators are extensions of those found in the mainstream literature and were
selected for further study:

1. Potentially dishonest entrepreneurs (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Jensen and
Meckling, 1978) increase the risk that they will deliberately withhold information
that is critical to equitable contract negotiation. Dishonesty could result in agency
losses due to opportunism.
2. Entrepreneurs knowing more than venture capitalists about the enterprise (Alchian
and Demsetz, 1972; Eisenhardt, 1989) constitutes a form of information asymmetry that creates an agency risk when entrepreneurs are opportunistic.
3. Great distance to be travelled between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur's enterprise (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Gupta and Sapienza, 1992)
increases the likelihood that less frequent monitoring will permit losses due to
agency risk.
4. Short-term self interest seeking by the entrepreneur inhibits joint profit maximization for both the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur (Alchian and
Demsetz, 1972).
5. Numerous entrepreneurs to be monitored (Eisenhardt, 1989) increase a venture
capitalist's span of control and decrease the time that can be spent monitoring
each venture.
6. Not performing as agreed may result from either unforeseen circumstances or
from self-interest seeking with guile (Williamson, 1975).
7. Game playing is a form of intentional self-interest seeking (Williamson,
1975).

INVESTOR SPECIAUZATION

The acquismon of specific information about either market or agency risk
sends a clearer, more relevant signal than general risk-reducing information
(Hayek, 1945; Hirschleifer, 1970). Because venture capital investors and
business angels cannot costlessly acquire specific information, they are guided in
its selection by the type of risk that they are most interested in avoiding.
Moreover, their tendency to concentrate on a particular type of risk would
enable them to avoid starting over from the beginning each time they consider
a new deal. On average, we would expect they would acquire information specifically related to the type of risk that they perceived to be the most threatening to them.

Venture Capital Firm Investors and Their Vuws

if Market Risk

There is substantial evidence to indicate that venture capital firm investors view
market risk as more threatening than agency risk. They may worry less about
agency risk because they are able to protect themselves through the use of boilerplate contractual terms and conditions that they append to each venture
capital agreement. Boilerplate reduces the cost of protecting themselves against
agency risk by generating economies of scale in the writing of contracts. These
economies of scale can then be used to offset the cost of investigating market
risk, which according to Driscoll (1974), has become their most important
function. It has become their most important function, in all probability,
because they see themselves as most vulnerable to it.
On average, venture capital firms spend about half of their time monitoring
nine investments for factors that could affect a new venture's competitive position
(Gorman and Sahlman, 1989). Even after they commit themselves financially to a
deal, they spend about eight hours on-site, and about 30 hours on the telephone
evaluating the competitive position of each company in their portfolio (Gorman
and Sahlman, 1989).
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) examined how venture capital firm investors
evaluate the riskiness of a deal. They found that the venture capital firm investor's evaluation consisted of five assessment stages: market attractiveness, product
differentiation, managerial capabilities, resistance to environmental threats, and
anticipated cashout potential. Each of these stages evaluated market risk with the
exception of managerial capabilities, which is an agency issue. In general,
however, venture capital firms seem to be assessing market factors more than
agency factors.
New businesses are subject to more market risk than established businesses
because they are often exploring markets where competitive equilibriums among
buyers, suppliers, potential entrants, current competitors, and product/service
substitutes have not been established (Porter, 1980). A new firm's own competitive actions may even be the source of some unexpected shifts in equilibrium
(Schumpeter, 1936). Assuming that venture capital firm investors specialize in
evaluating market factors, we would expect to find them avoiding start-up deals
that are fraught with the most market risk. In fact, previous researchers have
reported that venture capital firms do avoid start-up deals (Rea, 1989; Wetzel,
1986).

Small businesses that are growing too fast to finance their own growth could
also be expected to be subject to greater market risk. As we would expect,
Wetzel (1986) also reported that venture capital firms avoid providing equity
capital for small firms that are growing too fast to finance their own growth, but
that are not yet large enough to gain access to public equity markets. They
prefer instead to invest after the first few rounds of equity funding have already
been put in place (Bygrave and Timmons, 1992).
Venture capital firms often screen as many as a thousand deals a year looking
for opportunities that pose the least amount of market risk (Fiet, 1991a). They
focus comparatively less on an individual entrepreneur's character, integrity,
reputation, and intentions. Not only may they feel that agency problems can be
regulated more effectively through contract provisions, but they may simply not
have time to evaluate agency issues during the early part of their screening
process. They know that most deals will be rejected and that it would not be
prudent to investigate each entrepreneur's habits at this stage of the due diligence
process. Also, they may think that agency issues are better evaluated through
face-to-face contacts in which the evaluator can consider richer forms of more
subjective data (Daft and Lengel, 1986; Wetzel, 1986).
For the foregoing reasons, venture capital firm investors view market risk as
more important than agency risk, which is the first hypothesis.

Hypothesis 1: Venture capital firm investors view market risk as more important
than agency risk.

Business Angels and Their Vzews qf Ageng Risk
In contrast, there is substantial evidence to indicate that business angels view
agency risk as more threatening than market risk. Although Wetzel (1981, p. 217)
reported that they are 'financially sophisticated individuals of means, often with
previous investment or managerial experience with entrepreneurial ventures',
Haar et al. (1988) reported that they rely more upon their hunches and upon
recommendations from other angels to learn about the entrepreneurs (agents) in
the deal. Because of their previous experience, they may feel that their understanding of the market aspects of a deal is adequate. However, unless the entrepreneur is well known to them, they may feel that a deal will succeed only if they
have the right entrepreneur.
Why would reportedly sophisticated individuals rely upon hunches to guide
their investment decisions? Although not much is known about how they invest,
it may be that the venture capital markets in which business angels operate are
comparatively inefficient disseminators of information about deals, as suggested
by Gaston and Bell (1985) and Wetzel (1987). This suspected informational inefficiency should not be interpreted to imply that business angels would not
consider all available investment information, whether it was public or private, as
suggested by Fama (1970). The problem appears to be that what is available to
them is quite scant. Under these circumstances, investment information often
finds its way to business angels through friends and business associates. In fact,
friends and business associates were the most frequent and reliable sources of
information for business angels (Gaston and Bell, 1985; Wetzel, 1981, 1983,
1986, 1987).

RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES

Their reliance upon friends and business associates may be an indication that
they are precluded from gaining access to the same deal channels employed by
venture capital firms that commonly seek out co-investors among other venture
capital firms (Bygrave, 1988; Fiet, 1991b). Compared to venture capital firms,
business angels do not consider as many deals a year, simply because they do not
have access to them. Gaston and Bell (1985) reported from their study of Sunbelt
investors that business angels are frustrated and dissatisfied with the amount of
information that they receive about potential deals. One third of the investors in
their study reported that they were dissatisfied. The average investor wanted to
invest 83 per cent more than he or she did, but could not find sufficiently attractive deals.
Unlike many venture capital firms, business angels usually do not have analysts
on staff, nor offices dedicated to investigating deals. As a result, they often lack
competency with sophisticated analytical tools to evaluate market risk (Fiet,
199Ia). According to Wetzel (1986), it is not surprising that they often do not
require formal business plans from entrepreneurs because they normally would
not be qualified to evaluate them. However, there may be another explanation of
their not requiring them - they may feel that they do not see enough deals so
that they can properly compare and analyse them. Not having more opportunities to screen deals may result from their having a comparatively less visible
market presence.
Nevertheless, business angels do consult with other business angels, friends and
business associates about deals, particularly about the character, track record,
and intentions of the entrepreneur. However, they simply do not have access to
as many deals as they would like to consider. Because they seem to be rather
frustrated in obtaining market risk information themselves, they may substitute
agency information for it. That is, business angels may rely upon the entrepreneur to evaluate market risk for them. Making such a substitution would allow a
business angel to specialize in evaluating whether or not the entrepreneur understands the deal, and whether or not the entrepreneur can be relied upon as a
venture manager, even if they as investors do not have enough market information to understand it completely. That is, business angels can specialize in evaluating agency risk, while relying upon the entrepreneur to manage market risk.
Thus:

Hypothesis 2: Business angels view agency risks as more important than market
risk.
Based on the previous arguments it is likely that business angels and venture
capital investors have their own views of which risk is more important to
them. Their differing access to information about risk leads to the last two
hypotheses.

Hypothesis 3: Market risk is viewed as more important by venture capital firm
investors than business angels.
Hypothesis 4: Agency risk is viewed as more important by business angels than
by venture capital firm investors.

METHODS

Testing these hypotheses involved: (1) specifying the research design, (2) data collection, (3) developing the survey instrument, and (4) data analysis.

Research Design
The research design was a cross-sectional sampling of two separate and distinct
populations of venture capitalists: venture capital firms and business angels. Data
were collected using mailed surveys, personal solicitations to investor groups,
anonymous third-party referrals, and anonymous mailings to participants in
investor networks. Data were analysed using the following applications of BentlerWeeks covariance structure modelling: confirmatory factor analysis, a null model
to check for multicollinearity, and discriminant analysis. Combining these separate
applications in one Bentler-Weeks covariance structure model facilitated the
determination of measurement error and provided tests of statistical significance
for each hypothesis. Finally, a subset of both venture capital firm investors and
business angels was interviewed in face-to-face interviews to confirm the interpretation of the statistical results and to avoid common method variance.

Data Collection[l]
There are approximately 700 venture capital firms in the United States (Bygrave
and Timmons, 1992, p. 52). These are professionally managed organizations
usually investing other people's money. A deliberate attempt was made to include
both firms with large and small portfolios of investments. Representatives of firms
with larger portfolios were selected from a census of the 216 members of the
National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). Representatives of firms with
smaller portfolios were selected from a census of the 29 members of the Houston
Venture Capital Association (HVCA). No attempt was made to completely
separate these two sub-populations, however, because four HVCA firms were
also NVCA firms and a few had portfolios that were as large as medium sized
NVCA firms.
After four rounds of mailed surveys, 141 usable responses were obtained from
a total of 245 subjects, for a response rate of 57 per cent. The four rounds of
surveys were mailed according to Dillman's (1978) recommendations. The first
round consisted of a letter and a survey instrument. The second round consisted
of a postcard reminder that was sent one week later. The third round included a
replacement survey, along with a letter, all of which was mailed only to nonrespondents three weeks after the postcard. The fourth round was a certified
letter that was mailed four weeks later to all remaining non-respondents. This last
mailing included a final plea to respond along with another replacement survey.
Refer to Table I for a more detailed analysis of how usable data were obtained
from venture capital firm investors.
Gaston (1989) estimated that there are as many as 490,000 US business
angels. They are an elusive group to study because they have a preference for
anonymity. Furthermore, sometimes they are in the market for deals and at other
times they are inactive. There are no comprehensive lists of business angels.
They have been studied in the past using survey and referral techniques. The
average response rate from these studies has been less than 5 per cent. All

previous efforts to collect representative data on business angels have been inconclusive because it is mathematically impossible to demonstrate that a sample is
representative without being able to identify the population from which it comes.
Because the population of business angels is unknown, and probably unknowable,
the conclusions of all previous studies, as well as those of the present study, must
be limited in their generalizability to the sample that they represent.
To be counted as a business angel, a respondent had to have acted as an individual, normally investing his or her own money, not a firm's, and had to have
been active during the last three years. Earlier researchers used a cutoff that
varied between three years (Haar et al., 1988) and five years (Sullivan, 1990).
Because respondents were being asked to report how they evaluated risk, and
because they would probably find it useful to remember how it had affected
them in previous decisions, the more restrictive criteria was selected. An individual who had invested his own money, but had done it through a firm, was
viewed as a quasi-angel. Eighteen per cent of otherwise qualified respondents
were eliminated because they were quasi-angels and their responses could
obscure the discriminant validity of the statistical tests.
Dillman's (1978) procedure for mailing surveys was modified by omitting the
final certified letter. The marginal benefit of sending it to an unknown population appeared to be less than contacting new, potential investors. (It was more
than twice as expensive to send the final certified mailing as it was to send the

first three rounds.) Also, for venture capital firms, it only increased the overall
response rate by approximately 7 per cent.
Data from business angels were collected through a variety of contacts.
Surveys were mailed to 207 potential business angels, based on the recommendation of the Director for Economic Development for the City of Longview, Texas.
He suspected that the subjects were investors because they had previously indicated to him an interest in supporting any new businesses that could be attracted
to the community. After three rounds of surveys, 74 completed surveys were
received, 55 of which were disqualified for not having made an investment
during the last three years. In total, these efforts resulted in a usable response
rate of 9 per cent.
Five hundred contributors to the Greater Houston Opera were mailed three
rounds of surveys. They were selected solely based on a hunch that they might
occasionally be business angels. Of these, 193 surveys were completed and
returned. After eliminating non-qualifying respondents, 61 remained, resulting in
a usable response rate of 12 per cent.
In addition to mailed surveys, three other methods were utilized to collect
data. First, there are two known Texas networks of business angels whose
purpose is to anonymously review deals. Approximately 80 surveys were mailed
through their network offices. Second, the investigator made presentations to,
and distributed, surveys to potential business angels at venture capital forums in
Houston, Waco and Dallas, Texas. Third, some business angels became enthusiastic supporters and volunteered to personally deliver surveys, or to mail them
at their own expense. The results of these last three methods, together with the
previous efforts to contact business angels, are summarized in Table 1.

Development r!f the Suroey Instrument
There were three constructs to be measured: investor type, market risk, and
agency risk. The investor type construct was dichotomously coded so that it
could be used to categorize business angels and venture capital firms. If a
respondent was a venture capital firm investor, he or she was coded as a one. If
it was a business angel, he or she was coded as a zero.
The market risk and agency risk constructs were measured indirectly. A
preliminary survey instrument was constructed using the previously discussed
indicators that were found in the literature. Informal feedback on the survey
instrument was obtained from 22 academic colleagues representing such institutions as Aarhus University, Denmark, Babson College, Harvard University, Texas
A&M University, the University of Tennessee, and the University of Texas,
Austin. Next, these indicators were pre-tested in 38 face-to-face interviews with
venture capital firm investors, business angels, academic scholars, and public
policy makers. This pre-testing was conducted in accordance with Dillman's
(1978, pp. 155-9) recommendations. The purpose of these pre-test interviews was
to ensure that the questions were tapping on to the intended constructs and that
the questions were correctly interpreted.
As the respondents filled out the survey instrument, they were watched for
signs that they did not understand a question. Contemporaneous probing of
respondents concerning any apparently misunderstood questions resulted in the
redesign of a few questions, the elimination of a few others, and the substitution

of completely new questions in a few instances. For example, with regard to
market risk, the wording of several questions was altered by pre-testers and one
item, 'Few buyers' was added by pre-testers as an additional indicator of market
risk. With regard to agency risk, only one of the seven original indicators
survived unchanged after pre-testing. In most cases, changes to agency risk indicators were clarifications of wording. In other cases, they involved eliminating an
indicator, such as 'game playing' and replacing it with 'contractual ambiguities'.
Appendices I and II describe the changes that were made in the indicators as a
result of pre-testing. It is important to note that these indicators are substantially
different from those that were derived from the original literature review.
However, no changes were made unless they were initiated by the pre-testers,
support could be found for them in the literature, and they were approved by
the 22 academic colleagues who had previously provided feedback. Appendices
III and IV contain the actual questions that were used to collect data on market
risk and agency risk.
A more parsimonious set of construct indicators was identified through use of
a factor analytic application of covariance structure modelling. Thus, some of the
questions in Appendices III and IV were not used in the final analysis as construct indicators. The results of these data reduction procedures are also found in
Appendices I and II. The factor models for market risk and agency risk are contained in Appendices V and VI.

Data Analysis
Table II contains a correlation matrix of the final indicator variables for the
market risk and agency risk constructs. These variables were multiplied by their
standard deviations to generate a covariance matrix that was later decomposed to
model the relationships among the constructs.

Figure I. Model of venture capital risk avoidance

The purpose of the model in Figure I was to develop statistically significant
tests of the hypotheses and to evaluate the impact of measurement error on the
results. The 'E's represent errors in measurement for a particular indicator
variable. The 'D's are disturbance terms and represent errors in measurement for
the endogenous constructs. Because investor type is dichotomously coded (as a
zero when it represents business angels and as a one when it represents venture
capital firms), it is assumed to be unaffected by measurement error, and thus

does not have an 'E l' acting upon it. The curved, double-headed arrow between
the 'D's represents the partial correlation between market risk and agency risk
and is a measure of the possible extent to which investors do not specialize in
either market or agency risk.
There are four ways to verify that the measurement of the constructs is statistically significant. First, the value for the chi-square statistic for the overall model
had to exceed the standard cutoff value of 0.05. The other three fit indicators
are the Bentler-Bonett Normed Fit Index, the Bentler-Bonett Non-Normed Fit
Index, and the Comparative Fit Index. For a model to fit the data, each of the
last three indicators had to be greater than 0.95. As indicated in Appendices VI
and VII, these criteria were satisfied for both the market and agency risk constructs.
Before the model in Figure 1 could be tested it had to be assessed for multicollinearity among the construct indicators, which was done using a null modelling procedure. All of the construct indicators in the model were freed to
covary. Table III contains the results of the null model test. If there were multicollinearity, the null model would not fit the data, which is what occurred in the
initial stages of the analysis. To correct the lack of fit, it was assumed that the
net effect of all the unknown influences on the hypothesized relationships (or in
the case of the null model, the relationships among the construct indicators)
could be isolated and reduced by correlating the errors in measurement of the
indicator variables, or 'E's. (Refer to an extensive discussion of this fitting
technique in Bollen, 1989.) Identifying the errors to be correlated was accomTable III. Null model of venture capital risk avoidance

plished through the systematic use of the Lagranian multiplier test (Bentler,
1989; Bollen, 1989; Fiet, 1995). Thus, to fit the null model to the data, the
errors were correlated. Their correlation produced the model in Table III. The
correlated error terms are available from the author.

RESULTS

After fitting the null model, the hypothesized relationships indicated in Figure 1
were added to the null model. The results are contained in Table IV. It also
contains the disturbance terms, D2 and D3, for the two endogenous constructs.
The reliabilities of the construct indicators are available from the author.

Statistical Analysis
Hypothesis 1 was tested by examining the relationship between Fl (investor type)
and F2 (market risk) in Figure 1. Given that venture capital firms were coded as
one, to reject the null hypothesis that the mean difference scores for investor type
and market risk are equal, the sign of the coefficient indicating the direction of
the relationship had to be positive and the p value had to be less than 0.05. The
following is the structural equation for market risk:
market risk = F2 = (0.127)(F2) + 0.992(D2)

(1)

Both conditions held. The standardized difference in the means between investor
type, coded as 1, and market risk was 0.127 and the p value for that coefficient
was 0.0359. Thus, at a significance level of 0.05, the alternative hypothesis was
accepted. Venture capital firms are likely to view market risk as more important
than agency risk.
Hypothesis 2 was tested by examining the relationship between F 1 (investor
type) and F3 (agency risk) in Figure 1. Given that business angels were coded as
zero, to reject the null hypothesis that the means are equal, the sign of the coefficient indicating the direction of the relationship had to be negative and statistically significant (p < 0.05). The following is the structural equation for agency
risk:
agency risk

= F3 = (-O.l67)(Fl) + 0.986(D)

Again, both conditions held. The standardized difference in the means between
investor type, coded as zero, and agency risk was -0.167 and the p value for that
coefficient was 0.0077. Thus, the null hypothesis that the means were equal was
rejected. The business angels in the sample are more likely to view agency risk as
more important than market risk.
Hypothesis 3 was tested by comparing equations (1) and (2). Given that
venture capital firms were coded as one, to reject the null hypothesis that venture
capital firm investors viewed agency risk as being of equal importance or more
important than market risk, the mean difference score between investor type and
market risk had to be positive and significant while the mean difference score
between investor type had to be negative and significant. All of these conditions
held. Thus at a p value less than 0.05, market risk is viewed as more important
by venture capital firm investors than business angels.
Hypothesis 4 is the obverse of hypothesis 3. Thus, agency risk is viewed as
more important by business angels than by venture capital firm investors
(p < 0.05).
As indicated by the existence of measurement error, the model is not completely reliable. It is also apparent by the correlation between D3 and D2 that
some venture capitalists view both market risk and agency risk as being important. Despite the unknown effects of measurement error upon the modelled
relationships, which may result from misspecification, the relationships that were
tested in the four hypotheses could only have occurred by chance at a p value
less than 0.05.

The Follow-up Interviews
This research buttressed its statistical findings with ex post, face-to-face interviews
with both types of investors - 21 with venture capital firms and 23 with business
angels. The purpose of these interviews was to review the subject's responses to
items on the survey to determine the reasoning behind each response. These
interviews were supportive of the statistical findings and provided a richer understanding of their comparative risk assessment processes.

Venture capitalfinns. The following comments by venture capital firms were supportive of their concern for evaluating market risk. One said: 'We hire industry specialists to assess market risk.' Another said: '... to control losses due to market
risk, we consult with customers of the business, people who have worked with the
firm's management, and industry, market and technical experts.' A third venture
capital firm investor summarized the practices of his firm with this comment:
'Venture capital firms manage risk by trying to identify potential issues and
risks prior to the investment and doing sufficient due diligence to be comfortable that the risk is controllable. Our risk is controlled by a broad set of management procedures and in the end can only be minimized but can never be
removed.'
A statement that could have been made by many venture capital firm investors
was the following: 'My ability to control market risk is because I understand [my]
market.'

<-----Page 15----->566

JAMES O. FIET

The following comment provided collateral evidence that venture capital firms
consider agency risk to be a less important factor than market risk: 'We always
bet on Joe, not the market. However, markets are most important - more important than
people. Agent)' risk is difficult to distinguish from competent)'.'
Several comments suggested that venture capital firms could control agency
risk more effectively ex post than ex ante. One affirmed, '... thirry to fifty per cent of
managers are replaced, usuallY during the last part of three years [which provides some
evidence that agency issues are temporary provided they are anticipated in the
contract]. There is an inclination to make management changes early.' Another
counselled, 'Don't worry about the equity split. Sooner or later it will be Friday
afternoon and more money will be needed for payroll. It is easy to renegotiate
with the entrepreneur on Friday afternoon.'

Business angels. The following comments by business angels were supportive of
their concern for evaluating agency risk. One said: 'Agency risk is much higher
than market risk. There are a hell of a lot of unethical people out there - I
would not have been so trusting . . . You want to do business with people who you can
shake hands with and ~'ll just go out and do what thry say.'
Being more concerned for agency risk than market risk was a common theme
among business angels. One said: 'Agency risk is more serious than market threats. Ifyou
have "good people", you can go into a highlY competitive market.' Another said: 'I can not
stress enough how important it is to "feel" comfortable about an investment and
particularly the entrepreneur. I've learned to listen carefully to my intuition when
it appears to be in conflict with the intellectual, particularly when evaluating
people in a proposed deal.'

DISCUSSION

This research compared risk avoidance strategies employed by business angels
and venture capital firm investors. It found that differences in their strategies for
evaluating risk lead them to hold predictably different views of the dangers of
market and agency risk. Venture capital firm investors attach more importance
to market risk than agency risk. They are less concerned with agency risk
because they have learned how to protect themselves from it using stringent boilerplate contractual provisions. Boilerplate allows them to perfunctorily replace an
entrepreneur who under-performs, is guilty of malfeasance or who is found to be
incompetent. They are able to economize on the cost of writing complex, contingent-claims contracts by using boilerplate. This boilerplate strategy effectively
protects venture capital investors from market risk because they attach more
importance to it in their screening process.
In the present study, there was statistically significant evidence that the following four types of market risk information were viewed by venture capital firm
investors as being more important than agency risk information: (1) current competitors, (2) potential new competitors, (3) products or services that were ready
substitutes, and (4) customer demand. They can be very selective in choosing
which entrepreneurs they will fund because their information channels provide
them with as many as a thousand deals a year to evaluate.

RISK AVOIDANCE STRATEGIES

In contrast, business angels utilize a different strategy to avoid risk. They
report that they are frustrated because they do not have access to a comparable
number of deals, in many cases, only a handful of them a year. One consequence of a limited access to deals could be that business angels possess insufficient comparative data to evaluate market risk. Recognizing this lack of
information about market risk, this research found that they attach more importance to agency risk because they believe that if they can find the right entrepreneur, they can rely upon him or her to limit their losses due to adverse market
conditions. Thus, the business angel strategy for avoiding risk is to substitute
reliance upon a competent and trustworthy entrepreneur for their own competence in limiting losses due to market risk. Compared with venture capital firm
investors, business angels place much more importance upon screening entrepreneurs than deals for market risk.
The present study found that there was statistically significant evidence that
the following five types of agency risk information were viewed by business angels
as being more important than market risk information: (1) differences in cash
flow objectives, (2) differences in profitability objectives, (3) evidence of manipulation of profitability, (4) evidence of short-term self-interest seeking, and (5)
evidence of contractual ambiguity.
This research also noted that differences in the importance that each of these
venture capitalists attach to risk can exist because risk-reducing information is
characteristically specific information. They tend to selectively acquire information about different types of risk because no one can evaluate all of it. Specializing in the acquisition of one type of risk-reducing information minimizes its cost
through the development of economies of scale. Thus, it was not surprising that
one finding was that not only do venture capital firms specialize more in market
risk than agency risk, but they did so more than business angels. While business
angels were found to specialize more in agency risk than market risk and did so
more than venture capital firm investors.
Another finding of this research is that venture capitalists manifest broad
avoidance strategies for particular types of risk, strategies that could not have
been detected using previously utilized research methodologies. Because these
patterns do not seem to be directly related to what they do, previous efforts to
document the steps in the venture capital decision process never would have
been able to uncover them. Moreover, instead of utilizing covariance structure
modelling, most venture capital and entrepreneurship researchers have relied
upon regression/correlation techniques that depend upon variables being
measurable Uacobson, 1992). However, to measure a variable, it must first be
observable, which is not true of either market risk or agency risk. This bias is
unfortunate because the identification of these strategies is the first step in the
development of a theory of venture capital market segmentation.
To reinforce what has been suggested here, we must know much more about
possible substitution strategies that could be employed by venture capitalists to
compensate for their own deficiencies. If we do not examine the possibilities for
and effects of resource substitution, we are likely to have an incomplete understanding of the factors that drive market segmentation.
This research has some practical implications for entrepreneurs searching for
financial backing. If they knew, for example, that venture capital markets were

segmented based on investor strategies for avoiding particular types of risk, they
could use this information to match their own deal's risk profile with the most
promising providers of capital. An entrepreneur who could convince an investor
of his or her competence, intentions, and integrity would probably be able to use
this advantage more effectively among business angels than among venture
capital firms. An entrepreneur with a technical or market advantage would
probably find a more receptive investor audience among venture capital firms.

Survey Qyestions for Market Risk
When they invest, venture capitalists (both individual investors and firms) nearly always
run the risk of losing some of their principal. The risks that venture capitalists face seem
to fall into two categories: (1) market risks and (2) agency risks. MARKET RISKS are
due to unforseen competitive conditions. AGENCY RISKS are caused by the separate
and possibly divergent interests of investors and entrepreneurs. Agency risks may result
from entrepreneurs acting in bad faith, holding conflicting objectives, and the like. One
of the purposes of this study is to get your views about these two types of risk. The questions on this page relate to MARKET RISKS. For each question, how do you view the
