ABSTRACT
The working paper documents early analysis on a five year time series of UK informal investors
investment activity. The importance of entrepreneurial experience as a predictor or informal
investment activity is supported. Job related start-up entrepreneurs are particularly likely to be
investors in other young enterprises. Women are significantly less likely to invest than men.
However, when controlling for experience and other human capital effects, the role of gender
falls to around one percent. Spatial and educational variables appear less robust when employing
a dynamic, multivariate framework.

INTRODUCTION
The importance of Informal Investors/Business Angels as a source of risk capital to early-growth
enterprises continues to gain increased policy recognition. Several governments now widely
support this informal sector (European Commission, 2005) with public funded initiatives aimed at
both increasing the supply of early stage investors (e.g. via tax incentives for both investors’
income and capital), the attractiveness of potential investee firms, and reducing information
asymmetries in the operation of this informal capital market (e.g. via Business Angel Networks).
In this paper, we use the term ‘informal investor’ to include all forms of non-institutionalised
private investment including business angel activity. Informal investors may thus be defined as
“private individuals who provide equity and other forms of non-collateral finance directly to new
and growing businesses with which they have no family connections” (Mason and Harrison,
1996). Their value to small and growing enterprises centers on their ability and willingness
(Freear, Sohl and Wetzel, 1995) to invest relatively small sums of money at the earliest and most
speculative stages of new firm formation and growth. This is a focus where established capital
markets are likely to be less relevant or available for the entrepreneur seeking external funding
(Linde and Prasad, 2000; HM Treasury and Small Business Service, 2003). Very often informal
investor’s involvement is the first commitment of external money following the often more
subjectively allocated capital of ‘family and friends’ (Prowse, 1998).
Despite the growing international popularity of this overall policy stance (Maula, Murray and
Jääskeläinen, 2007), there has been a dearth of serious academic scrutiny of the underlying logic
of the promotion of informal investors. Lerner (1998) is a notable exception in questioning
government practice of involving essentially amateur rather than professional investors at this
most challenging end of the capital market. Our knowledge of the characteristics and behavior of
these key economic agents remains incomplete and unsatisfactory. Theory is similarly
underdeveloped beyond descriptive statistics and related taxonomies (Freear, Sohl and Wetzel,

1

<-----Page 1----->2002; Mason, 2006). Above all it is the lack of accurate, public information on their collective
numbers and activities that has frustrated research. An unknowable population of ‘invisible’
investors creates problems of survey design, sample representativeness and challenges our ability
to make robust statistical estimations.
Mason (2006) observes that we are now entering a ‘second generation’ of studies that go beyond
descriptive studies to apply more focused and analytical methodologies to the phenomenon. He
stresses the major need to apply our analyses dynamically employing time series of observations.
By such means we can address the criticism that cross-sectional studies of business angels or
informal investors are little more than ‘snap shots’ of activity at arbitrary moments in time.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Informal investors play a key role in the external financing of emergent businesses. Mason and
Harrison (2001) identify three specific areas in which their activities are critical. Firstly, informal
investors fill an important gap in the ‘firm size-age finance continuum’ (Berger and Udell, 1998).
The introduction of external sources of informal investment allows young businesses a greater
chance to develop to the stage and scale where they can attract and meet the rigorous commercial
criteria of professional investors including formal venture capitalists (Murray, 1999; Harding
1999, 2000a). Secondly, there is an accumulation of evidence that the scale of informal
investment activity is substantially larger than formal venture capital. Bygrave (2001), for
example, using survey evidence from 29 countries, estimates that the ratio of informal to formal
investments is of the order of 2:1. Recent US evidence (Sohl, 2006) suggests that in aggregate the
importance of formal VC activity is dwarfed by the informal investor commitments to early stage
ventures. Thirdly, informal investors, like their formal VC counterparts, can also make a
substantial contribution to the human capital stock available to the portfolio business. This
package has succinctly been termed “capital and consulting” by Warne (1988). The cognition of
risk capital investors, like entrepreneurs, is strongly influenced by their prior professional
experience (Dimov 2004). Social capital, (Aldrich et al, 1987; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998;) and
knowledge-based assets (Kogut and Zander, 1993; Grant, 1996; DeCarolis and Deeds, 1999) each
contribute to the assistance that portfolio companies can receive from their professional investors
(Maula, Autio and Murray, 2003). The quality of human capital available to new enterprises has
been identified in a number of SME ‘survival’ studies as the key contributory factor in
determining longevity (Taylor, 1999; Cowling and Hayward, 2000; Bosma et al, 2002; Cressy,
2006;), and similarly in SME ‘growth’ studies (Westhead and Cowling, 1995; Cowling, 2002a;
2002b). These positive effects occur as early stage, venture capital investors typically pursue a
“hands on” modus operandi with the inexperienced and often untested new management teams of
their portfolio companies.
By adding their skills and expertise, including network contacts to other key strategic players both
venture capitalists and informal investors give investee businesses access to strategically valuable
knowledge. The visibility of these network links to successful investors is a ‘signaling effect’
(Stigler, 1961; Megginson and Weiss. 1991; Fiet, 1995; Prasad et al, 2002) which confers on the
young firm a market credibility they would not otherwise possess at their stage of development
(Harrison and Mason, 1992; Mason and Harrison, 1996; Lumme, Mason and Suomi, 1998). Thus,
the true economic contribution of informal investors to their portfolio companies is the sum of
their financial investment, their addition to the stock of operational knowledge (human capital)

Each of these separate forms of resource is valuable to ambitious young businesses seeking to
grow rapidly.

HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT
Human Capital
The literature has stressed the importance of diverse human capital endowments of the investor in
determining the future success of the ventures selected for financing. Given that the investor also
gives advice and counsel in addition to finance, the quality of the investor has a direct and
continuing influence on the firm well beyond the time of the initial decision to invest. We would
expect that a range of both formally and informally acquired skills and experience will be
positively associated with increased informal investment activity.
H1a: The propensity to make informal investments will increase with an individual’s
level of formal human capital (i.e. education)
H1b: The propensity to make informal investments will increase with an individual’s
level of informal human capital (i.e. age, experience)
H1c: The propensity to make informal investments will increase with an individual’s
level of entrepreneurial human capital (i.e. direct experience with the process of startingup a new business)
Gender Effects
If human capital provides an important explanation of the incidence of informal investment
activity, then we might expect that its heterogeneous distribution within the adult population will
also have an influence on who is, or is not, prepared to act as an informal investor. If having
relevant management experience and/or direct entrepreneurial involvement are important preconditions for the propensity to invest, we would expect that a gender effect will be present.
Adult males are likely to have a higher propensity to make informal investments than adult
females. De facto, females are less likely to be entrepreneurially active then males. Minniti et al
(2005, 2006, 2007) suggest that the entrepreneurial knowledge stock is lower initially. Equally,
as Harding (2006) argues, there is qualitative evidence to support the contention that women
leave paid employment earlier, at a more junior level and with smaller compensation packages
making them less likely to have the requisite capital to invest." (Harding, 2006).).
H2: Adult males have a higher propensity to make informal investments than adult
females
Regional Effects
There is not likely to be an equal distribution of the stock of relevant forms of human capital
across a nation. The clustering of economic activity into more advantaged regions with better
developed institutional frameworks as well as countervailing public sector interventions at the

3

<-----Page 3----->regional level will influence both the distribution of existing stocks and the creation of new stocks
of relevant investor skills and experience (Porter, 1998). These disparities will also affect the
demand for finance from entrepreneurial businesses. Thus, we are likely to see these factors
generating in aggregate a strong spatial influence on informal investment activity even after
correcting for population densities (Martin, Sunley and Turner, 2002).
H3: The propensity to make informal investments will differ between regions given
spatial differences in economic activity
The three sets of hypotheses were formally tested using the combined results from analysis of the
GEM UK datasets 2001 to 2005.

METHODOLOGY
As noted, reliable identification of the population of informal investors remains problematic. A
reliance on the convenience sampling techniques remains a second best outcome. The descriptive,
univariate metrics generated from these data in order to come to broad and tentative conclusions
on the characteristics of the underlying population of these investors has to be presented with
significant caveats. Given the present importance being accorded to the encouragement and
promotion of business angel financing by government policy makers in several countries, the
need for more sophisticated and quantitatively credible estimation techniques is now indisputable.
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor with its growing time series data across some 40+ nations
gives us one opportunity to track informal investment activity (Reynolds et al, 2003). The present
study uses UK data from five annual surveys covering the period 2001 to 2005. We seek to
ascertain trends in informal investor activity. We are also interested in the dichotomy of activities
between informal, but informed and professional, investors and the separate community of
investors that restrict their financing horizons to family and friends – so called ‘love money’. The
changing balance between these two groups over time allows us to track on the
professionalisation of the business angel community.
We determine the propensity of our sampled adults to be an informal investor by employing a
multivariate framework. Given that several of the descriptive variables are likely to be highly
correlated, e.g. further education, social class, employment status, the interaction of these
variables needs to be controlled in order to understand the true contribution of any one variable.
The model we adopt is a binary probit regression with the dependent variable coded ‘1’ if the
individual is an informal investor and ‘0’ otherwise. For ease of interpretation, we report the
marginal effects calculated around the means of the independent variables. These indicate the
increase (decrease) in probability of an individual in a specified category (i.e. gender, education
etc.) becoming an informal investor1. In order to contribute to the ongoing research effort to more
rigorously define informal investment activity, our paper has three main objectives. Firstly, we
seek to quantify just how many active informal investors there are in the UK adult population
(with ‘adults’ defined as men and women of sixteen years of age and upwards). Second, we
estimate the scale of the investments they make. Third, we address the question of who they are in

Rare event logistic analysis was used to test the robustness of the probit regression results presented in
Table 2. No significant differences were found in either variable coefficients or significance levels. The
results of this logistic analysis are available from the authors on request.

to draw a ‘profile’ of the contemporary informal investor in the UK.

SAMPLE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Table 1 presents the sample statistics for the UK 2001-2005 classified on the basis of the
observed characteristics (personal, socio-economic and regional) of these informal investors.
There is considerable variation across the period in terms of the proportion of the sample
identified as active informal investors, and in both the average and median investment reported.
This variance suggests that given the rarity of informal investment activity, sample estimates are
subject to considerable instability as sample size changes. The time series also shows, in year
2001 figures, the vestigial influence of the bull technology market 1997-2000. Both average and
median investment levels have declined dramatically from 2001. Encouraging median levels have
risen annually since 2003 albeit from a greatly reduce base. We also observe that males are
significantly more likely to be informal investors than females. This finding reflects a general
phenomenon. Bygrave et al (2003) citing all 29 nations participating in the 2001 GEM survey
found that only 30.1% of all informal investors were women. The mean age for informal investors
in the UK is forty-five. There were no age differences apparent for adult investors under 65.
Beyond this age, there appears a clear lessening of activity.
Educational status was a key determinant of informal investment activity. Informal investment
activity strongly increases in line with the level of formal education. Individuals with any level of
post-school education had above average propensities to be informal investors. There is a broadly
three-fold magnitude in the difference in informal investment activity across the educational
spectrum between individuals with a post-graduate level education and those with no formal
qualifications. Yet, the positive effect of continuing education remains substantial even between
the contiguous groups of graduates and post-graduates. This suggests that education, and
particularly higher education, is a key indicator of an individual’s propensity to become an
informal investor. These data in the present survey corroborates both US (Aram, 1989) and UK
(Stevenson and Coveney, 1994) evidence. The authors of these two studies found that 82% and
74%, respectively, of their US and UK samples were educated at least to undergraduate level.
Regional effects were also evident but subject to considerable variation over the time period.
What the spatial distribution of informal investors does show year or year is the dominance of the
metropolitan influence of London.
The key finding from Table 1 is that individuals already directly involved in entrepreneurial
activity are significantly more likely to be making informal investments in other businesses. In
short, entrepreneurs are the most likely members of the population to both understand what
starting a new business entails and to be prepared to invest money in other entrepreneurs’ new
businesses. We employ three different measures of entrepreneurial activity: i) an individual
involved in a new business start-up; ii) an individual involved in a job related start-up; and iii) an
individual who is an owner-manager. All three categories are substantially above the sample
average with entrepreneurs in job related start-ups having a higher predilection to act as informal
investors than any other group in our survey. Their level of activity is nearly eight times greater
than the average propensity of the adult population in 2005. The link between existing
entrepreneurship experience and investment propensity strongly supports the evidence from

5

<-----Page 5----->earlier studies that informal investors contribute considerable human capital as well as risk
finance.
The spectrum of funding offered by informal investors reflects the diversity of both the supply
and demand for early stage funding. Over 50% of the sample invested total sums well under
£50,000 ($70,000 - $90,000) which can only be seen as seed scale or pre-commercial investment.
However, the other half of the sample was investing sums which are of a material size to many
new or young firms. While none of this funding is of a scale that would commonly secure the
longer term financial security of a young high growth firm, these sums represent a significant
contribution to the total resources of the nascent firm. For example, 4% of total investments by
individuals in our sample exceeded a level of £1 million ($1.4 - $2m). Overall, a majority of
informal investors provide levels of modest funding that professional investors are unlikely ever
to consider supplying (Murray, 1999, Harding and Cowling, 2006). Further, the provision of these
funds may also allow the entrepreneur to leverage further sources of more traditional finance, e.g.
bank debt.
The sample statistics indicate that the ‘typical’ informal investor in the UK is a male in his midforties, in full-time employment and, critically, already involved and experienced in
entrepreneurial type activity. He is also very likely to come from a relatively high social class and
be well educated. The median level of investment he will make is between £5,000 and £35,000
over a three year period.

QUANTITATIVE RESULTS
From the probit estimates for informal investment propensity (Table 2), we observe a number of
significant findings that challenge the initial conclusions inferred from the descriptive statistics.
For example, adult males were only marginally more likely (approximately 1%) to be informal
investors than females, when an array of other personal, social, labor market and regional
characteristics are held constant. This is far less than the two-fold differences reported in the raw
sample statistics. What this tells us is that it is other characteristics of men, not gender per se, that
are driving a significant proportion of this observed male/female disparity in the propensity to
make informal investments in the UK. This is an important finding given that women are
frequently perceived as being less likely to engage in entrepreneurial or related investment
activities (Brush, 1992, Ibarra, 1993, Cowling and Taylor, 2001). Our findings would suggest that
further work on female involvement in informal investment activity within the UK is required.
The age – informal investment relationship is problematic and again may reflects the challenges
of widely different sample sizes over time. No clear pattern can be deduced with both positive
and negative coefficients as well as varying statistical significance. We would expect that
increases in wealth and human capital would be linearly associated with age across the adult
working years. Further work including the exploration of non-linearities over time is desirable.
Similarly, educational effects are also evident but ambiguous. The increasing influence of further
education on investment activity is recorded in 2001 but the association dissipates over time.
None the less, basic and higher education (but not graduate qualifications) are both still
significantly associated with informal investment activity in 2005. The general pattern of
informal investment activity being positively associated with greater education is still in evidence

6

<-----Page 6----->but the relationship is far less strong than descriptive statistics would suggest. Given the scale and
range of complexities involved in the investment decision, the analytical skills stemming from a
higher level of formal education would reasonably appear to be an asset for any potential
investor.
In terms of the geography of informal investment activity, we also observe differences across
regions. The findings broadly confirm the univariate statistics from Table 1 in that the populations
of the North East and East Midlands both have significantly lower propensities to become
informal investors. The magnitude of these effects is -1.4% in both cases. All other regions are
not significantly different from each other. This suggests that the observed differences in the
proportion of informal investors in the adult population across regions is, for the most part, a
result of differences in the characteristics of the population rather than region-specific factors
such as culture, investment flows or institutional infrastructures. Holding these personal, social,
economic and labor market characteristics constant across regions would result in a fairly
equitable spread of informal investment activity across the UK, with the two previously identified
regions being the exceptions
Finally, we observe, once again, that being involved in all three forms entrepreneurial activity
significantly increases an individual’s propensity to make informal investments in other
businesses. This result is robust and stable. Beyond 2001, entrepreneurs in job related start-ups
are the most active investors with a marginal effect of +3.1% in 2005 compared to individuals not
involved in any entrepreneurial activity. The dominance of this entrepreneurial group is also seen
in 2003.
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION
We set out to quantify how many informal investors there are in the British adult population using
a new, and large-scale, data set. This estimation is important as informal investors play a vital role
in funding early stage businesses, as well as providing valuable experience and advice. We find
that between 1.2% and 2.43% of the total adult population of the UK has recently provided
informal investment to businesses, albeit the average figure has continued to decline since the
severe market correction in 2000-2001. The median figure shows a more encouraging positive
trend since 2003. We can therefore deduce that the actual number of active informal investors in
the UK ranges between 0.5m and 1.1 m. The assumption that informal investing is a widespread
source of financing to privately held businesses is corroborated. None the less, the variance in
activity over time illustrates the need for more sophisticated modeling incorporating variable
reflecting the dynamics of the wider economy.
From univariate, descriptive statistics, the ‘typical’ informal investor in the UK is most likely to
be male, in full-time employment and, importantly, already engaged in some form of
entrepreneurial activity. He will also be well educated, be in a high social class and aged in his
mid-forties. The median level of investment he will be making is between £5,000 and £35,000
($50,000) over a three year period although this has fallen since 2001, likely reflecting the postbubble market conditions. Yet, a significant proportion of this investor subgroup within the
overall population (16.7%) is also making very substantial investments with a median value of
£500,000 ($825,000). This scale of investment suggests that at least a proportion of informal
investment activity is likely to be bridging the gap between more traditional, debt-based financial
sources, and formal venture capital.

<-----Page 7----->Scaling up the sample findings would indicate that the total informal investment flow to new
businesses from the UK adult populace is in the region of £2.6bn to £12.8 bn per annum. The
contribution of classic venture capital (i.e. start-up and other early-stage finance) from UK
professional venture capitalists and invested in the UK in 2005 which was £382 million (BVCA,
2006). However, the scale of the disparity in the investment activity between formal and informal
venture capital can be over-estimated. Bygrave et al (2003) show that only some 12.6% of
informal investment is allocated to recipients who are not either a member of the informal
investors family, friends nor work associates, and our data confirm that around 20% of activity is
in this category. Thus, using this latter ratio, meritocratic funds, i.e. allocated optimally without
reference to family or friendship factors, provided by informal investors is of the order of £520
million to £2,560 million. By any criterion, informal investment is a source of investment activity
that eclipses formal VC finance.
This study provides important new findings based on the statistical robustness of a population
wide UK sample. The results confirm both the relatively high level of underlying informal
investment activity which, although influenced in part by socio-economic status and education, is
widely distributed throughout most regions. The scale of activity, its ubiquity and the relatively
small median investment values confirm that informal investment activity is of particular
importance for the support of new and/or small enterprises. Informal investors do help address the
critical area of the ‘equity gap’ (Macmillan, 1931) by providing sums of both debt and equity
finance that would be of little interest to professional investors including most venture capital
firms. However, given that equity gap issues also embrace demands for finance that are measured
from hundreds of thousands to millions of pounds sterling, individual investments by the majority
of informal investors as individual are unlikely to meet fully the financial demands of strongly
growth oriented businesses (Bank of England, 2001). Informal investment activity of any scale
would frequently demand informal investor syndicate activity (Mason, 2006). None the less,
informal investors are rightly of interest to policy makers concerned with the provision of finance
to the wider SME sector.
The UK GEM surveys are less able to answer authoritatively questions as to who received these
informal funds. There is some indication that family and friends are the major recipients of these
transfers (Harding, 2007). Farrell et al (2003) examining Canadian data categorize informal
investors into three categories, namely, those that invest purely in family members only; at ‘arms
length’ only; and in ‘combination’ (i.e. investing in both the previous groupings). These authors
also showed that over successive rounds of finance, the importance of family-only investments
decreased to zero by the third round of financing. This direction of investment flows has major
implications for government actions. Firstly, it cannot be assumed that financial support for
family or close friends can be exclusively analyzed as rational investments. Secondly, the
government’s support for the creation of business angel networks assumes that information
asymmetries are a major barrier in this market. However, if the provider and user of informal
investments are already well known to each other, or even related, such an information barrier is
unlikely to be material. Few persons would need an introduction service in order to invest in their
own family or friends. Thirdly, and most importantly, the exchanges dictated by kinship or
friendship cannot plausibly be viewed as a market. If the provision of finance is largely
conditional on blood or friendship ties, the market model with its underpinnings of rationality and
optimization is inappropriate. Confirming Wetzel’s (1987) comments, the conceptualization of
informal investors’ activities as a market remains problematic when compared to the more
instrumental and disciplined behavior of formal venture capital firms. These concerns re-inforce

8

<-----Page 8----->the need for a more robust, working taxonomy. Sørheim and Landström (2001) sought to classify
informal investors by both activity and competence. But the challenge to define and categorize
the spectrum of informal investors into communities of more utility by virtue of their internal
consistency and inter-group disparities remains. Nonetheless, given their economic and policy
importance it is a gauntlet worth picking up.
