<-----Page 1----->Venture Capital Investment: Initiating and Revising the Deal
Firm valuation studies suggest that entrepreneurs’ characteristics represent the primary factors
that affect valuation and consequently venture capitalists’ (VCs) expected returns and desire to
invest. In this article, we strive to understand in more detail how a VC puts forward an investment
offer based on some of these characteristics and, if the entrepreneur rejects that offer, what are the
conditions under which the VC should choose to make a revised offer. We approach this
investment deal phenomenon with a principal-agent model where both parties attempt to
maximize their expected returns based on their efforts allocated to the new venture and their
ownership share, as well as factors such as investment amount and rate of return. The principalagent model innovatively captures the notion of severe moral hazard by not only considering the
moral hazard originating from the entrepreneur’s behavior, but also the additional moral hazard
arising from the VC through optimizing the return from a portfolio of new ventures rather than
any one of these ventures. We show that the conditions necessary for the VC to make a revised
offer depend on the sensitivity of the service level rendered by the VC and that VC’s productivity
with respect to entrepreneurial effort. We also articulate the conditions under which both VC and
entrepreneur benefit from the payment of a base salary to the latter by the former as part of the
investment offer. Understanding the investment deal and resulting reactions is important to
scholars and practitioners because there exist significant and consistent discrepancies between
investors and entrepreneurs in terms of firm valuation and expected returns.

1. INTRODUCTION
In 2008 in the United States alone, venture capitalists (VCs) invested a total of USD 28 billion
(PWC Moneytree, 2009).1 Comparable figures are more modest in Canada and Europe, with
around USD 1.2 billion (CVCA, 2009) and USD 7.6 billion (Dow Jones VentureSource, 2009),
respectively. Yet, only a few new business ventures obtain VC funds in their early stages of
development. Between 2003 and 2007, for instance, Silicon Valley VCs invested each year less

1

We interchangeably use “VC” to denote both venture capitalist and venture capital, depending on the context.
2

<-----Page 2----->than 4% of their funds in seed ventures (PWC Moneytree, 2008). Firm valuation studies (e.g.,
Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Messica, 2008; Levie and Gimmon, 2008) suggest that entrepreneurs’
characteristics (such as reputation and effort) represent the primary factors that affect firm
valuation and consequently VCs’ expected returns and desire to invest.
We therefore attempt to understand more in detail how a VC puts forward an investment
offer based on entrepreneurial characteristics and, if the entrepreneur rejects that offer, what are
the conditions under which the VC should choose to make a revised offer. We also examine who
– entrepreneur or VC – may gain from including a base salary for the entrepreneur as part of the
investment deal. Since VCs exist because of their ability to reduce the cost of information
asymmetry between entrepreneur and investor (e.g., Amit et al., 1998), we address this
investment phenomenon with a decision framework that involves information asymmetry.2
Understanding the investment offer and resulting reactions is important because there
exist significant and consistent discrepancies between investors and entrepreneurs in terms of
firm valuation and expected performance (Mason and Harrison, 1996). Also, pricing – a firm’s
valuation per share – as well as the terms and conditions of the investment deal are key to
entrepreneurs (Valliere and Peterson, 2007). Too high a valuation from the entrepreneur may
lead to a rejection by the VC, while too low a valuation by the VC can discourage the
entrepreneur, thereby affecting the performance of the funded venture (Amit et al., 1998). A
better grasp of how VCs and entrepreneurs make their investment decisions can also improve the
chance of a successful deal and enhance cooperation between the two parties post-deal.

2

VCs’ ability to reduce the cost of information asymmetry arises pre-investment as they conduct due-diligence. It
also takes place post-investment as they actively participate in the affairs of the new venture by extending advice in
matters such as strategy, recruitment, and raising additional finance, and by closely monitoring the venture to
enhance its chances of success.
3

<-----Page 3----->In addition to suggesting that entrepreneurs’ characteristics represent the primary factors
that affect the value of a firm (e.g., Fried and Hisrich, 1994), the firm valuation literature also
argues that the assessment of the VC plays a critical role in the valuation (Metrick, 2006) and
that VCs extensively use their “gut feeling” to capture these entrepreneurial characteristics
(Messica, 2008; Levie and Gimmon, 2008). Challenges associated with firm valuation have also
led to numerous studies on: the overall VC process (e.g., Zacharakis and Meyer, 2000); moral
hazard and the existence of VCs (e.g., Amit et al., 1998; Admati and Pfleiderer, 1994); other
factors that affect firm valuation (e.g., Gorman and Sahlman, 1989; Hellmann, 2002); and the
VC’s time constraint (e.g., Shepherd et al., 2005).
Nevertheless, these studies have neglected the influence of severe double moral hazard in
the VC-entrepreneur relationship, and its impact on firm valuation and the deal process. More
specifically, existing literature has considered the moral hazard originating from the
entrepreneur’s behavior, but it has not considered the additional moral hazard arising from the
VC through optimizing the return from a portfolio of new ventures rather than any one of these
ventures (a goal articulated, for instance, in Dimov and De Clercq, 2006; Shepherd et al., 2005).
We address this gap and investigate the sensitivity of the investment offer as the VC alters his
belief on the entrepreneur’s behavior (i.e., level of effort allocated to the new business venture)
by proposing a principal-agent model in which the VC maximizes his or her return from a
portfolio of new ventures believing that the entrepreneur in question will only allocate a
minimum level of effort to the corresponding venture member of the portfolio. We use this
minimum level of effort to be allocated by the entrepreneur to more formally capture the notion
of a VC’s “gut feeling” regarding the entrepreneur’s characteristics and resulting behavior.

4

<-----Page 4----->Implications from this model are multifold. First, we derive the conditions necessary for
the VC to make a revised investment offer if rejected by the entrepreneur, and show that these
conditions depend on the manner in which the offer is revised (including offering a higher base
salary to the entrepreneur), on the VC’s ownership share, and on the change in the VC’s service
level as entrepreneurial efforts are expected to increase. For instance, we show that when the VC
believes that the entrepreneur’s effort can significantly enhance his or her productivity (i.e.,
revenue per unit of service), that VC is increasingly encouraged to close a deal and revise the
investment offer. In addition to offering a description of how the deal unfolds, our findings also
characterize the conditions under which both entrepreneur and VC benefit from the payment of a
base salary to the entrepreneur by the VC as part of the investment offer.
The remaining of this article is organized as follows. In §2 we describe the three bodies
of literature that relate to our research questions. §3 offers a narrative description of the VC deal
process, which leads in §4 to our formal principal-agent model. §5 presents conditions under
which a rejected investment deal should be revised, whereas §6 discusses the importance of
paying a base salary to the entrepreneur as part of the VC’s offer. §7 concludes by articulating
practical insights, and identifying limitations and further extensions of this work.

2. RELEVANT LITERATURE
Three bodies of literature are relevant to our research: factors affecting firm valuation; valuation
methods; and information asymmetry in new business ventures. We begin our discussion with
the first body.

5

<-----Page 5----->Fried and Hisrich (1994) and Pintado et al. (2007) argue that, although the commercial
potential of a venture (e.g., based on technology and/or marketability of the new offering) is
important, VCs consider an entrepreneur’s characteristics to be the most important factors that
affect firm valuation. Consequently, references are crucial for the entrepreneur because top
management capabilities may become primary indicators of the venture’s potential (Zutshi,
1999). Gorman and Sahlman (1989) claim that wrong doing of senior managers can drive
venture failures. Failure rates are high for newly funded ventures (e.g., Dimov and De Clercq,
2006), which encourages VCs to critically scrutinize entrepreneurial characteristics.
Other factors affecting firm valuation include the service to be rendered by the VC (i.e.,
the level of effort invested in the newly funded venture; e.g., Amit et al., 1998) and the
bargaining power of the VC (e.g., Inderst and Mueller, 2004). Since capital constraints also
affect the survivability of the venture and the entrepreneur’s earnings (van Praag, 2005), Fried
and Hisrich (1994) further argue that entrepreneurs anxious to secure capital may not even
specify any valuation in their proposal to VCs for fear of being turned-down. Even so, the
influence of capital constraints on firm valuation can favor the entrepreneur when competition
arises (likely when VC funds are abundant) because it can drive valuation up (e.g., Grossi, 2006)
and the degree of ownership sought by the VC down. Although many other factors may be
considered when a firm is valued, we focus in this article on the most important one, the
entrepreneur’s characteristics, and, as a result, the level of effort allocated by the two parties
involved in the investment deal based on their beliefs.
Regarding valuation methods used, the most popular among VCs is the so-called VC
method. As per Metrick (2006), a firm’s total valuation is the exit valuation multiplied by the
expected retention percentage and divided by the value multiple. Exit valuation is the valuation
6

<-----Page 6----->of the firm at the end of the investment contract. The expected retention percentage is the
proportion of current number of shares to number of shares at the time of exit (which increases if
new shares are issued subsequent to the initial investment by the VC). The value multiple is the
reciprocal of the product of the discount factor and the probability of successful exit. Partial
valuation is the VC’s proposed share of the total valuation. In other words, partial valuation is
the present worth of returns to the VC. If the partial valuation at least equals the investment, the
VC will invest.
The key component of the VC method for our focus is the probability of successful exit
because in our context it can be viewed, without loss of generality, as directly proportional to the
new venture’s expected revenue and, consequently, the returns to both parties. The probability of
successful exit is an assessment made by the VC and based on “gut feeling” (Messica, 2008;
Levie and Gimmon, 2008) that captures the entrepreneur’s characteristics. The probability of
successful exit is thus primarily driven by the entrepreneur’s effort. Since that level of effort is
unknown to the VC, information asymmetry emerges and, as a result, moral hazard arises (Amit
et al., 1998; 1990; Admati and Pfleiderer, 1994; Bergemann and Hege, 1998; de Bettignies and
Brander, 2007; Väänänen, 2006).
In the VC-entrepreneur relationship, double moral hazard exists, which can potentially be
severe. On the one hand, moral hazard from the entrepreneur arises because he or she not only
maximizes his or her interest but that entrepreneur may also possess private information that
renders his or her actual effort level to be less than the optimal level under full information. The
entrepreneur’s talents, commitment, and whether he or she will engage in other activities (e.g.,
take on a part-time job) are likely uncertain to the VC, yet these entrepreneurial characteristics
relate to the wellbeing of the new venture. On the other hand, moral hazard from the VC arises
7

<-----Page 7----->because the VC possesses a portfolio of investments and hence offers a level of service that
maximizes the value of that portfolio rather than his or her value from any single venture (e.g.,
Dimov and De Clercq, 2006; Shepherd et al., 2005; Kanniainen and Keuschnigg, 2003;
Jääskeläinen et al., 2006). Under time constraints, the selected level of service ends up below the
level that maximizes the VC’s value from that single venture. The probability of successful exit
is thus also affected by the VC’s service level.
Inspired by the framework of Amit et al. (1998), we propose a principal-agent model with
double moral hazard where the entrepreneur offers a level of effort that maximizes his or her
value from the newly formed venture, while the VC offers a level of service to that newly formed
venture that maximizes the value of his or her portfolio of multiple new business ventures (a first
modeling feature not captured in the principal-agent model of Amit et al. 1998). The literature on
the factors that affect firm valuation identifies entrepreneurial characteristics as the primary
determinant, however, our principal-agent formulation allows us to identify tradeoffs in the deal
process that are generated by those characteristics. Also, while the valuation method literature
uses the VC’s gut feelings to estimate the probability of successful exit, we instead formally
represent these gut feelings with a presumed minimum level of effort to be allocated by the
entrepreneur to the new venture in order to further capture the severity of moral hazard (a second
modeling feature not captured by Amit et al. 1998).

3. NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEAL PROCESS
Consider an entrepreneur who seeks VC investment for a new business venture of known
commercial potential, which we label quality. The VC requires an ownership share in return for
making the investment, and may elect to pay a base salary to the entrepreneur and/or to offer
8

<-----Page 8----->advisory service post investment.3 Once the venture is funded, the entrepreneur allocates effort to
that venture, although the effort level cannot easily be observed by the VC (and is therefore not
explicitly included in the investment contract). The entrepreneur encounters a cost from
allocating these efforts since he or she could allocate time on an alternate activity (e.g., a wage
job) based on that entrepreneur’s preference for work.
The new venture is expected to generate revenues that will be split between VC and
entrepreneur as per their ownership agreement. Expected revenues are positively associated with
the entrepreneur’s effort level, the VC’s service level, and the venture’s quality (all with
diminishing returns; Mas-Colell et al., 1995). Valliere and Peterson (2007) observed that, as they
gain experience, entrepreneurs increasingly value the personal compatibility of the VC. Also, the
quality of the venture likely enhances the productivity (i.e., revenue per unit of effort allocated)
of the entrepreneur and of the VC. Overall, there exist positive interactions between the three
components of the (expected) revenue function, with marginal revenue from entrepreneurial
effort increasing with VC service and marginal revenue from VC service increasing with
entrepreneurial effort. Further, the revenue function is known to both entrepreneur and VC since
the VC has conducted due diligence over the proposed venture and the entrepreneur, and since
the entrepreneur has proposed the venture and acquired some background information on the
VC.
If the investment deal closes, the VC expects a return from the venture, which is the
excess of his or her share of revenues over the investment amount, base salary paid to the
3

Upfront payments like base salaries are also modeled in Keuschnigg and Nielsen (2001, 2002) and in Repullo and
Suarez (2003), and noted in Admati and Pfleiderer (1994). The rationale for an upfront payment is that surplus is
transferred to the entrepreneur if VCs compete to obtain the deal. VC competition for a new venture is plausible
when that venture is expected to generate a large value (i.e., the value expected to accrue to the entrepreneur at the
time of exit, over and above the initially paid base salary, is far more than the base salary).

9

<-----Page 9----->entrepreneur, and cost of service. The base salary is determined exogenously (e.g., by
considering the potential of the venture, VC competition if any, and/or the VC’s desire to lure the
entrepreneur) and, for any given base salary, the VC decides on ownership share by fulfilling
two conditions: a “feasibility condition”, where the investment return should be at least as good
as an alternative investment return; and a “portfolio value-maximizing condition”, where the
service level offered should maximize the value of the venture portfolio.4
The VC starts with the belief that the entrepreneur will allocate a minimum effort level.
Hence, from the VC’s viewpoint, revenues depend only on his or her service level, and that VC’s
feasibility condition depends on his or her service level and ownership share. The VC maximizes
the value of his or her venture portfolio by equalizing marginal return from service across the
ventures in that portfolio. In other words, the VC must choose each service level associated with
each venture in the portfolio. Due to diminishing returns, the marginal return from service is
positive when the VC is time constrained. Hence, maximizing the value of the VC’s portfolio
does not result in maximizing his or her return on each individual venture. For a given minimum
effort level from the entrepreneur, quality of the venture, the VC’s marginal return from service,
and the cost for the VC’s time (i.e., total returns the VC brings to the VC firm from servicing the
ventures in his or her portfolio divided by the total amount of time invested in these ventures),
the VC’s portfolio value-maximizing condition only depends on that VC’s ownership share and
service level (just as the VC’s feasibility condition does). The VC determines ownership share
and service level by fulfilling these two conditions, and then makes an investment offer to the
entrepreneur.
4

For the feasibility condition, an alternate investment by the VC would earn that VC a gross return of principal plus
surplus (at his or her minimum required rate of return over the life of the contract) on the investment plus base
salary, and the monetary equivalent of his or her service. The excess of return from the venture over the return from
an alternate investment (called the “excess profit” from investing in the venture) must be at least zero. We will set
the excess profit to zero to keep the model tractable.
10

<-----Page 10----->The entrepreneur too expects a return from the venture, which is the sum of the base
salary and the excess of his or her share of revenues over the cost of effort. The entrepreneur
decides on whether or not to accept the offer based on two conditions: a “value-maximizing
condition”, where the entrepreneur allocates effort at the level that maximizes his or her return
from the venture; and a “feasibility condition”, where the entrepreneur’s optimal effort level
must exceed the minimum effort level expected by the VC and where the entrepreneur’s returns
from the venture should be non-negative.
From the investment offer and the VC’s conditions, the entrepreneur first identifies the
VC’s assessment of his or her minimum effort level and the VC’s service level, given the VC’s
ownership share, base salary, quality of the venture, VC’s rate of return, cost for the VC’s time,
and the VC’s marginal return from service (a measure of how busy the VC is). Sharing this type
of information with the entrepreneur is in the interest of the VC because the entrepreneur might
misjudge the investment offer and, as a result, reject an offer that is attractive to both parties, or
accept an unattractive offer that might lead to strain and lack of cooperation between both
parties.
Second, the entrepreneur must estimate an optimal effort level from his or her valuemaximizing condition. Unlike the VC, the entrepreneur focuses on only one venture at a time
and hence the optimal effort level is the one that maximizes his or her return from the venture.
The entrepreneur declines the investment offer if the optimal effort level is below the minimum
effort level expected by the VC; otherwise, the entrepreneur evaluates the offer further.5 We note
that when the entrepreneur increases his or her effort level to the VC’s minimum level, the

5

We note that when the optimal effort level is below the VC’s minimum level, the offer may still be attractive to the
entrepreneur, but not to the VC because the investment becomes inferior to an alternate investment.
11

<-----Page 11----->entrepreneur’s return from the venture decreases (because the extra costs of effort exceed the
extra returns) and he or she should refuse the offer when any of that entrepreneur’s or the VC’s
conditions is violated. Lastly, the entrepreneur estimates his or her return from the venture and
accepts the offer if that amount is non-negative.
When the entrepreneur rejects the investment offer, the VC may alter the terms with a
revised base salary and/or ownership share, subject to that VC’s feasibility and portfolio valuemaximizing conditions. The VC must then revise upwards his or her expectation of the
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level, which may even be justified since the rejection signals that
the VC might have been too conservative. We note, however, that the VC’s expectation of the
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level is an assessment that is crucial to protect an investment with
uncertain returns. Therefore, there might not be much room for revision, although, if rejected
again, this process could repeat itself until a mutually agreeable deal is reached. We further note
that, when the entrepreneur accepts the offer and that entrepreneur’s optimal effort level exceeds
the VC’s minimum level, the venture’s revenue will be more than anticipated by the VC.
This description illustrates how the deal process unfolds. The main questions then
become: When an investment offer is rejected, under what conditions should the VC make a
revised offer? Does the entrepreneur necessarily benefit from receiving a base salary as part of
the offer, and how does a change in the base salary affect the VC’s share of the new venture and
service level? These questions cannot be answered with intuitive reasoning, but a formal version
of the simple framework we described can. The next section translates this narrative description
into a formal principal-agent model.

4.3 An Illustrative Example
As an illustrative example of how the investment deal unfolds initially, we use the revenue
function

, with

,i

{1,2,3,4}, which satisfies

the underlying assumptions in Eq. (1). We consider a set of numerical values where

15

= 7000,

<-----Page 15----->= 0.155,

= 20,

= 0.041667,

= 1, r = .15, I = $2 million, b = $50,000, w = $1,500 per

hour of service, c = $500 per hour of service, and

= 1000 hours.

An investment of $2 million, contract life of 1 year, and base salary of $50,000 are
considered, although these amounts can be altered without affecting our qualitative results.
Metrick (2006) estimates the cost of venture capital as 15%, hence we used r = .15 for the one
year period. A cost of $1,500 per hour of service for the VC’s time corresponds to an annual
income of $3 million (at 2000 hours/year) to be brought back to the VC firm, which figure is in
line with Metrick’s (2006) average annual income. The positive marginal return from service to
other ventures, $500, accounts for the possibility of a time-constrained VC, and the quality of the
venture q has been set to 1 without loss of generality. Also, for the selected figures, the revenue
corresponds to about $9 million when the effort is at the minimum of 1000 hours/year (the
corresponding service level being 157 hours), and is about $35 million when it is at the assumed
maximum of 4000 hours (the service level being 219 hours). Gorman and Sahlman (1989) found
that VCs typically spend about 110 hours per portfolio venture per year, which is comparable to
the numbers of hours in this example.
Table 1 summarizes the deal initiation process for this example. We illustrate this process
for a range of the entrepreneur’s effective wage rate because that rate represents private
information regarding entrepreneurial characteristics. In Scenario 1 the rate is low, which can be
regarded as the entrepreneur being passionate about the new venture. The deal will close because
the entrepreneur’s optimal effort level is more than the minimum presumed and because that
entrepreneur is expected to face large returns. In Scenario 4, on the other hand, the rate is high,
which can be regarded as the entrepreneur being rather indifferent about the new venture and
resulting in the offer being rejected.
16

<-----Page 16----->------------------- Insert Table 1 about here ------------------This numerical exercise also demonstrates that a new venture’s revenue may
considerably increase if the entrepreneur exhibits more passion regarding that venture (moving
from Scenario 4 to Scenario 1). We also note that the VC’s offer is the same in all cases because
it is independent of the entrepreneur’s effective wage rate. Moreover, the numerical values in
Table 1 for s, V and P, and for e and E, are those anticipated respectively by the VC and the
entrepreneur at the time of signing the deal, not necessarily the actual figures observed in the
funded venture. In the next section we go a step further by investigating the conditions under
which a rejected investment deal should be revised.

5. REVISING THE INVESTMENT DEAL
When the entrepreneur rejects the VC’s investment offer and there is an opportunity for revising
the deal, the VC can decrease his or her ownership share α, and keep the same base salary b, or
increase b and keep α unchanged. However, since these decisions depend on the entrepreneur’s
minimum effort level emin, that level becomes the main determinant of the offer terms. Hence, the
VC can revise the offer as long as there is room for upwardly adjusting the minimum effort level.
We first look at necessary and sufficient conditions for revising the offer when b is kept fixed. In
this case, a change in the minimum effort level emin alters both the VC’s service level s and
ownership share α, and we must thus consider this dual impact to obtain Proposition 1.6
Proposition 1:
Case (i). The change ds/demin in the VC’s service level per additional unit of the presumed
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level is negative. Then revising the deal by
6

Proofs of all propositions appear in the appendix.
17

<-----Page 17----->reducing the VC’s ownership share should take place if and only if that change
exceeds a lower bound and a sufficiently large ownership share has initially been
allocated to the VC.
Case (ii). The change ds/demin in the VC’s service level per additional unit of the presumed
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level is positive. Then revising the deal by reducing
the VC’s ownership share should take place if and only if that change is below an
upper bound, regardless of the value of the ownership share initially allocated.

When the change in the VC’s service level per additional unit of the presumed
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level is very negative and below a (negative) threshold, the
decrease in expected revenue from a reduced service level (from a higher presumed
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level in order to revise the deal) and the reduced return from a
lower ownership share outweigh the saving in service cost. As a result, revising the investment
deal is unattractive to the VC. The lower threshold on the change in service level also translates
into a lower threshold for the VC’s ownership share, and hence revising the deal is unattractive
to the VC unless the ownership share granted remains substantial. Similarly, when the change in
service level is positive and exceeds an upper threshold, the cost of service increases
considerably with a higher presumed entrepreneur’s minimum effort level in order to revise the
deal. At the same time, a reduced ownership share further diminishes the VC’s return, making
unattractive a revision of the investment deal.
The specifics of the threshold on the change in the VC’s service level per additional unit
of the presumed entrepreneur’s minimum effort level depend on the sign of that change (as
specified in the appendix). Worth noting here are the numerous other factors that affect these
thresholds including: the marginal return to the VC from service across all ventures in the

18

<-----Page 18----->portfolio; the presumed entrepreneur’s productivity (i.e., revenue per unit of effort); the VC’s
ownership share as per the initial offer; the VC’s productivity (i.e., revenue per unit of service)
per additional unit of that minimum effort level; and the rate of change in revenue per unit of VC
service. For instance, if the (presumed) entrepreneur’s productivity increases, everything else
being equal, the threshold on the (negative) service level change is relaxed and revising the deal
likely becomes more attractive to the VC. However, if the rate of change in revenue per unit of
VC service increases (i.e., it becomes more negative), everything else being equal, the threshold
on the (positive) service level change becomes tighter and revising the deal likely becomes less
attractive to the VC. Overall, a smaller marginal return to the VC from service across all ventures
in the portfolio, a larger (presumed) entrepreneurial productivity, a larger VC’s ownership share
as per the initial offer, a larger increase in the VC’s productivity per additional unit of the
presumed entrepreneur’s minimum effort level, and/or a smaller (negative) rate of change in
revenue per unit of VC service should encourage the VC to revise the deal by reducing his
ownership share.
We also derive a sufficient and necessary condition under which the change in service
level is positive. Specifically, we found that change to be positive when the VC’s productivity
per additional unit of the presumed entrepreneur’s minimum effort level is above a critical
threshold (formally,

if and only if

, as detailed in the appendix).

When the VC’s productivity is large enough, the increase in revenue due to increased service
offsets the increase in the cost of service, encouraging a positive change in service level.
Proposition 2, instead, highlights a necessary and sufficient condition under which
revising a rejected deal should take place when the VC’s ownership share

19

is kept fixed but the

<-----Page 19----->base salary b is increased. Contrary to Proposition 1, we note in this case that, although the
presumed minimum effort level emin is still a key determinant of the offer terms, whether or not
the deal should be revised is unaffected by the adjustment made on that minimum effort level.
We do verify, nevertheless, that the VC’s service level should increase with an upward
adjustment of the presumed entrepreneur’s minimum effort level (i.e.,

is always positive).

Proposition 2: Revising the deal by increasing the entrepreneur’s base salary should take
place if and only if the VC’s ownership share exceeds a critical threshold.

Since the initial investment offer was made based on no excess profit, an increase in the
base salary is desirable only if the VC’s share of revenues increases over and above the
additional cost of service arising from an upward adjustment in the entrepreneur’s presumed
minimum effort level. As a result, the VC’s ownership share must exceed a certain threshold.
That threshold depends on the following: cost for the VC’s time, the VC’s productivity and its
rate of change, the productivity per additional unit of the minimum effort level, and revenue per
unit of (presumed) entrepreneurial effort. Specifically, a lower cost for the VC’s time, a higher
productivity for the VC, a smaller (negative) rate of change in that productivity, a higher VC’s
productivity per additional unit of the presumed minimum effort level and/or a higher
entrepreneurial productivity should encourage the VC to revise the deal by increasing the
entrepreneur’s base salary.
Table 2 summarizes when the decision to revise should take place based on Propositions
1 and 2, while Table 3 summarizes our sensitivity analysis on whether or not the decision to
revise the deal is more likely to happen based on how a change in a key model parameter affects
the various critical thresholds. These decision rules complement existing literature (e.g., Fried

20

<-----Page 20----->and Hisrich, 1994; Pintado et al., 2007; Zutshi, 1999) by emphasizing the role played by not only
the characteristics of the entrepreneur but also those of the VC in firm valuation and thus
expected returns. Also, we note that, although affected by the entrepreneur’s characteristics,
Propositions 1 and 2 result from the moral hazard arising from the VC because the conditions for
whether or not to revise an investment offer are born from the constraints faced by that VC.
However, the need to revise the offer arises from the constraints of the entrepreneur as he or she
is the one who decides to accept or reject the initial offer.
------------------- Insert Table 2 and Table 3 about here -------------------

6. THE IMPORTANCE OF BASE SALARY
We now fix the entrepreneur’s minimum effort level

presumed by the VC. We do this to

study the influence of the base salary b to be paid to the entrepreneur on the VC’s ownership
share

and on the VC’s service level s, as well as the influence of b on the entrepreneur’s effort

level e and return E. Proposition 3 articulates our findings.
Proposition 3: Everything else being equal, if the VC increases the entrepreneur’s base
salary, then his ownership share and service level should increase. The resulting increase in
the VC’s ownership share does not necessarily decrease the entrepreneur’s optimal effort
level, nor does the increase in the base salary necessarily increase the entrepreneur’s return.

When the VC increases the entrepreneur’s base salary (yet keeping the presumed
entrepreneur’s minimum effort level fixed), that VC must increase his or her ownership share to
keep the excess profit non-negative. Since the VC must also satisfy the portfolio valuemaximizing condition in Eq. (6), the VC’s productivity (i.e., revenue per unit of service)

21

<-----Page 21----->decreases due to the increase in ownership share. The VC’s service level must then increase due
to the decreasing nature at which the VC’s productivity changes as the service level is increased.
Although the literature supports that an increase in the VC’s ownership share should
decrease the entrepreneur’s incentive to allocate more effort (e.g., Amit et al., 1998), these
frameworks have ignored the positive impact of the VC’s service level on the entrepreneur’s
productivity (i.e., revenue per unit of effort), which can encourage the entrepreneur to allocate
more effort. Furthermore, the entrepreneur’s return may decrease in spite of an increase in the
base salary because that entrepreneur’s ownership share decreases. We also note that, even
though the entrepreneur’s base salary is a direct loss to the VC, the VC can still benefit from
increasing it because it may result in a larger excess profit due to the increase in the VC’s
ownership share.
These observations add to the entrepreneurial finance literature, which has been limited
regarding the importance of entrepreneurial salaries. Keuschnigg and Nielsen (2001, 2002) and
Repullo and Suarez (2003) have modeled upfront payments, although they rationalize them
based on the surplus transferred to the entrepreneur when VCs compete to obtain an investment
deal. This surplus is, however, only available if a VC has made an offer while facing a positive
excess profit. Then, for a given ownership share, the VC can offer a base salary as high as that
excess profit, which also benefits the entrepreneur. The entrepreneur, however, may not know
whether or not the VC’s offer is at positive excess profit. Consequently, the entrepreneur may be
encouraged instead to decline the base salary and ask for a higher ownership share. This action
can be beneficial because, if the VC has in fact made the offer at zero excess profit, then the VC
must have increased his or her ownership share in the offer to compensate for the base salary,
which results in reducing the ownership share of the entrepreneur. Thus, while existing literature
22

<-----Page 22----->suggests that offering a base salary is advantageous to the entrepreneur, our analysis shows that it
might not always be the case.

7. CONCLUSION
Entrepreneurship scholars (e.g., Fried and Hisrich, 1994; Messica, 2008; Levie and Gimmon,
2008) suggest that entrepreneurial characteristics are crucial to firm valuation and, in turn, the
VC’s expected return and desire to invest. We therefore studied the VC investment deal process
based on those characteristics, the conditions that encourage a rejected offer to be revised, and
when and whether the entrepreneur and/or the VC can benefit from including a base salary for
the entrepreneur as part of the investment deal. In this section, we address strategy implications
based on our results detailed in §4, §5 and §6, and conclude with a discussion of some
limitations of our study and opportunities for future work.
Passionate entrepreneurs may be more likely to attract VC funds. Asymmetric
information in the VC-entrepreneur relationship has been dealt with extensively (e.g., Admati
and Pfleiderer, 1994). Yet, an added feature of our principal-agent approach was to capture
passion in the form of an effective wage rate and to employ a minimum effort level to reflect the
private nature of this entrepreneurial characteristic. We then demonstrated in our illustrative
example that passionate entrepreneurs are more likely to find the investment offer attractive and
accept it because the effort levels they are willing to allocate to their new business venture will
exceed the minimum level presumed by their potential investors.
Service rendered and compatibility may be crucial to VC investment. Propositions 1 and
2 propose that the VC will be encouraged to revise the offer when he or she expects to

23

<-----Page 23----->significantly contribute to the success of the venture. If the service allocated by the VC enhances
the entrepreneur’s productivity and vice versa – in other words, they are compatible
(complementary) – then the VC should revise the offer providing he or she can maintain a high
productivity level even at high levels of service. These observations complement the findings of
Valliere and Peterson (2007) whereby compatibility between VC and entrepreneur is crucial in
VC financing. Our analysis therefore further complements this literature by characterizing
conditions that should encourage an investment offer to be revised, if rejected, based on both the
service level exercised by the VC and the compatibility of the parties.
VCs’ time constraints may discourage them from revising their offers. Propositions 1 and
2 also suggest that the VC may need to require a rather high ownership share in order to revise
an offer. We also demonstrated that the thresholds on the ownership share are expected to
augment with an increase in the cost for the VC’s time, making a revised offer less likely.
Existing literature has not yet uncovered this insight on the impact of the VC’s cost for time on
deal closing. Although the need for VCs to claim an ownership share is well-documented (e.g.,
Amit et al., 1998), what characterizes the actual level (and the threshold to exceed) is still under
scrutiny.
Industry specialization may encourage VCs to close more deals. Proposition 1 and 2
further suggest that the diminishing nature (concavity) of the VC’s service level constrains him
or her in closing the deal by decreasing the leeway in changing the service level in response to
changes in the entrepreneur’s effort level, and by increasing the minimum ownership share that
VC would need to revise a rejected offer. The VC can alleviate this problem by specializing in a
few industries and, as a result, be more productive to the invested ventures, even at high levels of
service. Specialization would then encourage VCs to revise their investment offers more often
24

<-----Page 24----->and potentially invest in more ventures. This implication is consistent with the finding of Norton
and Tenenbaum (1993) whereby VCs have been observed to specialize rather than diversify.
Both parties can benefit from the payment of a base salary. Proposition 3 proposes that
the entrepreneur might be worse off, yet the VC better off, when that entrepreneur receives a
base salary. Scholars, including Keuschnigg and Nielsen (2001, 2002) and Repullo and Suarez
(2003) have maintained that, when VCs compete for a deal, a base salary should be offered to
transfer surplus to the entrepreneur at the detriment of the VC. However, our analysis suggests
that, independently of whether or not competition is present, the payment of a base salary can
favor the VC due to its influence on the VC’s ownership share and on both VC’s service level
and entrepreneur’s effort level.
But if you pay them well, be ready to put more effort. Proposition 3 also suggests that,
everything else being equal, if the VC pays a base salary to the entrepreneur, then the VC’s
service level should increase. Although this appears counter-intuitive, we note that the VC
claims a higher ownership share while paying a base salary. Consequently, the VC has to render
more service to maximize his or her portfolio value. For the entrepreneur, his or her ownership
share decreases with the acceptance of a base salary, yet the entrepreneur’s optimal effort level
may not decrease because the VC will render more service, which in turn will tend to increase
the entrepreneur’s effort level (due to compatibility between both parties). The literature has
dealt with base salary payment (e.g., Keuschnigg and Nielsen, 2001), but the impacts of such
payment on the effort levels of the VC and the entrepreneur have not been scrutinized.
While our analysis is theoretical and based on mathematical reasoning, we note that the
underlying tradeoffs we have used and those we have uncovered are common in the

25

<-----Page 25----->entrepreneurship literature. Nevertheless, our principal-agent model has allowed us to
innovatively capture the severe moral hazard present in the VC investment deal. Our analytical
approach has also allowed us to investigate the sensitivity of the investment offer as the VC
alters his or her belief on the entrepreneur’s behavior. Furthermore, we have added some rigor by
offering a formalized sequential process of the investment deal in which the VC evaluates a new
business venture and initiates an offer, the entrepreneur responds to that offer, and then the VC
revise that offer if rejected.
Our arguments, however, have limitations because they are based on some modeling
assumptions. For instance, incompatibility, where the service allocated by the VC diminishes the
entrepreneur’s productivity and/or more entrepreneurial effort diminishes the VC’s productivity
(i.e.,

and/or

), may arise. Relaxing the compatibility assumption would add

flexibility into our insights, even though the vast majority of deals involves fairly thorough
assessments. Other key elements to the VC investment problem could be considered, including
the entrepreneur’s experience (market value), to unveil additional insights. For instance, the
effective wage rate, which accounts for both the entrepreneur’s experience and private
information about his or her preference for work, could be split in two separate constructs.
Moreover, we have not investigated the evolution of the deal process with respect to how the
VC’s service level could change upon observation of the true effort level of the entrepreneur
post-contract. Further research on the investment deal phenomenon can unearth more insights on
the VC-entrepreneur relationship and on what encourages a deal to close.

Proof of Proposition 1. The VC revises the investment offer (α,b) if and only if his or her feasibility
condition in Eq. (4) and portfolio value-maximizing condition in Eq. (6) are both satisfied. Without a loss
of generality, satisfying Eq. (4) is equivalent to the VC’s excess profit in Eq. (5) being zero. Since the
VC’s decisions – ownership share α and service level s – depend on the entrepreneur’s minimum effort
level emin, that level becomes the main determinant of the offer terms because the VC can revise the offer
if and only if there is room for upwardly adjusting that level. Therefore, we must characterize the range of

Outcome and explanation
The entrepreneur’s optimal effort level is more than his or her maximum available time (assumed
to be 4000 hours), which in turn is more than the minimum effort level. The entrepreneur return
(for 4000 hours) is $4,590,080, which is greater than zero. The entrepreneur thus accepts the offer
and allocates all of his or her time to the venture but still cannot maximize his or her return.
The entrepreneur’s optimal effort level is more than the minimum effort level. The entrepreneur’s
return is also greater than zero, and thus accepts the offer.
The entrepreneur’s optimal effort level is less than the minimum effort level. Hence the
entrepreneur rejects the offer though his or her return is greater than zero at the optimal level. If the
entrepreneur accepts the offer and allocates the minimum effort level, his or her return reduces to
$115,422. If the entrepreneur accepts the offer but allocates the optimal effort level (which is
below the required minimum effort level), the VC’s estimated excess profit is negative since the
VC’s offer is such that P* = 0 at the minimum effort level.
The entrepreneur’s optimal effort level is zero. The entrepreneur thus rejects the offer. It may be
noted that the entrepreneur’s return is positive, but he or she rejects the offer because the VC’s
excess profit is negative at the entrepreneur’s optimal effort level, which is less than the minimum
presumed by the VC, leading to tension if the entrepreneur accepts the offer.
