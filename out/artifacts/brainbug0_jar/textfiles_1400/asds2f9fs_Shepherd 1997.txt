Abstract
Researchers of venture capitalists’ decision making must be aware of potential
biases and errors associated with self reported data especially in light of this study’s
findings that venture capitalists’ lack introspection into the policies they “use” to assess
likely profitability. Surprisingly, venture capitalists demonstrate some introspection into
the policies they “use” to assess probability of survival.

Introduction
Venture capitalists are conspicuously successful at predicting new venture success
(Sandberg & Hofer, 1987; Hall & Hofer, 1993) and numerous studies have investigated
their decision making. The majority of empirical research on venture capitalists’ decision
making has produced empirically derived lists of criteria that venture capitalists report they
use when evaluating new venture proposals (e.g., Tyebjee & Bruno, 1981; 1984; Bruno &
Tyebjee, 1985; Gorman & Sahlman, 1986; MacMillan, Siegal & SubbaNarasimha, 1985;
MacMillan, Zemann & SubbaNarasimha, 1987).
Social judgment theorists suggest that “espoused” decision processes may be a less
than accurate reflection of “in use” decision processes (Priem, 1992; Priem & Harrison,
1994; Zacharakis, 1995). Therefore, is the prior research which relies solely on the
veracity of venture capitalists’ introspection likely to be biased and inaccurate? Venture
capitalist’ decision making is analyzed to determine the accuracy of venture capitalists’
introspection.

Venture Capitalists Decision Making Research
Research on venture capitalists’ evaluation criteria reveals no thorough integrated
explanation of new venture performance (Sandberg & Hofer, 1987, Shepherd, 1997c)
with much still to be learned about venture capitalists’ assessment decisions (Hall &
Hofer, 1993). The primary objective of research into venture capitalists’ decision making
is to determine the criteria used by venture capitalists in the evaluation of potential

<-----Page 1----->investments. The methods used in previous studies typically ask venture capitalists to list
and rank decision criteria based on their presumed affect on the investment decision (for
example, Tyebjee & Bruno, 1981; MacMillan & SubbaNarasimha, 1986), on the
likelihood of success (for example, Kahn, 1987; MacMillan et al., 1987), and/or on the
likelihood of failure, (for example, Gorman & Sahlman, 1986; Meyer, Zacharakis &
DeCastro, 1993).
Limitations of this research includes problems of retrospective reporting (for
example, Tyebjee & Bruno, 1984), use of questionnaire responses rather than actual
evaluations (for example, MacMillan et al., 1987 and Robinson, 1987) and biases and
errors associated with self reporting (Sandberg & Hofer, 1987). Self reporting tends to
overstate the number of criteria actually used and to understate the weighting of the most
important criteria when compared to more sophisticated decision making techniques (Stahl
& Zimmerer, 1984, Riquelme & Rickards, 1992).
Shepherd (1997a, 1997b) demonstrates that a model of venture capitalists' decision
making that includes industry related competence, competitive rivalry, lead time, key
success factor stability, educational capability, mimicry, scope and timing, has explanatory
and predictive ability for venture capitalists' assessments of both likely profitability and
probability of survival. Shepherd’s (1997a, 1997b) model is used here to investigate
venture capitalists’ introspection.

Research Method
This study follows suggestions that venture capitalists’ decision making can be
researched through a decision making framework (Riquelme & Rickards, 1992; Muzyka et
al., 1996; Zacharakis, 1995). Conjoint analysis is a strong tool for decision modeling
research providing significant, structured insight into venture capitalists’ decision criteria
(Muzyka et al., 1996; Zacharakis, 1995). Conjoint analysis focuses on concurrent rather
than retrospective techniques for collecting and analyzing decisions. It uses a variant of
regression to decompose a decision into a linear or multilinear equation allowing
separation of attribute weights used by a venture capitalist from an overall preference.
Respondents’ judgments are then subjected to statistical analysis to discover which
attributes affected their new venture performance assessments and in which ways. The
theoretical basis for this study’s use of conjoint analysis is information integration theory
(Anderson, 1981; Louviere, 1988). Information integration theory provides a welldeveloped error theory to support the statistical tests that follow.

Dependent Variables
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) found venture capitalists accept/reject decisions can be
predicted from their risk and return perceptions. Return is most often evaluated by
venture capitalists in terms of profitability (Robinson, 1987; Robinson & Pearce, 1984;
Timmons, 1981; Roure & Keeley, 1990) and risk in terms of venture failure (Gorman &

<-----Page 2----->Sahlman, 1986). Profitability was defined as: “net profit on sales, using a ten year time
horizon”. An eleven point likert type scale was used with end anchors describing “very
low profitability” and “very high profitability”. Probability of survival is defined as “the
probability that this venture will continue to participate in the market using a ten year time
horizon”. Again an eleven point scale was used with end anchors describing “very low
probability of survival” and “very high probability of survival”. A ten year time horizon
was chosen for both dependent variables. This was chosen to exceed Biggadike (1979)
and McDougall, Covin, Robinson & Herron’s (1994) choice of eight years to define a new
venture as it appears reasonable to assume that ten years captures sustainable
performance.

Attributes, Levels and Performance
In developing conjoint profiles, levels were chosen to represent variation that
typically occurs in the decision environment of venture capitalists, thereby maintaining
believability and response validity. Venture capitalists evaluated a series of conjoint
profiles which describe new ventures in terms of eight attributes: (1) Timing of Entry, (2)
Stability of Key Success Factors, (3) Educational Capability, (4) Lead Time, (5)
Competitive Rivalry, (6) Mimicry, (7) Scope and (8) Industry Related Competence.
These eight factors were each manipulated at two levels, and are detailed in Table 1 in
Appendix A. Discussions with venture capitalists, accountants and academics confirmed
the face validity for both the attributes and their levels detailed above. Appendix B
displays an example profile.

Experimental Design
Each of the eight attributes is varied at two levels in an orthogonal fractional
factorial design consisting of 16 profiles (Hahn & Shapiro, 1966). This design enabled
both individual subject and aggregate subject analysis. Each of the 16 profiles is fully
replicated, permitting estimates of individual subject error for use in subsequent analyses
of variance (Ettenson et al., 1992). These 32 profiles were randomly assigned to avoid
order effects, with a further practice case to familiarize respondents with the task.
Therefore the experiment presented 39 profiles.

Participants
Sixty six individual venture capitalists representing 47 venture capital firms
completed the survey. Directors, Managing Directors, Executive Chairmen, General
Managers and CEOs represent 52% of the sample. Senior managers constitute a further
42% with only 6% of the sample accounted for by analysts. Non government firms
represented 74% of the sample with semi government and government contributing 14%
and 12% respectively. 94% of their investment was in Australia with those investing
overseas predominantly concentrating on Asia. Average total capital under investment
using a trimmed mean was $54.650 million and typical investment $2.5 million.

<-----Page 3----->Research Instrument
The research instrument used with venture capitalists contained instructions,
conjoint experiment and a post experimental questionnaire that requested self explicated
weights as well as information about the characteristics of the respondent. Relevant term
definitions were also included on a detachable sheet that could be referred to while
completing the survey. Once instructions were clear, respondents considered conjoint
venture descriptions and provided a rating on an 11 point scale for its likely profitability
and on another 11 point scale the probability of survival. Each performance measure
referred to a time horizon of ten years.
After completing 39 profiles, a post experiment questionnaire was
completed. The post experiment questionnaire asked each respondent to rate the
importance of each factor on an 11 point scale from (1) very unimportant to (11) very
important, and also collected personal and firm information. An example of that section of
the post experiment questionnaire requesting self explicated weights is displayed in
Appendix C.

Analysis of Variance
To identify the determinants of new venture performance that are statistically
significant, an individual-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed on the
decision making of each venture capitalist. Although two or more attributes may
significantly affect the decision process, it is unlikely that those attributes will be of equal
importance (Ettenson et al., 1992). Therefore, statistical significance at the individual
level is supplemented with a measure of relative importance. Hay’s (1973) omega squared
(w2), a measure of explained variance, was used to assess the relative importance of the
eight attributes and selected two-way interactions to each respondent’s decision.

Reliability
Experimental formats may have been new and unfamiliar to venture capitalists and
therefore it was important to test consistency of responses within each individual. This
provides an indication of the consistency with which they apply their decision making
strategies. Sixteen replicated profiles were evaluated with the 16 original/identical cases
and were used in a test-retest measure using Pearson R correlations. Discussions with
respondents indicated they were unaware that cases had been repeated.

Respondent’s Insight
For each respondent, their self explicated weights were investigated in relation to
their omega square (w2) values, derived from ANOVA. If venture capitalists have insight
into their own decision making, then Pearson R correlation are expected to be high.

<-----Page 4----->Results
In the post-experiment questionnaire, respondents were asked to indicate the
importance of each of the eight factors in the evaluation of likely profitability and then
perform the same task for probability of survival. For each factor these assessments were
made on a scale of ‘Not at all Important’, scored 1, to ‘Very Important’, scored 11. “Self
explicated” reports of factor importance, averaged across venture capitalists are shown in
Table 2 for profitability assessments and Table 3 for probability of survival assessments.
Omega squared is used as a measure of “Conjoint derived” importance weight.
The mean omega squared value for each attribute in venture capitalists assessment of
profitability and probability of survival are also shown in Tables 2 and 3 respectively.
Mean reliability for profitability assessments across venture capitalists is .62 and .69 for
probability of survival assessments.

Since conjoint analysis is thought to be a more valid assessment of respondent’s
decision making, the question becomes what is the relationship between a participant’s self
reports of factor importance and importance measures derived from conjoint analysis. To

<-----Page 5----->address this question, the relationship is first explored diagramatically at an aggregate level
and Pearson R correlations computed between each participant’s "self report" of factor
importance and their "conjoint derived" measure of factor importance.
Relative importance of each factor was calculated as a ratio of factor
importance over total importance of all eight factors. Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate relative
aggregate importance of attributes derived from conjoint analysis compared to those
relative measures calculated from self explicated methods for venture capitalists’
assessments of profitability and probability of survival.

When compared to conjoint derived importance weights, the self explicated
weights underestimate the most important criteria and over estimate the least important
criteria.

<-----Page 6----->If participants have insight into their decision strategies, large and significant
correlations should be found between their self reports of factor importance and their
omega squared values, since they are presumably measuring the same thing. Furthermore,
since participant’s provided their assessment of attribute importance immediately after
completing the conjoint task, their insight into the use of the eight factors should be
considerably better than might otherwise be the case. Results from this correlation
analysis for venture capitalists profitability assessments are presented in the diagonal in
Table 4 and venture capitalists’ probability of survival assessments in the diagonal in Table
5.

From Table 4, it appears venture capitalists lack insight into their profitability
assessment with only one of the self explicated weighted factors significantly correlated
with a derived factor weight. Average correlation across the eight factors is only 0.17.
Therefore, venture capitalists lack accurate introspection into their profitability
assessments.

From Table 5, venture capitalists’ “espoused” importance of educational capability
and competitive rivalry is significantly different from the conjoint derived importance of
educational capability and competitive rivalry in their probability of survival assessments.
However, the “espoused” importance of timing, scope, mimicry, lead time, key success

<-----Page 7----->factor stability and industry related competence were significantly correlated with the
respective conjoint derived importance weights. Six out of eight significant correlations
could be considered high in conjoint versus self explicated weight research. For example,
Ettenson et al. (1992) found two significant correlation coefficients (p<.05) from his study
using eight product attributes and concluded a lack of introspection. For this study the
average correlation between ‘self explicated’ probability of survival assessment policy and
‘in use’ policy is .30.

Discussion and Conclusion
The findings of this study provide insight into research methods for those
researching venture capitalists’ decision making. For both profitability and probability of
survival assessments, venture capitalists have a tendency to overstate the least important
criteria and understate the most important criteria when compared to models derived from
conjoint analysis. However does this mean that venture capitalists’ lack introspection into
their decision making? The findings show that venture capitalists lack introspection into
their profitability assessments. However, the findings also demonstrate some introspective
ability into probability of survival assessments.
Therefore those studies investigating the decision making of venture capitalists’
profitability assessments using self reported data are likely biased and have errors. On the
other hand, this may not be the case for venture capitalists’ decision making research into
probability of survival assessments where the use of self reported data could represent a
reasonable approximation of the decision making actually used. It is unclear whether
studies using self reported data to investigate either new venture performance or the
overall accept/reject decision are biased, as both dependent variables include assessments
of profitability and probability of survival. One clear message from this study to those
researchers investigating venture capitalists’ decision making using self reported data is,
BEWARE!
