The early-stage equity market in the USA
JEFFREY E. SOHL
(Received 14 July 1998, final version accepted 17 August 1998)
As recently as 20 years ago the USA began a transition from a declining industrial and
manufacturing economy to an emerging entrepreneurial/innovation-driven economy. With
this transition, the early-stage equity market has also evolved. As the institutional venture
capital industry continues to focus on later stage and larger investments, the private investor
market now provides the major source of seed and start-up capital. However, imperfections
in the seed and start-up market have led to market inefficiencies for the high-growth firm.
Two funding gaps appear to exist in the US equity market, both largely as a result of these
market inefficiencies. This paper provides a broad overview of the early-stage equity market
for high-growth ventures in the USA. In light of the critical role of business angels in the
early-stage market, special attention will be given to this population. Also included is a
discussion of angel markets and recent trends in the early-stage equity financing of
entrepreneurial ventures.

Introduction
When the young Alexander Graham Bell needed money in 1874 to
complete his early experiments on the telephone, bank officers thought that
the idea of a telephone was a foolish one. The consensus was that the nation
had a workable communication system in the form of the telegraph and the
concept of individuals communicating across great distances through
speech was considered to be a bit extreme. Besides, Mr Bell did not have a
company with any tangible assets to provide collateral. Recognizing an
opportunity, Boston attorney Gardiner Green Hubbard and leather
merchant Thomas Sanders of Salem, Massachusetts helped out. Later,
these same two individuals put up the equity capital to start the Bell
Telephone Company in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1903, when Henry Ford
Jeffrey E. Sohl is Director of the Center for Venture Research and a Professor in the Department of
Decision Sciences at the Whittemore School of Business and Economics at the University of New
Hampshire, Durham, New Hampshire 03824. Phone: 603-862-3341; Fax: 603-862-4468; E-mail:

was in need of capital at the early stage in the development of the
automobile, he faced difficulties in securing funding to develop a working
prototype. The owner of Daisy Rifle, along with four other individuals,
came to the rescue and invested $40,000 in equity capital. About 100 years
later, in 1976, when Anita Roddick needed capital to open a second store
her bank responded that she had only been in business a few months, she
had no track record and that she should wait another year. For an
entrepreneur, a year is an eternity. Ms Roddick turned to a private investor,
Ian McGlinn, who invested the £4000 that she needed. She opened that
second store and so began the development of the Body Shop, a corporation
with over 700 stores today. In 1994 Jeff Bezos and a few employees created
a web site and data base in Bezos’s Bellevue, Washington, garage. He went
looking for capital from venture capital firms but their response became a
familiar one: good idea but, well, maybe later. After being introduced to
some private investors, he succeeded in raising $1.2 million from a
dozen private investors. A later round of $8 million was provided
from professional venture capital funds. In May 1997 the company
Amazon.com, the internet bookseller, completed an initial public offering,
providing the investors and entrepreneurs with a handsome return.
These and other stories abound and provide the motivation for the
research on early-stage equity markets. This research activity, begun in
earnest a scant 15 years ago, has evolved into a substantial body of literature
developed under the axiom of applying academic rigour to an applied area
of study. This knowledge base has been primarily delineated along two
market dimensions: the informal market, with an emphasis on the study of
private investors, commonly referred to as business angels, and the formal
market, characterized by institutional venture capital firms.
The seminal work on the study of business angels was conducted by
Wetzel (1983) and is generally acknowledged as the first study to establish
the existence of private investors. From this modest beginning extensive
research has been conducted in North America and Europe. In the USA,
studies have examined the angel market from a regional perspective
(Krasner and Tymes 1983, Neiswander 1985, Aram 1989, Gaston and Bell
1988, Haar et al. 1988, Postma and Sullivan 1990) by sectors (Freear et al.
1998) and delineated by investor categories (Freear et al. 1994a). The US
market as an entity has also been examined, with the Center for Venture
Research providing the majority of this research to date (Freear et al.
1994b, 1995a, 1997). In Canada, Riding and Short (1987) and Short and
Riding (1989) have made significant contributions. In Europe, primarily
the UK, the study of business angels has been spearheaded by Mason and
Harrison, who have examined business angels with respect to market
imperfections (Mason and Harrison 1992, 1995b, Harrison and Mason
1993), institutional archangels (Mason and Harrison 1995a), business
introduction services (Harrison and Mason 1996a, b) and the role of public
policy (Mason 1996). Recently, the study of business angels has spread
from these origins in the USA and the UK to include research on business
angels in Sweden (Landstrom 1993, 1995), Holland (K+V Organisatie
adviesbureau bv and Entrepreneurial Holding bv 1996), Finland (Lumme
et al. 1998), Japan (Tashiro 1998) and Australia (Hindle and Wenban

1997). An excellent summary of the evolution of business angel research
and the major contributions is provided by van Osnanbrugge (1998).
For the formal market, the initial empirical research was conducted by
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) and by Bygrave and Timmons (1986, 1992). The
study of venture capital firms and their investment process has produced a
more voluminous literature than the informal market counterpart
(Zacharakis and Meyer 1995). Reasons for this increased level of activity
are due in part to the findings of several studies that indicate a higher
survival rate and higher return on investment for firms with venture capital
as part of the financial structure, as opposed to firms lacking any venture
capital funding (Timmons 1994, Zacharakis and Meyer 1995). In addition,
the formal market is the visible segment of the early-stage equity market,
and with this visibility is the ability to identify and access venture capital
firms for research purposes, especially in contrast to the informal market
(van Osnanbrugge 1998). Similar to the evolution of research on business
angels, the early researchers in venture capital focused on the US market
(MacMillan et al. 1985, 1988, Gorman and Sahlman 1989, Sapienza 1992).
More recently, this stream of literature has begun to include European
nations as the unit of study (Murray 1995a, c). Recent cross-country
comparisons of the venture capital industry (Murray 1995b, Sapienza et al.
1996) is indicative of the international dimension. As in the case for
business angel research, an excellent taxonomy of the research on venture
capital firms is provided by van Osnanbrugge (1998).
In contrast to the research on specific segments and processes in the
formal and informal venture capital industry, the intent of this paper is to
provide a broad overview of the early-stage equity market for high-growth
ventures in the USA. In light of the critical role of business angels in the
early-stage market, special attention will be given to this population. The
paper is organized as follows: changes in the US economy, unique features
of the early-stage market, stages and sources of equity investing, the capital
gap, the attitudes, behaviour and characteristics of business angels and
angel market mechanisms. The paper concludes with some directions for
future research.
The US economy
As recently as 1979 the USA began a transition from a declining industrial
and manufacturing economy to an emerging entrepreneurial/innovationdriven economy. This trend continues today and has accelerated, as
evidenced by the increasing rate of new business formation. This evolution
is highlighted by three relatively recent changes in the structure of the US
economy and these changes have profound implications for the US capital
markets from both a supply and demand perspective.
First, employment and gross national product (GNP) data reveals the
systemic shift to an economy dominated by the innovative start-up. From
1954–1979, the share of GNP represented by the Fortune 500, the 500
largest companies in the USA, grew from 37 to 58%. The payrolls of these
500 largest US industrial corporations peaked in 1979 at 16 million jobs.

<-----Page 3----->104

JEFFREY E. SOHL

Since 1979, Fortune 500 employment has exhibited a steady decline as
employment decreased by over 25% or 4 million jobs. In 1996 the
percentage of employment represented by the Fortune 500 was a scant 10%.
From 1979 to 1995, the invisible entrepreneurial economy generated over
24 million new jobs as the number of new businesses created increased by
200% (Dennis 1997, Freear et al. 1997). Second, the US public equity
markets pay tribute to the innovative, high-growth entrepreneurial
ventures. In 1979 the volume of shares traded on the NASDAQ market
was less than one-half of the trading volume of the New York Stock
Exhange (NYSE). In 1994 NASDAQ share volume exceeded the NYSE
volume for the first time. As indicated in figure 1, this trend continues
today. Third, the source of wealth for the top high net worth group in the
USA has shifted with the growth of the entrepreneurial economy. Since
1984 the number of first generation entrepreneurs occupying the Forbes
400 richest Americans has steadily increased. In 1997, nearly three in four

individuals (72%) of the wealthiest Americans were self-made first
generation entrepreneurs.
Market misnomers
The transition to an entrepreneurial economy is firmly embedded in the
fabric of the US economy. As with any systemic change over a relatively
short time, there are both profound implications for investors and equity
capital markets, as well as misguided notions and conceptions of the new
economy (Wetzel 1995).
Perhaps foremost in the entrepreneurial misnomer is the reference to
the job generation capacity attributed to small businesses. Clearly, the
small business sector has an important place in the US economy as a source
of employment for the entrepreneur and their employees. Unfortunately,
the attention afforded small businesses is not commensurate with actual job
and wealth creation capacity. For the entrepreneurial economy small
business is too broad a definition. Most of the new jobs attributable to small
firms are created by a relatively few firms that start small and grow fast. As
early as 1980, Mitchell (1980) noted that only a minority of small firms
grow into large ones and that the small minority that can grow are far more
important than their numbers suggest. These small, high-growth firms
represent the potential for innovation, job creation and high returns for
investors claimed by the small business community (Mitchell 1980, Storey
1980). Since 1979, over 75% of net new jobs were created by less than 10%
of small businesses (Birch et al. 1993). It is the Inc 500 of the nation, not
the Fortune 500, that are the true engine of job growth. Over the last 4
years, these high growth start-ups added 6 million jobs to an economy that
added 7.7 million jobs in total. For entrepreneurs, size is a transient
characteristic where firms start small (and as such receive the small
business label) but grow fast.
Another misguided notion attributed to the small business/high growth
misconception is that private investors invest in small business. Venture
investors look for opportunities to back entrepreneurial companies that
offer the prospect of long-term capital gains substantial enough to justify
the risks and lack of short-term liquidity inherent in venture investing.
From a venture investor’s view there are three types of entrepreneurial
ventures (Bygrave 1994). First, the life-style ventures created by the
business owner to provide employment and driven by life-style motives.
These ventures have 5-year revenue projections under $10 million and are
the ‘classic’ small business. The life-style firm is of no interest to investors
and are often not so affectionately referred to as the living dead. In these
types of ventures the investor has no clear harvest options as the venture
failed to achieve the potential growth anticipated during the time of the
initial investment. These life-style ventures account for over 90% of all
start-ups Second, middle market ventures with 5-year revenue projections
typically in the range of $10 to $50 million. These ventures may need
venture financing and, if properly structured, can offer capital gains and
cash-out opportunities for investors. These firms rely heavily on financing

<-----Page 5----->106

from individual investors. These firms will remain privately held or they
will be sold. A business angel can harvest the investment through the sale
or, in the case of the firm remaining privately held, buy-back options may
be included in the terms and conditions of the original investment. Third,
high potential ventures with 5-year revenue projections in excess of $50
million. These are the potential big time winners for entrepreneurs and
investors. They expect to be publicly traded or acquired within 5 years.
These ventures represent the next generation of Apple, Norstrom,
Blockbuster Video and comprise less than 1% of all start-ups.
The last misnomer of the early-stage equity market concerns the
primary source of equity capital. The pool of equity capital for emerging
companies is not restricted to venture capital funds listed in Pratt’s Guide to
Venture Capital Sources (Testa et al. 1996). In reality there are two
segments to the venture capital market: one visible and one relatively
invisible. The visible segment is represented by about 500 venture capital
funds that manage between $35 to $45 billion. The invisible segment is the
oldest and largest segment of the US venture capital industry and is made
up of about two million self-made, high net worth individuals. Individually, these investors don’t merit a blip on any chart of total investment
capital in the USA. Collectively, however, hundreds of thousands of similar
investors, successful entrepreneurs who are willing to invest in other
entrepreneurs, have quietly become the nation’s major source of start-up
capital. These private investors are the spawning grounds for their venture
capitalist counterparts and in terms of seed and start-up capital far outpace
the venture capitalists that are in the headlines of today’s financial news.
Equity markets
As entrepreneurial ventures grow and mature they pass through various
stages in the search for equity capital. In general, there are four broad
categories of equity financing linked to the stage of development of the
venture (Venture Economics 1996). Initially, seed financing provides
relatively small amounts of equity capital to an entrepreneur to prove a
concept and to qualify for start-up capital. Start-up financing is equity
capital for companies completing product development and initial marketing. These companies may be in the process of organizing start-up or they
may already have been in business for 1 year or less. Early-stage financing
is generally considered to be equity capital for the expansion of a company
that is producing and delivering products or services. Although the
company has made progress, it is generally less than 5 years old and may
not be showing a profit yet. Later-stage financing involves funds provided
for a major expansion of the company whose sales volume is increasing or
for a venture expecting to go public within 6 months to 1 year. Mezzanine
and bridge financing fall under the rubric of later-stage financing.
For each of these financing stages the sources of equity capital, and the
relative position of these sources during the growth stages of the
entrepreneurial venture, are shown in figure 2. At the inception stage the
venture is traditionally owner/inventor financed through a variety of

<-----Page 6----->THE EARLY-STAGE EQUITY MARKET IN THE USA

107

bootstrapping methods (Freear et al. 1995b). In this context bootstrapping
is defined as creative methods of acquiring the use of resources without
raising equity from traditional sources. Bootstrapping methods entail both
a reduction in expenses and acquisition of capital. In the former, customerfinanced research and development, and working out of the home
developing the venture as a second job, are some of the more common
practices. In the latter, credit card debt and second home mortgages
generally provide the small amounts of capital during the initial stage of
development. As the venture begins to develop, but is still in the very early
stage of growth, friends and families tend to be the source of small pools of
capital. At this stage, more often than not, these are poorly structured deals
typically entered into without a great deal of due diligence. If this financing
is not overburdened with terms and conditions that may impinge on
professional equity capital at a later stage, these sources are useful to begin
product development, but are not considered to be classic investment
capital.

As the entrepreneurial venture grows, so does the appetite for cash.
Previous studies identified private investors as the major source of capital
in the seed and start-up stage (Wetzel 1983, Gaston and Bell 1988, Freear et
al. 1995a). This relatively invisible source is the oldest and largest segment
of the US venture capital industry and is made up of over 2 million
individuals with a net worth in excess of $1 million, excluding personal
residences. The majority of these individuals are self-made millionaires,
first generation money, and are individuals with substantial business and
entrepreneurial experience. Close examination of last year’s list of the 400
richest Americans (Forbes 1998) reveals that 72%, nearly three in four,
were first generation entrepreneurs. While estimates of the scale of this
informal venture capital market vary considerably, conservative estimates
suggest that about 250,000 angels invest approximately $10–$20 billion
every year in over 30,000 ventures (Freear et al. 1994b). All indications are
that the size of the informal market is expanding (Fenn et al. 1995). In the
past 25 years new incorporations have skyrocketed by almost 200%, and
with this burst of new companies is the growth in the number of
entrepreneurs who are angel candidates. In particular, start-ups from the
high tech boom of the 1970s have come of age, unleashing the wealth of
founders who are eager to invest in the next generation of entrepreneurs.
Estimates suggest that the number of latent or potential self-made, private
investors exceeds the number of active investors by a factor of five to one
(Wetzel 1995). As indicated in figure 2, a typical angel deal is an early-stage
round (seed or start-up) in the $100 000 to $1 million range, raised from six
or eight investors.
In contrast to the angel population, institutional venture capital funds,
the visible segment of the private equity market, invest primarily in the
later stage (figure 2), and consequently larger amounts, than their angel
counterparts (Timmons and Sapienza 1992, Meyer et al. 1995, Timmons
and Bygrave 1997). There are approximately 500 venture capital funds in
the USA that manage between $35 to $45 billion in total. Venture capital
funds invest between $3 and $4 billion annually in entrepreneurial
ventures, which is not a tremendous amount of capital considering the
appetite for cash of the entrepreneurial economy. As a point of reference,
on every business day more than $4 billion changes hands before noon on
the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Venture capital funds bankroll
less than 3,000 companies per year and many of these financings are for
ventures already in their portfolios. Venture capital investments in start-up
ventures number less than 300 per year. A typical round of financing from a
venture capital fund is a later-stage deal in the $2–$5 million range, with
average size of rounds steadily increasing (table 1). In 1994 the institutional
venture capital industry invested $2.7 billion in about 1000 companies. In
1995 they invested $3.8 billion in 1128 companies, or about $3.4 million per
deal. In 1996 a large increase in total investment dollars was not matched
with a proportional increase in the number of firms, with $10.1 billion
invested in 2163 companies or $4.6 million per deal. This trend continued
in 1997, with $12.2 billion to 2706 companies, $4.5 million per deal and in
the first quarter of 1998, $3.2 billion was invested in 700 ventures, a $4.6
million average per deal. Bygrave and Timmons (1992) cited this trend out

of the early seed and start-up phase and observed that the ‘venture’ seemed
to be eroded from the institutional venture capital industry.
The private investor and the institutional venture capital market, while
operating primarily in different stages, are complimentary in the sense that
the informal private investor market now provides the seed and start-up
capital that spawns new ventures. As the venture grows, it begins to
outstrip the ability of individual investors to supply adequate equity
capital. At this point, referred to as the ‘handoff’ and typically in the $2 to
$3 million range, professional venture capital funds may take interest in the
venture, particularly if the venture has demonstrated some success and has
progressed beyond the risk-laden seed and start-up stages of its development towards sustainable growth (Freear et al. 1994b). There are
indications that this complimentary relationship also extends to a twoway flow of investment opportunities. In this context, venture capital funds
will refer investment opportunities to angels with which they maintain a
professional relationship. These deals, deemed to be too early stage for the
venture capitalist, would meet the stage requirements of the private
investor. The reverse flow of information follows the complimentary
relationship and occurs when angel-financed firms mature to the stageappropriate venture capital level and are referred by the business angels to
the venture capital firms with which they have an established relationship.
The capital and information gap
For the established firm, financial markets supply a complete variety of
financing instruments, with these markets being relatively accessible and
the owner/manager is left to decide on the optimum mix of a financial
structure based on the cost of capital. For the high-growth entrepreneurial
firm, this supply assumption may not hold, causing systematic market
mismatches at particular stages of development of the fast-growth firm
(Brophy 1997). These imperfections, most notably in the informal venture
capital market, are well documented (Riding and Short 1987, Gaston 1989,
Mason and Harrison 1992, Harrison and Mason 1993, Landstrom 1993,
Freear et al. 1994b). Market imperfections lead to market inefficiencies,
and at least two inefficiencies in the equity financing market for
entrepreneurial ventures have been identified (Obermayer 1983). The first
is a capital gap between the needs of early-stage ventures and the suppliers
of early-stage capital. While estimates of the number of business start-ups

<-----Page 9----->110

JEFFREY E. SOHL

in the USA varies considerably, it appears that the number of high growth
entrepreneurial ventures that need equity financing is estimated to include
approximately 70,000 start-ups per year (5–10% of total start-ups) and
about 300,000 ventures growing faster than 20% per year, including 80,000
growing faster than 50% per year. The existence of private investors and
indications that capital is available, but quality deal flow is lacking (Mason
and Harrison 1994, Stevenson and Coveney 1994), tend to mitigate the
influence of the capital gap. However, estimates suggest that US
entrepreneurs need around $60 billion per year of patient, high-risk
value-added equity capital, over twice the venture financing currently
available (Sohl and Wetzel 1996). The second and equally important
market inefficiency is an information gap. An efficient market implies an
open and timely flow of reliable information concerning financing sources
and investment opportunities. In the informal venture capital market, with
the suppliers of capital seeking a degree of anonymity consistent with the
need to maintain reasonable deal flow, information flows very inefficiently
(Freear et al. 1994b, K+V Organisatie adviesbureau bv and Entrepreneurial Holding bv 1996, Mason and Harrison 1996). This capital and
information inefficiency results in a substantial funding gap in seed and
start-up financing stage (figure 2). The gap ranges from $100,000 at the low
end, the point at which the money raised from friends and families and
bootstrapping runs out, to the low seven figures on the high end, the time
when the venture becomes attractive enough to catch the eye of venture
fund investors.
Recently, there appears to be a new capital gap emerging in the US
equity markets, in addition to the gap outlined above. As the venture
capital industry has steadily progressed to larger and later stage financing
and the informal market has largely been active below the $1 million
threshold, an ensuing capital gap in the $1 to $3 million range is
developing. These larger capital requirements, but still considered earlystage deals, have spawned a new hybrid of angel financing–the angel
alliance. These alliances represent relatively large groups of business angels
and co-investment between private investors and early-stage financing
entities. Further discussion of the structure and characteristics of these
alliances is provided in the section on angel markets.
The attitudes, behaviour and characteristics of business
angels
The attitudes, behaviour and characteristics (the ABCs) of business angels
have been examined from a variety of perspectives. Angel profiles have
been assembled (Riding and Short 1987, Harrison and Mason 1992, Kelly
and Hay 1996a, Freear et al. 1997), and Mason and Harrison (1995b)
provide a cross-country comparison of these profiles. Recognizing the need
to examine sub-populations of business angels, Gaston (1989) presented
one of the earliest attempts to develop a number of individual categories
and market profiles. Freear et al. (1994a) subdivided the population of high
net worth individuals into three categories: business angels with experience

<-----Page 10----->THE EARLY-STAGE EQUITY MARKET IN THE USA

111

of investing in entrepreneurial ventures; interested potential investors with
no venture investment history but who expressed a desire to enter the
venture investment market; and uninterested potential investors who
under no circumstances would consider investing in entrepreneurial
ventures as part of their investment strategy. Based on a survey of 500
British angels, Stevenson and Coveney (1994) developed a six category
typology that considers entrepreneurial backgrounds and levels of
investment. The development of angel syndicates was noted by Mason
and Harrison (1995a) as they identified the archangel as the key individual
in the formation of angel syndicates. Sullivan (1991) provided an
examination of angels along the entrepreneur/non-entrepreneur dichotomy. Later work by Landstrom (1995) identified two extremes of angels,
passive investors who invest relatively small amounts of money and active
investors who appear to operate in a more professional atmosphere than
their passive counterparts. Restricting their analysis to serial investors
(individuals who have made at least three private investments) Kelly and
Hay (1996b) discuss two distinct investors: solo serial investors who invest
on their own all the time and syndicate serial investors who invest almost
exclusively with others. Wright et al. (forthcoming) extend the examination of serial investors to include serial entrepreneurs. Van Osnanbrugge
(1998) examines the differences between business angels and venture
capital firms in terms of deal origination, due diligence, monitoring and
exiting.
From this body of literature has emerged a general consensus of the
ABCs of business angels. In terms of deal structure, typical angel financing
is an early-stage round, either seed or start-up, in the $100 000 to $1 million
range, generally raised from six or eight investors. These co-investors
usually are trusted friends and business associates. In many cases there is a
lead investor that brings the investment opportunity to these co-investors
as a means of risk sharing and pooling of capital to round out the financing
requirements. These lead investors pre-screen the deal before presenting
the investment for consideration to the group. These informal groups are
amorphous in the sense that in subsequent investments different groups of
angels will coalesce, with a different lead investor, and with some overlap
between the previous syndicates. Since the informal investor market tends
to be in the form of regional networks of investors, information concerning
investment opportunities are derived from a variety of mostly regional
sources. The sources of deal flow within this regional market are friends,
business associates, and other business angels.
Most important to entrepreneurs seeking early-stage capital is that
angels have a higher propensity than venture capital funds to provide the
crucial smaller rounds of seed and start-up financing required by the earlystage venture. With this early money, business angels typically have longer
exit horizons than their venture fund counterparts and thus the capital they
provide is termed patient capital. Private investors are in the investment for
the long run, in the 5- to 7-year range. In the evaluation stage of the
investment, the private investor market is a relationship building market.
Since the seed and start-up investor is investing predominately in the
entrepreneur and this asset is a very mobile commodity, the vision of the

<-----Page 11----->112

JEFFREY E. SOHL

entrepreneur must be in congruence with the investment objective of the
business angel.
There is clearly a geographic factor in the informal investment process,
with the vast majority of private investors preferring investments close to
their principal place of residence, typically within 1 day’s travel time. This
localized nature of the market stems from several important behavioural
characteristics of angel investors. Business angels are usually cashed-out
entrepreneurs who have successfully harvested their own entrepreneurial
ventures. These individuals continue to yearn for the excitement of the
high-growth venture, but tend to eschew the sleepless nights associated
with running a start-up company. Thus, business angels frequently bring
expertise, knowledge and experience to the venture, all of which are more
easily tapped by the venture if the investor lives nearby. In this regard,
business angels are value-added investors, bringing both capital and knowhow to the investment. Second, private investors often take bigger risks or
accept lower rewards when they are attracted by the non-financial
characteristics of an entrepreneur’s proposal, such as the desire to create
jobs in their own communities. They are, quite literally, ‘adventure’
investors that seek a form of psychic income, in essence looking for an
attachment and a return. This psychic income is more easily derived if the
venture is located close to the investor. Third, angels follow a ‘kick the
tyres’ approach to venture investing. They are involved and bring
experience to the investment and are active investors. Thus, they like to
be close by to take advantage of these hands-on features of venture
investing. Angels often describe their activity as being a ‘mentor for
money’. With this close relationship, in terms of proximity and communication, entrepreneurs indicate that they consider this assistance and
business experience of the investor to be as valuable as the capital.
Other ABCs of private investors are that they typically invest in
ventures involved in markets and technologies with which they are familiar,
understandable in light of the high risk and illiquid nature of the
investment. The investment returns required by business angels are no
higher than the returns required by venture capital funds, an especially
noteworthy behaviour in light of the early stage of the angel’s participation
in comparison to their venture capital fund counterpart. However, this
attitude does not translate into a type of benevolent investor, angels are
opportunity seekers willing to consider mitigating circumstances. Deal
structure, as stated in the terms and conditions, tend to be briefer and more
informal than those of venture capital funds. Thus, what emerges is a
profile of a value-added, patient, early-stage regional investment population.
Angel markets
There are no directories of private investors and no public records of their
investment transactions. In addition, few vehicles exist for bringing
together potential investors and ventures seeking funds. Transaction costs
are high for the entrepreneur, raising private equity capital involves a costly

<-----Page 12----->THE EARLY-STAGE EQUITY MARKET IN THE USA

113

and time-consuming personal networking process, and for the investor,
with considerable time and dollars spent searching and evaluating
investment opportunities. The majority of active private investors report
that they have additional capital available to invest but limited, quality deal
flow is the primary constraint.
The private equity market tends to be regional in scope, rather than
local or national, and the informal venture capital market is more vibrant in
some regions of the USA than in others. The Silicon Valley area of
California and the Route 128 corridor around Boston, Massachusetts are
examples of active private investor markets. Emerging markets in the USA
include North Carolina, Colorado, the Pacific Northwest, Austin, Texas
and central Utah. For the institutional venture capital industry, investments in 1996 and 1997 indicate that California, Massachusetts, Texas,
Colorado and Florida are the top five states over the 2-year period (Coopers
and Lybrand 1996, 1997). Note the close parallel between the informal and
formal market, supporting the complimentary nature of the two markets in
terms of capital and information.
In light of the increasing entrepreneurial activity in the USA, various
dimensions of the angel market are emerging. These dimensions,
collectively forming the informal market, are labelled according to the
predominant mechanism for bringing together entrepreneurs seeking
capital and business angels searching for investment opportunities. The
first, and least organized, can be termed the uncover market. Access to this
segment is dominated by referrals by gatekeepers, such as other
entrepreneurs, lawyers and service providers, who often provide that
crucial initial introduction. Tapping into this market is often a random
occurrence and a time consuming process punctuated by many misguided
approaches. While accurate estimates of the size and scale of the informal
market do not exist, it is surmised that this market is a substantial segment
of the informal venture capital market. The second market dimension,
increasing in visibility and access compared to the uncover market, is the
collection of venture capital clubs and meeting organizations that are
scattered around the country. These clubs provide a variety of services and
opportunities to contact private investors. They provide some educational
opportunities for investors and entrepreneurs and often meet on a regular
basis. Some of these clubs may consist of small numbers of angels, typically
less than 10, that invest together. Others may provide a periodic venue for
investors and entrepreneurs to meet informally or act as a resource for
entrepreneurs to sharpen their presentation skills and business plans. At
the present time, these clubs number over 100 in the USA.
The third model, the angel alliance, is a relatively recent phenomenon.
These regional based groups of veteran and novice investors pool resources
and know-how, review deals and co-invest as a consortium. Distinguishing
characteristics of these alliances are size, visibility and entry mechanism.
These are large groups of angels, sometimes in excess of 100 private
investors. The alliances are visible in that their existence is relatively known
and they provide the ‘storefront’ for the private investor while protecting
their anonymity. In one form, the alliance meets on a regular basis with
deal origination and access to the alliance through one or more members of

<-----Page 13----->114

JEFFREY E. SOHL

the alliance. An alliance member brings an investment opportunity to the
alliance under the condition that the member is intending to invest in the
venture. Deal evaluation is accomplished through a venture forum format.
The forum provides the venue for the pre-screened entrepreneur to present
the business plan to the group of angels. After participation in the forum,
investors interested in the opportunity begin to coalesce into syndicates for
the investment under consideration and begin the due diligence process.
Other forms of angel alliances include a more formal structure with an
investment entity (with an independent pool of capital) as the ‘storefront’.
This organization maintains an angel alliance as a co-investment mechanism for the pooling of capital to round out the financing requirements of the
venture. In addition, the entity fulfills the role of finding quality deals and
monitoring the post-investment performance. Due diligence is undertaken
by the individual investor as well as by the organization. This latter form of
the angel alliance tends to invest capital in the $1 to $3 million range and
function primarily in the second, and more recent, capital gap in the USA.
The fourth model of the angel market is the matching network or
business introduction service. The matching networks represent the first
attempt to increase the efficiency of the early-stage market by providing a
mechanism for investors to evaluate opportunities and entrepreneurs to
gain access to business angels. The first matching network, founded at the
University of New Hampshire in 1979, at that time called the Venture
Capital Network, provided the model for the matching network that is still
followed today. These are typically not-for-profit, university-affiliated
networks that provide entrepreneurs with access to private investors, while
maintaining investor anonymity. A key feature of the matching network is
an established connection to the investor and entrepreneur community in
their respective region. Investors and entrepreneurs join for a fixed period
of time and a flat rate. Typical requirements include the submission of an
executive summary of the business plan by the entrepreneur. Investors
self-certify as accredited investors and list investment preferences,
including size, stage and location. The network screens for those business
plans that match investor criteria and forwards an anonymous copy of those
business plans satisfying the criteria to the individual investor. The
investor, if interested, contacts the network for information on the
entrepreneur. At this time the entrepreneur is also provided with
information on the investor. The network facilitates the introduction and
then exits from the process. All subsequent contact is between the investors
and the entrepreneur directly. In addition to the matching service,
networks provide education, to both the entrepreneur and investor, on
investing in the early-stage market, market trends, and similar timely
investment information. These networks also organize venture forums,
where pre-screened entrepreneurs (who are members of the matching
network) are given the opportunity to present their business plan to groups
of early-stage investors. At the present time there are about a dozen
matching networks scattered around the USA. These networks have
approximately 200 investor and entrepreneur members each. In terms of
facilitating early-stage investments, statistics indicate yield rates, defined as
the probability of a network member entrepreneur receiving equity

<-----Page 14----->THE EARLY-STAGE EQUITY MARKET IN THE USA

115

financing, to be in the 10 to 15% range for the matching service and
approximately 40% for the venture forum venue.
The fifth segment of the angel market, and the most recent, is the
electronic matching network. These are Internet-based networks that
attempt to mirror the matching networks through the medium of the
Internet. To date about 30 of these electronic networks have sprouted on
the World Wide Web. Unlike the matching network described above, these
electronic networks typically do not engage in any educational function nor
use the venture forum paradigm. Requirements for the entrepreneur cover
the spectrum from the submittal of a two-page executive summary to
detailed business plans. Investor certification is required, but criteria for
certification varies. Electronic networks have been largely unsuccessful to
date, less than 1% of equity capital raised in 1997 was harvested on-line
(Private Equity Week 1998). There are several factors contributing to the
present lack of success of on-line matching. First, angel investing is a faceto-face phenomenon and no amount of electronic interfacing, in the present
form, will replace a seasoned investor’s ability and desire to ‘kick the tyres’
on a deal. This personal side of the investment is a contributing factor in
making the market exciting for the investor. Second, electronic networks
have failed to address the regional nature of the market. Strategies of many
electronic networks, to develop a national angel market operating with one
platform and structure, fail to recognize this important regional component. Third, simply accessing capital will not serve the needs of
entrepreneurs. The value-added component that business angels and
venture capital firms bring to a company after an investment is as critical as
the capital. The future for electronic networks most probably lies in
providing an efficient method for deal screening. Unfortunately, in many,
if not all, of the current initiatives, a lack of understanding of the many
components of the angel market, resulting in poor strategic selection, is
hampering penetration of electronic networks into the early-stage equity
market.
Conclusion
Several trends are developing, with each having potential impacts on the
early-stage equity market. The first is the globalization of the angel capital
concept. Spearheaded by the work of Harrison and Mason in the UK,
informal venture capital markets are emerging in the Nordic Countries,
Holland, Austria, Germany and Australia. Recent initiatives in Japan and
South Korea are attempting to promote private equity investment,
although cultural barriers remain substantial. EBAN, the European
Business Angel Network, is a new project designed to increase the
efficiency of the Northern European informal market. These initiatives are
not US–international alliances, but rather independent initiatives with a
focus on regional economic development. Researchers can learn a great deal
by studying these emerging markets and assist in their development
through application of the concepts developed based on US and UK
business angel research.

<-----Page 15----->116

The second trend is the burgeoning number of successful entrepreneurs, many funded with business angel capital, who have cashed-out
and are ready to join the ranks of private investors. These potential
investors have unique characteristics and requirements. Uncovering
incentives to bring this new capital to bear on the myriad of
entrepreneurial activity sweeping the USA is a major challenge. To this
end, and to better understand the current private investor market,
longitudinal studies need to be undertaken. While surveys represent a
cross-sectional ‘snap shot’ of the market and have been the primary
vehicle for knowledge generation in angel research to date, these surveys
need to be supplemented with longitudinal research. Through the
tracking of private investment from the point of introduction, data on
both the successes and failures can be identified, with each possessing
valuable market information.
The third trend is the entrepreneurial mind set percolating in the USA.
The dream of yesterday, to own your own home, has been replaced by the
desire to own your own business. More and more entrepreneurs are
viewing these businesses not as the local lifestyle company, but rather the
high-growth venture. To service this increasing population of entrepreneurs, information on the portals to entry to the early-stage equity market
must be provided. On the pragmatic side, the USA is sorely lacking in
information on angel network activity. A directory of networks, alliances
and clubs, similar to the directory for the UK, needs to developed. The
listing, containing valuable information on fee structure, the number of
investments considered and funded, including the terms and conditions of
the investment, and related information, would provide both a service to
entrepreneurs seeking equity capital and a rich data base on business angel
activity.
A fourth trend is the continued strengthening of the relationship
between the venture capital industry and private investor market. The
synergy between these two capital resources should continue to be mined.
The angel deal of today is the institutional investment of tomorrow. To the
extent that there can be additional dialogue, more mutual two-way deal
flow, and potential co-investment activity, the entrepreneurial community
will benefit. Investment activity of the institutional venture capital industry
is available. From this base, through backtracking the venture capital
investment to the origination of the deal in the angel market, valuable
research can be conducted on both angel activity and the synergy between
the two markets.
Fifth, angel investing is a face-to-face phenomenon, and this
behavioural characteristic appears to be a firm construct of the early-stage
market. Electronic interfacing, most likely as a method of deal screening,
may yet have a place in the market, but certainly not in the current form or
strategy. Research on the behavioural side, using the existing agency theory
approach as an avenue of initial inquiry, could probe deeper into the
relationship between entrepreneur and investor. A taxonomy of models of
angel investing, with a focus on the process of the investment decision from
origination to conclusion, would provide valuable insights on the earlystage market structure.

<-----Page 16----->THE EARLY-STAGE EQUITY MARKET IN THE USA

Finally, while isolated examples exist, the nation’s universities are
poised to experience a more widespread role in fostering deal flow. The link
between the university laboratory and the marketplace should be enhanced
through more formalized relations with the business angel community. For
an efficient market originating in the university, clear ties between the
technology, the entrepreneur and the investor must be present to get the
technologies to market. Clearly, the university represents a fertile ground
for innovation and deal flow by providing a climate and support for the
academic scientist with the high-impact innovation with the potential to
produce commercial products. The entrepreneur wraps the business
around the innovation and develops the high growth venture. The
university contributes through developing both the entrepreneurial talent
and the skilled labour pool to work in these entrepreneurial ventures. The
investor supplies the equity capital and the know-how, the value-added
investment, for the high growth start-up. The ingredients and individual
components exist in many university settings, but lacking is the linkages
between these components. Research on the models to develop and
facilitate these academic scientist, entrepreneur and investor triads would
contribute to an enhanced role for the university in the entrepreneurial
economy.
In the roughly 15 years of research on informal venture capital much
has been learned. However, the private investor market is still largely
misunderstood, inefficient, and under-researched. The more the literature
sheds light on business angels, the more research questions arise. However,
through the tenet of applying academic rigour to an applied area of study,
the research will continue to make progress and provide valuable
information to entrepreneurs, investors and public policymakers. While
the day when every deserving entrepreneur will have access to private
equity and investors will have a reasonable flow of quality investment
opportunities is not close at hand, sustainable additions to the knowledge
base is a goal within reach.
