Activities of Entrepreneurs Establishing
New Ventures

The' credibility ga0 is not often cited as a problem by
marketers; for t/i/s reason marketing texts pay littie or
no attention to it Yet, for the entrepreneurial marketer
it may well be the most fundamental marketing
challenge. Addressing the credibility gap may not have
received any previous research interest, but tlieoretical
support for its relevance abounds. Risk and its corollary,
making use of trust, have been seen as quintessentially
entrepreneurial activities. If they do epitomise
entrepreneurship, then
surely, studying
how
entrepreneurs use trust ought to provide valuable
insights into what entrepreneurs do.
While tiiere is increasing research into trust,

exploratory nature of this investigation.
The search for trust in this investigation focuses on
entrepreneur^ usage of elements of the marketing mix.
Respondents are asked about what they have done, why
t/iey have taken that course of action and what the
outcomes have been.
We find tliat there is a wide panoply of ways in which
entrepreneurs use trust, for example ' enthusiasni and
'sliared valued. The latter two are particularly important
because tiiey can lead to trust in situations where there
may not already be existing relationships (tlie most

metJwds entrepreneurs use to build trust - which tliey
can then use to mitigate customer^ perception of risk.

However while there are numerous studies on taist in the fields of marketing
and organisational behaviour e.g. Moorman, Deshpande and Zaltman (1993) and
Mayer et al (1995) this is not the case in entrepreneurship research. Moreover, it
has recently been said that' entrepreneurial activity can be considered in terms
of: reassuring potential principals (customers) of their trustworthiness, Shapiro
(1987:636).
This paper starts with the presentation of a model of trust based on the
existing literature on trust which is primarily from the fields of marketing and
organisation behaviour. Since our interest is the marketing activities of
entrepreneurs establishing new ventures, we then present the research question
which provided the focus for our research. It should be stressed that the focus of
our interest is the establishment of new ventures (start-ups), for this recison we
refer to the principal(s) as entrepreneurs - we consider this appellation to
appropriate, particularly since our respondents were selected on the basis that
they were not going into self-employment but rather had the intention to grow.
Subsequently we show how the initial model of trust we presented can be
adapted in the light of the findings from our research. We hope that the adapted
model reflects more realistically the issues surrounding trust facing the
entrepreneur. Of course some of the findings may be of relevance to researchers
in other managerial fields.
The Trust Model
The model which is developed below addresses the following issues:
1.
2.
3.

On what bases should the customer trust the marketer? We distinguish
between the entrepreneur^ characteristics; the rule of law and how they
behave.
Specifically in terms of the latter we then consider how customers find out
whether the marketer is trustworthy. This is may be through a combination
of social learning, self-disclosure or reputation.
This research deals with entrepreneurs who are establishing new ventures
and focuses on their management of trust in their marketing activities.
Thus the model focuses on why others may consider the entrepreneurs
themselves to be trustworthy (based on their behaviour). The answer is
because of a possible combination of antecedents to trust specifically,
ability, integrity, and benevolence.

The following three pareigraphs summarise the key issues, which are
subsequently considered in more detail.
Why should one individual trust another? This question has been approached
from three distinct perspectives: bases of trust antecedent factors of trust and
fomis of trust The fundamental distinctions between these approaches are as
follows. The' bases of trust approach explains that trust may exist due to the aile
of law or shared personal characteristics; moreover, trust may develop due to

<-----Page 2----->The Role of Tmst

751

interpersonal interaction.
The' fonn^ of trust approach shares some common ground with the above,
but the essential difference appears to be that it allows for the existence of
' affect-based trust (i.e. people may trust each other because of emotional bonds).
The' antecedent factor^ approach appears to be the most holistic of the three
since it seeks to identify specific antecedent factors which may account for the
existence of trust between two people. The approach has advantages since it is
possible to identify different antecedent factors depending on the situation being
studied. In organisational behaviour, for example, benevolence, integrity and
ability have been identified. The discussion below integrates material from the
three different approaches.
On What Bases Should the Customer Trust the Marketer?
The first issue Figure 1 seeks to resolve is why should a customer trust a
marketer? This is answered by identifying the bases to trust i.e. a customer could
trust the marketer because of the' rule of laW (institutional based trust) and/or
because of the trustee as an individual (Luhmann 1979). In the latter instance,
the bases for trusting are specifically the trusteed inherent characteristics
(characteristic based trust) or their previous behaviour, referred to as process
based taist by Zucker (1986).
Characteristic Based Tmst
Characteristic-based trust only pertains to individuals; it cannot be acquired in
the way that the other two forms of trust can be obtained. Its presence or
absence is a cognitive factor between the focal individual and the third party. It
exists if the third party feels that there is a social similarity between themselves
and the focal individual. So, for example, an exchange partner may consider the
ethnic background of their suppliers/customers to be an important factor in
exchange since common social and cultural nomis may make a satisfactory
exchange easier to achieve.
It should be noted that characteristic-based trust is a commodity which exists
according to the inherent characteristics of an individual and their perception by
the wider social environment
Process Based Tmst
The association between trust and long-term relationships (process based
trust) is well-documented by Good (1988:33), who emphasises that exchanges
requiring trust will not be ahistoHcal instances, i.e. they will not take place on a
one-off bcisis.
Social exchange theory also shows the association between trust and longterm exchange. According to Blau (1964), social exchange is embedded in tmst.
'Social exchange, therefore entails supplying benefits that create diffuse future
obligations...since the recipient is the one who decides when and how to
reciprocate a favour, or whether to reciprocate at all so social exchange requires
tmst ...typically however social exchange relations evolve in a slow process,
starting with minor transactions in which little trust is required because little risk

is involved and in which both the partners can prove their trustworthiness (Blau
1964:454).
Where, at the start of a relationship, individuals are dealing with strangers,
they do not know to what extent the other party can be trusted and there is little
basis for trust Scanzoni (1979) suggests that tnist is unlikely to appear early in a
relationship because there would be little basis in past experience for its
development In these situations it is posited that parties will exchange on a basis
of little risk and therefore little need for trust; as parties prove themselves to be
taistworthy, more trust will be placed in them. The following analysis considers
the factors at play in the development of interpersonal trust witiiin long-tenn
exchange relationships.
Fonns of Trust
From the preceding argument it may seem that trust is simply a' cognitive
construct which may develop through an acquisition of information. According to
Luhmann, familiarity is the precondition for taist (i.e. trust requires a degree of
cognitive familiarity or knowledge of the object being trusted). The extent of this
knowledge lies between total ignorance and complete infonnation. The
manifestation of trust on the cognitive level of experience is reached when social
actors no longer need or want any further evidence or rational reasons for
placing their trust in third parties.
However, the value of research which deals with the' fonn^ of trust is that it
distinguishes between' affect-based trust and' cognition-based trust (McAllister
1995). The emotional base of trust is argued to be complementary to the
cognitive base. This consists of the emotional bond among those who take part
in a relationship. The emotional basis of trust exists in interpersonal trust
emotional trust can also be present in public or institutional taist since the
public can feel indignant about the abuse of power. The emotional content of
taist is just as reciprocal and intersubjective as its cognitive base.
The discussion below considers how individuals find out whether or not
others are to be tnisted. We consider three specific methods, social leaming, selfdisclosure and reputation.
How Does the Customer Find Out Whether the Entrepreneur is
Trustworthy?
There are a number of different methods individuals can use to find out
whether potential tnistees are, in fact trustworthy.
Social Leaming
The diagram shows that one of the methods the trustor can use, through
interpersonal interaction, to find out whether someone is trustworthy is' social
leaming, where trust evolves out of past experience and prior interaction
(Rempel et al. 1991). Exchange partners make dispositional attributions of each
other in teniis of their reliability and dependability. Having identified how a
customer can find out that the marketer is trustworthy, the next issue is what

<-----Page 5----->754

Haider Ali and Sue Birley

does the customer look for in order to identify trustworthiness? This is answered
in the next box which identifies ' ability, ' integrit}" and ' benevolencd as
antecedent factors to trust
The final box shows that when all of the above have been answered it may be
possible to engage in a trusting exchange i.e. the customer's perceived risk is
overcome, this is referred to as the behavioural enactment of trust In the
diagram it is shown to be linked to all three bases to trust i.e. the reason why a
customer enters into a trusting exchange is because of their trust in the aile of
law, the sellef" s characteristics and past behaviour. Of course the extent to which
each basis contributes to the overall level of trust in each purchase will vary.
Furthermore, the diagram shows that the demonstration and development of
trust between exchange parties is an on-going and iterative process.
Self-Disclosure
Self-disclosure theory provides a model for explaining how individuals are to
acquire information about the trustworthiness of their interaction partners. Trust
develops gradually through repeated encounters involving the potential for
rejection or ridicule (Altman and Taylor 1974; Rubin 1973). However, if agents
protect themselves from the risks oif dealing with one another, they eliminate
diagnostic opportunities for leaming about the dispositional qualities of the
partner that relate to trust In order to find out that the other person can be
trusted they must be given the opportunity to show that they do not care
(Strickland 1958).
Reputation and Process-Based Trust
Process-based trust develops as individuals demonstrate their trustworthiness
to exchange partners through concrete actions. Process-based trust cannot be
transferred from one individual to another; it is acquired within the marketplace
by a particular person, institution or brand name with a reputation. The
definition of reputation offered by Zucker is: a symbolic representation of past
exchange history; brand name is a deliberately constructed proxy for reputation
(Zucker 1986:62).
On what Personal Bases (Antecedents) do Others Consider Entrepreneurs
to be Trustworthy?
Mayer et al (1995) provide an explanation as to what the trustor looks for in a
trustee. In their model, trust has specific antecedents which are' ability,' integrity'
and ' benevolence. Benevolence refers to the extent to which the trustee is
believed to want to do good to the trustor and thereby qualifies the relationship
between the trustor and the trustee. Integrity refers to the trustor perceiving that
the trustee adheres to a set of principles that the trustor finds acceptable.
In terms of ability, Mayer et al. (1995) draw the following distinction: an
individual may be entrusted to do analytic tasks related to his or her technical
area; the individual may not be trusted to initiate contact with an important
customer. Therefore trust is domain specific (i.e. people have ability in different

<-----Page 6----->The Role of Trust

755

areas). Ability they consider to be composed of aptitude, training and experience.
Like previous commentators, Mayer et al. (1995) make the important point
that the demonstration of trust requires there to be risk taking by the truston
' Behavioural trust is the assuming of risk (Mayer et al. 1995:724).
Behavioural Trust
Behaviourally, to trust is to act as if the uncertain future actions of others are
indeed going to be certain, in situations where the violation of the expectations
will yield negative consequences (Lewis and Weigert 1985:971). Such
demonstration of trust builds taist in the trustee and as such encourages them
to act in a trustworthy manner' we taist them (tnistors) more because trustimplying behaviour contributes to the emotional and cognitive foundation of
tnist (Lewis and Weigert 1985:464).
Research Agenda
Since entrepreneurship is associated with' risk and entrepreneurial activity can
involve passing some of that risk onto other people, logically, in these latter
instances entrepreneurship must also involve getting those people to taist you.
Furthermore, the amount of risk someone is willing to take in another person
depends on how much they trust them. There may well be an iterative process of
manipulating the levels of risk and trust in a new venture, so that an equilibrium
is reached when the entrepreneur only asks others to take as much risk in the
venture as the amount of tnist they have in him.
Given our view of entrepreneurship as a process which seeks to arrive at an
equilibrium, we define the domain of this research was: How do entrepreneurs
manage risk and trust?
At the start-up stage of any venture, when entrepreneurs are trying to acquire
customers, among other resources, the management of risk and trust is of crucial
importance. It is at this time that the venture will have least credibility with the
target customers and, if sufficient credibility is not established, the venture will be
still-bom. For this reason the research focuses on the acquisition of customers.
The question driving this research was: how do entrepreneurs explicitly maneige
customer-perceived risk at the start of a new venture, and does trust play a role?
The question is phrased in such a way that the focus of the study becomes
the process of new venture management Our interest is in what entrepreneurs
actually do. Secondly, because we are interested in their motivations for their
actions, we restrict our interest to entrepreneur^ explicit management of CPR
This is an important methodological issue; it means that we will not read into
entrepreneur^ descriptions of their actions as to whether they are managing risk
and trust The identification of customer-perceived risk and the need to use trust
must be explicit in entrepreneur^ own words. One of the reasons for taking this
approach is to reduce the chances for the researcher' finding evidence which
may not really be there. This should not deny the value of future research
looking into the implicit management of risk and trust

<-----Page 7----->756

Haider Ali and Sue Birley

Having established the research question, which research design should be
used to answer it? Material for the development of hypotheses or selection of
themes can obviously only come from existing research; for this reason, the
following section explains which variables may be relevant and where the search
for evidence may prove to be fruitful.
Method

Since this was an exploratory study which sought to find out in entrepreneur^
own terms how they used trust in their marketing activities, in-depth interviews
were undertaken. In an inductive enquiry, even the basis for representativeness is
not known, so there has been no attempt to control for any variables. Instead
emphasis has been put on acquiring a diverse sample of respondents who could
provide a large amount of rich detail. There were 40 respondents, who were
selected on bases identified by Eisenhardt (1989) and Yin (1984), who says that
cases can be selected because similar results are predicted (literal replication) or
to generate different results for predictable reasons (theoretical replication).
This method of sampling is synergistic with the theory building objective of
our research. The existence of some similar Ccises and some contreisting ones,
makes it possible to understand the single casefinding,generalisations can then
be made from one case to another on the basis of a match to the underiying
theory and not to a larger universe (Miles and Hubemian 1994). Given this
method for sample selection, the findings cannot be generalised to a specific
population (Yin 1984), instead, the aim is to generalise to theoretical
propositions:' the investigatof-s goal is to expand and generalise theories (analytic
generalisation) and not to enumerate frequencies , Yin (1984:21).
Indeed it should be noted that random selection of respondents is not to be
preferred. According to Miles and Huberman (1994), theoretical sampling means
that' choices of informants, episodes and interactions are driven by a conceptual
question not by a concern for representativeness..! Miles and Huberman
(1994:29).
Therefore, because of the lack of existing theory relating risk and trust to
marketing in an entrepreneurial context this research is inductive, because of
the need to develop theory the sample is a heterogeneous one and it is for this
reason that the research method is principally qualitative.
Adapting the Trust Model to Entrepreneurship
The findings below deal with the usage of trust to mitigate CPR There are four
key constructs which we have identified which could be added to the taist model,
these are shown in Figure 2. ' Enthusiasni we argue should be considered to be
one of the personal traits which contribute to characteristic baised trust
' j^ociatiori and' shared visiori we consider to be two separate antecedents to
trust i.e. they are two possible reasons why others should trust the entrepreneur.
Finally ' fot^givenesS is critical for understanding why trusting behaviour may
persist even where trust has been abused, this is important for entrepreneurs

who may find that they abuse trust, without malevolent intent and need to
maintain otheri trust
Enthusiasm
The word' enthusiasni, as an important characteristic of a finri s management
was not a construct for which respondents were specifically asked and given the
attention paid to it by them, it is considered that it is sufficiently important to be
analysed further.
The role of enthusiasni is most succinctly put forward by respondent 31, who
had used the services of an experienced associate to find out from large
corporations whether or not they would be interested in developing the venture.
While the associate is described as being competent the trial was not successful:
' Pt this stage a substitute for credibility and expertise is enthusiasni.
This section investigates the meaning of the term' enthusiasni and the role it
plays in acquiring customers. The question which arises is whether' enthusiasni
is related to risk and trust or whether it is like' inertid, and is a construct which
exists outside the realms of risk and trust
What is Enthusiasm?
Unlike concepts such as risk and trust which have a substantial literature
supporting them, there appears to be very little published material on
' enthusiasni. For a definition, the dictionary is the only source for a definition:
'andent and lively interest or eagemes^ , Collins Dictionary (1987). The reference
to someone who is enthusiastic being' lively and' eagef seems to be in line with
one respondent s understanding of the tenn' enthusiasni:' I think that [failure to
generate interest] is just because we didri t have somebody with enough oomph
to get ther^ , I think that [the failure was due to] his approach, which was,' can I
come and talk to you about.
What Role Does Entiiusiasm Play?
From the definition above it can be sunnised that enthusiasm demonstrates
the marketer^ personal interest in the product With a multitudinous array of
products available to the customer, we argue that it is the enthusiasm of the
marketer which tells the customer that the product being promoted is worth
further consideration.
In the first instance, prior to making a purchase, enthusicism thus encouraiges
further interest on the part of the customer. It should be stressed that taking
note of a product and finding out more about it do not require taist on the part
of the customer, since such activity does not require the taking of a risk.
According to one respondent enthusiasm is an altemative to expertise and
credibility. The customer may or may not consider that the entrepreneur has
credibility or expertise; however, their willingness to consider what is being sold,
to take more than a cursory interest will depend on their perception of the
marketed s enthusiasm.
The question remains as to whether enthusiasm will also lead to customers

<-----Page 10----->TheRoleofTmst

759

making a purchase. The central tenet of existing literature is that risk cannot be
undertaken if there is no trust In this respect there are three ways in which
enthusiasm may be categorised:
1.
2.
3.
4.

enthusiasm is a component of an antecedent to trust
enthusiasm is a component of a basis of trust
enthusicism is neither a component to an antecedent to taist nor a basis of
taist
enthusiasm may or may not be a component to an antecedent or basis of
taist depending on the context.

The section below considers the theoretical reasons as to whether enthusiasm is
a component of an antecedent to taist or a basis of taist Whatever the
conclusions reached in that discussion, it can be said here that enthusiasm may
play a role in overcoming customer^ inertia and lethargy and lead to them
becoming more aware of the product/service than they would otherwise have
been. In this respect' enthusiasni is an important characteristic of the people
involved in a new venture, however in this function it is not related to risk and
taist
A Link Between Entiiusiasm and Trust?
It should be noted that in the organisation behaviour literature there has
been no reference made to enthusiaism as an antecedent to taist The
antecedents to which Mayer et al. (1995) refer are ability, integrity and
benevolence. Benevolence refers to the extent to which the taistee is believed to
want to do good to the taistor and thereby qualifies the relationship between the
taistor and the taistee. Integrity refers to the taistor perceiving that the taistee
adheres to a set of principles that the taistor finds acceptable.
According to an organisational behaviour-based model of taist (Mayer et al.
1995), there is no justification for ar^guing that enthusicism is an antecedent to
trust Nevertheless, this should not discount a role for enthusiasm in a marketing
or entrepreneurial context The reeison is due to the inherent difference between
the nature of dyadic ties within an organisation as opposed to dyadic ties
between independent individuals or organisations.
For example, within organisations, the interaction between individuals is
indiscrete and ongoing: at one extreme, employee contracts may require contact
between individuals. Employees do not need to be enthusicistic about their work
for contact to take place.
In contrast in a marketing context interaction is discrete: what contact there
is has to be deliberate and requires pro-active motivation on the part of
individuals for it to take place. In this framework, enthusiasm may be important
because, if the marketer demonstrates enthusiasm which is shared by the
customer, this may be constaied as a sharing of values and may over a period of
time lead to taist
Qualifying the level of enthusiasm is important because where both parties

<-----Page 11----->760

Haider Ali and Sue Birley

have low levels of enthusiasm then although vision is shared there is no
motivation to spend time together. Secondly, where one party has high
enthusiasm and the other low enthusiasm there are no shared values. It is only
when a high level of enthusiasm is shared that values will be shared and
enthusiasm may work as an antecedent to trust
The enthusiasm of entrepreneurs can only be relevant where they are dealing
with small numbers of customers (i.e. business customers or consumers who
were placing orders of relatively high value).
Entrepreneurs use enthusiasm to share their vision and values with their
target customers. Enthusiasm we would argue is a personal trait some people in
terms of personality are enthusiastic. We would argue that just as the psychology
literature on trust identified that people who are perceived as' opeii and' trusting
are likely to be trusted, so people who are' enthusiastic^ may be perceived as
trustworthy.
At the start of a venture entrepreneurs may not only have to contend with
CPR they may also have to overcome customer^ apathy or inertia - in order to
do this enthusiasm can be important Moreover enthusiasm can be a component
of characteristic based trust
Association
' jAssociatiorl is a means of acquiring trust Entrepreneurs can identify which
organisations, corporations and individuals already have credibility amongst their
target customers and by association confer such credibility onto themselves.
Thus association is a means of bringing credibility from the extemal environment
into the organisation.
Branding can be used to distinguish the entrepreneur- s offering and also to
acquire trust Unlike established brands, new brands launched by new ventures
have little or no track-record and the endeavour is towards developing a
reputation. One of the ways in which entrepreneurs can acquire such reputation
is to have their brand in close proximity to established brands which already
enjoy credibility amongst customers - this is an example of association serving as
an antecedent to trust Customers are willing to trust the brand because it is
associated with other credible brands.
In terms of contribution to theory it should be noted that' associatiori does
not fall into the antecedents to trust already identified in the literature (e.g. Mayer
et al. (1995)).' Associatiori does not arise out of integrity, benevolence, or ability.
It simply arises from being in the right place. For the new venture, therefore,
there may be a fourth antecedent to taist namely' associatiori.
Shared Vision
It is important to distinguish between vision and values, we argue that the
former are a component of abilit:^'.
It has been acknowledged (e.g. Mayer et al. (1995) and Morgan and Hunt
(1994)), that an antecedent to taist are 'shared valued , which in the Mayer et al
(1995) argument fall within the wider category of ' integrity. Material from

<-----Page 12----->The Role of Taist

761

respondents suggests that in an entrepreneurial context trustors can taist
trustees because they both share the same vision. Such vision can relate to what
are considered to be appropriate elements of the marketing mix and future
trends in the market place. Moreover, unlike shared values which are a
component of integrity, we argue' shared visiori is a component of abilit^J' (i.e.
customers or channel intermediaries trust the entrepreneur because he
demonstrates his ability by presenting a vision of the future which is in
accordance with theirs).
There are three cases from the interviews which lend credence to this notion.
A leisure venture gained support from a govemment agency, because they felt
that the time had come for this idea. In contrast a potential publisher had not
found support to date, because potential advertisers did not consider that the
concept to have any value. For some manufacturers, there are two groups of
customers, the retailer and the ultimate consumer. The first person the
entrepreneur deals with is the retailer. Retailer^ trust will be obtained if they
share the entrepreneur- s vision as to which elements of the marketing mix will
secure sales. The distributors of a snack-food product felt that their product
would be a very important development in the snack-food industry and agreed to
distribute it They also wrote letters to potential investors and other stakeholders
supporting the venture.
Another set of examples which supports the notion of' shared visiori arises
from the decision to use branding by some respondents. In some instances
entrepreneur^ decisions regarding branding were influenced by what they felt
would conform to the vision of their channel intermediaries.
Entrepreneurs who use shared vision/values also need to consider that this
means of getting others to trust you requires others to do the sharing.
Entrepreneurs will therefore need to search to find such people.
Forgiveness
Situations where customers are willing to forgive entrepreneurs fall into two
categories:
1. Where the core benefit does not appear to be affected
2. Where customers believe the marketer is acting out of benevolence and
integrity and in the long-run will provide a quality product or service.
This shows that the relationship between risk and taist is not as straightforward
cis some of the existing literature presents it Evidence from respondents suggests
that even where trust hcis been ' abused the customer is willing to carry on
taisting - rather than what existing principles would suggest - that customers
would take their custom away.
For entrepreneurs to understand why customers forgive and to what extent
they can benefit from the existence of forgiveness is a very important issue. This
is because lack of resources means that entrepreneurs may well have to make
compromises on quality and yet retain the goodwill of their customers.

<-----Page 13----->762

Haider Ali and Sue Birley

Bitner (1990) finds that employee explanations, offers to compensate and the
appearance of the physical environment can detennine how customers perceive
the causes of service failure. In particular Bitner (1990) hypothesised that' less
control is attributed to the firm when the service failure occurs in an organised
service environment than when the event occurs in a disorganised environment"
Bitneretal. (1990:73).
Thus in instances of service failure customers can be forgiving, i.e. even
though promises have not been kept they may still trust the marketer if they feel
the failure was beyond the control of the marketer. In the entrepreneurial context
the latter may be due to the age of the business.
Conclusions
This paper has identified the role of' enthusiasni ,' associatiori,' shared visioii
and' forgiveness , as constaicts which are relevant to the understanding of taist
in an entrepreneurial context Of course these constmcts may play an important
role for an understanding of trust on other contexts as well.
The notion of forgiveness is an important contribution because the abuse of
tmst need not necessarily lead to a breakdown of tmsting behaviour and the
situations in which forgiveness comes into play is important for those who rely

have also explained why enthusiasm may be useful to entrepreneurs in situations

antecedents to tmst in some but not all situations.
