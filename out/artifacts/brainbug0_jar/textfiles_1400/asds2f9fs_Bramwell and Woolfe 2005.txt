Universities have emerged as central actors in the knowledge-based economy. No
longer confined to their traditional roles of teaching and conducting primary research, the
famously successful examples of Stanford University and the growth of Silicon Valley,
and MIT and the development of the ICT corridor of Route 128 indicate that they are
increasingly viewed as key drivers of innovation and “major agents of economic growth”.
Consequently, many policymakers view research universities as “knowledge factories”
for the new economy with largely untapped reservoirs of potentially commercializable
knowledge waiting to be taken up by firms and applied (Wolfe 2005b, 1). However, this
overly mechanistic view of the process by which basic scientific research is transformed
into economically viable products demonstrates not only a misconception of the
commercialization process itself, but also of what universities can and should be expected
to do. It is the flow of knowledge that drives innovation, but knowledge transfer and
knowledge spillover within a regional economy is a fluid, iterative, and complex process
involving many different actors. Universities tend to be followers of technological
innovation rather than leaders - “catalysts” rather than “drivers” (Doutriaux 2003).
While the presence of a leading research university in a community in itself is not
sufficient to stimulate strong regional economic growth, they can make significant
contributions to the process (Wolfe 2005b).
Current research on the role of universities in regional economic development
seeks to go beyond the classic cases of Silicon Valley, MIT, and Cambridge, to come up
with other successful examples in order to better understand the processes by which
university-generated knowledge is transferred into the local industrial community.
Universities are important actors in the local economy, but we need a more nuanced and

<-----Page 2----->3
contextualized understanding of the actual role that universities play in regional
economic development. In a recent study of the dynamic and growing cluster of ICT
firms in Waterloo, Canada, the University of Waterloo (UW) clearly emerges as a key
actor in the local economy. While commercialization activities of the University of
Waterloo have been an important element of regional economic success, there are many
other types of linkages and knowledge transfers that are occurring, and the university’s
role in the local community goes far beyond simple commercialization activities. Based
on data from the Waterloo ICT study, this paper takes up the increasingly salient critique
of assumptions about universities as generators of commercializable knowledge, and
argues that the task of transferring knowledge from universities to industry is far more
complex, and the role of universities in local economies is much more robust and multivariate than linear conceptions of the innovation process indicate.
A brief discussion of post-WWII traditional understandings of the linear models
of commercialization predicated on university-driven research and firm take-up, is
followed by an outline of the recent literature on universities, innovation and regional
economic development, with a particular emphasis on the process of learning and
mechanisms of knowledge transfer between universities and other local and non-local
economic actors. We seek to go beyond linear models of knowledge transfer for
commercialization purposes, to come up with a more robust conception of the
mechanisms by which university knowledge is transferred into the local economy. Most
approaches that focus on commercialization and spin-off activity overlook the two
conventional but essential roles of performing primary research and training highlyqualified personnel (HQP) (Wolfe, 2004; Lawton-Smith 2003a; Goldstein and Renault

<-----Page 3----->4
2004; Lundvall 2002). At the same time, however, emerging research indicates that this
characterization still does not accurately capture the range of university activities. A
more accurate understanding of this role requires a framework for analyzing the character
of the institutional and interpersonal linkages between universities and firms, and the
mechanisms by which knowledge is transferred between them.
We argue here that universities are not just trainers of highly qualified scientists
and researchers, they are also attractors of talent from elsewhere to the local community
(Florida 2002; Gertler and Vinodrai 2005; Betts and Lee 2005). Universities do not only
generate new knowledge through primary research, they also provide technical support
and specialized expertise and facilities for on-going firm-based R&D activities
(Grossman et. al. 2001; Bramwell, Nelles and Wolfe 2004). University activity is not
confined to the process of knowledge transfer on a local basis, but also acts as a conduit
of new knowledge through the “global pipelines” of international academic research
networks (Bathelt, Malmberg and Maskell 2004; Lawton-Smith 2003a; OECD 1999).
Finally, rather than acting as “ivory towers” insulated from their community, they act as
“good community players” that facilitate local linkages and networks and create “anchors
of creativity” that underpin the virtuous cycle of talent attraction and retention (Wolfe
2005b; Henton, Melville and Walesh 1997; Gertler and Vinodrai 2005; Betts and Lee
2005). In relation to this framework of knowledge transfer mechanisms, the University
of Waterloo emerges as a strong example of a “entrepreneurial research university” that
is actively engaged with the process of economic development in the local community
(Tornatzky, Waugaman and Gray 2002).

Universities and ‘Learning’ in Knowledge-Based Economies: From Linear to
Interactive Models of Knowledge Transfer
“People are preoccupied with spin-offs, with the idea of starting something new. There is
a lot of naivety around this especially with people in government and economists who
think [that with] one good piece of research and a patent and you can build a company.
It does not work like that. If you do not have at least 40 innovations and a lot other
things, you are not going to go very far.” 1
Massive investments in basic scientific research resulting from Post-World War II
science and technology policy, especially in the US, were predicated on expectations of
durable, long-term economic benefits from commercialized research. Universities were
privileged as the principal site for the conduct of scientific research and their autonomy to
conduct research and judge its merits and applications, was left intact. Underlying this
‘social contract for science’ was the ‘linear model’ of innovation that was based on the
assumption that “a rather straightforward conversion takes place from investments in
basic science to economic growth, passing through applied science, technological
development, and marketing” (Lundvall 2002, 3). In a stylized linear model, the
innovation process begins with basic research that leads to new discoveries, without
consideration of potential future applications. These basic discoveries launch potential
applications that are pursued and taken-up by firms through further applied research,
development, design, production, and marketing. The later stages of this process lead to
the successful commercialization of new products and processes (Brooks 1996, Stokes
1997, cited in Wolfe 2005b).
In recent years, however, universities have come under increasing pressure to
expand their traditionally dominant role in the conduct of basic research and supplement
it with more applied research activities. Three major trends characterize the changes that
1

<-----Page 5----->6
have affected the university system: the linking of government funding for academic
research with economic policy; the development of more long-term relationships between
firms and academic researchers; and the direct participation of universities in
commercializing research (Etkowitz and Webster 1998). As a result, while universities
continue to fulfill their traditional roles of performing primary research and training
highly qualified people, they have come under increasing pressure in recent years to
expand their basic research activities to include more applied research of greater
relevance to industry, and to diffuse technical knowledge and provide technical support
to industry. This shift reflects changing government expectations that public investments
in basic research should produce a measurable economic return (Wolfe 2005a).
However, while this shift in policy perspective was partly stimulated by a reevaluation of the linear model, it has not yet been replaced with a more realistic
understanding of the processes by which knowledge flows between universities and
industry. Influential work on the process of knowledge transfer affords some guidance.
The theoretical shift toward an emphasis on interactive learning in the production and
application of knowledge has critical implications for the processes of knowledge transfer
and regional economic development in general, and for universities in particular. In
contrast to earlier linear models of scientific research and knowledge transfer, based on a
conception of knowledge as codified information, innovation is now seen as an
interactive process. Lundvall (1992; 2004), among others, argues that the knowledge
frontier is moving so rapidly that successful innovation requires constant learning and
adaptation, and thus the emerging paradigm is more accurately described as a ‘learning
economy’ than a ‘knowledge-based’ one. A firm’s interaction with knowledge

<-----Page 6----->7
institutions, as well as suppliers and customers has become a critical condition for
successful innovation, because the interaction between scientific knowledge and technical
innovation is characterized by complex feedback loops between producers and users.
Innovation is also a social process, where users and producers actively learn from
each other by regular ‘learning-through-interacting’ (Cooke 1988; Maskell 2001). In
this context, learning refers primarily to the building of new competencies and the
acquisition of new skills rather than simply accessing information of codified scientific
knowledge. However, successful learning through interaction involves a capacity for
localized learning within firms, and between firms and supporting institutions in a region.
In this sense, the capacity for learning of firms in a region – the ability to develop and
assess both person-embodied, tacit knowledge, and easily accessible and reproducible
codified knowledge - is a critical variable in successful innovation. This form of learning
often occurs at the regional level because firms within a region often share common
networks that facilitate learning among them, and are supported by a common set of
regional institutions, including universities (Wolfe 2005a).
Because knowledge transfers are mainly person-embodied, the ability to put
information to productive use requires an extensive and interactive learning process
supported by a high level of skills accumulated through training and experience, and
strong networks between researchers, all of which support the development of new
capabilities on the part of firms and other institutions in the region. This view shifts the
focus to the processes and capabilities that enable a firm to successfully absorb and apply
the knowledge, which implies that firms must develop a considerable capacity for
research themselves (Pavitt 1991). Therefore, the ability to exploit external, often

<-----Page 7----->8
university-generated, knowledge is critical to the innovative capabilities of firms. Cohen
and Levinthal (1990) argue that the success of knowledge transfer between universities
and firms is strongly conditioned by the internal knowledge base and research capacity of
firms themselves. Absorptive capacity refers to the notion of knowledge as the capacity
of the firm to acquire and apply research results, rather than as an end in itself where “the
overlap between the firm’s internal knowledge base and external research allows firms to
recognize potentially useful outside knowledge and to use it to augment its existing
knowledge base” (Wolfe 2005a, 8). A key implication of this argument is that firms
require a strong contingent of highly qualified research scientists and engineers, recruited
primarily from universities, in order to develop the ability to assess and absorb scientific
knowledge. These highly trained scientists and engineers bring to the firm not only a
strong knowledge base and research skills, but also a network of formal and informal
academic contacts acquired during their training. The role played by networks in the
process of knowledge transfer has been the focus of a great deal of research which
indicates that firms and industries link with the publicly funded science base in many
informal ways. 2

Bridging institutions such as universities and public research institutes 3

provide the social interaction and networking capacity essential for tapping into the
shared intelligence of the firms and the research organizations within a given geographic
region.

2

For example, in their study of public-private sector linkages in three areas, Faulkner and Senker (1995)
found that good personal relationships between firms and public sector scientists were they key to
successful collaboration, because personal relationships build up understanding and trust, which in turn
leads to long-term contractual relationships.

Universities and Economic Development: Mechanisms for Knowledge Transfer
The preceding discussion emphasizes the fact that knowledge transfers between
universities and other economic actors are highly personalized, and as a result, often
highly localized, which underscores the significance of geographical proximity for the
process of knowledge transfer. Proximity to the source of the research is important in
influencing the success with which knowledge generated in the research laboratory is
transferred to firms for commercial exploitation, or process innovations are adopted and
diffused across researchers and users. The proximity effect of knowledge transfer
provides a strong clue as to why universities are increasingly seen as an essential element
in the process of local and regional economic development, especially in knowledgeintensive industries, such as information and communications technology or
biotechnology. However, what is not yet clear is the actual process by which, and degree
to which, the proximity effect of university research on innovativeness contributes to the
process of regional economic growth and industrial cluster formation (Wolfe 2005a). 4
In summary, the role of universities in local economic development goes far
beyond the linear transfer of basic research into commercializable products. Instead,
universities emerge as multi-faceted economic actors that are embedded in regions, and
not only produce codified and commodified knowledge and human capital, but also

4

There has been a great deal of theoretical and empirical work on industrial clusters and cluster formation,
such as the research generated through the Innovation Systems Research Network (ISRN),
www.utoronto.ca/isrn. For the sake of situating the argument, clusters are defined as “a geographically
proximate group of interconnected companies and associated institutions in a particular field, linked by
commonalities and complementarities”, and can include concentrations of interconnected companies,
service providers, suppliers of specialized inputs to the production process, customers, manufacturers of
related products, and governmental and other institutions such as national laboratories, universities,
vocational training institutions, trade associations and collaborative research institutes. (Porter 1998).

<-----Page 9----->10
actively participate as important institutional actors in both building and sustaining local
networks and flows of knowledge, and in linking them with global ones.
An emerging debate in the literature, however, sends a strong note of caution
about assuming unproblematic and causal relationships between universities and regional
economic development. Varga (2001) argues that the classic – and most famous - cases
of regionally embedded universities such as Silicon Valley, Route128 in Boston, and the
Cambridge Phenomenon have only limited general validity, and that the amount and
quality of technological information transmitted from local academic institutions depends
on the level of development – or regional absorptive capacity – of the local innovation
system. Similarly, a study of universities and the development of industry clusters in the
U.S. concludes that the impact of the university can go beyond the provision of basic
research, but that the knowledge assets of the university must be properly aligned with
the multi-variate needs of local firms;
A large base of research and development is required but not sufficient. The
university must also address the business, workforce, and community issues. The
university must be aligned with regional interests and industry clusters across a
broad spectrum, not just in terms of technical knowledge (Paytas 2004, 34).
In her study of the universities of Oxford and Grenoble, Lawton Smith (2003b) examines
the way in which national level institutions shape the opportunities and constraints facing
universities, and finds that a university’s level of engagement with the local community is
directly related to the degree of autonomy that they have from national institutions to
choose to adopt a territorially active role. In a similar vein, Boucher, Conway and Van
Der Meer (2003) find that there is a range in levels of regional engagement of European
universities, which is influenced by several factors such as type of university and type of
region. Their findings indicate that the universities that are most comprehensively

<-----Page 10----->11
engaged in the local economy are single, relatively large and technologically oriented
universities located in peripheral regions that tend to be more directly integrated into
regional institutional networks and have a greater impact on their economic, social, and
cultural development. At the same time, they find that the ability of these newer
technologically oriented universities to actively engage in the local community is
inhibited by competition with older, more prestigious universities for institutional
dominance. On another sobering note, while they find that basic research and technology
transfer functions of universities do generate significant knowledge spillovers that
contribute to regional economic development that would not otherwise occur, Goldstein
and Renault (2004) argue that the magnitude of these contributions is marginal in
comparison to other factors.
In this context, the role of universities in regional economic development appears
to be less direct or instrumental than is often presumed. In his study of eleven high
technology clusters in Canada, Doutriaux (2003) finds no direct causal relationship
between the presence of a university and local high technology development, and
concludes that Canadian universities are better seen as “catalysts for development rather
than drivers” (63). However, universities do retain a measure of policy autonomy.
Active participation in the local community and economy is, in many ways, a matter of
individual institutional policy, and “the involvement of the university in the region
depends on the role that the university chooses for itself” (Lawton Smith 2003a, 6). The
impact can range from the “simply mercantile” effect of income generation effects to a
“technologically pro-active model where universities attempt to promote technology
transfer to influence the trajectory of local economic development” (Lanza and Piccaluga

<-----Page 11----->12
1995 cited in Lawton Smith 2003a). However, while the success of a university-based
cluster initiative requires more than “an active, engaged high quality university”, almost
all high tech regional economies are anchored by a research university, so the presence
of such a university indisputably remains a key factor advantage (Tornatzky, et al. 2002).
Recent research into the role of universities and regional economic development
has begun to find other incidences of robust university involvement in local economies.
Rosenberg (2003) argues that American commercial success in high-technology sectors
of the economy, “owes an enormous debt to the entrepreneurial activities of American
universities” (116). He attributes much of this entrepreneurial activity to the willingness
of university faculty to go beyond their traditional research and teaching activities and
engage in the commercialization of their research. 5

Though linkages are manifested in

different ways and to differing degrees, more and more cases of “entrepreneurial research
universities” are emerging in the literature (Feldman 2003; Feldman and Desrochers
2004; Paytas 2004; Jacob, Lundqvist and Hellmark 2003). The Innovation U project, a
recent study of how a small group of research universities in the southern U.S. are using
their technological strength to build links with industry identifies the emergence of a new
21st century model of an “entrepreneurial research university” that “aggressively partners
with technology-based industry and regional economic development interests, exhibits
and encourages entrepreneurial behaviour, and champions these new directions in its
public pronouncements and internal values” (Tornatzky et al. 2002, 14). In this context,

The University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada stands out as “the most
entrepreneurial university, possibly in North America, but certainly in Canada”. 6

The University of Waterloo: An Entrepreneurial University Embedded in an
Entrepreneurial Community
“Today it is the University of Waterloo. If you sort of go back in the cluster, if you like,
it all comes from the UW in some form or other…Is there a cluster around the area, yeah
there is. Is the external perception stronger than it actually is, yeah I think so…We get
referenced in presentations in San Diego, Washington and New York about this Waterloo
cluster…but it’s clear that the University of Waterloo is the one thing that pulls it
together.” 7
A critical mass of high technology companies and the proven resilience of the
regional economy signify that the Waterloo region, located an hour west of Toronto, is
one of the most dynamic sources of high-tech activity in the country, boasting 468
companies involved in either the production or facilitation of high technology. Strong,
well-established firms provide high levels of employment in automotive, advanced
manufacturing, biotechnology, business and services, education, environmental science,
food processing, furniture manufacturing, high tech, logistics and warehousing, R&D,
and telecommunications (PWC, 2001a; Canada’s Technology Triangle, 2004). Currently
automotive/metal manufacturing, education and business services sectors are the largest
area employers (The Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity, 2003). The economy
is quite diverse within each sector, and the Waterloo region is not dominated by one
particular high tech sector such as telecommunications or Internet-based firms, which has
enabled the region to weather economic shocks, such as the post-2000 dot.com meltdown

that devastated employment in other leading ICT clusters. Two community
organizations, the Communitech Technology Association, and Canada’s Technology
Triangle (CTT), are dedicated to promoting entrepreneurialism and maximizing regional
economic growth and competitiveness.8 Starting in the mid-1970s, a flurry of high tech
firm formation and exponential growth in the high tech sector was stimulated primarily
by spin-offs from the universities, existing firms, firms outside the region, and through
independent start-ups. Of these sources, university spin-offs have had the greatest impact
on the local economy. 9 Since 1973, the University of Waterloo has spun off 59
individual high technology firms, 28% of the total number of high tech firms born in the
cluster (Xu, 2003: 63). 10
The University of Waterloo has had a powerful impact on the shape of the
regional economy, but this impact goes far beyond its successful spin-off activity. The
decisions made during its formative years laid the groundwork of expertise, research

8

In particular, Communitech, the local association for high tech firms, was created by a group of successful
local entrepreneurs, and represents the interests of high tech firms to the government and provides mutual
support and networking opportunities, peer-to-peer groups, and other support mechanisms for local high
tech entrepreneurs.
9
There is some confusion in the literature about firm formation in the region about what constitutes a
university spin off. Many include firms founded by university alumni or students in this category regardless
of the source of the core technology or intellectual property. In the interest of precision we employ a more
rigorous definition. A university spin off company is “a commercial entity that derives a significant portion
of its commercial activities from the application or use of a technology and/or know-how developed by or
during a university funded research program. The new enterprise is created either (1) to license a
University invention, (2) to fund research at the University in order to further develop a
technology/invention that will be licensed by the company, or (3) to provide a service using Universityderived expertise” (University of Alberta Research Services Office, 2003). Accordingly, Research in
Motion, a firm often credited as a UW spin off is considered here to be an independent start up. It was
founded while both principles were still students at the university but as a consulting firm unrelated to their
areas of study. Because no technology or IP was transferred at the time of foundation RIM is not a
university spin off, irrespective of any research contacts it currently has with the institution.
10
Some of the most notable spin-offs include Waterloo Maple Inc (1988), Open Text (1989), Virtek Vision
Corp. (1986), Dalsa (1980) and Northern Digital Inc (1981). Independent startups account for the smallest
amount of new firm formation in this period, though they include some of the region’s biggest names, such
as Research in Motion (RIM) (1987), Descartes Systems Group Inc (1981), Meikle Automation (1994) and
Intellitech Innovations Inc (1989). Second, third and even fourth generation spin-offs contributed the most
to firm births in the latter half of this period.

<-----Page 14----->15
capacity, and talent pool for the region’s current high tech economy. While the
University of Waterloo is now one of many vibrant centres of knowledge creation, it,
more than any other university or college in the area, has had the most profound
formative effect on high tech industry in the region and is considered by most to be the
institutional centre of this cluster high tech firms. 11
The university developed and has maintained a strong international reputation for
academic excellence in science, math and engineering. Beyond this academic strength,
however, much of its success at linking with both local and non-local industry is
attributed to two well-known innovations: the Intellectual Property (IP) Policy and the
Co-op program. Whereas at many universities, the institution claims ownership of
commercially viable intellectual property, at the University of Waterloo, full ownership
of IP rests with the creator, thus encouraging the individual faculty or student to
commercialize the idea. This single innovation is credited with the large number of high
profile start-ups and spin-offs in the region. Cooperative education, where students
complete work terms in industry as part of their curriculum, was a training innovation
adopted in the early days of the institution, and was the first, and remains the most
successful, of its kind in Canada. Many people credit Waterloo’s success to these two
innovations;
There are two magic things about Waterloo: the Co-op program selected faculty
who had more of an applied bent and if they were not like this when they got
there, their students would change them into this. Waterloo also has the real
tradition of inventor as owner. I have been surprised at how big a thing this is
symbolically. It is more important that I thought it was.12
11

The region consists of three other educational institutions: Wilfred Laurier University (1960), The
University of Guelph (1964), and Conestoga College (1967) specializing in business, agri-biotech and
technical trades respectively have all spawned high tech spin-offs. However, of these, the University of
Waterloo has been the most significant.

Our own research on the ICT cluster in Waterloo suggests, however, that this
characterization still does not accurately capture the range and depth of linkages between
UW and local industry. While the university clearly serves as a critical conduit for
knowledge transfer in the regional economy and it has been very active in the transfer of
cutting-edge knowledge in the form of commercialization of research into entrepreneurial
spin off companies, a tendency to over-emphasize or mythologize this form of knowledge
transfer belies the more subtle but no less powerful impact of alternative knowledge
transfer mechanisms.
The data from our empirical study of the ICT cluster in the Waterloo region
indicates that the University of Waterloo demonstrates a multi-variate capacity for
knowledge transfer to the local economy consistent with the analytical framework of
alternative knowledge transfer mechanisms outlined above. In terms of knowledge
creation, UW provides of technical support for on-going firm-based R&D activities
through project-oriented consulting and joint research projects. In terms of human capital
creation, through graduate degree programs and co-op programs, the UW generates a
large pool of highly qualified and experienced scientists and researchers, who are attuned
to the research and technology needs of industry, as well as attracting scientific talent
from elsewhere to the local community. In terms of global linkages, the knowledge that
is transferred locally benefits from the university’s linkages with “global pipelines” of
new knowledge. Finally, UW acts as an engaged entrepreneurial institution – or “good
community player” – that is embedded in the local economy and shapes and supports the
local networks and flows of knowledge that underpin a highly successful regional
“entrepreneurial” culture (Bramwell, Nelles and Wolfe 2005). In summary, UW emerges

<-----Page 16----->17
as multi-faceted economic actor, embedded in the Waterloo region, that not only
produces codified and commodified knowledge and human capital, but also actively
participates building and sustaining local networks and flows of knowledge, and in
linking them with global ones. A more detailed discussion of the relationship between
the University of Waterloo and the local economic community in relation to this
alternative framework of university knowledge transfer mechanisms underscores the
characterization of UW as an “entrepreneurial” university.

Beyond Research for Commercialization: “Little R, Big D” and Getting the First Look
There is a voluminous literature on the economic impact of university spin-offs
which emphasizes commercialization but tends to obscure or ignore other more difficult
to measure, but still impactful, research functions of universities (Feldman 2003;
Feldman and Desrochers 2004).

Betts and Lee (2005) identify several other types of

tech transfer that also directly involve partnerships between universities and industry. In
sponsored research agreements, a firm subsidizes or wholly funds university research in
return for preferential, rather than exclusive access to research results, or “getting the first
look”. When firms want to invest in research and development for incremental
innovation of an existing product or process, or to act as “test beds” to solve a particular
problem which requires university expertise and/or research facilities, they will often
enter into limited term, project-focused fee-for-service R&D agreements (Grossman, et
al. 2001). Finally, and most difficult to measure, are informal arrangements such as
participation in research consortia made up of university and private sector

<-----Page 17----->18
representatives, faculty consulting with or working in firms, or firm personnel working in
universities.
The University of Waterloo is among the best performing universities in Canada
in terms of the number of high tech, ICT-intensive spin off companies it has produced.
However, the university’s role in the commercialization process has evolved a great deal.
Whereas it played the key role of knowledge generator in the 1980s, the level of spin-offs
and the results of social network analysis indicate that knowledge transfer within the
region in the form of commercialization of primary research is on the decline (Xu, 2003).
The findings from our interview data on the impact of the university on local firm
formation echo this finding. Although the University of Waterloo continues to play a key
role in the development of the cluster, its primary contribution is no longer through new
firm formation and commercialization. In fact, there was some indication that the
university is running somewhat behind the times in terms of tech transfer;
universities need to continually innovate in their tech transfer process to come up
with innovative models. [They] need to figure out how to work with small
companies and engage with them in ways that are meaningful to the companies. I
find, overall, that universities tend to want companies to think the way they do
rather than the other way around…Waterloo is a bit of an interesting case because
they did so many things right early they have a very strong brand so there is a
tendency to rest on their laurels a little bit…Waterloo doesn’t need to fix itself in
its view as much as others do [but] they’re working on a technology cycle of what
they used to do, and it was great, but it becomes irrelevant. The truth is that
Waterloo has done the most tech transfer by a factor of 5 or 6 of any other
university but most of that was done in the 70s and 80s, its not current experience.
So there’s a little bit of nostalgia playing out there. 13
In addition, while about half of the firms in the region have formal and informal links
with the university, many others report that they have only very tangential or non-existent
ones. Many firms report no linkages whatever. For firms that do have linkages with the
13

Confidential interview.

<-----Page 18----->19
university, there is a range in depth and breadth of interaction. Some hire only co-op
students, while yet others may have some small or informal research relationships, and a
few, typically though not exclusively, larger firms are closely connected and “have a very
tight relationship with the university” through research connections and hiring co-op
students. However, regardless of the depth or breadth of the linkages, the university is
still perceived by most respondents to be a critical source of knowledge generation in the
region. Its continued impact is partly attributable to its capacity to support and augment
firm in-house research activities in the local high tech community.
Consistent with the functions described above, the two most discernible trends in
the research activities of high tech firms in Waterloo are support of short-term R&D
projects to support incremental innovation, and university-led or joint primary research
projects in order to get preferential access to the results. Though most firms are engaged
in R&D to some extent, they are typically much more focused on product development
than primary research.14 The trend in the innovation process is predominantly solutionsfocused, incremental innovations rather than research-intensive, first generation
innovations. Product and process improvements are intended to make the product “faster,
smaller, cheaper” and often involve development activities such as the modification of
existing software platforms, product updates and new releases, applying the core
technology to different applications within the same factory, or making software web
accessible. This emphasis on performance improvement and fine-tuning reflects the trend
toward what one observer describes as “little R, big D” projects. For many firms, both
14

These research activities are highly correlated to firm size, and while there is evidence of both types of
activities across large and small firms, not surprisingly, larger firms tend to have more robust partnering
relationships, often involving the funding of research chairs, long-term collaborative research projects,
university faculty working within the firm, and full-time staff occupied with university and government
interaction. Smaller firms, in contrast, tend to engage in short-term, problem-focused research projects.

<-----Page 19----->20
large and small, out-sourcing problem-focused, short-term R&D projects is financially
and logistically beneficial because “given the size of [our company] it’s about accessing
very specific technical expertise that, given the size of the company wouldn’t make sense
to bring in house”.
Primarily, though not exclusively, large, global firms with robust partnering
mandates that collaborate with the university on long-term, core research projects, report
that the primary benefit is “getting the first look” at the research results. They want to
keep abreast of what is happening at the research level, even though they know they will
not have any proprietary access to the IP that results as it very quickly becomes part of
the public domain when the research results are published. Long-term research is by
nature explorative and speculative, and if firms foresee it to be directly relevant to their
business strategy, they prefer to keep the project within the company to avoid a potential
conflict over ownership of IP. A typical example of the firm attitude toward jointly
sponsored university research, is the comment that “at best you know, it’s a research
project, at best you’re going to get some idea feasibility and you may be getting some
prototype out of it and that’s really where my expectations stop.” 15 Again, they have
access to cutting edge knowledge without having to invest in the people and facilities to
acquire it, yet it also gives firms an inside eye on developing university graduates they
may want to hire. Firms also report the benefit of research collaboration with the
university as increasing their global reach and perspective by “magnifying your insight
into the global marketplace” because research professors are usually part of global
networks of expertise in their particular research areas.

<-----Page 20----->21
While a few report close interaction with particular university labs as their prime
reason for locating in Waterloo, the majority of firms, both large and small, that report
R&D linkages with UW indicate that it is primarily for short term research, usually of a
couple months’ duration, on a “project by project basis as needed” and that the primary
benefit of collaboration is the ability to do problem-focused research and small codevelopment projects that allow them access to university expertise and lab facilities.
Knowledge exchanges tend to be more informal and both firms and researchers appear to
prefer it that way. Informal relationships are quick and easy to access – “I call my friends
[at UW] if I have a problem” – whereas more formal research relationships are often
hindered by disjunctures between researchers and firms expectations about the length of
time to commercialization and conflicts over ownership of IP. This underscores the
importance and fluid and iterative quality of informal networks between the university
and local industry. At the same time, it is critical to note that intentionally facilitating
these informal project-based relationships is an important element of the institutional
policy of the university. As one administrator commented;
What we think is the most important part is the business that it brings here, the
knowledge that flows back and forward, the pilot projects that are done using our
premises, using our researchers…It’s so hard in Canada to have the kind of
critical mass to bring in the tech researchers that we bring in who need equipment
and labs, and they want to work with colleagues that they respect. It we’re doing
it entirely through teaching and the small amount of money that’s gone into
research over the years, we’re probably not going to bring in the same kind of
teams and retain them. So being able to do that in the local community and have
it be a win for those businesses too is really a very positive thing.16
Generating, Attracting and Retaining Talent: “The Best Tech Transfer Is A Pair of
Shoes”

<-----Page 21----->22
Another key variable that links universities to local economic development is its
role as a provider of a large and deep pool of highly qualified and talented people (HQP)
(Wolfe 2005a). Many recent studies of the economic benefits of publicly funded
university indicate that skilled graduates are one of the most critical mechanisms of
knowledge transfer from universities, and the primary benefit that accrues to firms.
Because of their ability to participate in the conduct of basic research, new graduates
enter industry with high-levels of training and applied scientific knowledge, as well as
academic and professional networks, and are thus equipped to perform research, develop
ideas, and solve complex problems. Senker (1995) suggests that graduates bring into
industry an “attitude of the mind” and a “tacit ability” to acquire and use knowledge in a
new and powerful way. The ability of graduates to contribute to innovation in industry
is shaped by their ability to apply basic research techniques and learned scientific
knowledge determine. Firms report that new graduates not only transfer cutting edge upto-date knowledge to firms, they also bring enthusiasm and critical approaches – or “fresh
eyes” – to firm-based research and development that stimulates other members of the
research team. Skills acquired in their education and research experiences act as a
precursor to the development of industry-related skills, which over time, allow people to
develop highly valuable skill sets. Mike Lazaridis, founder, president, and CEO of
Waterloo-based Reseearch in Motion (RIM) stresses the critical human capital dimension
of basic research activities:
The number one reason to fund basic research…is to attract the very best
researchers from around the world. Once here, they can prepare Canada’s next
generations of graduates, masters, PhD’s and post-doctorates, including the finest
foreign students. All else flows from this…If you really want to understand
commercialization, all you have to do is attend convocation at your local
university (quoted in Wolfe 2005b, 326).

<-----Page 22----->23

While these benefits are difficult to quantify, the evidence suggests that students bring a
wide range of skills and techniques to industry, which enable firms to increase their base
of tacit knowledge as well as to expand into new industrial applications. Therefore,
students provide a key transfer mechanism to channel the benefits of government funded
university research into industry for the broader purposes of economic development. 17
Another critical knowledge transfer mechanism is found in the person-embodied
knowledge of experienced researchers with well-developed expertise. A number of
recent studies have begun to identify the finding and retaining of existing talent as
another critical factor influencing the growth of dynamic regional economies, and
universities are emerging not only as key generators, but also as key attractors of talent
(Florida 1999; Betts & Lee 2005).

Zucker and Darby (1996) tracked the movements of

‘star-scientists’ and found that leading research scientists tend to collaborate more within
their own institutions and with firm scientists located close by. Florida (2002) found that
experienced executives will locate themselves where other highly skilled people are, and
that highly educated labour flows to places that have a ‘buzz’ about them – where the
most interesting work is being done. Knowledge flows in the form of in-bound talented
labour act to reinforce the knowledge assets already existing in a region.
While the University of Waterloo has clearly contributed much to the local high
tech economy through successful spin-off firms and other research activities, perhaps its
most important contribution lies in its role in training a significant proportion of the local
17

Our own research on Ontario programs to promote international collaborative research and universitypartnering, suggests that the movement of doctoral and post-doctoral students into industry frequently
provides the most effective method for transferring research results from the laboratory directly to industry
(citation pending).

<-----Page 23----->24
labour force. University of Waterloo graduates make up a major proportion of the
valuable high tech human capital in the region. Not only are graduates well trained
within the university, they often come with practical experience gained through co-op
placements both in local firms and in firms all over North America. Furthermore, many
graduates are highly innovative and entrepreneurial, two qualities emphasized in normal
stream undergraduate courses and specifically targeted through special limited enrolment
programs and departments designed to provide a business background and resources to
potential entrepreneurs, such as the Enterprise Co-op Program.
The fact that the University of Waterloo has developed such an expertise in
training and graduating highly talented, innovative and entrepreneurial individuals in
math, computer science and engineering is no coincidence. These areas of expertise
developed over several decades and were the product of decisions taken by the innovative
and visionary architects of the university and its early math and engineering departments.
Thus the current character of the regional economy owes a lot to decisions made in the
1950s and 60s about the mandate and mission of the first regional university. In
recognition of the technical manpower shortage and the growing needs of industry, the
Waterloo Plan, called for a new type of education to be offered on a cooperative basis
with industry, and formed the basis of University of Waterloo’s highly successful co-op
education program. The rotation of students to industry and back to the classroom
solidified already tight relations with local industry. The reflexive relationship allows the
curriculum to keep up with the ever-changing technological frontiers of industry while
industry support of the program funds the acquisition of technology to enhance classroom
learning. It was thus that UW became one of the first universities in Canada to enable

<-----Page 24----->25
students to actively explore and make use of innovations in the relatively new field of
computing. The exposure that students had to the early days of computer technology laid
the foundations for a technological leap that shaped the industrial development of the
region from the 1970s onward (Nelles, Bramwell and Wolfe 2005). 18
The availability of skilled, talented people, especially the large number of “smart
and competitively priced engineers”, is consistently cited by local firms to be the most
critical input into their competitive advantage, because human capital is the main input
into software, or as one respondent put it, “human capital is what software is made of”. 19
Regardless of the level of involvement with the university on an R&D level, almost every
firm cited its critical importance as a provider of highly skilled and specialized talent.
The University of Waterloo is considered to be the most impactful educational and
research institution in the cluster and many firms indicate that it is primarily relevant to
them as a source of skilled talent. 20 A majority of local high tech firms require university
educated employees, and in many cases, most of the staff has at least a BSc, many have
MScs, and a large number of firms have several staff members with a PhD, many in
18

The first major ICT breakthrough at the university, was the software innovation, the WATFOR compiler,
which sealed its role as the key regional high tech institution. As soon as it obtained its first computer,
engineers and mathematicians started developing software, and invented the Waterloo FORTRAN compiler
to speed up programming computations. This technology, dubbed WATFOR, became the basis for one of
the university’s first spin-off companies and the first software company in Waterloo – WATCOM (1974),
now parent company to several generations of subsequent spin-offs in ICT. Furthermore, the WATCOM
spin off established a business model based on a relationship between the company and the university that
allowed the company to retain ownership of its research and intellectual property, which formed the basis
for the university’s current intellectual property policy.

20
Again, it is important to note that other post-secondary institutions in the region are also important
sources of highly skilled graduates for the local talent pool. While Waterloo is cited most often as the
primary source of new hires, especially out of the software engineering program, McMaster University is
also listed as an important source of engineering talent for certain types of highly specialized engineering
research. Wilfred Laurier University is regularly mentioned as a source for junior marketing and
management people. Many firms, in both manufacturing and software, have a labour pool that is a mix of
university-educated engineers and college-educated technicians, and report that they actively recruit from
Conestoga College for their technical staff. Leaving these institutions out of the analysis is not meant to
minimize their impact, but this research is focused on the multi-dimensional impact of the University of
Waterloo.

<-----Page 25----->26
software engineering. Most firms indicated that it was a distinct advantage to be located
in Waterloo because it provided a ready supply of “smart and competitively priced”
engineers and because UW is “one of the best universities in the world for computer
engineering”. 21 As one respondent put it, “it all has to do with the proximity to the
university and the fact that a lot of our staff at this point, probably about 400 of our 2,000
staff went to Waterloo”. 22
The Co-op Program consistently emerges as one of the key shapers of the talent
pool in the Waterloo region, and therefore as a critical component of local economic
growth. Whether or not they have other linkages with the university, a clear majority of
firms either actively or regularly hire students from the co-op program, have hired them
in the past, intend to start up again when the economy improves, or are planning to do so
in the future, as the firm grows. Three key benefits of Waterloo’s co-op program were
reported. Because firms are always looking for “the best and the brightest”, first and
foremost, it acts as a steady source of new hires, because firms know that the students
have work experience, and they get the opportunity to evaluate them in the work place
before hiring them. Second, co-op students act as an important source of knowledge
transfer; because they are exposed to new ideas in their courses and bring these ideas to
their placements; “a lot of the students are on the cutting edge of the products that we’re
working on, so we definitely get the benefit from that”. Finally, Waterloo co-op students
have an international reputation for being of high quality, and as a result, local firms have
to compete with global ones to attract the best students, though they retain the benefit of
location;
21

In addition, the presence of large software and other technology intensive firms in the area, such as Open
Text, RIM, and ATS serves as both a magnet and an anchor for the highly specialized labour pool.
22

<-----Page 26----->27
We’re competing with Intel and Microsoft constantly for those top students and I
think Microsoft hires like 15% of the graduating class and 15% of the co-ops
there and who wouldn’t want to go and work for Microsoft? So we’re generally
paying top dollar because we’re competing against US folks but we’re also
competing for the best of the best. And I think we get way more than our share
here locally.
Beyond these highly visible and tangible benefits of the Co-op Program, is its
contribution to the virtuous cycle of entrepreneurialism in the region. In this sense, the
person-embodied element of tech transfer through co-op students emerges quite clearly,
as does the importance of qualitative relationships between people in the university and
in industry, for which “the students are often the instrument”;
Just think what it means if you are a professor in a fourth year class, in any
subject. If you have a student in front of you who has come back from four
months with an industry leader and has been doing some good work. It does keep
you on your toes. One of the great benefits is that thru the students who move
back in forth, the professors are aware of what is going on in university and vice
versa. So students are very important. The best instrument of technology transfer
is a pair of shoes. 23
This aspect of person- or more precisely, student-embodied knowledge transfer is
underscored as a critical part of the overall innovation process. For example, one
interviewee cited IBM as reporting that Waterloo undergraduate co-op students were the
principal instrument that enabled most small and medium sized companies to integrate
computers into their operations.24 At the same time, student-driven tech transfer is also
critical specifically to the commercialization process;
For example, students come off co-op terms and co-opt entrepreneurial faculty to
develop a company. Faculty research and commercialization is about 80 percent
of the total commercialization rate. Students play a big role in spin-offs and tech
transfer.

<-----Page 27----->28
This awareness of the crucial link between commercialization and entrepreneurialism is
underscored and supported by the Enterprise Co-op Program, which enables students to
start their own venture in lieu of doing a co-op placement with an established firm, and
focuses on creating a local network of contacts and mentors to support it.
Data from interviews of ICT firms in the Waterloo region consistently indicates
that the primary locational factor for local firms is access to a deep and highly skilled
local talent pool (Bramwell, Nelles and Wolfe 2005). Despite the fact that many firms
have no direct links with the university, UW is nonetheless credited by most as a key
generator, and to some extent, attractor, of this skilled talent. Most respondents report a
variant on the perception that “the community has tremendous cultural assets in the
universities and that’s helped. It’s been able to grow and attract a talent pool that is
disproportionately large for its size.”
Global Linkages: Universities as Pipelines
“Researchers go to global conferences as part of what they do…When we work
with a professor at UW, we don’t just get that professor’s perspective, we don’t
just get the electrical and computing engineer perspective, we get a global
perspective that works with 500 professors at very great institutions world wide
and get their ideas so you know what’s happening.” 25
While locally generated and sustained knowledge flows are a critical element that
drives the innovation required for regional economic growth, access to global knowledge
flows are crucial as well. Local ‘buzz’ results from physical co-location, and is “the
force that facilitates the circulation of information in a local economy through
interpersonal face-to-face contact, and the mechanism that supports networking in the
community” (Storper and Venables 2003). ‘Pipelines’ refer to channels of information
25

Confidential interview.

<-----Page 28----->29
and communication used in non-local, often distant, interaction with external sources of
knowledge. Bathelt, Maskell and Malmberg (2005) argue that important knowledge
flows are generated through global pipelines, the advantages of which derive to firms
when pipelines feed local interpretations of knowledge that contributed to successful
firms and regions elsewhere. In the innovation process, firms need to access knowledge
flows from both local buzz and global pipelines, and successful regions are effective at
building and managing a variety of channels for accessing relevant knowledge from both
sources.
Universities play a crucial role in facilitating access to global flows of knowledge
(Kanter 1995). While scholarly international knowledge exchanges have always been
intrinsic to academic research, in the context of the global knowledge-based economy,
“world-wide linkages among universities are complex and increasingly affected by their
growing identification with national economic strategies” (OECD 1999, 52). Scientific
knowledge flows easily between researchers around the world in its codified form of
published journals and academic conferences, but additionally, new information and
communications technology has facilitated the development of international formal and
informal research networks “ranging from bilateral ties between individuals in related
departments to complex multidisciplinary networks, twinning arrangements and
institutional consortia” (OECD, 1999, 52). Consistent with the person-embodied nature
of many knowledge flows discussed above, links with global sources of knowledge are
facilitated through the attraction and retention of foreign faculty, researchers and graduate
students, who bring knowledge and maintain personal linkages from their training or
research in their home country (Gertler and Vinodrai 2005).

<-----Page 29----->30
Though this is a less central, and less often reported mechanism of knowledge
transfer in the Waterloo region, this dynamic of international knowledge exchange
through the university is definitely present. Firms cite the ability to attract and retain
talent as a major issue for future innovation and economic growth. While there is little
evidence that UW attracts talent directly into the local labour pool for firms per se, it does
attract academics on a global basis who want to work in internationally acclaimed
mathematics and engineering departments. 26 More importantly, however, through both
the exchange of codified knowledge at conferences as well as less formal networks,
academic researchers have access to cutting edge research on global basis, which they in
turn, disseminate into the local industrial community through formal and informal
research linkages. Several of the larger, global firms with robust research linkages with
both the university and government research labs, reported that having access to globally
connected academic researchers was invaluable because “it’s a great magnifier of our
insight into the global research marketplace”, they can “keep an eye on what’s current”,
and they can work with professors who “work with many people globally in areas of
expertise that we don’t have because they’re looking 5 to 10 years ahead”. Again, this
underscores the person-embodied nature of much knowledge transfer, and thus the
critical contribution of formal and informal networks of knowledge sharing among local
and non-local actors that sustains economic development in a region, which the
University of Waterloo has consistently sought to develop, promote, and support.

The Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics was established with private funding from Mike Lazaridis,
CEO of RIM, specifically to attract world class theoretical researchers to Waterloo.

“Good Community Players”: the University of Waterloo’s Engaged Entrepreneurial
Culture
“One of the things that has happened of course is that there has been a selfselection, a culture developed at the University of Waterloo, I don't think it was
managed, nobody set about to create this culture but happened and it is a culture
of innovation, valuing entrepreneurship, there is a very positive regard for
professors who had started their own companies. There was a president who
bragged about having a certain number of University professors who are
millionaires and that wasn't regarded as a negative.”

Much of the learning process that supports innovation is person-embodied in the
form of both new and experienced talent. In this sense, as argued above, supporting firmbased R&D activities and providing and attracting highly skilled and creative members of
the local labour force are among the most valuable contributions that universities make to
the process of knowledge transfer and regional economic development. However, while
many regional economies have the knowledge assets and research infrastructure that are
necessary for local economic development, they differ widely in their capacity to
mobilize these assets. The mere concentration of a critical mass of firms is not sufficient
to transform a particular locale into a vibrant and dynamic regional economy. It depends
on the ability of local actors to collaborate across geographic and social boundaries; an
‘economic community’ bound by durable, collaborative and responsive relationships
between firms, local institutions, and the community, and mediated by key people and
organizations, that afford each of these actors a sustained mutual advantage (Wolfe
2005b; Henton et al. 1997). Social capital is a critical component of dynamic regional
economies, and it can be created through the establishment of collaborative networks

<-----Page 31----->32
between business, civic and public institutions, including universities, and spearheaded
by committed and creative leadership from key people and organizations.
Some universities can, and do, provide engaged and dynamic community
leadership in building collaborative networks and institutions at the local level (Wolfe
2005b). Current research goes beyond the primary functions of providing primary
research and training of new graduates, and sees universities as important community
actors that contribute to virtuous cycles of economic growth and development (Lawton
Smith 2003a). Universities can act as facilitators of networks for innovation in local
firms by creating a “meeting ground in which seasoned professionals from the high tech
industry can rub shoulders as well as mentor less experienced scientists and entrepreneurs
as they attempt to create thriving start-ups of their own” (Betts and Lee 2005, 18-19). A
concrete example of this is research parks, which are often subsidiaries of, or affiliated
with local universities. 27 Gertler and Vinodrai (2005) characterize universities as
“anchors of creativity” that build quality of place by fostering the openness, tolerance,
and social inclusion that attracts highly skilled researchers and students, which in turn
creates a ‘buzz’ that attracts more talent; a virtuous cycle that underpins economic
competitiveness in modern societies.
Much of this multi-faceted institutional behaviour that is closely engaged with the
local economic community is captured in the concept of the “entrepreneurial research
university”. The Innovation U project provides a conceptual framework for
characterizing these types of universities, and groups their activities into three broad
functions: providing mechanisms to facilitate industry-research partnerships; acting as
27

Not all communities with a science park, however, demonstrate greater high tech employment or venture
capital funding, so science parks clearly have varying degrees of impact on the local economy (Betts and
Lee 2005).

<-----Page 32----->33
institutional enablers of entrepreneurial culture; and providing boundary spanning
structures with other local institutions and firms (Tornatzky et al. 2002). The results of
our research indicate that The University of Waterloo emerges as a salient exemplar of
this type of entrepreneurial research university, with an institutional policy that explicitly
supports innovation in all three areas.
Mechanisms and facilitators of partnerships, refers to university capacities not
only to commercialize basic research, but also to offer consulting and R&D support to
industry involving faculty on a project basis, and include industry-research partnerships,
technology transfer and commercialization facilitation, industrial extension and technical
assistance, entrepreneurial development, and industry and education training
partnerships. Universities that are successfully linked with local industry have “a robust
portfolio of industry-sponsored research and ‘customer-friendly’ structures, policies and
procedures to enable this activity” and that there is “logical, theoretical and empirical
support for the value of these kinds of partnerships” (Tornatzky et al. 2002, 17). In
addition, these universities actively support entrepreneurial activity through the provision
of programs such as business incubation services and facilities, locally based seed funds,
entrepreneurial courses and majors, and various entrepreneurially-oriented conferences
and events.
UW is singularly active in its support of entrepreneurial education and activities.
The mandate of the recently established Centre for Business, Entrepreneurship and
Technology (CBET) is to and to co-ordinate, develop, and support the several strands of
UW’s entrepreneurship activities, all of which are intended to facilitate the development

<-----Page 33----->34
of UW as an “Entrepreneurial University”. More specifically, CBET is intended to
research issues such as
how an entrepreneurial culture is created within a university, how faculty
members decide to commercialize their technology, how they commercialize their
technology, issues of the relationship between academic researchers and the
business community and issues relating to the impediments of facilitating a
transfer of technology between those two communities. 28
In terms of educational programs, it has recently launched the Master of Business,
Entrepreneurship & Technology (MBET), which attracts potential entrepreneurs from
around the world, and teaches business skills critical to identifying, exploiting, and
establishing new commercial opportunities, with an emphasis on innovative technologies.
A Bachelor (BBET) degree program is under development. Undergraduate students can
also participate in the Enterprise Co-op program where they commercialize a business
venture of their own rather than work for an existing firm. 29 Innovate Inc. is a
department within the university that provides resources and counseling to faculty and
student entrepreneurs, and aims to facilitate the commercialization of knowledge created
within the institution. Finally, The Institute for Innovation Research, affiliated with the

According to a university official, in the Enterprise Co-op Program, “a small number of students are
encouraged to start their own companies during co-op work terms and you might think that that's not going
to yield important, competitive advantage altering, leading edge technology -- not true, very often you do
get that and so you can have this huge self-selection bias where a note of 20,000 students we are
approached by 200 regard themselves as potential entrepreneurs and …then we take about 10 percent a
year of those people who think they've got it and we give them a very rough screening process where we
explain to them that this will be the toughest co-op term that they ever have had,…and then we give them a
small amount of funding, somewhere between $6000 and $8000, and then we mentor them and we insist on
them having an external business mentor that they have to go find them themselves we don't do any spoon
feeding -- so they have to have a business plan for how they're going to sustain their own
company…basically this is been very successful on a small-scale. So out of 35 students that we’re working
with now we would have 22-23 that are profitable in their little companies and some are making three times
what they would in the co-op term with another company…One young man made $100,000, one of the
strategies was OK how are you going to sustain yourself and his answer was to hire other co-op students
and become an employer. A graduation day we shook his hands and asked him how it was going and he
says ‘fantastic. I just got one and a half million dollars to take the next step’. So, this isn't kid stuff, its
serious entrepreneurship.”

Faculty of Engineering, is dedicated to the generation and dissemination of applied,
interdisciplinary research that advances understanding of entrepreneurship in technologybased enterprises, and to promoting entrepreneurship within universities.
This underscores a second function of entrepreneurial universities as institutional
enablers of culture, that share values or a “culture” that is explicitly stated in vision and
goal statements, and is supported by a formal and informal system of rewards that
encourages faculty to be involved in entrepreneurial activities (Tornatzky et al. 2002). At
UW, faculty and students are not simply informally encouraged to commercialize new
ventures or to establish links with local technology firms by the absence of administrative
or policy impediments. Rather they are actively and explicitly encouraged and supported
to do so through established policies such as the ownership of IP, and entrepreneurship
programs and linkages such as those delivered through CBET, all of which are sustained
and perpetuated by an underlying, explicitly stated, and widely shared culture of
innovative entrepreneurialism. This is manifested in a multitude of ways from
department heads and deans “preaching” to faculty that providing consulting and
problem-solving to local firms is a “duty”, to the spontaneous establishment of
networking groups – “an entrepreneur's association which started as half a dozen students
sitting around in the summer 2000 and there are now 2000 members…” – to the formal
programs already outlined.
UW is credited with singularly visionary leadership and innovation in the policy
and program design that has contributed to the region’s economic success;
I gave a talk in Toronto about just how innovative UW is – and it truly is –
everything from intellectual property policy, to the co-op program, to this new
Centre for Business Entrepreneurship, the Masters in Business Entrepreneurship.
Those are things that are just not done and certainly at the time the decisions were

<-----Page 35----->36
made they weren’t done that way anywhere else in the world, let alone
Ontario…someone had the courage to stand up to say, no, it’s not the way it’s
done anywhere else, but it’s the way it’s done here. 30
Many respondents both within the university and in local firms referred to the culture of
entrepreneurialism in the region, and the virtuous cycle of university-industry linkages it
perpetuates;
if people have entrepreneurial instincts, abilities, ambitions, because if its
outstanding record it’s the kind of place people are going to go so more and more
it’s got professors, lecturers, students – relationships that are built on the
entrepreneurship of bringing technology to market. 31
UW is seen by many as a critical player in this process and is perceived to contribute to
the “attitude, values and culture” in the region;
Starting with Coop, it became legitimate to talk to people in industry. This
produced trust, then people started talking about technical issues. And all of a
sudden people at universities found that people in industry were not dummies.
And people in industry found that university people were competent and realistic.
You can not believe what a discovery that is. 32
Finally, because they take on a larger role of external partnering, the governance
structures of entrepreneurial universities include boundary spanning structures and
systems for the purposes of managing the university-industry interface. These are
manifested in formal partnerships with local economic development organizations, where
participation occurs at all levels of the institution from senior leadership to interested
faculty and staff, as well as less formal advisory boards and councils that engage in a
variety activities designed to promote mutual learning between the university and local
industry. These types of formal partnerships between UW and the local industrial
community do exist but are less evident. One example of a formalized relationship is the

commented that there are very few formal linkages and rather UW plays “more of an
informal role. I think its just being good community players at the same time as
[providing] knowledge-based researchers.” 34
Most linkages and knowledge transfer are through person-embodied informal
relationships that embed people in the local community;
We have professors that are lecturing here and they’re out working in these
companies [which] tells me that we’ve got multiples of links every single day.
I’m not certain some of these professors think they first work for them[selves] or
they first work for [UW]. And I’m a little surprised some days because you do
find out that they are CEO of this company out there or whatever, and they’re a
fulltime tenured prof too.
The Enterprise Co-op Program relies on - and is robustly supported by - voluntary
mentoring from people in local industry to support the fledgling entrepreneurial efforts of
students. Thus, there is a shared sense of a virtuous cycle existing between the local
entrepreneurial community and the research and teaching activities of the university.

Conclusions
Regardless of whether or not firms had formal or informal links to the university,
or no links at all, most of them cited the existence of the University of Waterloo as a
critical actor in the development of the local high tech entrepreneurial economy. In fact,

a sizable number of firms report no current involvement with university research
activities, and some allude to a disconnect between the expectations of firms and the
university, suggesting that Waterloo takes a larger share of the credit than its total input
into the local economy warrants. However, even firms with tangential or no ties to the
university, such as for example, those with no other connections beyond hiring co-op
students, or those who comment simply on the international cachet of the University of
Waterloo, still cite the presence of the university as a critical contributing factor to the
strength of the regional economy. 35 On the other hand, the large number of firms that
report being heavily networked with UW describe a deeply synergistic relationship that
has emerged and endures as a result of the university being located in Waterloo.
The University of Waterloo is cited consistently as an important source of spin-off
activity, R&D resources and support, and talented and educated people, as well as formal
and informal local and global linkages that support local firms. As a result of the
interdependence of these roles, and the density of interaction with local firms, the
university is an embedded actor in the regional economy, and exists within a virtuous
feedback cycle with the local high tech community; “companies like us…were
fundamentally there because we wanted to be close to the innovative and active
environment of the university, the source of students, co-op students. It was an exciting
environment.” A consistent theme that emerges from the interviews is the perception of
the University of Waterloo’s “entrepreneurial spirit” that is perpetuated through a
virtuous cycle of deep and interactive links with the local industrial community;

Some firms stated that the only benefit to being located in the Waterloo area was the international cachet
of being located in the same city as the University, RIM and Open Text.

There is an entrepreneurial identification process students where go back and
forth to industry which gives individuals experience in industry. Faculty members
will go back and talk to their students, co-op students are enthusiastic coming
back from their terms. The University IP policy also attracts entrepreneurial
researchers interested in the IP dividend with strong commitments industry. Due
to various programs such as the co-op program the University of Waterloo has
had from the outset very strong University -- industry linkages. As a result we've
never had any major problems promoting University industry linkages as it pays
dividends in the community.
The intention of this research has been to shed light on the distinctive dynamics
at work when a university not only develops academic excellence in disciplines with
direct research applications to industry, such as software engineering, but also sets an
explicit priority to develop linkages with industry for the purposes of regional and
national economic development. To do this, we demonstrated that knowledge transfer
mechanisms from universities are far more robust than the linear process of
commercialization would suggest. The University of Waterloo stands out as a
particularly successful instance of an entrepreneurial research university that is deeply
engaged in the local high tech industrial community. Despite obvious societal benefits to
increased university-industry interaction, however, this is not to suggest that an
entrepreneurial university is in any way qualitatively superior to a traditional one.
Universities generate and disseminate knowledge as a common good. Both of these
functions co-exist at UW. Because the process of knowledge transfer into the local
economic community is multi-faceted, and largely person-embodied, universities cannot
be viewed is such a dualistic way.
