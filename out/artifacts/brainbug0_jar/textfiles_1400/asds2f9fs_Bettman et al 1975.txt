Research on multi-attribute attitude models has relied on correlational
methods. An analysis of variance paradigm applied to individual level data
supports the multiplicative assumption of multi-attribute models. A single-attribute form of the Fishbein model is found to be superior to a similar version
of the "adequacy-importance" model.

INTRODUCTION

During the past several years, one of the more
intensively studied areas in marketingand consumer
research has been multi-attributemodels of attitude
[36]. The basic proposition of these models is that
consumersform attitudestowardproductson the basis
of productattributes,a formulationwhich has considerable implicationsfor marketingstrategies. While a
variety of alternativespecifications of the multi-attribute model have been employed, the most prominent
have been the so-called "adequacy-importance"
model [10, 11, 14, 17, 31] and the approachadvocated
by Fishbein [15, 18, 22, 35]. Empirical research
directed at validating these various forms of the
multi-attributemodel has commonly been based on
cross-sectionalcorrelationdesigns, althoughmore recently individual level analysis has been strongly
advocated [ 11, 12]. This articlepresentsan alternative
approach for investigating the adequacy-importance
and Fishbein models at the individuallevel.
The Fishbein Model may be formulatedas:
(1)
Aj =
il, aibi$,
where:
Aj = attitudetoward brandj,
ai = evaluative aspect of attributei, its goodness
or badness,

n = number of attributes.

In a similar manner,the adequacy-importancemodel
may be expressed as:
(2)

A

Sinl Ii Bii,

where:
A. = attitudetoward brandj,
I = importanceweight given attributei,
B1j = belief as to the extent to which attribute i
is offered by brandj,
n = number of attributes.

Controversy has developed over which of these
modelsis morevalidfor use in marketing,and attempts
have been made to comparethe two approaches.Bass
[8], Sheth [30], Talarzyk[32], and Cohen, Fishbein,
and Ahtola [17] comparedthe models on theoretical
and practical grounds, but no empirical work was
reported in these articles. Mazis and Klippel [25]
comparedthe two models on the basis of cross-sectional analysis, using the coefficient of determination
(r2) as the criterion. They found that the adequacyimportancemodelwas slightly,but consistently, better
in terms of r2. However, as Bass and Wilkie [11]
have pointedout, cross-sectionalanalyses are subject
to many pitfalls, since individual differences can
distortresults. In addition, Birnbaum[13] has argued
forcefully that judgingmodels via correlationalprocedurescan lead to incorrectinferences, and he provides
examples in which data sets correlate better with
predictionsfrom an incorrectmodel than with predictions from the "true" model which was used to
generatethe data. Based on these considerations,the

thesis of this research is that a rigorous comparison
of the two models has not yet been reported. The
purposeof this study is to provide such a comparison.
Note that the Rosenberg [26] model is not tested,
as it has not been widely used in marketingin its
originalform.
In comparingthe models, the viewpoint taken here
is that the most realistic and theoretically consistent
approachis to analyze individuallevel data. Individual
level analysis does have limitations, of course. The
amount of data required from each individual may
be large, and since individuals are not necessarily
stable in their processes, there may be considerable
heterogeneityeven within an individual.
The crucial elements of the models are believed
to be the componentsthey employ and the composition
rulesthey assume, i.e., the way each model assumes
that individuals combine the various pieces of information measured. The important aspects of the
models' compositionrules, as expressed by the basic
algebraicassumptionsof the models, are as follows:
1. The contributionto affect for each attribute is
multiplicativefor each model; e.g., IA,B.and a,b~..
2. The powers of the terms in the product for eac3h
attribute are assumed to be 1 for both models
(althoughbeliefs-onlymodelshave been suggested,
where the power of ai or Ii is assumed to be zero).
3. The productterms, a b.. and IiBi, add over attributes to form an overall affect measure in both
models.
4. The components themselves, ai, b0, I,, and B,j,
are codedin particularways as partof the measurement process. Researchers using the Fishbein
model have typically treated a, and bi. as bipolar
(e.g., -2 to +2) scales, while adequacy-importance
model researchershave tended to treat the scales
as nonnegative(e.g., 1 to 5). Of course, differences
between the two models in terms of the coding
schemes used to assign numericalvalues to scale
responses are not inherent to the specific mathematical formulationsshown in (1) and (2) above.
Obviously,a researcherusing data gatheredunder
the Fishbeinformat could elect to code the scales
from 1 to 5, rather than -2 to +2, and likewise
for the adequacy-importancemodel. In practice,
however, much researchusing the Fishbein model
[22, 35] has treated the scales as bipolar, while
modelresearchhas coded the
adequacy-importance
scales on a unipolarbasis.
These four aspects of composition rules may be
referred to as model algebra. An examination of the

algebraic assumptions indicates that the major difference in modelalgebrabetween the two formulations
is with respect to point 4 above. This is more than
a simple coding decision, however, for important

psychologicalimplicationsare involved. For example,
Fishbeinresearchersassume that if a brandis believed
unlikelyto possess (say bij = -2) an attributewhich
is very bad (ai = -2), then the contributionto affect

is high, +4 in this case. Adequacy-importancemodel
researchers have assumed that if a brand is believed

not to possess (B11= 1, say) an attribute which is
unimportant(Ii = 1), then the contributionto affect

is low, + 1. Thus, in summary, the two major distinc-

tions between the models are: (1) the components
used; and (2) the codingrules employedby researchers
using the models.
Given these notions, a fundamental approach to
comparisonof the two models is to examine directly
how consumers appear to make decisions about (i.e.,

form attitudestoward)products,based on perceptions
of product attributes (bi or Bq.) and some sort of
importance(Ii) or evaluation(a,) associated with each
of these attributes. Given a set of consumer decisions
made with respect to a number of products, models
(1) and (2) can be used to attempt to represent the
process used in these decisions. To the extent that
one model provides a consistently better representa-

tion than the other, then there is evidence that the
componentsand model algebraof that model provide
a closer approximation to the consumer's cognitive

algebra, i.e., the composition rule the consumer
appears to use [3]. The viewpoint of this study is
that a basic approachto validationof the two competing models is to examine how homogeneously consumersrespondto the componentsusedfor each model
and to examine how well model algebra for each of
the two models correspondsto consumers' apparent
cognitive algebra, given the components used by each

model. Regardlessof what each model assumes consumers are doing, the consumers may very well be
doing somethingdifferent.
Note that the cognitive algebra used by subjects
is independent of any assumptions about coding decisions. Cognitive algebra is simply the way subjects

handle and combine the pieces of informationgiven
to them, and is an empirical phenomenon. Cognitive

algebrais cruciallyaffected by the specific components
used in the models, however. The purpose of examin-

ingthe codingassumptionsis to aid in the interpretation
of the empiricalresults. The main point of this article
is to study how subjects actually combine data, and

then to see how their behavior meshes with model
assumptions. While the major factor which affects
how subjects combine the data will likely be differences in the components used in the two models
(i.e., importanceversus evaluation, degree of belief
versus likelihood), in the interpretationof the data
relative to model algebra it becomes necessary to
examine coding distinctions.
How would one examine consumers' cognitive alge-

bra? As a first step, attention might be focused on
the multiplicationissue; i.e., to what extent is the
multiplicativeform of the multi-attributemodel representative of consumers' personal combinationrules?
Using the method developed by Anderson [2, 3, 4,
5], investigationof the multiplicationissue could be

<-----Page 3----->COGNITIVEALGEBRAIN MULTI-ATTRIBUTE
ATTITUDEMODELS

undertaken through an experiment in which subjects
are asked to handle information for a single attribute.
Suppose, for the adequacy-importance model, five
distinct levels were defined for each of the Ii and
Bij components. By combining the 5 levels on each
component, 25 distinct pairs of attribute information
could be formed. A subject could then rate his affective
reaction to (i.e., attitude toward) each pair of Ii and
B1jvalues. That is, subjects could be presented with
profiles of the form:1
You believe that BrandX is
X : : :very low
very high::.:.
in possessing a qualitywhich you personallyfeel is:
very important:_: :_:_:X: not importantat all.
To you, using BrandX would be
: : very
very favorable:__:_ :_:::_:_:_:_:
unfavorable.
Note that subjects would be given the levels of Ii
and B,i and asked to provide an affect rating. Alternatively, the product information could be presented
on scales of the form used in operationalizing the
Fishbein model. If the components and model algebra
provide a valid representation of how subjects actually
handle product information, then a definite pattern
of affect ratings should emerge from the subjects'
responses. However, the particular nature of this
pattern would be expected to differ, depending upon
how the subjects combine the information. Figure 1
illustrates the patterns of affect ratings which would

' Therehave been manymeasuresof the Bijtermused in studying
the adequacy-importancemodel. The particularmeasure used in
this study is congruentwith the definitions advanced by Wilkie
and Pessemier [36], yet differentfrom the adequacymeasureused
by Sheth and Talarzyk [31] or by Bass and Talarzyk [10]. Thus
we are speaking of adequacy-importancemodels only in some
generic sense, since the measures used differ within that class.

be expected if the theoretical models were accurately
representing subjects' information handling behavior.
The adequacy-importance model, since it assumes
multiplication of Ii and B~i, and typically assumes 1
to 5 (unipolar) coding for each component, implies
a pattern similar to the form of Figure l(a) if the
subject's cognitive algebra is equivalent to the model
algebra. For a fixed level of B i, the 5 Ii levels define
a straight line with slope Bij, and the overall pattern
of the 25 data points is a diverging fan of straight
lines in the upper right quadrant. The Fishbein model
assumes multiplication also, but the typical bipolar
coding of -2 to +2 for both ai and bijimplies a quite
different pattern. For a fixed level of bij, a straight
line with slope br1is obtained, and a pattern of the
form of Figure l(c) is found, a crossing pattern of
straight lines. These two patterns are vastly different,
as the ordinal properties of the data implied by each
differ. Although (1) and (2)(together with the related
coding decisions) imply patterns of this form, subjects'
cognitive algebra may not be adequately represented
by either model. For instance, one plausible alternative
to multiplying the two components is to add them
[4]. If subjects were adding Ii and Bij(or, alternatively,
a, and bij), a pattern of the form shown in Figure
l(b), a set of parallel lines, would be obtained. The
numerical values assigned to the components in these
graphs correspond to the coding schemes typically
used in attitude research. However, in the present
analysis, the values are assigned for illustrative
purposes only, because it is not necessary to make
any coding assumptions in order to analyze the affect
rating data. This is an important point and will be
discussed further.
In summary, the present research examines how
subjects actually combine components given to them
in developing a rating of affect. Given these results,
one can then examine the implications for the validity
of the attitude models considered. First of all, the
validity of the multiplicative assumption in the Fishbein and adequacy-importance models of attitude is
considered. The design discussed earlier allows determination of whether. subjects appear to be multiplying
the two components, as detailed in the following
sections. Second, it is important to examine the
patterns of results obtained for each of the two models.
If there is relatively greater heterogeneity of response
patterns for one model than for the other, then the
components used in that model are presumably more
ambiguous. Finally, a third issue, although of lesser
importance than the other two issues, is whether the
specific coding rules used by researchers appear to
correspond to the implicit coding (i.e., unipolar or
bipolar) carried out by subjects. The first issue can
be regarded as a partial test of the validity of the
general class of multi-attribute models, while the
second and third issues are aimed at discovering
important differences between two representative for-

<-----Page 4----->154

mulationswithin the general class of models. To the
extent that heterogeneityof response patternsoccurs
for either formulation, confidence in the validity of
the model as a representationof subjects' personal
combinationrules suffers. To the extent that subjects'
implicit coding differs from researchers' coding
schemes, confidencein these specific operationalrules
suffers, even if response patternswere homogeneous.
However, the issue of heterogeneity (and hence the
specific components used) seems more crucial for
model validity than the coding issue. This is believed
to be a much more fundamental and meaningful
approach to model validation than previous verbal
or correlationalattempts. The specific task and its
appropriatenessfor examiningthese issues are dealt
with in more detail in the following section.
METHOD
Background
The rationale and analytical technique underlying
this study are derivedfrom the informationintegration
work of Anderson and his colleagues [2, 3, 4, 5].
Anderson[2] first coinedthe term"cognitivealgebra"
to denote the algebraic models used by subjects to
combine pieces of information.In work particularly
relatedto this study, he and Shanteau[6, 28] examined
subjective utility models of the form of (1) and (2).
They found that subjects multiplied terms, but that
adding across the resulting products did not hold
exactly [6]. Tversky [34] also studied the subjective
utilitymodelandfound that multiplicationwas upheld.
Both Anderson [4] and Birnbaum[13] have argued
that factorial designs are most appropriatefor assessingsubjects'cognitivealgebra.In this formof analysis,
each term in the model is considered to be a factor
in an ANOVA design. In this study there are two
terms or factors for each model-Ii and B~jfor the
adequacy-importancemodel and a, and bi for the
Fishbein model. Five levels were defined for each
factor in both models, allowing construction of two
5 x 5 factorial designs.
The ExperimentalTask
Subjects were divided into two groups, one group
being presented with stimuli of the adequacy-importance type, the otherwith stimuliof the Fishbeintype.
Adequacy-importancesubjects rated profiles of the
type shown earlier, with 2 replicates each of the 25
profiles in the complete 5 x 5 factorial design for
a total of 50 profiles. All 50 profiles were given at
once so that replicates were given by interspersing
them within the first administration.
For the Fishbein task, each subject rated profiles of
the form:
You believe that BrandX is
_: very unlikely
very likely:_:_:X::
to possess a qualitywhich you personallyfeel is:

bad.
very good:_:_: :_:X:very
To you, using Brand X would be
very favorable:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:_:

very
unfavorable.

Once again 2 replicates each of the 25 profiles in
the 5 x 5 factorial design were rated.
Before rating the profiles, each group of subjects
was first given a warm-uptask to acquaintthem with
the factors utilized [4]. For the adequacy-importance
subjects the warm-uptask consisted of rating Ii, BiJ,
and Aj for five attributes and seven brands of
toothpaste; Fishbein subjects rated a,, bqi, and Aj

for the same attributes and brands. However, the
instructions for the profile rating tasks emphasized
that subjects were to rate a hypothetical product,
Brand X, and not toothpaste; i.e., they were asked
to consider how they would use informationon attributes for products in general. Also, subjects were
told that they should evaluate BrandX assumingthat
they had informationonly on the single attribute in
the profile, and that the two pieces of information
in the profile were intended to represent their own
feelings about the attribute,not someone else's. The
response scale used for the profiles was anchored
[4], by presenting subjects with "extreme" profiles
first, e.g.:
low
Very high:-X:_:_:_::very
Very important:X:_:_:_:_:not importantat all

Orderof the other profiles was randomized.Subjects
were undergraduatestudents enrolled in an introductory psychology course, with 85 subjects receiving
the adequacy-importancestimuli and 77 subjects receiving the Fishbein stimuli. Different subjects were
used for the two tasks because of the possible effects
of order bias and fatigue. The factorial rating task
described above differs from other ratingtasks often
used in consumer research. Hence, a discussion of
the appropriatenessof the task for the issues studied
is in order.
Appropriatenessof the Task
The first issue to be raised regardingthe task is
that multi-attributemodels are not being directly
studied;only a singleattributeis considered.However,
the results of studying a single attribute can yield
insightsinto how subjects combinecomponents;starting with a simplercase as a means for understanding
a more complex phenomenon is a common strategy
for research. One problemmay arise in that subjects
may assume values for other attributes in addition
to the informationon the single attributeactuallygiven
to them. If they assume that other attribute values
would be like the attribute presented, no problems
arise. However, if they assume other attributes are
generally positive, this could cause problems. This
point will be discussed furtherin the results section.
Any sort of configuralrelationshipamong attributes

<-----Page 5----->COGNITIVEALGEBRAIN MULTI-ATTRIBUTE
ATTITUDEMODELS

cannot be studied using the present single attribute
design. This is clearly a shortcomingand should be
the subject of future research. Althoughthe question
of combiningratingsfor more than one attributewas
not addressed in this study, Anderson and Shanteau
[6] have shown how a four-way factoral design can
be used to study models of the form a, bI + a2b21
or IIBn1 + I2B21, for example. Of course such a
four-way design presents even more complex and
numerous stimuli to the subjects. Hence it seems
reasonableto examine the simplercase first.
The second issue is the conceptualizationof the
factorial rating task. What does the task demand of
subjects, and how are they likely to react? This
seemingly basic issue has not been treated anywhere
in the literatureon human judgment to the authors'
knowledge. The most straightforwardway of conceptualizingthe task is that subjects are presented with
a particular factorial sample from the universe of
possible combinationsof ai, b1ior Ii, Bij components.
The scales used in this study for these components
have been used in previous research, and have thus
been assumed to have some meaning for subjects.
In addition, all of the combinations in the factorial
design could potentiallyoccur, i.e., none of them are
"nonsense" combinations.
The important question is how subjects respond
to the combinations, as represented in the profiles.
Subjects were told to assume that the profiles referred
to a hypotheticalproductwith hypotheticalattributes.
Since the importanceand evaluationratingsvary over
profiles, it seems clear that subjects cannot see all
the profiles as being related to the same attribute.
What does this imply about responses? There seem
to be two basic ways of conceptualizing subjects'
response modes. First, subjects may intuitively combine the componentsin a content-freemanner,without
assuming particularattributes, brands, etc. This was
the thrust of telling subjects that the attributes were
hypothetical. The second way subjects may respond
is to assume content, i.e., to imaginesome particular
product class and some particularattribute,and perhaps even a particularbrand. If this is the case, then
each subject may not even assume the same content
over the course of the task. Thus a great deal of
heterogeneitywouldbe introduced.For example, some
subjects may assume monotone (more is better) attributes and others may imagine non-monotone attributes. Although research on ideal point formulations
[8] has appeared,there is no theoryfor how responses
differ across attributes, brands, or even product
classes. Researchon both the Fishbein and adequacyimportancemodels has thus implicitlyassumed homogeneity, with all attributes and brands being treated
equally. Hence, regardless of what subjects assume,
the homogeneityassumptionimplies that there should
be no differences in combinationrules. This is indeed
a strong assumption. However, in the absence of any

155

theory of heterogeneity in the literature, it seems
reasonable.In any event, there is no reason to expect
any biases caused by the assumption to affect differentially the two models. It should downgrade the
performanceof both.
The argumentabove has been concernedwith showingthatsubjects'responsesarerelevantfor the problem
at hand regardless of any content assumed by the
subjects. Another important issue is whether the
responses have external validity. The factorial rating
task is certainlylow in mundanereality [7], and may
cause consistencies and simplerules to appearbecause
of noninvolvement. One way of claiming external
validity for the task is to note whether there are
individualdifferences in the rules subjects appear to
use for combiningthe profile information.The more
individual differences there are, the more likely it
may be that the factorial task itself is not dominating
responses, but that the particularcomponents used
(ai and b. or Ii and B1.) are influencingthe results.
A second argumentin favor of the factorial approach
is based on past empiricalresults. Anderson and his
colleagueshave been able to verify theoreticalmodels
in diverse areas by using the factorial task, and more
importantly, the theoretical models examined have
involved differentcognitive algebra:multiplying[28],
adding and averaging [4], ratio models [2], and so
forth. This implies that the task does not bias the
form of the cognitive algebra, althoughthe task may
cause an upwardbias in the consistency of subjects.
On the whole, therefore, although there are some
problems, some degree of external validity seems
present.
It has been argued that subjects' responses can be
meaningfully studied to examine cognitive algebra.
It remainsto be shownthatthe responsesare applicable
for studyingthe particularmodels of interest, Fishbein
and adequacy-importance.The technique is equally
relevantto both models where the dependentmeasure
is some supposed interval scale of affect [11, 14,
22, 25, 31, 35]. In this case the assumptionis implicitly
madeby the modelerthateach attributemakes comparablecontributionsto affect. This assumptionof equal
contributionto affect is not made in those cases where
the adequacy-importancemodel has been used to
predictpreferenceranking[9, 10]. In fact, if the major
concern is to predict order of preference among a
set of brands in a static situation, the analyses in
this article are not totally relevant, since importance
is fixed for each attribute among the set of brands.
Thus all that is relevant is the relationship between
B j and subjects' affect ratingsas B1 changesfor fixed
Ii. However, in attitude change situations where an
attribute'simportanceratingis altered [22], the results
are quite relevant. For example, assume that attribute
i has low importance(Ii = 1), and a particularbrand
has a low degree of possession (B, = 1). Because
of advertisingor other factors, attribute i undergoes

<-----Page 6----->156

a change in importanceto high importance(Ii = 5)
for some segment of the population. The adequacyimportancemodelwould predictthat people for whom
the importancewas changed would tend to rank the
brand higher than people for whom importancewas
not changed, assuming comparable importance and
perception scores for the other attributes. This is
nonintuitive; if a brand does not possess a very
importantattribute, it should be less desirable than
a brand perceived as not possessing an unimportant
attribute.Clearlythe task of this study is not strictly
testing for this effect, but even for the rank-order
case of adequacy-importance
models the task is somewhatrelevant.However, since the static case is studied
here, the results presented later should be viewed
as mainlyrelevantto the case where an intervalaffect
measure is used, as has been the case for a good
deal of research on both models.
Thus the task seems relevantand valid for studying
both the adequacy-importanceand Fishbein models.
Again, it should be emphasized that the main focus
of the article is how individualscombine information.
For that purpose, the assumptions made by model
buildersabout appropriatescale codes for the model's
componentsare irrelevant.However, to draw conclusions from the results about the appropriatenessof
a particularmodel, the modeler's assumptions must
be examined, as done earlier. The next section addresses the question of how subjects' ratings can be
analyzedto yield insightintohow pieces of information
are combined, i.e., the subjects' cognitive algebra.
Classificationof CognitiveAlgebra
Although subjects perform either an adequacyimportance task or a Fishbein task, their cognitive
algebra may not correspond to that theoretically implied by the task. Thus it is importantto distinguish
between the type of task performedand the type of
cognitive algebra employed. For example, subjects
receivingthe adequacy-importancestimulimightyield
data plots of the form of Figure l(c). A variety of
other possibilities might also exist which could be
classified and examined.
Each of the theoretical models implies a set of
statistical properties and a particulargraphicalform
for the affect ratingsin the task given. These statistical
properties and graphicalanalyses were employed to
develop a number of categories into which subjects
were classified. To some extent the categories were
developed ex post, after the data had been collected,
as it became clear that categories not suggested from
the simple coding and combination rules were of
considerableimportance.
In analyzing the rating data, the assumption of
interval scale affect measures was made. This is a
crucial but necessary assumption since the unipolar
multiplyingmodel and the adding model of Figures
l(a) and l(b) cannot be distinguished on the basis

JOURNALOF MARKETINGRESEARCH,MAY 1975

of ordinaldata [21]. Green [19] has discussed uses
of MONANOVA to transformdata to additivity to
attemptremovalof interactions.Such transformations
were not used for several reasons. First, one of the
most crucial distinctionsto be drawnis between data
of the form shown in Figure l(a) and that of Figure
l(c), and the crossover interactionof l(c) cannot be
removedby monotonetransformation.Second, in past
research using the models tested here interval scale
data have been assumed for the affect measure in
many cases. Third, within-individualanalyses were
performed,meaningthatno interpersonalcomparisons
were undertaken.Finally, Anderson has argued that
with the use of the anchoringandwarm-upprocedures
discussed earlier, the success of his algebraicmodels
lends credence to treating ratings as interval scales
[4].
The basis for all of the statistical tests is analysis
of varianceappliedto the ratingdataof each individual
subject. Since there are two entries per cell, the
statistical significance of both main effects and the
interactionterm can be tested. Note that the ANOVA
approachrequiresonly the assumptionthat the dependentvariableis an intervalscale. No assumptionsneed
be madeaboutthe scalingof the independentvariables.
This is important, since the models examined are
multiplicativemodels. The results obtainedfrom such
models are not invariantif both the components have
only intervalscaling and they are actually multiplied.
Having both components ratio-scaled is necessary.
Hence, approachesusing a priori scales for the components have severe problems, since subjects presumably do not provide ratio-scaled ratings of such
componentsas importanceor evaluation. Thus multiattributemodels seem to require more sophisticated
datathansubjectscanprovide. However, the ANOVA
approachavoids this problem since subjects are not
asked to rate the components.Thus the patterns of
responses can be examined without attacking this
scaling issue. These patterns are strictly an empirical
issue relatingto subjects' implicituse and coding of
the components, and not related to this scaling issue
per se. In fact Anderson [3] uses the subjects'
responses to derive scales rather than assume them
a priori.However, to reiterate,scalingof the independentvariablesis not the presentfocus; it is unnecessary
in orderto determinethe model forms discussed later.
Only assumptions about the dependent variable, affect, arenecessaryfor this purpose.Codingand scaling
considerationsare useful for interpretingthese model
forms, however.
As indicatedpreviously, both statisticaland graphical criteria were used to develop the categories.
However, the statisticalcriteriawhich were employed
variedto some extent; for certaincategoriesit seemed
appropriateto employconventionalsignificancelevels
(a = .05), while for others the amount of explained
varianceas measuredby J(2was employed [19, 20].

The particularreasons for choice of criteria will be
discussed as the categories are presented. Before
proceedingto the descriptionof the categories,it seems
useful to show an example of the raw data which
were analyzed and the results of the ANOVA based
on these data. This illustrationmay help to clarify
some of the discussion to follow. Table 1 shows the
dataand the ANOVA for Subject 113, who performed
the Fishbein task. In the top portion of the table are
the affect ratingsfor each combinationof evaluation
and belief levels, with each entry representing the
mean of the two replicates. The bottom portion of
the table shows the ANOVA. These data are graphed
in Figure 5(a).
CognitiveAlgebra Categories
CategoryI-No SignificantEffects- "No Effects."
Subjects falling into this category have no significant
effects for either the treatments or the interaction.
They either act randomlyor concentrate their affect
ratingsat a single level. As a groupthey are essentially
uninterestingand their ratings may result from low
task involvement.
Category 2-Significant Main Effects-"Adding
Model." Subjects in this category have either one
or both maineffects significant,buthave no significant
interaction effects. Their data plots correspond to
Figure l(b), i.e., a set of parallellines. The underlying
theoreticalmodel impliedis additionof terms.

interactionconcentratedin the linearx linear(bilinear)
component of the interaction, with a single degree
of freedom [3, 6, 28]. The total sum of squares for
interaction,with 16 degrees of freedom, can be partitionedinto this bilinearterm with 1 degree of freedom
and a residualterm with 15 degrees of freedom. The
appropriatetest, therefore, is for a significantinteraction, and a nonsignificantresidualinteraction[ 19, 24,
33]. The data correspondto the plot in Figure l(a),
i.e., a divergingfan of straightlines in the upper right
quadrant.The underlyingtheoretical model is multiplication of data coded in a unipolarfashion, which
corresponds to the assumptions of the adequacyimportancemodel. The basic principleunderlyingthis
categoryis that in combininginformationby multiplying, holdingone factor constant produces data which
are a straight line in the other factor; hence, the
emphasisis on the linearby linear(bilinear)interaction
term. For computationaldetails, see [4, p. 157].
Category4-Major Portion of Explained Variance
in Interaction- "BipolarMultiplyingModel." In this
category the first departureis made from the use of
significance levels as criteria. The rationale is as
follows: for the underlying theoretical model, the
bipolar multiplyingmodel in Figure l(c), there is an
unambiguousprediction that all explained variance
(as measured by

&2)

should be concentrated in the

interaction. The prediction for this model contrasts
with that of the unipolarmultiplyingmodel for which
there is no a priori basis for assigning explained
variance, except to say that it should be distributed
among the treatment effects and the interaction.
Whereas the use of a standardsignificance level is
a sensible procedurefor defining the category corresponding to the unipolar multiplying and adding
models, the use of explained variancefor the bipolar
multiplyingmodel gives additionalinformationabout
the data. It is a particularlyappropriateprocedure
in view of the nature of the data. There were cases
in whichboth maineffects were significant(in addition
to the significant interaction), yet the amount of
explained variance in the interactionwas over 70%,
while in total the two main effects accounted for less
than 10%.In such cases the data plots were virtually
indistinguishablefrom those in which there were no
significantmain effects, but a significant interaction.
For those reasons, it seemed reasonable to develop
criteriabased upon explained variance.
The particularcriteria which had to be met for
inclusionin this category were as follows: the amount
of explained variancein the interaction,as measured
by C2, had to be at least 35%, and in addition, had
to be at least 3 timesgreaterthanthe explainedvariance
for each maineffect taken separately.Althoughthese
criteriaare purely judgmental,an examinationof the
characteristics of subjects placed in this category,
which will be discussed shortly, lends credence to
the particularparameterschosen.

Category 5-Major Portion of Explained Variance
in One Main Effect and the Interaction- "Asymmetric
Multiplying Model." Subjects in this category have
one strong main effect which explains roughly the
same proportion of the variance as does the interaction.
The specific criteria formulated were that 0d2for one
main effect was less than 10% of the total cO2,and
further, was less than 25% of the C2 for the other
main effect. Such data were not predicted from the
simple coding and combination rules discussed earlier.
Graphical presentation of this model and discussion
of its implications are presented later.
Category 6-Significant Main Effects, Significant
Interaction Not Concentrated in the Bilinear Term"Curvilinear Multiplying Model." Subjects in this
category have two significant main effects, but tests
of the interaction showed a significant residual interaction after the bilinear term was extracted. This
category is clearly related to Category 3. The major
distinction between them is nonlinearity which is
present in this model, but not in the unipolar multiplying model. In addition, the amount of explained
variance in each main effect is sufficiently large
relative to that in the interaction, so that subjects
are not classified into Categories 4 or 5. Since data
of this type were not predicted from the simple coding
and combination rules discussed earlier, graphical

presentation and psychological interpretation are undertaken later.
"
Category 7--"Unclassified.
Subjects in this category have data which do not meet the criteria of any
of the categories discussed. Essentially they have
relatively low total explained variance, yet they also
have effects which reach significance. Since they are
few in number, they will not be discussed further.
These classification rules are relatively complex,
but are necessary to classify fully subjects' cognitive
algebra patterns. In addition, some of the rules used
are clearly arbitrary. However, this is the first attempt
at developing a classification scheme of this sort, and
a rough categorization is thus unavoidable.
RESULTS
The results of the study are shown graphically in
Figures 2 to 7 and summarized in Table 2. Two
measures of reliability of subjects' ratings are presented in Table 2-YW2, the total variance accounted for
by the ANOVA, and r, the product-moment correlation
between the two sets of 25 ratings. Note in Table
2 the particularly important point that the homogeneity
of response patterns, as indicated by the distribution
of subjects over categories, is relatively much greater
for the Fishbein task than for the adequacy-importance
task. The structure of these individual differences was

certainly not predicted, and will be considered later.
One further issue should be discussed concerning
graphical presentation of the rating data. Anderson
[3, 4, 6] uses what he calls functional measurement
to obtainsubjectivescale values for the stimulusfactor
levels which are then used to aid in plotting the data.
The details are given in Anderson and Shanteau [6];
the basic idea is that the row and column averages
of the subject's rating data provide scale values for
the levels of each factor (see [27] for a dissenting
view). If the factor used for the horizontal axis in
plotting the data is spaced on the horizontal axis
accordingto these functional scales, the form of the
model becomes more apparent.However, this is true
only for those cases which satisfy the adding or
unipolarmultiplyingmodel. Departuresfromthe model
infirmthe scale values. Thus, to providecomparability
across data plots, all graphs were plotted as if the
levels of the independent variables (factors) were
intervally spaced from 1 to 5 on the horizontal axis.
These are only labels for the graphs, however. As
discussed above, specific scale values for the independent variablesneed not be assumedin orderto analyze
the data.
Figure 2 graphs the summary data from the two
ratingtasks. The data from the adequacy-importance
task exhibit the divergingfan pattern,which is characteristic of the unipolar multiplying model's algebra,
although there appears to be a distinct nonlinearity
in the data, as evidenced by its curvilinear nature
for low levels of B . The data from the Fishbein
task clearly exhibit the bipolar multiplying effect
requiredby the Fishbein model, althoughsome asymmetryis present. Based on the results of this aggregate
level analysis, it might be concluded that both the
adequacy-importancemodel and the Fishbein model
are reasonably valid representations of consumer
decision rules. In both cases, the multiplicativeform
of the multi-attributemodel appears to have been
supported. However, the intent of this research is

159

to examine behavior at the individual level, since
heterogeneity of response patterns is an important
criterionfor model validity; accordingly, the various
categoriesidentifiedin the datawill now be discussed.
Figure 3 shows the data of subjects who satisfied
the criteria for an adding model. The plot in 3(a) is
for a typicalsubject, while 3(b)and 3(c)arethe grouped
data for subjects who received the adequacy-importance and Fishbein tasks, respectively. Both of the
summaryplots correspondwell to the theoreticalplot

The graphs in Figure 5 are data for subjects who
satisfied the criteria for the bipolar multiplying model.
A typical subject data plot is shown in 5(a), while
5(b) and 5(c) show data for 11 adequacy-importance
subjects and 44 Fishbein subjects respectively. All
plots correspond well to the theoretical graph of Figure
1(c). Table 2 indicates the high proportion of explained
variance attributable to the interaction relative to the
main effects.
The results above show that only 14 subjects (17%)
followed the underlying theoretical model for the
adequacy-importance task, while 44 subjects (57%)
appeared to utilize a bipolar multiplying model for
the Fishbein task. This difference is highly significant
(X2 = 29.1, d.f. = 1, p < .001). Even under the very

conservative assumption of ordinal equivalence, in

which case the adding models of Category 2 are
combined with the unipolar multiplying models for
the adequacy-importance task, the Fishbein model still
performs significantly better (X2 = 5.4, d.f. = 1, p
< .05). Further, for the adequacy-importance task
11 subjects acted as though they were using a bipolar
multiplying model, while for the Fishbein task only
3 subjects appeared to be following the unipolar
multiplying model. Thus, not only is there relatively
more heterogeneity for the adequacy-importance
model, but the coding implied by subjects' responses
differs from that of the model, as it is typically
operationalized.
Figure 6 shows the data for subjects satisfying the
criteria of the asymmetric model, 6(a) being for a
typical subject, while 6(b) and 6(c) are grouped data
for the two tasks. Fourteen subjects from the adequacy-importance task and four from the Fishbein
task are involved. It should be noted that for these
plots the horizontal axis corresponds to the stimulus
scale for which the main effect was very small (impor-

tance for the adequacy-importancetask and belief for
the Fishbein task-see Table 2). The plots form
divergingfans of straight lines and are symmetrical
about a line drawnparallelto the X-axis. If the scales
are reversed, the plots look quite different, forming
a narrow crossing pattern running from the bottom
left to top right of the graph.
This particularcategory is interestingfor two reasons. First the main effect which accounts for high
explained variance differs for the two tasks. The
adequacy component demonstrates a strong main
effect for the adequacy-importancetask, while the
evaluationcomponent exhibited the strong effect for
the Fishbein task. (Within each task all subjects in
this category had the same strong main effect.) The
former result is particularly interesting in light of
previous researchon a hybridof the adequacy-importance model advocatedby Sheth [29], which has been
labeled the "beliefs-only" model. Some studies have
reportedrathersubstantialcorrelationsfor this model
[16, 23], so it seems more than mere coincidence
that the adequacy factor, rather than the importance
factor, was the one which exhibited a main effect
in the AsymmetricMultiplyinggroup.
A second observation is that the pattern of data
shown in Figures6(b) and 6(c) is exactly what would
be expected if subjects had coded one of the two
types of informationon a bipolarbasis and the other
as unipolar before "multiplying." In the figure, the

horizontal axis corresponds to the dimension which
was apparentlytreated in a unipolarfashion. Thus,
it appears that the 13 adequacy-importance task sub-

jects falling into this group treated importance as
unipolar, while the 4 Fishbein task subjects treated
likelihood on a unipolar basis. These results, while
characterizing only a relatively small portion of the
total sample, may serve to point out sources of

<-----Page 11----->161

ATTITUDEMODELS
COGNITIVEALGEBRAIN MULTI-ATTRIBUTE

ambiguity in the two models as they are currently
operationalized.There are alternative interpretations
of this pattern of results: for instance, subjects may
have "coded" both scales from -1 to +3, instead
of -2 to +2 as the Fishbein model assumes, or 1
to 5, as the adequacy-importancemodel assumes; or
subjects assumedwhen given an unimportantattribute
that the brand was moderately acceptable on other
attributes not presented and took this into account
in their ratings. However, the interpretationgiven is
more favorable to the adequacy-importancemodel,
and hence more conservative given the conclusions,
since it assumed only one scale is treated as bipolar
ratherthan both.
It is now fairlyclearthat a relativelylargeproportion
of the subjectsin the adequacy-importance
task treated
the adequacy stimuli as bipolarrather than unipolar.
Eleven subjects in the bipolar multiplying category
and 13 more in the asymmetricmultiplyingcategory
fit this description, meaning that over 40% of the
subjects treated the adequacy data differently than
the typical operationalizationof the adequacy-importance model.
Also, considerablecontroversy has surroundedthe
importance component of the adequacy-importance
model [28]. Present results indicate that the mixed
findings related to this component may be traced to
individualdifferences in how subjects treat a scale
rangingfrom "not importantat all" to "very important." While some may view the scale as intended
by the researcher, other subjects appear to treat the
scale as something akin to a scale whose end points
should read "very important (not to have the attribute)" to "very important (to have the attribute)."
The latter scale is clearly bipolarin nature, while the
former is unipolar. The fact that there appears to
be some ambiguity in how subjects interpret the
importancescale suggests further work on the development of a reliableand valid measureof this component is necessary. This component very probablyled
to the greater heterogeneityof response patterns for
the adequacy-importancemodel.
Finally, analogous to the above arguments, there
is some indicationthat subjects have difficulty interpreting the "likely-unlikely" scale used to operationalize the b j component in the Fishbein model.
This finding is in agreement with previous research
[22], and Ahtola [ 1] has arguedthatto treatsubjective
probabilities(whichis what b ijrepresentstheoretically)
as bipolar is inappropriate.The fact that the overwhelming majority of subjects in the Fishbein task
tended to treat the likelihood measure as bipolar is
somewhatsurprising,since intuitivelylikelihoodwould
seem to be a unipolarconstruct. One plausibleexplanation for this phenomenon is that subjects were
engagingin cognitive balancing,ratherthan cognitive
adding, which is the basis for the Fishbein model
[1]. However, the test this hypothesis would require

an attitude change paradigm,which was beyond the
scope of this research.
Finally, Figure7 shows the datafor subjects satisfying the criteria of the curvilinearmultiplyingmodel,
7(a) being for a typical subject, and 7(b) for grouped
data for the 18 adequacy-importancesubjects. Only
two Fishbein subjects satisfied the criteria.The plots
show, as expected, some relationshipto those of Figure
4, the unipolarmultiplyingmodel. The suggestion of
a divergingfan of straightlines is present, but there
is a markedcurvilinearityat low levels of adequacy
(B0i).In all cases the data show that at low importance
levels, affect was either low and constant, or low
and increasingas belief increased; but, at low levels
of belief, the affect value was initiallylow, rose, and
thenfell againas importanceincreased.The suggestion
of this pattern is present even in the summary of
the unipolarmultiplyingmodel, Figure 4(b).

The reason for such results under the adequacyimportancetask becomes clear upon examination of
the algebraicassumptionsunderlyingthe model. The
adequacy-importancemodel assumes that an attribute
for which belief of possession is very low (Bij = 1)
but is very important (Ii = 5) will contribute more

to affect than an attributefor which belief of possession is very low (Bij = 1) but which is not important
at all (Ii = 1), since (5)(1) > (1)(1). (Again, note that

these numbersare used as examples of typical scale
values used in previous research, not as scale values
assumed for this study. Scale values need not be
assumedfor the ANOVA.) This predictionis nonintuitive to say the least, and subjects in this category
reactedin a way counterto this model algebraassumption. Again, recall that this argument is not strictly
applicableto the cases wherethe adequacy-importance
model has been used for rankingalternatives rather
than predictingan affect rating.

The presence of the curvilinear effect in Figure
4(b) for the unipolarmultiplyingmodel suggests that
the adequacy-importance
modelhad this problemeven
for subjects who fulfilled the statistical criteria for
the adequacy-importancemodel's cognitive algebra.
Thus the curvilinearcategory contains subjects who
essentially multiplybut who show even more marked
deviations from linearity at low levels of belief than
the unipolarmultiplyingsubjects.
The total set of results is complex, so the implications are now summarized.One of the purposes of
the present research was to examine the validity of
the multiplicativeassumptionsunderlyingthe general
class of multi-attributeattitude models by using a
simplified single-attributetask. From Table 2 it can
be seen that a relatively large numberof the subjects
in both tasks (66%for the adequacy-importancetask
and 69%for the Fishbeintask) were essentially behaving as though they multiplied the 2 components of
the model. This finding can be regarded as strong
supportfor the validityof the generalclass of models,
insofar as the single-attributetask yields information
about the multi-attributecase.
A second purpose was to examine the differences
between the components and coding used for the
Fishbein model and the adequacy-importancemodel
in terms of (1) the heterogeneityof subjects' response
patterns, and (2) the data coding procedures subjects
apparently used in the task correspondingto each
model. While there were virtually the same number
of "multipliers"among the subjects engagingin the
respective tasks, there is clear evidence in Table 2
that the cognitive algebrapatternof the Fishbein task
subjects was much more homogeneous than that of
the adequacy-importancetask subjects. Also, the
typical coding rules of the Fishbein model seem more
representativeof subjects' implicit coding rules than
those of the adequacy-importancemodel. Of the
subjects classified into the 4 multiplyingcategories,
only 25%fit the assumed model (unipolarmultiplying)
under the adequacy-importancetask, while 83% fell
into the appropriatecategory (bipolarmultiplying)in
the Fishbein task. Furthermore, nearly 25% of the
adequacy-importancetask subjects were classified as
bipolarmultiplying,but only 3 subjects in the Fishbein
task fit the unipolarmultiplyingcategory.
From this pattern of results, it is clear that the
type of cognitive algebra a person appears to use is
affected substantiallyby the scales used to measure
cognitive constructs. Unfortunately, it is impossible
to know which way of representing cognitive constructs correspondswith "truth." Therefore, reliance
mustbe placed on externalcriteriasuch as homogeneity of response patterns across subjects and the ultimate usefulness of the model, as operationalized,to
the policy-maker.Based on these criteria,the Fishbein
form of the model seems relatively superior to the
adequacy-importancemodel. This conclusion is based

JOURNALOF MARKETINGRESEARCH,MAY 1975

on the more homogeneouspatternof responses exhibited by subjects in the Fishbein task. Of course there
is still heterogeneitywithineach task, so these conclusions are only relative, not absolute. In addition, the
subjective coding apparentlyused by subjects corresponds well with the coding typically used in the data
analysisstagefor the Fishbeintask. Thusthe marketing
managercan utilize the Fishbeinmodel with considerably more confidence than he can the adequacyimportancemodel where he wishes to predict affect.
If he wishes to predict only the rank order of brands,
the resultsdo not speak directlyto the issue; however,
it may be argued, as above, that these results should
give cause for thoughteven in the latter case.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate individualdifferences in subjects' combination rules. This implies that the task
does have some degree of realism, since different
rules were shown. However, future research should
moredirectlyexamine this issue. Lack of involvement
in the task may lead to simple additive rules; this
could be checked by attemptingto manipulatedegree
of involvementand examiningthe resulting cognitive
algebra types. Also, one could attempt to study
whether the factorial task forced consistency in subjects' responses by interruptingthe task and determining the effect of the interruptionon the resultant
cognitive algebratypes.
An important advantage of the ANOVA method
is that it allows the study of individual differences
in handlinginformationnot easily undertakenin the
typical correlationaldesign. The study of individual
differences reported here is one contributionof this
study to the methodology of informationintegration
research. This issue has been essentially ignored by
Anderson [4], as his work has usually involved small
numbersof subjects. Individualdifferences analysis
could be an importanttool for examiningissues such
as whether subjects combine the informationfor all
attributesin the same fashion;this was simplyassumed
earlier, since there are no relevant data or theory. It
may be true that subjects use different combination
rules for different subsets of attributes. This seems
to be a fruitfulareafor furtherresearch.One additional
contributionto the methodology of information integration studies is in the use of t)2 as a criterion
for selecting model types. It is believed that this study
is the first to use 6C2in this manner.
Finally, there are significant results for attitude
research.Again,these results are subjectto the caveats
thatonly singleattributeswere used andthatthe results
are relevant more for models attempting to predict
affect than for models predicting rank preferences.
Given these limitations,the mainfindingsare twofold:
(1) there is considerablesupportfor the multiplicative
form of multi-attributemodels, although there is a
significantproportionof the populationwhich appears

to use some other form of data handling strategy;
and (2) the Fishbein model represents the cognitive
algebra of subjects relatively better than the adequacy-importance model since there is greater homogeneity of response in the Fishbein task. The evidence
also points strongly to the conclusion that the cognitive
components of the Fishbein model (i.e., ai and bi.)
are indeed treated in a bipolar manner and multiplied,
as assumed by the Fishbein model algebra.
For the adequacy-importance model the evidence
points to the conclusion that the scales used to operationalize the model are ambiguous. Even those subjects
who appeared to treat both stimuli as unipolar exhibited
curvilinearity in their data. As indicated in the previous
section, their behavior, while not following model
algebra, is nonetheless intuitively reasonable.
The weight of the evidence, then, seems to indicate
that the Fishbein components are less ambiguous than
the adequacy-importance model components, and that
the Fishbein model algebra corresponds to subjects'
cognitive algebra more closely than adequacy-importance model algebra. The adequacy importance model,
with its typical unipolar coding scheme, makes very
nonintuitive assumptions about high importance-low
belief items, and the nature of importance itself as
a unipolar rather than bipolar scale seems to cause
problems. Most subjects were able to deal with "very
bad" in the Fishbein task, but many subjects seemed
uncertain about how to deal with "not at all important"
in the adequacy-importance task. Thus, in terms of
an approach to validation using individual subject
patterns of information combination as the data. the
Fishbein approach to attitudes seems to be relatively
more valid. Cohen, Fishbein, and Ahtola [16] have
argued conceptually why this is so, and the data of
the study presented here seem to bear out their
arguments.
This finding is particularly important for marketing
applications of these models, because the real issue
is that subjects respond much more heterogeneously
to the adequacy-importance task than to the Fishbein
task. If cross-sectional analyses are to be used in
real applications, then presumably one should try to
minimize any controllable sources of heterogeneity.
The results presented here imply that one should use
the Fishbein approach to do this. This could be
particularly important if the model is being used in
a disaggregated sense for diagnosis.
