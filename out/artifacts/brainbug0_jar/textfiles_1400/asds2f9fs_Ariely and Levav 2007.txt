<-----Page 0----->Sequential Choice in Group Settings: Taking
the Road Less Traveled and Less Enjoyed
DAN ARIELY

Many individual decisions take place in a group context wherein group members
voice their choices sequentially. In this article we examine the impact of this dynamic decision process on individuals’ choices and satisfaction with their outcomes.
We propose that choices reflect a balancing of two classes of goals: goals that
are strictly individual and goals that are triggered by the existence of the group.
The latter sometimes results in choices that undermine personal satisfaction and
increase regret. We find support for goal balancing in three studies in which we
tracked consumers’ orders of dishes and drinks. In the Lunch study we found that
real groups (tables) choose more varied dishes than would be expected by random
sampling of the population of all individual choices across all tables. The Beer
study demonstrates that this group-level variety seeking is attributable to the interaction—implicit or explicit—among group members, and can be dissipated when
the group is forced to “disband” and its members make strictly individual choices.
Finally, the Wine study demonstrated that individual choices in a group context
are also aimed at satisfying goals of information gathering and self-presentation
in the form of uniqueness.

W

e begin with a true story of a brunch honoring a
colleague who had recently accepted an academic
position at a west coast university. To celebrate this joyous
occasion, we chose a restaurant that was highly
recommended but that most of us had never visited. While
perusing the rich menu, one of the authors was
contemplating two options: a French toast platter and a
pancake platter. Both seemed attractive. However, when
another member of the party requested the pancakes, the
author in question decided to order the French toast. Why
did the choice of one diner affect the choice of another?
Indeed, do choices differ when made sequentially in a group
context? In this article we study the goals and motives that
may prompt individuals’ choices in a sequence to differ from
choices made in other decision settings.
Research in consumer behavior and social psychology has

produced ample evidence that the decisions and judgments
of individuals in a group are dependent upon the decisions
and judgments of other group members such that choice or
opinion shifts are induced (for a review, see Levine and
Moreland 1998). For instance, Asch’s (1955) classic
experiment on judgments of line lengths showed high levels
of social conformity despite the existence of a correct
response to the task. His findings were later qualified by
Deutsch and Gerard (1955), who attributed shifts in
judgment or choice to an adherence to norms (normative
social influence) or acceptance of persuasive arguments
(informational social influence). Thereafter, the notion of
normative and informational social influence has served as
the primary paradigm guiding research on choice and
judgment shifts (see, e.g., Burnkrant and Cousineau 1975;
Herr, Kardes, and Kim 1991; Kaplan and Miller 1987;
Levine and Moreland 1998; Moscovici 1985; Myers and
Lamm 1976). One emergent proposition is that the type of
influence will depend upon the decision task. For instance,
Kaplan and Miller (1987) suggest that normative influence
should predominate for judgmental tasks such as dish
selection in a restaurant, while informational influence
should dictate judgment or choice for intellective tasks, such
as solving problems, that have a single correct solution.
The preponderance of evidence indicates that the
prevailing outcome of group-influence situations is choice
and opinion convergence (Festinger 1950; Levine and
Moreland 1998). Mackie and Goethals (1987) ascribe this

to an isomorphism between individual and group goals.
They characterize the interaction between an individual and
his group as “pervaded by an atmosphere of ambivalence”
(p. 148; see also Thibaut and Kelley 1958). The ambivalence
is a consequence of the recognition by both the group and
the individual that they are interdependent for mutual goal
satisfaction, and that this interdependence represents a
conflict that necessitates compromise. Indeed, Mackie and
Goethals (1987) believe that there is a meaningful distinction
between individual goals and group goals. This distinction
is pertinent to the group-influence literature because
researchers have often focused on situations wherein the
group is tasked with producing a single output from the
totality of the individuals’ inputs. For instance, studies of
jury decision making (see, e.g., Kaplan 1987) examine the
process groups use to reach a single verdict from multiple
opinions. Similar qualifications apply to research about
group polarization (e.g., Isenberg 1986), groupthink (Janis
1982), and competition versus cooperation (e.g., Deaux
1996). In consumer research, Corfman and Lehmann (1993)
support the notion of group and individual goals by showing
that others’ welfare is taken into account when making a
group decision. Other studies have analyzed the result of
group influence on one individual’s decision in cases where
an individual is exposed to judgments of others (Asch 1955),
in purchases of luxuries and necessities (Bearden and Etzel
1982), and where word-of-mouth information is available
(Herr et al. 1991).
An examination of our opening anecdote reveals a pair
of subtle, yet significant, differences between the celebratory
brunch and traditional work on social influence. In contrast
to research about single group decisions, the output of the
decision-making process in our restaurant example
corresponds exactly to the inputs provided by individual
group members—the “group decision” is really just a
sequence of the individuals’ choices. Second, as opposed
to previous studies on the effect of group influence on a
single person’s choice, our study does not use confederates
or manipulate the nature of the group in order to test its
effect on a single individual. Instead, we study a natural
situation where multiple, interdependent individual
decisions occur in an environment whose effect is contingent
on the actual choices made by each group member. This is
quite different from the previous approach because it allows
us to investigate how the constraints introduced by the group
influence the dynamics of the decision-making process.
Mackie and Goethals’s (1987) notion of individual and
group goals is static, and thus must be altered to suit our
setup. We suggest that the two general goal classes or
motivations most applicable in our case are individual-alone
goals and individual-group goals. The former are goals of
the individual that are independent of the presence of others
(e.g., satisfying one’s own taste), while the latter are
contingent on choices made by other group members or are
only induced because of the existence of a group context
(e.g., the desire to portray oneself as interesting and unique).
These two goal classes can have interesting implications

because the group context (or contingency) sometimes
forces them into direct conflict, such that fulfilling different
goals is achieved by choosing different alternatives. For
instance, the dessert that a consumer likes best might portray
him as less unique if a majority of the group has already
ordered it. We conjecture that consumers resolve this conflict
through a goal-balancing process in which they weigh the
importance of each goal class, yielding a choice that reflects
a trade-off and implicit acceptance or rejection of the
constraints the goal classes impose. Thus, the consumer in
our example might decide to underplay individual-only
goals and pick the dessert that makes him seem unique. At
the group level, goal balancing can yield two patterns of
choice: group uniformity and group variety seeking. Group
uniformity represents a tendency for individual choices to
converge on a single alternative. Conversely, group variety
seeking is a tendency for choices to diverge and include
varied alternatives. In this article we investigate the grouplevel outcome that results from the goal balancing
undertaken by the individual group member when making
decisions in a sequence.
It is important to note that our aim in introducing the goal
classes was to make the simple conceptual point that the
importance of certain goals is often contingent on the
decision environment. However, “goal class” is simply a
generic name for a category of goals and is therefore too
broad to generate specific hypotheses about the outcome of
choice behavior. Mackie and Goethals (1987) articulate three
specific goal types that they consider important for
understanding the tension between individual and group
goals. “Utilitarian goals” represent the need for “tangible
outcomes” (p. 146). “Knowledge goals” presume that
individuals in a group are interdependent in their quest to
acquire information about the world. Finally, “identity
goals” assume that individuals desire to understand
themselves and their reality in order to form an ego identity
and establish a positive sense of self. We adapt the
definitions of these goal types to a consumer decision
setting, and add a fourth goal type (minimizing regret and
avoiding losses) that has traditionally been important in
consumer research and is relevant to the group context under
study. In the next section we detail some of the major goals
that individual consumers attempt to satisfy when making
choices in a group context. We will also speculate about the
choice pattern that would result from considering each goal
in isolation.

Goal Types
Satisfying One’s Taste (Individual-Alone Goal).
This goal relies on the basic economic premise that individuals, irrespective of the context, will choose those items
that maximize satisfaction of their taste, where taste is defined as an internal need that is independent of any external
factors. Fulfillment of this goal necessitates the selection of
an identical alternative whether the individual decision
maker is choosing in a group context or not. Note, however,

<-----Page 2----->SEQUENTIAL CHOICE IN GROUP SETTINGS

that individuals could still be influenced by the group when
satisfying their own taste if informational social influence
is active. Such situations would be characterized by choice
uniformity if other group members were viewed both as
possessing similar tastes and more information about the
alternatives. In contrast, variety seeking would occur if others were viewed as possessing different tastes (see Fig. 1).

281
FIGURE 1
AN ILLUSTRATION OF GOAL CLASSES, GOALS, AND THEIR
PREDICTIONS

Minimizing Regret and Avoiding Losses (IndividualGroup Goal). Loss aversion (Kahneman and Tversky
1979) predicts that consumers will experience more disutility from observing another diner in the group enjoying a
better dish compared to the corresponding utility that they
would derive from observing another diner who had selected
a worse dish. They might then feel compelled to order the
same dish in order to minimize the potential for disutility
and regret. Assuming a fixed distribution of tastes, loss aversion and regret minimization suggest that individuals in a
group context will have a greater tendency for group uniformity relative to the overall set of alternatives selected by
the same individuals choosing alone.

Information Gathering (Individual-Group Goal).
Consumer choices may also be an endeavor to acquire information about preferences regarding similar or identical
future experiences (Scitovsky 1976). In an often-cited example of variety-seeking behavior, Simonson (1990) found
that students picking candy bars for consumption in the next
three lectures, opted for more varied choices than students
picking a single candy bar in the beginning of each of three
successive lectures. This result is commonly attributed to
individuals’ desire to learn their preferences (Hauser and
Wernerfelt 1990; McAlister and Pessemier 1982) or hedge
the risk of future changes in taste (Simonson 1990).
In a group setting, individuals could similarly seek to
diversify their choices in order to gain more information
through interaction with other group members. The benefit
of sharing information can occur naturally in situations
where members can share their choices, but also where no
sharing takes place and information is transmitted only
though verbal opinions or facial expressions during or after
consumption. Sharing might also create incentives toward
variety seeking under “attribute satiation” models, where
each dish is like an attribute in McAlister’s (1982) dynamic
attribute satiation model. With diminishing marginal sensitivity to each bite of a given entrée, sharing of entrées
may produce more utility than consuming all of one’s most
preferred option. We posit that the group’s presence can
induce collective variety seeking even when there is no
sharing, and all the studies reported herein focus on such
contexts.

Self-Presentation (Individual-Group Goal). It is well
known that individuals consume products in an effort to
convey an image to themselves and others (Belk 1988).
Choices made in group settings provide an ideal venue for
conveying such signals. An abundance of social psychological work has shown that such situations are characterized

NOTE.—In cases where informational social influence is present during the
decision process, an outcome of group uniformity or variety seeking can result.

by uniformity (Asch 1955; Deutsch and Gerard 1955; Hinsz
and Davis 1984; Kaplan 1987). However, Snyder and Fromkin (1980) suggest that people will make choices that are
unique in order to present themselves in a positive light.
Research by Ratner and Kahn (1999) corroborates this point.
They find that in some cases individuals seek variety because
they expect to be viewed more favorably as a result. In
related work, Hsee (1999) shows that consumers choose a
low level of variety for products whose origin is hard to
observe (such as the label of a T-shirt), but choose a high
level of variety when the differences are easy to observe
(such as the color of a T-shirt). These findings suggest that,
depending on the image an individual wants to convey, the
identity goal can either lead to group uniformity or variety
seeking. When unique choices can be used as positive selfpresentation cues, variety seeking at the group level will
ensue. Similarly, personality traits that relate to self-presentation may also determine the tendency to seek variety in
groups. For instance, individuals who are high on the trait
of need for uniqueness (Snyder and Fromkin 1977) will be
more likely to select options that have yet to be chosen,
thus yielding greater group level variety.
In sum, we have outlined four types of goals that individuals face when selecting alternatives in a group setting:
satisfying one’s taste, avoiding losses and minimizing regret,
information gathering, and self-presentation. The objective
of this work is to examine goal balancing and its outcome
in consumer choices in a group context. We propose goal
balancing only as a general framework that can help us
understand the trade-offs implicit in these decisions. Figure

1 summarizes the predicted direction of the outcome according to each goal type, assuming each goal was considered in isolation. We construct our argument using three
studies that successively reveal the outcomes of goal balancing and the reasons that may underlie it. In study 1 (the
Lunch study) we test the goal-balancing hypothesis at its
most basic level: Does group context influence individual
choices, and, if so, what is the revealed choice pattern? In
study 2 (the Beer study) we seek more direct evidence that
goal balancing entails a trade-off between goals, including
loss aversion and the taste satisfaction goal. Finally, study
3 (the Wine study) examines the importance of the information and identity goal types in goal balancing.

STUDY 1: THE LUNCH STUDY
The principal aim of study 1 was to ascertain whether
goal balancing imposes meaningful constraints on choice
by examining the group-level outcome of sequential decisions in a group context. The outcome pattern would also
serve as an indirect indication of which goal types were
being traded off. A null effect of group context would imply
that the goal of satisfying one’s taste (an individual-alone
goal) trumps all other concerns and suggests that the constraints imposed by goal balancing are insignificant. An outcome of choice uniformity at the group level would provide
some evidence supporting regret minimization and loss aversion and possibly self-presentation in the form of conformity
as the primary goals that individuals consider when making
choices in a group context. In contrast, a pattern of group
variety seeking would hint that satisfaction of taste and loss
aversion are traded off in favor of information gathering
and uniqueness as a form of positive self-presentation.
To test for the influence of group context on individual
decisions in a natural setting, we collected lunch order slips
from a popular Chinese restaurant in Durham, North Carolina. The data were gathered over a period of six weeks,
in collaboration with a restaurant manager who was blind
to the hypothesis. We analyzed the order codes of all tables
of two or more diners. Lunch orders were of uniform size
and price, and, unlike the usual custom in Chinese restaurants, were served as individual portions and not shared.
The restaurant offered a total of 25 lunch selections, not
including soups and appetizers.
There are two possible benchmarks for comparison that
may be considered in a one-cell study of a group’s effect
on individual choice. The first is the pattern of selections
of customers lunching alone. We did not choose this benchmark due to the possibility of a selection confound: people
who dine alone may somehow have different preferences
than those who dine in groups. Instead, we constructed
“nominal groups,” as is common in group problem-solving
research (see, e.g., Baron, Kerr, and Miller 1992; Diehl and
Stroebe 1991; Laughlin, VanderStoep, and Hollingshead
1991). That is, we randomly aggregated the orders of individuals from the real groups into tables of the same size
and compared the variety in those simulated groups to the
variety of selections at real tables.

Method
Eight hundred and fourteen lunch order slips were collected over the course of six weeks, representing a total of
2,202 diners. As discussed above, the choice variability
within these tables cannot be meaningfully interpreted without a comparison to a reference population that was not
subject to the group contingency. To overcome this problem
we created a simulation program designed to generate such
nominal groups as a control. The simulation was programmed to take the entire set of individual choices (2,202
dinners across 814 tables) and randomly reassign individuals
to tables (for an illustration, see Fig. 2). The constraint imposed on these nominal groups was such that they had the
same distribution of table sizes as the original set. In effect,
this created a comparison group that reproduced the same
overall (i.e., sample) variety in dish choices and table sizes,
but without any table-specific interorder dependencies. In
order to achieve stability in our measure of the reference
group’s variety, we repeated this process 100 times and used
the generated tables (groups) from all these runs as our
reference class.
Based on both the original and created tables, we computed a Variety Index, or V, that was calculated as shown
in Equation 1. This definition bounded the Variety Index
between 0 and 1. The index was designed to equal 0 when
all the dishes in a table are identical and 1 when all the
dishes in a table are different. For example, if there are three
diners at a table, and all three choose different items, V will
equal (2/2 p 1) ; if two of the diners choose the same item,
V will equal (1/2 p .5); finally, if all three diners choose
the same item, V will equal (0/2 p 0). Goal balancing

<-----Page 4----->SEQUENTIAL CHOICE IN GROUP SETTINGS

would be supported if the group context was shown to significantly influence V levels; a higher or lower V in the real
groups would indicate that the outcome of such a balancing
process is group variety seeking or group uniformity, respectively.

Results and Discussion
The analysis of the Lunch study consisted of comparing
the Variety Index across the real and simulated tables. Two
important results emerge. First, a comparison between the
V for the real sample and the distribution of V’s obtained
through the simulation (see Fig. 3) indicates that the group
context has a strong and significant influence on individual
decision making. We interpret this to mean that individualgroup goals constrain choice such that fulfillment of taste
satisfaction is limited. Second, the results suggest that the
outcome of the group contingency is to increase variety in
choices at the group level. In fact, all the tables produced
by our simulation displayed a lower Variety Index measure
than the original tables (i.e., there was no overlap with the
simulated distribution)!
In addition to this overall analysis, we also tested the data
separately for each table size (see Table 1). The difference
in the variety index was in the same direction for all five
table sizes in aggregate, although it was significant only for
four of the five comparisons separately (all but table size
3). From these findings we deduce that certain group contexts (e.g., dining in a Chinese restaurant) create a preference
contingency that prompts individuals to tend toward selections that increase variety at the group level.
It is worthwhile noting that we obtained these results
despite a couple of factors that would exert a bias against
group-level variety seeking and limit our power to detect
them statistically. First, because the restaurant we selected
was a popular establishment, customers would be more
likely to have favorite dishes, therefore displaying stickiness
in their selections irrespective of the group’s choices. Second, the overall levels of V may seem high. Recall that there
were 25 possible options on the menu, making it quite difficult to find anything but highly varied choices, even without the group context (i.e., through randomly generated
groups). For instance, if the group contingency were nonexistent and the prior odds of selecting any dish were equal,
1 in 25, the probability that both people at a table would
choose option 1 would equal (1/25) ∗ (1/25) p .0016. The
probability that both would choose option 2 is also
(1/25) ∗ (1/25), and so on for all 25 options. With 25 ways
that a pair of diners might agree, the probability of
agreement p 25 ∗ [(1/25) ∗ (1/25)] p 1/25 p .04, and the
probability of finding variety under these conditions is there-

fore 1 2 .04 p .96. For two-person groups, when both
members agree, V takes on its minimum value,
V(min) p 0, and when they differ, V takes on its maximum
value, V(max) p 1.0. With the aforementioned probabilities
of agreement and disagreement, the expected value of
V p (.04 ∗ 0) 1 (.96 ∗ 1.0) p .96. The group effect that
we find, though small, is therefore impressive in light of the
odds of randomly generating a similar effect. In conclusion,
the Lunch study is consistent with the idea that group context
can induce individuals to make choices that produce greater
variety at the group level.

STUDY 2: THE BEER STUDY
The Beer study was designed to achieve three objectives.
The first was to replicate our previous findings using a setup
that would allow more experimental control. The second,
and more important, objective was to examine more directly
the idea that individual choice in a group context reflects
trade-offs (or sacrifices) of different goals. Specifically, we
wanted to examine whether goals other than individual taste
satisfaction—an individual-alone goal—could determine
choices made in a group setting. Last, we wanted to rule
out the alternative explanation that the group-level variety
we found in study 1 is due to positive affect stimulated by
the occasion of dining out. Kahn and Isen (1993) have
shown that positive affect induces variety seeking in individuals, perhaps by prompting more inclusive categorization
structures. Conceivably, if the group dining context created
positive affect, consumers might be led to categorize more
inclusively and to consider a broader variety of options than
they would as individuals. If so, the same collective variety-

<-----Page 5----->JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

FIGURE 4

seeking behavior should manifest when people in consumption groups are asked to choose individually.
In the Lunch study, we find evidence hinting that personal
taste satisfaction may be sacrificed in favor of other goals,
yielding variety seeking at the group level. A key implication of this conjecture is that satisfaction should depend
on the individual’s location in the choice sequence. The
hypothesis for the “sequential order effect” is derived from
the notion that the first consumer in the sequence is free to
fully satisfy his/her taste because others have yet to create
the group contingency by expressing their choices. However,
the remaining consumers are faced with this contingency,
which constrains their choices to those alternatives that increase group-level variety. We consequently expect satisfaction with consumption to be higher for the first person
than for the second through nth persons in the sequence.

AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE BEER SAMPLE MENU AND THE
DESCRIPTION OF THE FOUR BEERS USED IN THE BEER
STUDY

Method
A local microbrewery permitted us to pose as regular
restaurant waiters and offer their patrons a free sample of
beer. One hundred tables of two or more (of age) diners
(mean table size p 2.7 persons) were approached by one
of us and told that the brewery was conducting a special
promotion, whereby free 4 fluid ounce sample glasses of
house beer were being offered to interested customers. We
next described the different beers (see Fig. 4) and asked
them to make their selection.
The essence of the Beer study involved the introduction
of two types of selection processes that were manipulated
between tables (subjects). Tables were randomly assigned
to one of two conditions (50 tables in each condition), the
Collective condition and the Independent condition. In the
Collective condition, subjects were read the descriptions of
the beers and offered special promotion menus to peruse.
They then were asked to make a selection one by one,
indicating to the waiter which beer they would like to taste,
as they would in a normal ordering situation. In the Independent condition, subjects were read the descriptions of
the beers, offered the same promotion menus to peruse, but
were told that a “special rule for this promotion” required
them to make their selection without looking at or consulting
other members of the table. These customers simply marked
their choice on an individual menu. (None of the subjects
in the Independent condition resisted the idea of submitting

confidential forms, and in general were rather amused by
the notion.) The different beer selections were recorded for
the two experimental groups, including the order of choice
for the Collective condition.
Customers in both conditions then received their beer
sample together with a short, three-question satisfaction survey to fill out as part of “the brewery’s desire to find out
what people think about its beer.” The first question asked
customers to rate how much they liked the beer that they
had just sampled. This rating was done on a 0–10 scale,
where 0 represented “didn’t like it at all” and 10 represented
“liked it very much.” A second question asked subjects if
they wished that they had ordered a different sample of beer.

The response for this question was a simple yes or no answer.
Third, customers were asked to estimate how many times
they planned to visit the microbrewery in the next month.1
The rationale underlying the first two questions was to assess
both satisfaction and regret in the Collective and Independent conditions in order to test whether choices made in a
group setting are constrained and whether they reflect a
sacrifice of certain goals. Although the Lunch study provided evidence of the group-level choice pattern and hinted
that it comes at the expense of taste satisfaction, the Beer
study allows for a more direct test of the sacrifice of taste
satisfaction and the consequent choice pattern. We expected
to replicate the group variety-seeking pattern from the first
study, and predicted that it would come at the cost of taste
satisfaction.

Results and Discussion
The results were consistent with the notion of goal balancing. First, we found that variety seeking (V) was significantly higher in the Collective condition (M p .843)
than in the Independent condition (M p .46), t 98 p 5.69,
p ! .001, thus replicating the results of the Lunch study. In
addition to the Variety Index measures, the aim of the Beer
study was to test the impact of increased variety within a
table on the satisfaction and regret of the individuals who
composed these tables. Our hypothesis was that “taking the
road less traveled” would prompt customers to sacrifice
choosing their preferred beer in favor of a lesser-liked beer
because of a desire to satisfy other goals, leading to increased group-level variety. The results of the postconsumption questionnaire support this conjecture (see Table
2). Subjects indicated significantly higher satisfaction with
their beer choice in the Independent condition (M p 7.75)
than in the Collective condition (M p 6.80), t 98 p 3.12,
p ! .005. Responses to the regret question (the “yes/no”
question on the survey) were, as expected, highly correlated
with the satisfaction ratings (r p .677 ). Subjects in the Collective condition were significantly more likely to regret
their choice (38.4 percent) than subjects in the Independent
condition (12.4 percent), Mann-Whitney U p 6707, p !
.001. Furthermore, these findings reject the notion that informational social influence is driving our results in the
sense that information from others was not used to better
satisfy one’s taste.
The sequential-order hypothesis stipulates that satisfaction in the Collective condition should also depend on the
individual’s location in the choice sequence. In order to test
this idea, we recorded the order in which people in the
Collective condition voiced their choices. As the waiters,
we asked customers for their orders in a randomly predetermined sequence, so that this way customers could not
self-select into the ordering. Recall that the first consumer
in the sequence was free to satisfy his/her tastes fully because the group contingency (and need for goal balancing)

first customer in the sequence (M p 7.26) were significantly
higher than the mean ratings for the rest of the group members (M p 6.48), F(1, 49) p 4.97, p p .03. Follow-up tests
showed that the first customer in the Collective condition
was as happy with his/her beer (M p 7.26) as the average
customer in the Independent condition (M p 7.75), t 49 p
1.23, p 1 .2. However, patrons not choosing first in the Collective condition were significantly less happy with their
beer (M p 6.37) than the consumers in the Independent
condition (M p 7.75), t 49 p 4.15, p ! .001.
Responses to the regret question revealed an identical
pattern: overall reported regret was significantly higher in
the Collective condition (38.4 percent) than in the Independent condition (12.4 percent), U p 6707, p ! .001. In addition, the first customer in the Collective condition was
significantly less likely to report regret (24 percent) than the
remaining members of his table (48 percent), U p 3205,
p ! .05. The latter were also significantly more likely to
regret their choices (48 percent) relative to customers in the
Independent condition (12.4 percent), U p 3502, p ! .001.
This set of findings also rules out the interpretation of our
Lunch study results in terms of a group setting effect on
affect, categorization, and consequent variety seeking.
Several conclusions can be drawn from the results discussed thus far. First, personal taste satisfaction cannot account for the data obtained because average satisfaction in
the Collective condition was actually lower than that of
individuals choosing independently. Second, the group-level
outcome of variety seeking is consistent with the notion that
individuals within a group context balance their individualalone goals against the constraints introduced by individualgroup goals. Finally, the robust finding of variety seeking
allows us to reject regret and self-presentation in the form
of conformity as the principal goals fulfilled by our
participants.

STUDY 3: THE WINE STUDY
The data supporting the existence of a group contingency
(studies 1 and 2) suggest that personal taste satisfaction and
regret minimization are sacrificed for the sake of grouplevel variety (study 2). Our goal-balancing framework in-

<-----Page 7----->286

dicates that satisfaction of other goals—information gathering and self-presentation (in the form of uniqueness)—might offset the disutility that arises from this forfeiture. Information gathering is essentially a rational view
that implicates consumers’ desire to learn their preferences
as a motive for variety seeking (Scitovsky 1976). If this
explanation is correct, then eliminating the need to obtain
information from other group members should obviate the
need to seek variety. The Variety Index for groups with a
diminished need for information should therefore be lower
than the V for groups with a higher need for information.
Second, the self-presentation goal is a social signaling explanation by which consumers seek group-level variety in
order to convey an image of individuality and uniqueness
to themselves and others (Hsee 1999). If this explanation is
accurate, then a measure of need for uniqueness (NFU; Snyder and Fromkin 1977) should be positively correlated with
the tendency to seek variety. The Wine study is designed
to identify whether each of these explanations is a significant
factor in goal balancing.

Method
Forty-five groups of business students from the daytime
and global executive master’s program at Duke University
were approached under the aegis of a “marketing study on
wines” and asked to sample a few wines. Groups ranged in
size from two to six members (M p 4.3), and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: Information and
No Information. Two lists of wines were prepared, each
containing four different wines (set 1 and set 2). In the
Information condition, participants first sampled 1 fluid
ounce of each of four different types of wines from one set
and were provided with a list that contained the name, year,
and a brief description of each wine. Next they were asked
to choose one of the four wines from the same set for the
purpose of receiving a full, 4 fluid ounce glass. Since the
initial tasting was done in the same group context, any possible information about the wines had already been acquired
or transmitted prior to the second phase because the latter
involved previously tested wines. In contrast, subjects in the
No Information condition received a new list of wines in
the second phase, allowing for learning and information
sharing to take place during both the first and second phases.
Participants in the No Information condition sampled 1 fluid
ounce of each of four different types of wines from one of
the sets, but were asked to choose one of the four wines
from the other set for the purposes of receiving their full,
4 fluid ounce glass (groups who received set 1 in stage 1
received set 2 in stage 2, and groups who received set 2 in
stage 1 received set 1 in stage 2). The two wine sets were
counterbalanced between groups. Thus, the manipulation
kept the process of wine consumption identical between the
two groups and changed only the level of information available for the second set of wines.
After sampling their selection in the second phase, subjects in both conditions completed a satisfaction questionnaire regarding their chosen wine (the 4 fluid ounce glass).

JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH

The satisfaction survey consisted of four questions. The first
question asked participants to rate how much they liked the
wine they had just sampled using a 0–10 scale, where 0
represented “didn’t like it at all” and 10 represented “liked
it very much.” The second question asked participants if
they wished that they had ordered a different sample of wine.
The response for this question was a simple yes or no answer.
The third question asked participants to estimate how many
glasses of wine they had consumed in the last month, and
the fourth question asked them to rate their level of knowledge about wine. The latter was done on a scale from 0 to
10, with 0 meaning not knowledgeable at all and 10 meaning
very knowledgeable.2 After responding to these four questions, subjects were asked to complete the need-for-uniqueness scale (Snyder and Fromkin 1977).

Results and Discussion
In the first step of our analysis we calculated the Variety
Index for all groups of respondents in order to test the hypothesis that the group creates a contingency for individual
choice. Note that in both conditions subjects made their
selections out loud, or “collectively.” In order to test for the
group contingency, we used the same procedure as in the
Lunch study to create a benchmark null hypothesis level of
variety seeking (see Fig. 2). Once again, we ran the simulation 100 times to obtain stable results. We find that the
mean V from the simulated groups (M p .554) was lower
than the mean V from the real groups (M p .658), t 44 p
5.38, p ! .001. Responses from the wine satisfaction question also replicated the Beer study’s result: the satisfaction
for the first person in each group (M p 6.69) was significantly higher than the satisfaction with the wine for the
remaining people in the group (M p 5.6), t193 p 3.05,
p ! .01. The regret question showed an identical pattern,
with reported regret for the first person in each group (20
percent) lower than the regret indicated by the rest of the
people in the group (37 percent), a marginally significant
difference, U p 2790, p p .078. Thus, the results from the
Wine study replicated those from the previous experiments,
indicating that a group context causes increased group-level
variety at the cost of personal consumption dissatisfaction
and regret.
A similar analysis was conducted for each of the two
experimental conditions. In the No Information condition,
V in the real groups (M p .734) was significantly higher
than V in the simulated groups (M p .577), t19 p 3.91,
p ! .001. Likewise, in the Information condition, V in the
real groups (M p .645) was higher than the V in the simulated groups (M p .541), t 24 p 3.74, p p .001. These results further support the hypothesis that variety seeking is
higher in real groups than in randomly formed groups. In
addition, each condition also displayed the same pattern of
higher first-choice satisfaction with the wine (sequential or2
Aside from a significant correlation of wine knowledge with NFU
(r p .213, p ! .005), the two wine knowledge questions did not show any
significant effect and will not be discussed further.

<-----Page 8----->SEQUENTIAL CHOICE IN GROUP SETTINGS

der effect). Subjects choosing first in the Information condition indicated a higher satisfaction rating (M p 6.56) than
the rest of the members of their group (M p 5.51),
t109 p 2.3, p ! .05. Similarly, the first respondents in the No
Information condition rated their wine (M p 6.85) higher
than group members who followed (M p 5.73), t 82 p
1.98, p p .05. No significant differences were detected in
the satisfaction ratings of the first, t 43 p .52, p p .6, or
second through last subjects, t148 p .61, p p .53, across
both conditions.
Next, we compared the Variety Indexes across the two
conditions in order to test the relative importance of the
information-gathering goal. Although only marginally significant,3 the direction of the results supports the importance
of the information goal: the mean V was higher in the No
Information condition (M p .734) than in the Information
condition (M p .645), t 43 p 1.89, p p .066. It appears that
information gathering plays a role in goal balancing, yielding a choice pattern of group-level variety when an opportunity for knowledge acquisition is present. However, note
that the simulation results indicate that even when the need
to acquire information from others is obviated (i.e., the Information condition), there remains a tendency to seek variety at the group level (V in the Information condition was
higher than the V for the simulated groups).
One additional factor that might account for the tendency
to seek variety is self-presentation in the form of uniqueness.
Our analysis relies on responses to the need-for-uniqueness
(NFU) scale and its relation to group variety seeking. In
order to ascertain the importance of impression management
for our respondents, we conducted three regression analyses
using the group V as a criterion and the average NFU for
each group as a predictor. The first regression included data
from the entire sample, and found that NFU was a significant
predictor of variety seeking, F(1, 37) p 10.11, R 2 p .22,
p ! .005. The coefficient for the NFU was positive (.396)
and statistically significant, t p 3.18 , p ! .005 . We repeated
the same analysis separately for the two experimental groups
and obtained the same pattern of results. For the No Information condition, the overall model was statistically significant, F(1, 13) p 5.03, R 2 p .28, p ! .05, and NFU was
positive (.552) and statistically significant, t p 2.24 , p !
.05. For the Information condition, too, the overall model
approached significance, F(1, 22) p 3.92 , R 2 p .15, p p
.06, and the NFU coefficient was both positive (.290) and
marginally significant, t p 1.98, p p .06.
While the relationship between the Variety Index and need
for uniqueness supports the identity explanation, it is not
an individual-level test. Since our Variety Index can be calculated only at a group level, all individuals within a group
are afforded the same level of V. This is a problem, however,
because NFU is measured at the individual level. In order
to calculate an individual-level measure of variety seeking,
we created an index called Sequential Variety. It was calculated using the sequence of choices made by the members
3
Note, however, that this is a conservative statement because we make
a directional prediction, but use a two-tailed test.

287

of each group such that when an alternative had been previously selected, that subject’s choice was marked “0”; otherwise the choice was marked “1.” Since the first subject
in each group was necessarily a “1,” we dropped all the
choices made by the first respondent from this measure.
To test the significance of need for uniqueness on an
individual level, we employed a logistic regression that predicted sequential variety from NFU scores and a dummy
variable for each individual’s order in the sequence. We
included the order variable because as the number of preceding orders increases, it becomes more difficult to select
an alternative that had not been previously chosen. The
results showed a statistically significant log likelihood ratio,
implying that NFU was a reliable predictor of sequential
variety in our total sample, x 2 p 4.848, p p .028. Order
of choice was also significant, x 2 p 12.561 , p ! .001, such
that variety decreased as the position in the ordering sequence increased. We repeated the same analysis for each
of the two experimental conditions separately and obtained
a mixed overall result. In the Information condition, both
NFU, x 2 p 4.461, p p .034, and the order variable,
x 2 p 6.891, p ! .009, were significant. However, in the No
Information condition, only order achieved significance,
x 2 p 5.61, p ! .02. The discrepancy in the results might
hint at a compensatory relationship between NFU and information gathering: when the opportunity for information
gathering is reduced, NFU explains variety in choice; when
information cannot easily be obtained, information gathering
explains variety in choice.
Next, in order to compare directly the relative effect of
the two explanations, we included all terms in a single
model. Using logistic regression, we tested the significance
of NFU scores, order in the sequence, and a dummy variable
for the two experimental conditions (Information and No
Information) as predictors of Sequential Variety. The results
showed a significant effect for NFU, x 2 p 4.67, p p .03,
and order, x 2 p 12.56, p ! .001, but not for the experimental manipulation, x 2 p .49, p p .82. These results
might imply that NFU has a relatively stronger effect on
sequential variety than information gathering.

GENERAL DISCUSSION
The preference-construction literature has focused primarily on the characteristics of the actual object or question
at hand (Feldman and Lynch 1988; Fischhoff, Slovic, and
Lichtenstein 1980; Payne, Bettman, and Johnson 1993;
Slovic 1995). Preferences are said to be labile and subject
to cognitive biases and simplifying heuristics. Knowledge
acquired through this research has sensitized market researchers to the crucial importance of questionnaire framing,
complexity, display, and so on. In this article we demonstrate
that, in addition to the typically cited context effects, there
are also contingencies created by group contexts. A distinctive aspect of the group contingency is its interpersonal
nature: it is not a property of the task (e.g., a frame) or the
character of the individual, but rather a consequence of the
social context of the task. Our investigation also shows that

<-----Page 9----->288

the social context affects choices of group members, as well
as the satisfaction with the outcome of their choices.
We believe that the origin of our group contingency is in
the creation of goals introduced by the group context. The
existence of the group forces consumers to grapple with
goals belonging to two general classes: goals whose attainment depends only on the action of the individual (individual-alone), and goals whose attainment depends on both the
individual and the group (individual-group). Concurrent fulfillment of these two goal classes is sometimes impossible
because each can require the choice of a distinct alternative.
We have suggested that choices made under the constraints
that the goal classes impose reflect a process of goal balancing, wherein consumers tend to alter their selection in
order to try to account for both sets of goals. All three
experiments are consistent with this formulation by demonstrating that choices made in group contexts yield a systematically different pattern than those made individually
or where nominal (simulated) groups are formed. The Lunch
and Wine studies used a computer simulation to show that
real groups exhibit a higher level of variety seeking than
artificially formed, or nominal, groups. In the Beer study
we replicated this finding by comparing the choice patterns
of real groups and groups where each member made a selection independently (silently).
We specified four consumption-relevant goal types that
fall under each goal class: satisfying one’s taste (individualalone), regret minimization and avoiding losses (individualgroup), information gathering (individual-group), and selfpresentation (individual-group). These goal types are useful
because their fulfillment predicts whether the group-level
choice pattern will be unchanged, relatively uniform, or relatively varied compared to the outcome of choices made
without a meaningful group contingency. Each prediction
implies that its associated goal (or goals) was weighted more
heavily in the trade-off process that defines goal balancing.
In particular, no effect of group context is hypothesized
when the goal of individual taste satisfaction is completely
fulfilled. Group uniformity is anticipated when minimizing
regret is emphasized. Group variety seeking is expected
when information gathering is considered paramount. Either
pattern of results can emerge when consumers attend to the
goal of self-presentation, depending on social norms.
All three studies suggest that people take the road less
traveled and point to group variety seeking as a consistent
and stable outcome when individuals order food and drinks
in group settings. The Beer study demonstrates that this
choice outcome comes—in accordance with our framework—at the expense of personal (taste) satisfaction and
regret minimization. The Wine study supports our suggestion that variety-seeking outcomes are partially due to the
heightened importance afforded to two other goal types:
information gathering and self-presentation.
The evidence most consistent with the goal-balancing account is the result obtained in the analysis of the “sequential
order” hypothesis. Recall that two types of subjects in the
Beer study selected beers while unencumbered by the group

contingency: customers assigned to the Independent condition, and the first customer in each table assigned to the
Collective condition (and in both conditions of the Wine
study). In essence, these subjects had no goals to balance—they were free to fulfill the goal of satisfying their
taste because we experimentally eliminated the individualgroup goal class. Across the two conditions, their reported
satisfaction with consumption was equal, but higher than
the satisfaction of customers whose choices were constrained by the presence of goals associated with another
goal class (i.e., individual-group). The relationship among
order, variety in choice, and satisfaction hints at a dynamic
decision process and suggests that the rest of the group
members shifted their choices based on the selections voiced
such that they were eventually less happy with their own
selections. The Wine study indicates that this shift was due
to the (implicit) trade-off favoring the information and selfpresentation goals.

ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS AND
FUTURE RESEARCH
The factors influencing variety-seeking behavior have
been studied by various consumer researchers (see Kahn
[1995] and McAlister and Pessemier [1982] for comprehensive reviews). Our findings accord with the notion that
individuals making choices within a group context try to
balance different goals such that they choose options that
have not been selected previously (variety seeking). We believe, however, that there may be additional factors contributing to this effect.
Consumers have a natural bias to engage in variety seeking, sometimes called naive diversification (Read and Loewenstein 1995; Thaler 1998). A number of animal studies,
for instance, reveal that there is a “hard-wired” tendency to
seek variety (Hebb 1955; Scitovsky 1976). Rats that are
given a maze task for thousands of trials appear to change
their behavior just for the fun of it (i.e., after the first few
hundred trials, when there is no new information to acquire).
Lesions to particular brain structures seem to inhibit and
even eliminate this tendency (Fiske and Maddi 1961). Such
natural tendencies to seek variety (or sensation seeking; see
Zuckerman 1976) can be a very useful and valid behavioral
heuristic because of the inherent statistical advantage of
hedging. At times, like many heuristics, it can be an overgeneralized strategy that yields less than ideal results, as
we found in our experiments, and as we imply by our title.
For example, in her study of charitable giving, Strahilevitz
(1999) finds that people donate money anonymously to several different charities in spite of their claim that they derive
the most utility from giving to a specific one (see also Ratner,
Kahn, and Kahneman 1999).
Naive diversification in a group setting may be moderated
by Campbell’s (1958) notion of entitativity, which refers to
the tendency of members to view their group as an individual
entity. Recently, Hamilton and Sherman (1996) expand on
Campbell’s concept by arguing that cognitive processes re-

<-----Page 10----->SEQUENTIAL CHOICE IN GROUP SETTINGS

garding judgments of the group will mimic those that regard
individuals. This suggests that group members apply the
same heuristics (e.g., naive diversification) they would use
for themselves even when the choice is made in a group
setting (and presumably the heuristic may not be useful).
So, in the same manner that individuals tend to choose
variety when deciding their own consumption, they may
make choices in a group context such that variety will result
at the group level. An interesting avenue for future research
would involve testing whether the sense of entitativity determines the tendency to seek variety at the group level. If
entitativity is low, for instance, will individuals disregard
others’ choices when making their own selections?
Second, if we assume that the goal of satisfying one’s
taste is perceived as temporally distant when placing an
order, while the group-dependent goals are often immediate
(e.g., self-presentation), then time discounting (Loewenstein
and Prelec 1992) and preference misprediction (Kahneman
1994) may have contributed to the data we obtained. Recall
that the scenarios we investigated imposed a lag between
the time of ordering and the time of consumption. Individuals might consequently underweigh their satisfaction with
the order in favor of placing greater weight on the satisfaction of group-related goals. In situations where there is
no time lag between the choice and its outcome, the effect
of group-related goals might exercise a weaker influence.
Future research might test a model of the influence exerted
by other group members through time, from the decision
period to consumption and postconsumption—a sort of time
discounting of the utility derived from group concerns. It
is possible to imagine a result indicating that the group
contingency is important at decision time and at postconsumption—the two instances where there is a collective element to the consumption process (e.g., when discussing
what to order and in the postmeal “review process” of the
experience)—but not during consumption itself.
Several factors may serve as boundary conditions for
group variety seeking. In our setup, table size may have
been a determining factor. All of our studies involved small
to medium table sizes. It is possible that group structure in
larger tables changes such that the contingency actually acts
on subgroups within the table. Alternatively, variety in larger
tables might be a simple consequence of natural heterogeneity, obviating the need for individuals to seek it actively.
A second moderating factor involves ambiguity of preferences. Information is likely to gain importance as uncertainty increases, which would place emphasis on information
gathering in the goal-balancing process. Product familiarity
might therefore be crucial as a determinant of the choice
pattern that emerges from decisions in a group setting. A
final boundary condition relates to the different categories
in which consumers might seek variety or uniformity. While
we believe that this goal exists in many situations, its particular instantiation as uniqueness might not. In some situations consumers may actually want to portray themselves
as similar to their group, a possibility we alluded to when
we first described the self-presentation goal type. For in-

289

stance, it is unlikely for diners within a group to choose
items that are very disparate in price. Similarly, it is rare
for one person to order only a small salad if other group
members order entrées. Variety seeking in dish selection,
then, ordinarily would be coupled with uniformity in dish
type and money spent. Self-presentation might help explain
this choice uniformity in the same way that it explains variety seeking. After all, nobody enjoys being considered
miserly. Indeed, the variety seeking we find might be the
outcome of a strong normative social influence that governs
behavior in dish selection situations. Even though our experiments reveal information gathering and self-presentation
as important factors, it is possible that these are actually the
antecedents of a variety-seeking norm (see Ratner and Kahn
[1999] for a discussion of consumption norms).
There are many decisions that individuals make in a sequential group context. We offer two lessons for individuals
in such settings to maximize their consumption utility. First,
consumers are more likely to maximize enjoyment from
consumption if they hold fast to their initial decision without
being swayed by other group members. In light of our findings on individual-group goals, however, this might be a
difficult strategy to execute. A different approach relies on
avoiding individual-group goals altogether: always order
first. But this raises the specter of another kind of goal
balancing: the desire to satisfy one’s tastes versus the need
to be polite. We leave this question for future research.
