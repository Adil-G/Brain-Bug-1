(Trust; Work Behavior; Work Performance; Attitudes)

Scholars from various time periods and a diversity of disciplines seem to agree that trust is highly beneficial to the
functioning of organizations. For example, early organizational scholars professed trust to be an important hallmark of effective organizations(e.g., Argyris 1962, Likert
1967, McGregor 1967). More recently, researchers representing a variety of perspectives have expressed significant interest in trust (e.g., Bies et al. 1995, Coleman 1990,
Gambetta 1988, Hosmer 1995, Kramer and Isen 1994,
Kramerand Tyler 1996, Rousseau et al. 1998). As Kramer

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE, ? 2001 INFORMS
Vol. 12, No. 4, July-August 2001, pp. 450-467

(1999, p. 569) observed, "this interest has been fueled, at
least in part, by accumulating evidence that trust has a
number of important benefits for organizations and their
members."
Although organizational scholars have devoted a significant amount of attention to examining the numerous
potential benefits of trust, they have devoted significantly
less attention to examining the different ways that trust
might transmit these benefits. Prior studies appear to
make two fundamental distinctions regarding how these
effects occur. The dominant perspective is that the effects
of trust are transmitted in a relatively straightforward
manner: Trust results in distinct (main) effects such as
more positive attitudes, higher levels of cooperation (and
other forms of workplace behavior), and superior levels
of performance. This idea is reflected in most theoretical
treatments of trust and its effects on workplace attitudes,
behaviors, and performance (e.g., Golembiewski and
McConkie 1975, Jones and George 1998, Mayer et al.
1995). And, as reported in this article, over 90% of empirical studies examining the consequences of trust have
hypothesized and examined the main effects of trust. Finally, the idea that an increase in trust leads to better team
processes and performance has provided the impetus for
numerous interventions by managers and consultants
(e.g., see Kaplan 1979, Tannenbaumet al. 1992, Woodman
and Sherwood 1980).
Although the perspective described above has dominated the literature, it does not represent the only way
that trust might have positive consequences. A handful of
studies suggest that trustis beneficial because it facilitates
the effects of other determinants on desired outcomes.
Hence, instead of proposing that trust directly results in
desirable outcomes, this model suggests that trust provides the conditions under which certain outcomes, such
as cooperation and higher performance, are likely to occur. In contrast to the research described in the previous

Trust in Organizational Settings

paragraph, this perspective is relatively undeveloped,
comprising mostly empirical studies, as yet interpretedin
isolation from one another, which were focused on specific contexts and hypotheses. The broader theoretical issues which may provide a solid foundation for understanding the moderating role of trust have received little
attention.
The primary aim of this article is to explore these two
fundamentally different models to obtain a better understanding of how trust might produce positive effects on
attitudes, perceptions, behaviors, and performance outcomes within organizational settings. We briefly review
the theory for the dominant model and examine the extent
to which the data from existing research is consistent with
the predictions of that model. As it has seen limited attention, we focus most of our efforts on developing the
second model in the form of two propositions. One proposition suggests that trust facilitates the effects of motivational concepts on workplace behaviors and outcomes
by influencing one's expectations about another person's
future behavior. The second proposition suggests that
trust moderates the relationship between an interaction
partner's action and the truster's response by influencing
one's interpretationof the action. We then consider the
conditions under which trust is likely to have a direct
effect on desired outcomes, an indirect effect, or no effect.
The theoretical framework may assist researchers in better interpretingpast research on the consequences of trust,
as well as designing future research to assess the effects
of trust across a variety of literatures.

Foundations of the Analysis

In this article, we refer to the two models by which trust
operates with terms used by organizational scientists to
differentiate how one construct influences another: main
effect and moderation. These two models represent important distinctions because they imply different theoretical rationales, different methodological designs, different forms of statistical evidence, and different ways of
using trust as a managerial intervention. Hence, developing a better understanding of the role of trust is an
importantstep for research and practice related to the concept of trust.
One element of our analysis is a review of the empirical
literatureon the effects of interpersonaltrust.We compile
and analyze research from several literaturesover the past
40 years to provide a better theoretical understandingof
the role of trust in organizational settings. The review
identifies the different outcomes trust has been associated
with, provides evidence for how trust affects these outcomes, and offers insights that we draw on as one element
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 12, No. 4, July-August 2001

of our theory development. By using the review as an
element of our analysis, we hope to ensure our theory is
grounded in evidence and that it produces propositions
that can be readily operationalized.
In this article, we will focus on the effects of interpersonal trust on individuals' workplace-relevant attitudes
and behaviors. Although the concept of trust has been
defined in a number of ways, we use the term in a broad
sense that reflects theoretical and empirical research in
the organizational sciences. Rousseau et al. (1998, p. 395)
proposed the following as a cross-disciplinary conceptual
definition of trust: a psychological state comprising the
intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive expectations of the intentions or behavior of another. Individual researchers tend to use slight variations on this
definition, operationalizing trust as an expectation or belief that one can rely upon another person's actions and
words, and/or that the person has good intentions toward
oneself (e.g., Cook and Wall 1980, Johnson-George and
Swap 1982, McAllister 1995, Robinson 1996, Zaheer et
al. 1998). We use the term in a manner reflecting these
conceptual and empirical definitions. In this article, we
are consistent with almost all of the studies included in
our review in treating trust as a unidimensional psychological state. We recognize, however, that trust is a complex psychological state that may consist of different dimensions.
Because existing trust research is relatively diverse and
multidisciplinary, Bigley and Pearce (1998) note that it is
importantfor researchersto focus on particularproblems,
and then use concepts, theories, and methods appropriate
for the problems. Based on delineations made by other
trust researchers (Worchel 1979, Lewicki and Bunker
1995, Bigley and Pearce 1998), we will focus only on
trust as a psychological state, such as a belief or attitude,
toward another known individual, as opposed to trust as
a dispositional construct (e.g., Rotter 1967) or among
groups or firms (e.g., Wicks et al. 1999, Das and Teng
1998). And, we will focus on the effects of trust on
workplace-relevant attitudes and behaviors of individuals
as studied by micro-organizational behavior researchers,
rather than on the organization of economic transactions
and the concomitant reduction of opportunism within organizations (e.g., Williamson 1985), or the dynamics of
romantic relationships (e.g., Holmes 1991).

Main Effect
According to this model, trust operates in a straightforward manner:Higher levels of trust are expected to result
in more positive attitudes, higher levels of cooperation
and other forms of workplace behavior, and superior
levels of performance. As noted above, this model has
451

<-----Page 3----->KURT T. DIRKS AND DONALD L. FERRIN

Trust in Organizational Settings

dominated how the concept of trust has been studied in
research and used in managerial interventions.
Given the state of the literature related to this model,
we have two objectives in this section. First, we briefly
discuss the theoretical rationale for why trust has a main
effect on a variety of workplace perceptions, attitudes,
behaviors, and performance outcomes. Second, we review empirical research utilizing this model to examine
the extent to which the data match the theory's predictions for the different outcomes. These objectives allow
us to examine the main effect model and also provide a
point of comparison for the moderation model.
As noted above, we conducted a review of the published empirical literature examining the effects of interpersonal trust. The details of the procedures and criteria
we used to conduct the review can be found in the Appendix. Our review identified 43 studies that used the
main effect model, 29 of these examined behavioral and
performance outcomes, and 23 studies examined attitudinal or perceptual outcomes (some studies examined
multiple outcomes). Table 1 provides a detailed listing of
these studies, categorized by the outcome examined. We
also provided a short summary of each study's key proposition, as related to trust. Finally, to determine whether
the data supportthe prediction, we included details on the
two primary criteria used to evaluate results of a main
effect hypothesis (Rosenthal 1991): statistical significance and effect size.'
Main Effects on Workplace Behaviors and
Performance Outcomes
Most studies that examine the relationship between trust
and interpersonalbehavior tend to rest on the premise that
individuals' beliefs (i.e., trust) about another party affect
how they behave in interactions with the referent of the
belief. Mayer et al. (1995) provided a model for this idea.
According to their model, individuals' beliefs about another's ability, benevolence, and integrity lead to a willingness to risk, which in turn leads to risk taking in a
relationship, as manifested in a variety of behaviors. In
other words, a higher level of trust in a work partnerincreases the likelihood that one will take a risk with a
partner (e.g., cooperate, share information) and/or increases the amount of risk that is assumed. Risk-taking
behavior, in turn, is expected to lead to positive outcomes
(e.g., individual performance). And, in social units such
as work groups, cooperation, information sharing, etc. are
expected to lead to higher unit performance (Larson and
LaFasto 1989). For the most part, each study reported in
this section uses a variation of this argument, designed to
fit the particular outcome or context.2 These ideas apply
for studies that utilize trust as a predictor (e.g., O'Reilly

452

and Roberts 1974) or that position trust as a mediator in
a larger model (e.g., De Dreu et al. 1998).
Researchers have used this basic idea to examine the
main effects of trust on a variety of behavioral and performance outcomes: communication and information
sharing, organizational citizenship behavior, effort, conflict, negotiation behaviors, individual performance, and
unit (e.g., group) performance. For many of the outcomes
studied, the evidence for the predictions of a main effect
is not robust: Statistical significance of the effects is inconsistent across studies and the effect sizes tend to be
modest. For example, 10 studies examined the idea that
individuals transmit more information, and/or information with higher fidelity, to a superior or work partner
when they trustthat individual. Of these, six studies found
a significant effect of trust on various operationalizations
of information sharing (Boss 1978, Mellinger 1959,
O'Reilly 1978, O'Reilly and Roberts 1974, Smith and
Barclay 1997, Zand 1972). But, four studies did not find
a significant effect (De Dreu et al. 1998, Dirks 1999,
Kimmel et al. 1980, Roberts and O'Reilly 1974). Likewise, research on the main effects of trust on unit performance shows inconsistent findings. Two studies did find
evidence for a significant, positive main effect of trust on
group performance (Dirks 2000; Klimoski and Karol
1976), and one study reporteda significant, positive effect
on business-unit performance (Davis et al. 2000). But,
other studies examining the main effect of trust on group
performance (Dirks 1999, Friedlander 1970), negotiation
dyad performance(Kimmel et al. 1980, Schurrand Ozanne
1985), and interorganizationalperformance (Zaheer et al.
1997) found only partial supportor no support.As shown
in Table 1, similar inconsistencies are found in research
examining the main effects of truston effort, conflict, and
negotiation behaviors. In other words, some studies report
a significant main effect, others do not.
The outcomes for which the main effect model appears
to have the strongest empirical supportare organizational
citizenship behaviors and individual performance.For example, five studies found significantpositive effects of trust
on organizational citizenship behaviors (Konovsky and
Pugh 1994, McAllister 1995, Pillai et al. 1999, Podsakoff
et al. 1990, Robinson 1996), while one study found insignificant effects (Deluga 1994). All four studies of the
effects of trust on individual performance reported a significant, positive effect.
Main Effects on Workplace Attitudes and Cognitive/
Perceptual Constructs
Most studies of the effects of trust on attitudinaland perceptual constructs also utilize the main effect model, although the rationales for those effects are slightly different. For the effects of trust on satisfaction, Rich (1997)

Trust in Organizational Settings

suggests that trust in one's manager directly results in
increased satisfaction because managers are responsible
for many duties that have a major effect on an employee's
job satisfaction, such as performance evaluations, guidance on job responsibilities, and training. Therefore, as
an employee's trust in a manager increases, job satisfaction will also increase. This logic also seems to explain
the effect of trust on organizational commitment, although researchers who have studied this empirical relationship have not clearly specified the rationale. Researchers examining the effect of trust on perceptions, for
example of the accuracy of information, and acceptance
of a decision or goal tend to build on the idea that trust
has a direct impact on people's overall view of the other
party.
Most of the studies that examined the effects of trust
on attitudes focused on satisfaction, although researchers
have also examined the effects of trust on organizational
commitment and preference for integrative bargaining
(i.e., cooperative negotiations). Research on the effects of
trust on perceptions has examined main effects on the
perceived accuracy of information given by another entity, acceptance of decisions from a superior, perceptions
of psychological contract breach, procedural justice
judgements, perceptions of organizational climate, and
perceptions of risk.
In general, the evidence is highly supportive of main
effects of trust on attitudes, perceptions, and other cognitive constructs. For example, 12 studies examined the
effects of trust on various facets of workplace satisfaction
(e.g., satisfaction with decisions, supervisor, relationship,
job); all studies demonstrated significant effects. Likewise, the idea that the level of trust in a partner would
have a main effect on perceptions of accuracy of information provided by that partnerreceived support in two
studies (Benton et al. 1969, Roberts and O'Reilly 1974).
In general, lower levels of trust were associated with suspiciousness of the information, while high levels of trust
were associated with acceptance of the information. Findings were similar for goal/decision acceptance, procedural justice judgements, perceptions of breach of a psychological contract, perceptions of organizationalchanges
or programs, and perceptions of risk, with most studies
showing significant effects.3
Summary of Evidence for the Main Effect Model
The studies examined in our review reported fairly consistent significant effects of trust on attitudinal and cognitive/perceptual constructs. One concern in interpreting
these relationships is that they may be biased because of
percept-percept inflation. However, the results from two
studies (O'Reilly and Roberts 1974, Schurr and Ozanne
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 12, No. 4, July-August 2001

1985), which used reasonably strong experimental designs to examine the effects of trust on satisfaction report
effect sizes consistent with other studies. This suggests
that a substantial portion of the variance may not be from
inflation.
Overall, the effects of trust on various workplace behaviorsand performanceoutcomes are weakerand less consistent. For many outcomes, some studies revealed a significant effect, while others did not. The most promising
evidence seems to be for the effects of trust on organizational citizenship behavior and individual performance.
For example, the effect sizes of trust on organizational
citizenship behavior noted in Table 1 are similar to those
reported by Organ and Ryan (1995) for other key determinants of organizational citizenship behavior. In the
cases of the other outcomes, the evidence does not seem
to provide strong support for the conventional wisdom
that is represented by the main effect model-that trust,
on average, results in desirable behaviors and outcomes.
A clear case in point is the mixed evidence for the effects
of trust on dyad or group performance, a relationship that
has long been assumed to exist (Golembiewski and
McConkie 1975).
As a final observation, we note that the findings reviewed in this section mirror other cases in which organizational researchershave attempted to validate the idea
that positive attitudesor sentiments (i.e., satisfaction,commitment, team building) have a main effect on desirable
work behaviors and higher performance (Iaffaldano and
Murchinsky 1985, Mathieu and Zajac 1990, Tannenbaum
et al. 1992, Woodman and Sherwood 1980). These efforts
produced evidence suggesting that although these attitudinal constructs did tend to influence other attitudes, the
evidence for the effects on behaviors and performance
was disappointing. Each of these reviews concluded that
the effects of attitudes and sentiments on work behaviors
and performance are unlikely to be straightforwardor robust.
Given these findings and observations, we suggest that
additional research is needed to better understandthe effects of trust, particularlyon behavioral and performance
outcomes.

Moderating Effect

In this section, we explore a different model of how trust
might operate in organizational settings: by serving to
facilitate (i.e., moderate) the effects of other determinants
on work attitudes, perceptions, behaviors, and performance outcomes. In other words, trust provides the conditions under which cooperation, higher performance,
and/or more positive attitudes and perceptions are likely
to occur.

Trust in Organizational Settings

As noted earlier, trust is a psychological state that provides a representationof how individuals understandtheir
relationship with another party in situations that involve
risk or vulnerability. Accordingly, trust embodies the accumulated experiences with, and knowledge about, the
other party in situations involving vulnerability. Because
it represents an individual's understanding of a relationship, we propose that trust engenders two distinct processes through which it fosters or inhibits positive outcomes in the relationship. First, trust affects how one
assesses the future behavior of another party with whom
one is interdependent (or whom may take action that affects oneself). Second, trust also affects how one interprets the past (or present) actions of the other party, and
the motives underlying the actions. In this section, two
propositions are developed which build on these different
processes. Both propositions rest on the premise that trust
does not act in a direct causal role or elicit particular
outcomes itself. Instead, trust moderates the effect of primary determinants (causal factors) on outcomes by affecting how one assesses the future behavior or interprets
the past actions of another party. By impacting the assessment of the other party's future or prior actions, trust
reduces some of the concomitant uncertainty and ambiguity.
The idea that trust may operate as a moderator is not
new, but it has received relatively scant attention in comparison to the main effect model. Rousseau et al. (1998)
observed that several theorists focused on interpersonal
trust in work relationships have positioned trust as a moderator (in addition to some research in organizational economics and romantic relationships). Within the area of
organizational research, Hwang and Burgers (1997) proposed that trust is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for cooperation; this terminology suggests that trust
may act as a moderator,although the mathematicalmodel
does not specifically consider how trust might operate in
this manner. Mishra and Spreitzer (1998) developed propositions describing both main and moderation effects of
trust for a specific research question in a specific context:
They posit that in the aftermathof downsizing, survivors'
behavioral responses will be determined directly by trust,
and also by the interaction of trust with empowerment
and work redesign. And, as will be described later in this
section, several empirical studies have used the idea of
moderation to develop and test specific hypotheses (see
Table 2 for details), although these studies have been interpretedin isolation from each other. Although researchers have explored the ideas within specific contexts, they
have not yet addressed broader theoretical issues which
would provide a solid foundation for understanding the
moderating role of trust. Our intent is to extend existing
456

research by: (a) developing propositions based on a consideration of the perceptual and behavioral processes
through which trust operates as a moderator across contexts, (b) providing a theoretical foundation thatcan guide
future research on the role of trust across multiple contexts, (c) offering a frameworkthat will help integrateand
interpretexisting research, and (d) defining the conditions
under which trust is most likely to act as a main effect, a
moderator, or neither.
PROPOSITION1. Trust moderates the relationship be-

tween motivational constructs and workplace behaviors
and outcomes.
This proposition is based on the idea that trust does
impact workplace behaviors and performance,but that its
effect is not that of directly causing one to engage in those
behaviors. Instead, as described below, trust has an indirect effect by providing an assessment of the potential
behavior of one's work partner. Contemporary theories
of workplace behavior have focused on a number of
causal determinants of behavior, other than attitudes or
sentiments. For example, microtheorists suggest that
work behavior is caused by needs, goals, or incentives
(Kanfer 1990), and macrotheorists have focused on determinants of work behavior such as roles, rules, structure, culture, and norms (Perrow 1986). Trust does not
seem to reflect, in any way, these kinds of determinants
of work-related behavior, and hence perhaps should not
be expected to operate as a factor that causes individuals
to engage in particularworkplace behaviors. Instead, trust
might more appropriately be viewed as influencing the
type of, or degree of, behavior that such determinants
result in, as it allows one to assess the potential behavior
of an individual with whom one is interdependent. For
example, a motivational construct may provide the drive
for cooperative behavior, while trust helps facilitate the
occurrence of the cooperative behavior, because, under
high trust, the individual believes that a partneris willing
to cooperate.
This idea can be illustratedby considering the relationship between trust and an outcome it is commonly associated with risk-taking behavior (Mayer et al. 1995). According to theories of motivation, risk-taking behaviors,
like other types of workplace behaviors, are often caused
by individual motives (e.g., propensity to risk), goals, or
incentives. Trust, instead of directly causing risk-taking
behaviors, may influence the extent to which a motivation
for engaging in risk-taking behaviors is likely to lead to
risk-taking behaviors. For example, an individual who
considers another to be dependable will find it relatively
easy to work toward a group goal with that partner,because one does not have to be anxious or concerned about
the partner's potential behavior. Hence, the goal is likely

to exert a strong effect on behavior and performance, as
one can be comfortable directing all of one's resources
(e.g., attention, effort) toward the group goal. In contrast,
if one considered the partner to be undependable, one
would likely be anxious about the partner'sbehavior, and
thus might find it worrisome to work toward the joint
goal. Under this condition, the goal is likely to exert a
much weaker effect on behavior, as the individual begins
to divert resources away from the group goal as a means
of self-protection. In this example, trust functions not in
a causal role, but as a moderator that influences the
strengthof the relationship between a motivator (the goal)
and an individual's behavior.
This idea can also explain people's behavior in response to other cues that motivate people's behavior such
as work roles, cultural and group norms, and organizational rules. For example, individuals generally recognize
their work roles and the importance of successful role
performance. In addition, managers sometimes request
that employees engage in actions outside the prescribed
roles. To the extent that individuals trust their managers,
they are likely to be able to devote all their resources (e.g.,
attention, effort) to role performance, norm conformance,
rule compliance, and/or managers' requests, because of
their confidence that they will receive appropriate rewards and not be undeservedly penalized for doing so.
However, if an individual considered the manager to be
undependable, the individual would likely become concerned about the manager's response, and thus might find
it worrisome to behave as expected or requested. Under

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 12, No. 4, July-August

2001

this condition, the role, norm, rule, or managerial request
is likely to exert a much weaker effect on the individual's
behavior, as the individual diverts resources for selfprotection. In these examples, trust functions not by causing the individual to engage in the behavior, but as a
moderating construct that influences the strength of the
relationship between the behavioral cue and the individual's behavior.
Evidence. Data from three studies are consistent with
this proposition. Dirks (1999) found that trust did not
have a main effect on group processes and performance,
but did moderate the relationship between group members' motivation and group processes and outcomes. For
example, groups with high levels of motivation tended to
direct their effort toward group goals in the high-trust
condition, but they directed their effort toward individual
goals in the low-trust condition. And, motivation had significant, positive effects on group performance in the
high-trust condition, but motivation had no effect on performance in the low-trust condition. Presumably, the
group's energies were channeled toward either group or
individual goals, depending upon the level of trust within
the group. Similarly, in a negotiation, Kimmel et al.
(1980) found that trust did not produce a main effect on
information exchange or outcomes (joint benefit), but it
did interact with aspiration levels to influence negotiation
processes. Under high trust, high aspiration levels produced high levels of information exchange and integrative (cooperative) behavior under high trust. But under
457

<-----Page 9----->KURT T. DIRKS AND DONALD L. FERRIN

Trust in Organizational Settings

low trust, high aspiration levels produced extremely low
levels of information exchange and high levels of distributive (competitive) behavior. In interpreting the results,
the researchers suggested that negotiators deemed risky,
cooperative behaviors to be prudent tactics under conditions of high trust only; under low trust, negotiators chose
to use methods that put them at lower risk to reach their
goals. Finally, Read (1962) proposed that as individuals'
motivation to be promoted increased, they were less
likely to share negative information about their work with
their bosses. He suggested that this relationship would be
moderated by trust, i.e., the tendency to withhold information would be particularly acute when the subordinate
did not trust the boss. The data supported these ideas.
Taken together, these three studies demonstrate a pattern consistent with our theorizing: Trust influences taskrelated behavior and/or performance via moderation. Specifically, trust affects the level and/or type of behaviors
that individuals engage in as a result of motivational constructs. For example, not trusting one's coworkers may
cause an individual to be anxious when working with
them because of the risks involved in engaging in cooperative behavior. If highly motivated to work towards a
goal, the individual is likely to choose to engage in behaviors that minimize the risks, but still allow achievement of the goal. Alternatively, high levels of trust seem
to allow that motivation to be expressed in ways that involve more risk, but may result in higher overall achievement. The proposition may be integrative in explaining
how trust operates across a variety of contexts, as the
three studies examined three different phenomena (group
performance, negotiations, superior-subordinaterelationships), conducted in experimental and field settings, and
were studied at the individual, dyadic, and group levels
of analysis.
The above ideas provide an illustration of, and evidence for, how trust operates as a moderator in a variety
of contexts. In the next two sections, we consider how
this proposition might be applied to research in two specific contexts: mixed-motive situations and the production of organizational citizenship behaviors. These two
contexts were chosen as they provide existing theoretical
frameworks that we can build on.
Cooperative Behavior in Mixed-Motive Contexts. A
substantial amount of research relevant to organizations
has attempted to understand the determinants of cooperation in situations where interdependentindividuals have
mixed motives. Researchers have studied this problem
using various types of experimental games including social dilemmas, a prisoner's dilemma, and negotiations
(Komorita and Parks 1995). In this section, we draw on

458

the goal/expectancy model (Pruitt and Kimmel 1977)
from the experimental gaming literatureto examine how
interpersonal trust might facilitate cooperative behavior.
Although prior research on trustin this domain has tended
to examine dispositional trust among unfamiliar actors,
our focus will be on interpersonaltrust as defined earlier.
Following the goal/expectancy model, researchershave
suggested that a primary determinant of cooperative behavior in such contexts is participants'goals for achieving
cooperation (Pruitt and Kimmel 1977, Yamagishi 1986),
or more precisely, a goal for cooperation being the dominant goal for an individual (as opposed to a goal for
noncooperation). The goal, which may be determined by
a numberof factors such as the incentive system, provides
the motive for cooperation. But, as researchersnote, such
a goal is insufficientfor cooperationto occurbecauseparticipants must expect that their partner will also cooperate
(Pruittand Kimmel 1977, Yamagishi 1986). Lacking this
expectation, cooperation is unlikely to be attractive and/
or feasible. Trust representsan expectation of cooperation
that may make cooperation attractive and feasible.
Building on the goal/expectancy model, one might propose that trust would moderate the relationship between
individuals' goals and cooperative behavior. Specifically,
under low trust,cooperative goals are unlikely to be translated into cooperative behavior (or the effect of the cooperative goal will be tempered), while under high trust,
cooperative motives are more likely to be translatedinto
cooperative behavior. Although this example provides an
explanation of a situation in which the cooperative motive
is dominant, the idea can also apply to situations in which
cooperative motives and competitive motives (e.g., created by the incentive system) are more equally weighted.
In this case, we predict that trust will determine which of
the two motives is attended to. In other words, under high
levels of trust, the individual will be more likely to attend
to the cooperative motives, while under low levels of
trust, the individual will be more likely to attend to the
competitive motives. This prediction builds on the idea
that because trust influences the individual's assessment
of the partner's future action, it helps one assess the viability of cooperative behavior. For example, in this situation, an individual with low trustin his partnersis likely
to perceive that cooperative behavior is unlikely to result
in personal gains as he believes the partners will take
advantage of his actions.
In sum, in mixed-motive situations, we propose that
trust will moderate the relationship between cooperative
motives and cooperative behavior. At present, there does
not appear to be explicit evidence from the experimental
game area that directly supports this idea, but the goal/
expectancy model provides a theoretical rationale for it.

Trust in Organizational Settings

Organizational Citizenship Behavior. As noted in our
review, researchers have found consistent support for a
main effect of trust on organizational citizenship behavior. We believe, however, that there is a theoretical reason
to expect that trust may also affect organizationalcitizenship behavior via moderation.
Such an idea can be derived from Organ's (1990) exposition of the "motivationalbasis" for organizationalcitizenship behavior. Organ proposes that individual dispositions have a main effect on behavior and that this
effect is moderated by perceived fairness or satisfaction.
For example, conscientiousness, a disposition with motivational properties, exerts a main effect on organizational citizenship behavior. According to Organ (1990),
dissatisfaction produces a "damper"effect on this relationship. Specifically, under low levels of perceived fairness or satisfaction, individuals who might normally be
motivated to engage in citizenship behaviors will withhold them.
We suggest that trust might operate in a similar fashion
by moderating the relationship between determinants of
citizenship behavior (e.g., dispositions) and the expression of citizenship behavior. In other words, individuals
who might normally be motivated to engage in citizenship behavior will tend to withhold it under low levels of
trust. The social exchange perspective used by other researchers to specify the relationship between trust and
organizational citizenship behavior provides the rationale
for this idea. Specifically, researchers argue that under
social exchange there are no specified future obligations
as there are in economic forms of exchange. Hence, in
cases where individuals do not trust the other party (e.g.,
their employer), their tendency to engage in organizational citizenship behavior (or other positive forms of discretionary behavior) is likely to be suppressed because
they feel that the other party will take advantage of their
good citizenship and fail to respond in kind. Alternatively, under high levels of trust, individuals will not have
such reservations and their tendency to engage in organizational citizenship behavior is more likely to be expressed.
Presently, there appears to be no empirical evidence to
explicitly support this proposition, as existing research
has only examined the main effects of trust on organizational citizenship behavior.
2. Trust moderates the relationship bePROPOSITION
tween a partner's action and the truster's response.
We propose that trust may also provide conditions under which cooperation and higher performance are likely
to occur in a second manner:by moderating the relationship between an interaction partner's action and the

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol.

12, No. 4, July-August 2001

truster's response via interpretation.Specifically, trust affects one's interpretation of another's past action or
events relating to the past action: Under high levels of
trust, one is more likely to respond favorably to a partner's action than under low levels of trust.
Interpersonalbehaviors are usually ambiguous to some
degree, therefore interpretation is used to reduce ambiguity, so that individuals can respond appropriately to
others. Scholars have long recognized that people's preexisting beliefs and evaluations guide their interpretations
of objective reality. They determine to a great extent what
people see and hear, and "draw lines about and segregate
an otherwise chaotic environment; they are our methods
for finding our way in an ambiguous universe" (Allport
1935, p. 806). They have been found to relate to what is
perceived in an ambiguous scene, to affect individuals'
causal interpretationof a target person's behavior, and to
affect individuals' evaluations of attitudinally-relevant
empirical evidence (Fiske and Taylor 1991).
Logically, one's response to an action taken by another
party will be a direct function of the action, per se, and
its characteristics (e.g., valence, severity, and frequency).
We suggest, however, that the same action could be interpreted and reacted to differently, depending upon the
level of trust that one has in the other party. Because it is
a core element of an individual's understandingof his or
her relationship with other parties (Berscheid 1994), trust
provides a perspective from which to interpretthe action.
Consequently, it may affect the extent to which the action
is salient, the conclusions one draws about the factors
motivating the partner's action, and ultimately one's psychological and behavioral responses to the action. For
instance, although the valence of feedback impacts employee responses (Fedor 1991), trust in the manager may
moderate this relationship. In response to negative feedback from a trusted manager, an employee is likely to
consider the feedback accurate, and expend extra effort
to try to improve performance. Yet in response to negative feedback from a manager who is not trusted, an employee is likely to doubt the accuracy of the feedback,
and not expend extra effort to improve performance. In
these examples, an action on the part of the managerproviding negative feedback-resulted in different attitudinal, perceptual, and behavioral responses depending
on the level of trust.
As a specific example of this more general proposition,
Mishra and Spreitzer (1998) suggest that in the aftermath
of a downsizing, survivors' level of trust in top management influences the extent to which the downsizing is
considered a threat, and this appraisal affects survivors'
reactions to changes in the level of empowerment and

Trust in Organizational Settings

work redesign. Below we describe several empirical studies that are also consistent with the proposition. While
these hypotheses have been developed to describe the
contingent relationship between specific variables in specific contexts, Proposition 2 provides a more general logic
that can be used to develop hypotheses for a diverse set
of research questions and contexts.
Evidence. Three studies demonstrate how trust may
moderate the relationship between another party's action
and a psychological response. Robinson (1996) found
that initial trust in an employer moderatedthe relationship
between a psychological contract violation and subsequent trust in the employer. She argued that because of
the tendency toward cognitive consistency, initial trust
guides individuals to selectively perceive and interpret
information about the violation in different ways. For example, an individual with high initial trust will tend to
perceive the violation in ways consistent with that level
of trust (e.g., as unintentional, a misunderstanding);
through this process a high level of trust is preserved.
Under low trust, the opposite was proposed to occur. Similarly, Benton et al. (1969) found evidence that trust influenced the relationship between deceit by a partnerand
doubting the partner's word. Specifically, after being deceived by a partner to a limited extent, individuals with
high levels of trust in the partner tended to hold little
doubt about the partner's truthfulness. Alternatively, under the same level of deceit, individuals with low levels
of trust in their partner tended to have significant doubt
about the partner's truthfulness. In their research on employees' interpretationsof organizationalchange, Rousseau
and Tijoriwala (1999) found some evidence that trust in
management moderated the relationship between management's reasons for change and the perceived legitimacy of those changes.
The proposition that different behavioral responses to
a partner'sactions may occur underhigh and low levels of
trust is demonstratedby two studies. Simons and Peterson
(2000) found that trust moderated the relationship between task conflict and relationship conflict within
groups. They proposed that, under low trust, task conflict
within a group is interpretednegatively and subsequently
results in relationship conflict. Alternatively, under high
levels of trust, they suggested that task conflict would be
more likely to be interpretedpositively and hence would
not be translated into relationship conflict. Schurr and
Ozanne (1985) found support for trust as a moderatorof
the relationship between the bargaining stance of a partner (tough versus soft) and several outcomes (integrative
behavior, distributive behavior, and agreements reached)
in a bargaining situation. For example, under high trust,

460

a tough bargaining stance led to integrative behavior and
high levels of agreement; under low trust; a tough bargaining stance resulted in more distributive behavior and
low levels of agreement. The authors suggested that this
was the case because prior levels of trust frame the perceptions of the partner's behavior (e.g., toughness) and
the motives underlying it.
In sum, these five studies support the proposition that
trust influences the relationship between a partner's action and an individual's response to that action. Three of
the studies (Benton et al. 1969, Robinson 1996, Rousseau
and Tijoriwala 1999) provide evidence specifically suggesting that this occurs by influencing an individual's perception of the partner's action: Under high trust, the action is interpreted positively, but under low trust, the
action is more likely to be interpretednegatively. Hence,
the individual is acting in response to the partner'sactions
(e.g., deceit by a partner,intent to cooperate), as opposed
to trust directly. Trust shapes the response elicited.
Although the studies focused on different phenomena
(e.g., psychological contracts, negotiations, group decision making, social dilemmas) and examined phenomena
at the individual, dyadic, and group levels of analysis, the
five studies provide a consistent patternwhen integrated.
Future Research. This idea could be used within the
context of other relationships within organizations where
trust is reputed to be importantfor fostering cooperation.
For instance, researchers might examine how trust operates as a moderator in negotiation processes between labor and management. Some researchers describe negotiation processes as sequences of actions that unfold as
individuals interact with and respond to each other
(Weingart 1997). Putnam and Jones (1982), for example,
examined how individuals in labor and management roles
responded to each others' negotiation behaviors via reciprocity. One might posit that trust would affect this process by moderating the relationship between negotiation
behaviors and responses to the behaviors. Under high levels of trust, the patternmay be more likely to evolve into
a cooperative patternas individuals interpreteach others'
behaviors positively; under low levels of trust, the pattern
may be more likely to evolve into a competitive pattern
as individuals interpreteach others' behaviors negatively.
For example, actions taken by one side (e.g., concessions)
may lead to negative interpretations("They are trying to
take advantage of us!") under low levels of trust between
the parties, but lead to positive interpretationsunder high
levels of trust.In addition,drawingon Simons and Peterson
(2000), conflict over the terms of an agreement may trigger relationship conflict "through a process of misinterpretation and reprisal."

Trust in Organizational Settings

These ideas could also apply to understanding interaction processes in other contexts, such as virtual teams.
Given the limited amount of contextual information (e.g.,
Daft and Lengel 1986) that is available to members of a
virtual team about their partners' behaviors and motives,
the effect of trust as a moderator may be significant. For
example, within a virtual team, the relationship between
a partner's behavior and one's interpretationof and response to that behavior may be highly contingent on the
level of trust. In such a situation, the level of trust may
provide a powerful lens through which that action is interpreted and responded to.
Summary of the Moderation Model
In this section, we developed two propositions regarding
how trust provides the conditions under which favorable
perceptions, attitudes, behaviors, and performance outcomes are likely to occur. In other words, higher levels
of trust increase the likelihood that determinants of cooperation will actually result in favorable outcomes;
lower levels of trust decrease the likelihood. We suggested that there are two distinct ways in which trust
might operate in this fashion.
The evidence that was used to provide tentative support
for this theory came from a variety of settings and situations including supervisor-subordinate relationships,
work groups, negotiation dyads, and social dilemmas. In
addition, it was gathered in both field and experimental
settings. The consistency across these settings suggests
that the propositions may have potential to provide an
integrative understanding of how trust operates.

Conditions Under Which the Models Are
Likely to Be Applicable

In this article, we have discussed two models that describe
different ways that trust might operate in organizational
settings: the main effect model, and the moderationmodel
(Propositions 1 and 2). We suggest both models are valid,
but that given a particularcontext, one model will better
describe the effects of trust than the other. Thus, we now
consider the conditions under which trust is likely to operate as a main effect, a moderator, or neither.
We use the concept of "situational strength"to delineate when each model is likely to be applicable. Researchers suggest that situations are "strong"to the extent
that they provide guidance and incentives to behave in a
particularway, and lead everyone to construe the particular events in a similar way (e.g., Mischel 1977, p. 347).
In contrast, situations are weak to the extent that they do
not provide guidance or incentives to behave in a particular way, and do not provide clear or powerful cues that

ORGANIZATION SCIENCE/Vol.

12, No. 4, July-August 2001

lead individuals to interpret the events in a similar way.
Organizational researchers have found this concept to be
helpful for understandingthe role of psychological states
and traits (e.g., attitudes, personality, beliefs) in impacting workplace outcomes, given the existence of other determinants such as reward systems, rules, and group and
cultural norms (e.g., Davis-Blake and Pfeffer 1989,
House et al. 1996). Examining the simultaneous effect of
trust (a psychological state) and other determinants via
the concept of situational strength builds on arguments
presented earlier in this article: In many situations, there
are factors that have more proximal and direct effects on
workplace outcomes than does trust.
We suggest that the main effect model will be particularly applicable in situations that are weak for the outcome in question. The main effect model is built on the
idea that, because trust is a positive psychological state,
absent other more powerful or proximal determinants,
one will be more likely to engage in a variety of desirable
actions (e.g., cooperation). Consequently, in weak situations, where other factors do not play a strong role in
guiding outcomes, a higher level of trust will have the
opportunityto result in positive outcomes (e.g., behavior,
attitude). Instead of facilitating or hindering the effects of
other constructs (which by definition are not operative)
as described in Propositions 1 and 2, trust will itself have
a more direct effect on the outcome.
However, as situations increase in strength for the outcome in question, the main effect of trustdeclines as other
cues emerge that more directly impact the outcomes. In
midrange situations, where cues are neither weak nor
strong in directing an individual toward an outcome, trust
helps to "tip the scales," as it helps the individual assess
the future behavior of another party and/or interpretpast
behavior. For example, as discussed in Proposition 1,
trust will moderate the effects of behavioral cues on behavioral and performance outcomes because of the assessment of the potential behavior of one's partner. For
Proposition 2, when a partner'sactions are somewhat ambiguous but not entirely so, trust helps to reduce that ambiguity via interpretation.In other words, because of the
moderate ambiguity, individuals' interpretive processes
will shape how the partner's action is perceived, and thus
will shape the individual's response to that action.
Lastly, in situations that are very strong for the outcome in question, outcomes become "over-determined"
(dominated) by other factors, and therefore trust is unlikely to demonstrate an appreciable effect. More specifically, as cues to behave in a particularway become very
strong, concerns related to trust in the other party are
likely to be set aside, and therefore trust will not facilitate
461

<-----Page 13----->KURT T. DIRKS AND DONALD L. FERRIN

Trust in Organizational Settings

or hinder the effects of the cues as described in Proposition 1. And as another party's actions become very unambiguous, Proposition 2 is likely to become less applicable because interpretationbecomes unnecessary.
In summary, we propose that trust will demonstrate a
main effect in situations that are weak for the outcome in
question, and will have no effect in strong situations. In
midrange situations, trust will facilitate the effects of
other factors by reducing the ambiguity associated with
assessing others' potential future behavior or the motives
underlying others' past behavior. Given that situations are
arrayedalong a continuum from weak to strong, in theory,
trust may sometimes simultaneously operate via both
models. We suggest, however, that the dominant observable effects are likely to be as a main effect or a moderator, contingent upon the strength of the situation. An
implication is that, in many cases, researchers should examine main and interactive effects of trust.
Implications
Some researchers have argued that most organizational
settings are relatively high in situational strength because
of the deliberate use of reward systems, rules, goals, etc.
(Davis-Blake and Pfeffer 1989). This would likely include many of the day-to-day situations that organizational members experience. However, other researchers
have countered that many situations, such as mergers,
downsizings, the founding of an organization, cultural
changes, structuralchanges, and situations involving the
existence of numerous competing goals, are weak (e.g.,
House et al. 1996). Given this variance in the situational
strength of work settings, our analysis suggests that trust
will operate in substantially different ways according to
the work setting. For instance, one might speculate that
trust will have a significant main effect on employee's
reactions in a downsizing or a merger, because of the
uncertainty involved, but may have a moderating effect
in situations where there is less uncertainty and ambiguity.
In addition, different types of research settings also
vary in their strength. Prior research has recognized that
experiments conducted in laboratory settings are less
likely to show main effects of psychological constructs
such as attitudes, partially because experiments create
moderate to strong situations (Eagly and Chaiken 1993).
In fact, many of the studies in the present review that
found effects for trust as a moderator, but not as a main
effect, used experimental methods in laboratory settings.
One might also extend the logic of strong and weak
situations to make predictions about the types of outcomes that, on average, would be more susceptible to be
governed by predictors other than trust. For example, absenteeism is likely to be largely dictated by organizational
462

rules, sanctions, and reward systems. Consequently, we
might expect trust not to operate as a main effect on absenteeism, but instead operate as a moderator or not at
all. In contrast, other acts are more "discretionary"(e.g.,
organizational citizenship behavior) across most situations, and therefore trust may be more likely to demonstrate a main effect. The effect of trust on attitudeswould
follow a similar logic.
Finally, we note that while these ideas are useful for
identifying which model better describes the effect of
trust,they also help resolve discrepantpredictionsmade by
researchers who claim that interpersonaltrust has no significant impact in organizationalsettings (e.g., Williamson
1993), with those made by researchers who argue it has
a substantial impact (e.g., Golembiewski and McConkie
1975, Kramer 1999). The former rests on the assumption
that organizations are largely (strongly) governed by factors such as contracts, rewards, rules, etc., while the latter
makes no such assumption. Consequently, drawing on the
logic articulated above, depending upon which assumption is warranted in a given situation, trust may operate
as a main effect, a moderator, or not at all.

Discussion
The idea that trust has numerous benefits for organizations has been, and continues to be, a major impetus for
research on trust (Golembiewski and McConkie 1975,
Kramer 1999). Our review indicates that there is empirical support for the idea that trust has importantbenefits
for organizations. However, researchers should hesitate
to assume that these benefits are always transmittedin a
singular or straightforwardmanner, or even that the effects of trust and the mechanisms through which it operates are the same regardless of the organizational context. The primarypurpose of our article is to examine two
alternative models that describe the way in which trust
operates, further develop the moderation model, and explore when trust is likely to function according to each
model.
Research Implications
The propositions on moderation are likely to have implications not only for researchers interested in understanding the role of trust, but also for researchers in other literatures.Because the two propositions describe how trust
influences the impact of a range of predictors on perceptions, attitudes,behaviors, and performanceoutcomes, researchers outside the trust area may be able to utilize the
propositions to better understand heterogeneity in established relationships between the constructs of interest in

ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/VO1.12, No. 4, July-August 2001

<-----Page 14----->KURT T. DIRKS AND DONALD L. FERRIN

Trust in Organizational Settings

that area. For example, we previously explored how Propositions 1 and 2 may be applicable for research on negotiations, organizational citizenship behavior, strategic
games, and virtual teams. We do not feel the propositions
are limited to these areas;rather,we believe the ideas may
apply more generally to problems where there is uncertainty and ambiguity about future or past actions of another party under conditions of vulnerability.
As suggested earlier, trust, as a representation of how
individuals understand their relationship with another
party, operates by affecting how one assesses the future
behavior or interprets the actions of another party. Much
of the existing research on the consequences of trust has
been focused on trust as being about expectations of future behavior of another party. Future research may give
more consideration to the significant role that trust plays
on interpretations of behavior, the motives underlying
those behaviors, and how this affects individuals' responses. Previously, we explored how this idea might be
helpful in examining negotiation processes and how trust
may impact reciprocity. Likewise, it might be helpful in
studying other reciprocity-based processes such as retribution (Bies and Tripp 1996). Low trust would be expected to fuel a retributionprocess, while high trust may
limit it. As a final example, it may be helpful for understanding how and why employees respond to managerial
actions in organizations that have experienced recent organizational changes which have broken trust.
While the framework describes the effect of trust as
primarily a main or moderated effect depending on the
strength of the situation, the framework also suggests that
in some cases trust may simultaneously have a main and
moderating effect. This presents a methodological concern because of the difficulty of interpretinga main effect
in the presence of a significant interaction. The maineffect model suggests that the effect of trust is linear,
while the moderation model suggests that the effect is
nonlinear. Therefore, when an interaction is present, a
main effect should not be interpretedas a constant effect,
but only as an average effect, recognizing that the actual
effect varies over different levels of trust and the other
predictor variable(s) (see Jaccard et al. 1990). Accordingly, when trust simultaneously operates via both models, it may be difficult to draw a clear conclusion about
the magnitude of the main effect. Yet it will be particularly difficult to do so if predictor variables other than
trust, and/or the interaction terms, are excluded from the
model.4 Consequently, in midrange situations researchers
should be careful to measure predictor variables other
than trust; failing to do so may result in an erroneous
interpretationof the nature (i.e., main vs. moderation) of
the effect of trust, and/or the magnitude of the main effect.
ORGANIZATIONSCIENCE/Vol. 12, No. 4, July-August 2001

Thus, the framework in this article may assist researchers
in better anticipating the effects of trust in various workplace contexts, and appropriately designing research so
that they can more accurately assess those effects empirically.
The ideas presented, and evidence reviewed, suggest
that trust has an important impact on attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. But, the propositions and framework
presented in this article suggest that in many situations
there are other constructs that can have a more direct and
substantial impact on outcomes than does trust. Future
research might examine the impact of trust relative to
these other determinants to obtain a better understanding
of the role of trust in organizations.
Lastly, it is important to note that the main effect and
moderation models often do not describe all factors that
may impact the effects of trust on outcomes. As one casein-point, while the models describe how trust impacts the
behavior of the truster, they do not address other factors
that may affect the outcome such as the actual behavior
of other individuals. (Note that Proposition 1 deals with
the anticipated future behavior of the trustee, while Proposition 2 deals with the past behavior of the trustee; neither proposition predicts the actual future behavior of the
trustee). For example, when outcomes depend upon multiple parties (e.g., group performance outcomes resulting
from group members' cooperative behavior) the effect of
any single individual's level of trust on the outcome may
be diffused or otherwise limited. Research in particular
literatures that are affected by these factors will clearly
need to take them into account.
Managerial Implications
Our analysis suggests that, broadly speaking, managers
interested in capitalizing on high trust or mitigating the
effects of low trust have at least two options available to
them. First, they may attempt to change the level of trust
in their organizations. A number of interventions have
been developed for this purpose, and while they appear
to be effective in changing trust levels, their impact on
otheroutcomesis inconsistent(e.g., Woodmanand Sherwood
1980). Our analysis suggests that this inconsistency may
be because of the situation: While increases in trust are
likely to have a direct positive impact in weak situations,
they will only have a contingent impact in midrange situations and will have no impact in strong situations.
Second, managers often have the capacity to change
the strength of situations. Our analysis suggests and provides a theoretical rationale for the idea that when trust
is high, managers can capitalize by destructuring:making
the situation very weak, so that outcomes are determined
by trust ratherthan by other factors. However, when trust
463

<-----Page 15----->KURT T. DIRKS AND DONALD L. FERRIN

Trust in Organizational Settings

is low, managers will benefit by creating a highly structured environment so that trust will neither directly nor
indirectly cause negative outcomes. In fact, trust levels
are usually at their ebb during periods such as organizational crises, downsizings, and mergers, when situations
are weak and low trust is, therefore, likely to have a direct
negative effect. Managers cognizant of these processes
can therefore strengthen such situations by introducing
strong and unambiguous proximal cues despite the
broader uncertainty inherent in the situation. These ideas
also suggest that managers may be more successful in
implementing change efforts on a proactive rather than
reactive basis, doing so in "good times" rather than bad,
when trust levels are high rather than low.
"Downside" Implications of the Moderation Model
In the section on moderation, we focused on the positive
benefits that trust may facilitate. These positive benefits
occurred because trust provided the individual with an
assessment of another party's future behavior and/or interpretations of the party's past behavior. Consequently,
under high levels of trust, the truster was more likely to
cooperate, put oneself at risk to the other party, and/or
perceive the other party's actions in a positive light.
It is important to recognize, however, that high levels
of trust may not always be warranted. When trust is not
warranted there is a significant potential downside of
providing a greater "opportunity for malfeasance" (e.g.,
Granovetter 1985, p. 491, Kramer et al. 1995) because it
affects assessments of future behavior and/or interpretations of past behavior. For example, Benton et al. (1969)
found that despite being taken advantage of 25% of the
time by a partner, high-trust participants failed to lose
trust in the partner and continued to allow the partnerto
systematically take advantage of them. In other words,
instead of being a "mechanism that mitigates against
risk," as some economic scholars suggest (c.f. Bigley and
Pearce 1998), trust may actually increase the potential for
opportunistic behavior to occur. Hence, the dynamics of
the moderation model provide two theoretical rationales
for why trust might simultaneously provide the conditions
under which cooperative behavior is more likely to occur,
but also under which opportunistic behavior is more
likely to occur.
Conclusion and Summary
Over the last several decades, management researchers
have increasingly recognized that trustplays an important
role in work organizations, and empirical evidence has
generally but not consistently supported this perspective.
In most cases, scholars have assumed that trust has a direct, positive effect on outcomes of interest, and have
designed empirical research to assess these direct effects.

In this article, we have developed an alternative model
that describes how trust functions as a moderator, facilitating or hindering the effect of other determinants on
outcomes of interest. In doing so, it attempts to make
several contributions: (a) developing the idea of moderation at the level of propositions, which will allow authors
of future empirical studies of trust from a variety of literatures to develop hypotheses and research designs specific to their question and context, (b) identifying and
discussing two distinct psychological processes through
which trust may act as a moderator, (c) specifying when
(i.e., under what conditions) trust is likely to demonstrate
a main effect, a moderating effect, or neither, and (d)
reviewing and integrating the existing empirical literature
on trust. The framework has implications for positioning
trust theoretically, studying it empirically, and utilizing it
practically.

Appendix Procedures for Identifying Empirical
Studies
Steps
(1) Search of electronic databases: PsyclNFO, ABI Inform, Social Science Abstracts.
(2) Examine reference lists of prior nonempirical research that included a review (e.g., Golembiewski and McConkie 1975, Kramer
1999, Mayer et al. 1995, Pruitt and Carnevale 1993, Ross and LaCroix
1996).
(3) Manual review of journals (1980 to present): Academy of Management Journal, Administrative Science Quarterly,Journal ofApplied
Psychology, Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,
and Organization Science.
(4) Perusal of reference section of articles identified in prior steps.

Criteriafor Inclusion
(1) Trust was defined as a psychological state (see Introduction for
details). Studies operationalizing trust as a behavior (e.g., Deutsch
1958, Komorita and Mechling 1967) or as a disposition (e.g., Rotter
1967) were excluded.
(2) The study positioned trust as an antecedent variable and trust was
specifically hypothesized to be related to a dependent variable that was
a behavior, an indicator of performance, or a work-related attitude or
cognition. Accordingly, we did not include any articles in which trust
was solely positioned as a correlate (e.g., Kavanagh 1975) or as a dependent variable.
(3) Studies that quantitatively measured trust (e.g., with a survey) or
manipulated it were included; qualitative studies were not included.
Note. We believe that the procedures described above should have
detected the bulk of relevant empirical studies. We recognize these
procedures may have missed a few studies in which trust played a
minor role. The manual searches should have decreased the occurrence
of this problem for most of the recent research.

Trust in Organizational Settings

Endnotes
'Although the effect sizes reported in the table provide important information, readers should be appropriately cautious in the interpretation of them. First, there are a number of studies for which we were
unable to estimate an effect size, and many of those were cases where
the results were reported as statistically nonsignificant. Second, a number of the relationships may be slightly inflated as a number of studies
measured trust and the dependent variables at the same time, using the
same methods, and/or using the same source. Third, effect sizes should
be interpreted as evidence of the existence of a relationship, but not as
evidence of causality (Rosenthal 1991).
2For purposes of completeness, we note three studies that examined
outcomes associated with trust, although they do not fit the main-effect
model described here. Two studies suggest that an individual's trust in
another party affects the other party's behavior. For example, Atwater
argued that subordinates' trust in their manager affected the amount of
"supportive"behavior the manager engaged in. Fried et al. (1992) proposed that when superiors perceived that their subordinates did not trust
them, they avoided evaluating the performance of the subordinates
(presumably because they felt the subordinates would question their
appraisals). Lastly, Ross and Wieland (1996) examined the idea that a
mediator's perception of the negotiating parties' trust in each other
influenced the mediator's strategy.
3We also note that there were several studies that we coded as examining the effects of trust on behaviors and/or performance, although
they arguably could be catalogued as supporting the main effects of
trust on perceived behaviors. In other words, the studies were operationally examining the effect of trust on perceptions of behavior, as
reported by the truster(e.g., Porterand Lilly 1996, De Dreu et al. 1998).
4This observation may enable researchers to better interpretthe results
of past research, as summarized in Tables 1 and 2. In the studies reported in Tables 1 and 2, there is inadequate information to rate the
research setting as, e.g., weak, midrange, strong, or somewhere between these points. Thus, it is likely, albeit not demonstrable, that some
of the studies in Table 1 may have omitted important predictor variables and/or interaction terms. If this were the case, the main effects
would tend to be inconsistent (because the main effect of trust is not
constant) and occasionally weak (because in midrange and strong situations trust should not have main effect). While the results in Table
1 differ by dependent variable, overall they do appear to be fairly inconsistent and weak. In contrast, the interpretationof interaction terms
is not necessarily impaired by the presence of a significant main effect.
If it is assumed that most of the studies reported in Table 2 were set
in midrange situations where the moderation model is applicable, this
provides a plausible explanation for the more consistent support for
the moderation model examined in Table 2.
