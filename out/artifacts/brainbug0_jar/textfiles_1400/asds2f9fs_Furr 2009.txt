Personality Psychology as a Truly Behavioural Science
R. MICHAEL FURR*
Department of Psychology, Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, USA

Abstract
Personality psychology has been accused of neglecting behaviour—of devoting insufﬁcient
attention to what people actually do. The current paper addresses four important issues
regarding the study of behaviour as separate from other important psychological
responses—the deﬁnition of behaviour, the importance of studying behaviour, the strengths
and weaknesses of core methods through which behaviour is studied and the degree to
which behaviour actually has been studied in personality psychology over the past 15 years
(along with information about the use of speciﬁc methods of studying behaviour).
Analysis of publication trends indicates that behaviour is not studied to the degree it
merits; furthermore, it indicates that, when behaviour is studied, it is usually studied at a
very generalized level relying on relatively weak methods. The current paper is offered as
a starting point for focused discussion of these important issues, potentially enhancing the
ﬁeld’s standing as a truly behavioural science. Copyright # 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
Many of us tell people that personality psychology is based upon a scientiﬁc study of
human behaviour. Whether it is during the ﬁrst day of class, during a conversation at a
dinner party, while explaining our careers to friends and families, or while trying to
convince society more generally that psychological research is valuable, we assure people
that, as psychological scientists, we seek to understand the processes underlying important
human behaviour. Many, if not most, people seem to appreciate this goal.
It is ironic then that personality psychology seems to lack dedication to the study of
behaviour. Although the ﬁeld has produced important insights into human nature, several
problems reduce the ﬁeld’s impact as a truly behavioural science. The current paper is
intended to address these problems and to initiate dialogue about behavioural research in
personality psychology by exploring the deﬁnition of behaviour as separate from other
psychological responses, the importance of behaviour, the core types of behavioural data

and the trends in the ﬁeld’s use of behavioural data. This discussion leads to the conclusions
that behaviour merits greater attention and that greater use of high-quality, wide-ranging
behavioural data is crucial for the well-being of personality psychology.

GOALS OF THIS PAPER
This paper is based upon several fundamental issues that I believe are crucial for the ﬁeld’s
study of behaviour. First, personality psychologists must pursue consensus about the
deﬁnition of behaviour. It appears that we use the term behaviour very loosely and
inconsistently—what one researcher calls behavioural data, another may call cognitive
data; what one researcher sees as a behavioural checklist, a colleague may view as a selfreport questionnaire; and what one researcher submits as children’s behaviour-in-dailylife, a reviewer may dismiss as parental reports of children’s personalities. That is, there
seems to be minimal consensus about behaviour and, by extension, what constitutes
behavioural data. Such ambiguities are a signiﬁcant conceptual weakness of the ﬁeld,
potentially impeding the ﬁeld’s progress as a cumulative science. When authors state that
they have studied ‘behaviour’, the ﬁeld should understand what they mean. Indeed, I am
often surprised at the various ways that behaviour has been conceptualized and measured,
and, in fact, I now have only vague expectations as I begin reading a supposedly
‘behavioural’ study. Thus, this paper presents a deﬁnition of behaviour, differentiating it
from other important psychological phenomena.
Second, the importance of behaviour may be under-appreciated, and we should weigh
the importance of behaviour against the strengths and weaknesses of various types of
behavioural data. An under-appreciation of its importance may reduce motivation to
collect, examine, and publish behavioural data. Of course, the argument that personality
psychology underutilizes behavioural data should be accompanied by a discussion of the
importance of such data—why should personality psychology pay more, or any, attention
to behaviour? Furthermore, even if we generally appreciate the importance of behaviour,
we must identify speciﬁc methods of assessing behaviour. To date, there has been no
comprehensive and integrative discussion of core types of behavioural data and their
relative merits. Personality psychology may eventually move towards behaviour, but such
movement is most productive if we use methods closely reﬂecting actual behaviour.
Moreover, under-appreciation of the costs and difﬁculties of collecting good behavioural
data may lead reviewers and editors to expect more from behavioural studies than is
warranted or practical. For example, many top tier journals require multiple studies, which
may be an enormous burden on researchers who spend many months or even years
collecting, preparing and analysing a wonderfully rich set of behavioural data. To address
these important issues, this paper presents several fundamental roles of behaviour in the
science of personality psychology, and it organizes, describes and evaluates core methods
that provide wide-ranging behavioural data. The evaluation acknowledges that each
method has its role, its advantages, and its disadvantages, but it highlights three methods—
direct behavioural observation, experience sampling assessments of behaviour and
acquaintance-reports of recent behaviour—as being the best direct reﬂections of actual
behaviour.
Third, a good analysis of the past, present and future role of behaviour and behavioural
data requires evidence regarding the degree to which we truly study behaviour in general
and the frequency with which we use high-quality behavioural data in particular. Previous

work (Baumeister, Vohs, & Funder, 2007; Robins, Tracy, & Sherman, 2007) suggests some
under-appreciation of behaviour and behavioural data; however, this work does not directly
reﬂect the degree to which behaviour is examined by personality psychologists speciﬁcally,
and it does not provide clear information about the range of behavioural methods
represented in published research. Thus, the paper examines methodological trends in the
ﬁeld’s study of behaviour, with particular emphasis on the core methods of behavioural
assessment.
These issues have important implications for personality psychology, as illustrated by
the ebb and ﬂow of the act frequency approach to personality (AFA; Buss & Craik, 1983).
AFA asserted that personality dispositions are rightfully viewed as ‘summary statements
about behavior up to the present’ (Buss & Craik 1983, p. 106). From this perspective, the
typical research program relied upon retrospective self-reports (or retrospective
acquaintance-reports) of behavioural events categorized into dispositional domains such
as dominance and aloofness. Participants completed ‘act reports’, which included up to 100
behaviours deemed relevant to a speciﬁc dispositional domain, and they rated the
frequency with which they had manifested each behaviour during the previous three
months (e.g. Buss & Craik, 1985). This approach—its conceptual and methodological
qualities—was inﬂuential in the 1980s, but it waned after several signiﬁcant criticisms
emerged. Perhaps most notable was Block’s (1989) critique, which pointed to several
conceptual and methodological issues potentially compromising AFA’s utility. Of
immediate relevance are two particular issues. The ﬁrst was ambiguity regarding the
meaning of ‘acts’ themselves—Block argued that the AFA approach failed to ‘discuss the
nature of acts and how, conceptually, they are to be delineated’ (p. 234). The second issue
was the fact that the typical AFA-based research design relied on relatively weak methods
for measuring behaviour. Block argued that the reliance on retrospective self- or
acquaintance-reports of behaviour provided thin evidence of actual behaviour, concluding
that ‘nowhere have acts been directly observed in the AFA’ (p. 237, but see also Gosling,
John, Craik, & Robins, 1998). These issues and their cutting implications for the AFA are
echoed in the central points of discussion in the current paper—the deﬁnition of behaviour
and the evaluation of methods of measuring behaviour. For sustained, productive advances
in personality psychology, such issues should be discussed and, ideally, resolved as
thoroughly as possible.

DEFINING BEHAVIOUR
Perhaps the most fundamental issue at hand is the concept of behaviour itself—what is a
behaviour and what is not? Because personality psychology has not discussed this
fundamental question in a comprehensive manner, we seem to have only two easily
accessible ways of evaluating what the ﬁeld means by behaviour—by examining the way
that authors have attempted to organize the ﬁeld’s data, and by examining what is presented
as behaviour in our research. Neither approach produces clarity. For example, Funder’s
(2004) categorization of behavioural information includes ‘time taken to seek help’ in a
lab-based situation, physiological responses such as blood pressure and brain functioning,
and responses to some traditional personality tests such as the MMPI and the TAT. In
contrast, Mayer’s (2004) categorization frames brain functioning as ‘Biomedical Data’,
and it frames free association tests as ‘Thematic World Report Data’. In terms of actual
presentation in research, ‘behaviour’ varies from phenomena such as one’s degree of

talkativeness during social encounters (Furr & Funder, 1998), to academic performance as
reﬂected in one’s score on a statistics test (Hair & Hampson, 2006), to ‘behavioural
impulsivity’ as reﬂected in participants’ performance on computerized attention tasks
(e.g. Dougherty, Mathias, Marsh-Richard, Furr, Nouvion, & Dawes, in press).
In an effort to move towards a coherent and consensual deﬁnition, I suggest that
behaviour may be deﬁned as verbal utterances (excluding verbal reports in psychological
assessment contexts) or movements that are potentially available to careful observers
using normal sensory processes. By limiting behaviour to movements that could be
perceived by others through normal senses, this deﬁnition emphasizes the potentiality for
behaviour to have direct social consequences. This excludes many internal physiological
responses such as neural events and blood pressure, and it excludes external physiological responses such as blushing or sweating; however, it includes potentially nonintentional responses such as trembling and gaze aversion—physical movements with
potentially important social implications. Similarly, the deﬁnition excludes most indices of
reaction time or computerized cognitive assessment, as such information is not potentially
observable through normal sensory processes. Furthermore, such assessments are
generally interpreted as indicators of cognitive or affective responses, rather than being
interpreted as meaningful ‘behaviours’ in their own right. However, the deﬁnition includes
many other forms of behaviour—verbal and nonverbal, intentional and unintentional,
visual (e.g. smiling) and auditory (e.g. using a particular tone of voice), macro (e.g. leading
a rally) and micro (e.g. raising an eyebrow). Note that, by this deﬁnition, verbal utterances
are behaviours (e.g. verbalizes hostility, tells an off-colour joke), but an important
distinction should be drawn between unsolicited, spontaneous verbal statements about
one’s (or another’s) personality versus verbal statements made in response to direct
questioning by researchers in a personality assessment context. By the deﬁnition above,
verbal statements about one’s personality can indeed be considered behaviours. For
example, if someone states ‘I am an intellectual person’, then this is indeed a verbal
behaviour (e.g. ‘claims to be intellectual’). Whether such a statement should be considered
an interesting behavioural event likely depends upon the context in which it is expressed.
For example, a spontaneous, unsolicited and repetitive tendency to claim to be intellectual
may indeed be an interesting behaviour that may or may not be empirically associated with
‘Intellectualism’ or a similar trait, perhaps being more of a behavioural manifestation of
narcissism. On the other hand, if such a claim is made in response to a direct question from
a researcher (e.g. ‘Do you consider yourself to be an intellectual person?’), then the
statement is perhaps appropriately interpreted as a basic self-report of personality, rather
than an otherwise-interesting behavioural event. Finally, by deﬁning behaviour in terms of
actions that are potentially available, the deﬁnition includes actions and responses
expressed in social situations as well as those expressed by people while they are alone. For
example, if George throws a shoe at his dog while he is alone at home, this would qualify as
behaviour because it could have been detected by others if they were present.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEHAVIOUR
As summarized in Table 1, I believe that the study of behaviour has at least four important
roles in personality psychology. The ﬁrst and perhaps most obvious role is that behaviour
can be the primary phenomenon to be explained in psychological research. That is,
researchers may be interested in the causes and/or predictors of important behaviours.

Table 1. The roles of behaviour in personality psychology
Roles of behaviour in personality psychology
1. Important behaviours are key phenomenon to be explained
2. Behaviour is the foundation of important theoretical phenomena (e.g. cross-situational
behavioural consistency)
3. Behaviour is a mechanism within psychosocial processes
4. Behaviour reveals the importance and nature of personality constructs and measures

Many psychological phenomena are central to human nature, human well-being and
general societal functioning, and indeed, they are fundamental to personality psychology.
But behaviour is where other psychological responses such as thoughts, feelings,
motivations and values become concrete and become most tangibly consequential for one’s
self and others. What we think, feel, desire and value may have their most important effects
when we actually act upon those thoughts, feelings, desires and values. Thus, behaviour
merits substantial attention in personality psychology.
For example, Ayduk, Rodriguez, Mischel, Shoda, and Wright (2007) evaluated verbal
intelligence and self-regulatory competence as predictors of boys’ aggressive behaviour.
Aggressive behaviour was operationalized as acquaintance-reports (i.e. teachers and camp
counsellors) of participants’ recent aggressive behaviour in daily life, with results
suggesting that verbal intelligence and self-regulatory competence had an interactive effect
on aggressive behaviour—high verbal intelligence was linked to low aggression among
boys who had high regulatory competence more so than among boys who had lower
regulatory competence. Such research is important because it helps ‘identify the
psychological conditions necessary for understanding and potentially reducing aggression
in at risk youth’ (Ayduk et al., 2007, p. 386). This research is notable, in part, because it
included high-quality behavioural data. Speciﬁcally, multiple camp counsellors rated boys’
aggressive behaviour on multiple occasions, with ratings provided in close temporal
proximity to those occasions. Moreover, the behavioural dependent variable was a
composite of two speciﬁc aggression variables—verbal and physical aggression—that
were highly correlated with each other, reﬂecting a strong level of internal consistency.
Unfortunately, research intended to evaluate the causes and predictors of behaviour rarely
includes such good behavioural data. More commonly, such research includes self-reports
or informant-reports of behaviours that are decontextualized and retrospective. As argued
later, such data are relatively weak indicators of behaviour.
A second important role of behaviour is as the foundation of some of the most
fundamental phenomena in personality psychology. Phenomena such as cross-situational
behavioural consistency (Funder & Colvin, 1991; Furr & Funder, 2004), the temporal
stability of cross-situational behavioural proﬁles (Fournier, Moskowitz, & Zuroff, 2008;
Shoda, Mischel, & Wright, 1994) and the predictability of behavioural contingencies
(Fleeson, 2007) provide important perspectives on the very nature and functioning of
personality. In investigations of these phenomena, the speciﬁc behaviours examined are not
usually of primary interest; rather they are exemplars of behaviour in general or of certain
classes of behaviour. However, our understanding of these important phenomena are most
strongly informed by observing what people actually do—by observing a range of
behaviours that people truly enact.
For example, Furr and Funder (2004) examined the cross-situational consistency of
participants’ behavioural proﬁles. Participants were observed in several situations, with

behaviour coded by independent judges in terms of 64 behavioural items. The correlation
between a participant’s 64-item behavioural proﬁle in one situation and his/her behavioural
proﬁle in another situation represented the consistency with which the participant exhibited
behaviour across situations. Results revealed signiﬁcant consistency even after controlling
for situationally normative behavioural tendencies, and they revealed that consistency was
stronger between similar situations than between dissimilar situations. In this research, the
64 behaviours reﬂected a range of personality-relevant social actions, and this research
was, again, notable partly for its use of good behavioural data. Although previous
researchers had examined similar questions (e.g. Magnusson & Ekehammar, 1978), that
work relied on participants’ descriptions of the pattern of reactions that they would likely
show in each situation. Such work was informative, but the degree to which it reﬂected real
behavioural phenomena was unknown.
A third important role of behaviour in personality research is as part of processes
affecting important psychosocial outcomes. Behaviour can have important effects on
outcomes such as relationship satisfaction, physical health, social acceptance and job
satisfaction. Along with other psychological responses potentially affecting such
outcomes, behaviour merits serious and well-designed examination. This type of work,
though relatively rare, is well represented by Downey’s examination of a behavioural
mediation model of rejection sensitivity’s effect on anger and rejection from romantic
partners (Downey, Freitas, Michaelis, & Khouri, 1998). Downey and her colleagues
hypothesized that rejection sensitivity produces maladaptive behaviours during stressful
interpersonal interactions with a romantic partner and that these behaviours would elicit
anger—and thus potential rejection—from the partner. Participants engaged in 20-minute
videotaped interactions with their romantic partners. Judges observed the videotapes and
coded behaviours such as ‘put-down’, ‘deny responsibility’ and ‘hostile or negative voice
tone’. Results supported the mediational hypothesis, with negative behaviours accounting
for much of the effect of rejection sensitivity on partner’s post-interaction anger.
A fourth role for behaviour in personality research is that it elucidates concrete
implications of personality constructs, and it reveals observable implications of new
measures. That is, behaviour is an outcome through which personality constructs manifest
themselves concretely—indeed, personality constructs without behavioural implications
are unlikely to be widely interesting or important. In this sense, behaviour helps reveal the
breadth and nature of personality’s impact. Similarly, behaviour reveals the observable,
tangible meaning of new measures or methods. Although new measures or methods of
assessment may have many cognitive, perceptual, emotional and motivational correlates,
their theoretical and practical importance is limited if they have no demonstrable
behavioural implications.
For example, Asendorpf, Banse, and Mücke (2002) examined potential differences
between shyness as a facet of implicit self-concept and explicit self-ratings of shyness, with
particular interest in differential behavioural implications. Participants were videotaped
during several shyness-inducing activities, and, after watching the videotapes, observers
coded six behaviours that were manifestations of shyness (e.g. speech duration, gaze
aversion). Results revealed that the implicit measure of shyness was uniquely associated
with shyness behaviours hypothesized to be spontaneous or automatized; in contrast, the
explicit measure of shyness was uniquely associated with shyness behaviours hypothesized
to be controlled. Such research capitalizes on a careful process of observing and coding
behaviour, and it provides important insight into the personality constructs under
investigation.

TYPES OF BEHAVIOURAL DATA: STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
In the effort to understand behaviour’s true connections with personality, we must use
research methods that are highly relevant and maximally informative. That is, we must
employ measures that reveal what people actually do and that do so well.
As summarized in Table 2, this section presents nine methods that, according to the
deﬁnition above, produce behavioural data. It focuses on methods that can reﬂect a wide
range of meaningful behaviours. That is, these methods are used to gather information
across many different behavioural and social domains—for example, prosocial
behaviours, solitary actions, maladaptive behaviours, work-related responses, parenting,
behaviour within romantic relationships and so on. In addition, these methods can be used
to gather information across many levels of abstraction—from micro-level behaviours
such as eyeblinks and gaze aversion, to mid-level behaviours such as talkativeness and
expressions of gratitude, to macro-level behavioural styles such as ‘friendly behaviour’ or
‘conscientious behaviour’.
Focusing on methods with such wide-ranging applications, the following discussion
does not address methods providing narrowly focused behavioural information. For
example, a recent study of values and behaviour examined ‘value-congruent behaviour’ by
giving participants the opportunity to donate money to a human-rights organization and
recording whether each participant did so (Verplanken & Holland, 2002, p. 442). This
highly speciﬁc task was a reasonable way of evaluating a single behaviour with relevance to
the hypothesis in question, but it would not fall clearly within the types of behavioural data
in Table 2. Similarly, some mechanical or automatized devices produce data reﬂecting
speciﬁc behaviours. For example, global positioning system (GPS) technology can trace
participants’ movements and locations, and such information could be relevant to

personality. As researchers adopt such technology, they may derive a great deal of
information; however, an initial consideration suggests that the information may be
relevant to a rather narrow range of personality-relevant behaviours. Although such
narrowly focused methods or ‘behavioural tests’ are useful ways of assessing speciﬁc
behaviours, they are not general methods for examining a wide range of behaviours.
Furthermore, the discussion focuses on data representing an individual’s behaviour—
that is, data interpreted as reﬂecting the way a person actually acts. For example, a recent
study of attachment in romantic relationships used observational data to reveal the display
of ‘emotional, instrumental, and physical caregiving behaviours’ in stressful situations
(Simpson, Winterheld, Rholes, & Oriña, 2007, p. 466). In the interest of clarity, such data
should be distinguished from behaviourally derived data reﬂecting other psychological
responses. For example, researchers might examine cognitive responses such as decisionmaking by having participants pick up one of two cards on a table, or they might study
attention-regulation by measuring reaction times under various conditions. In a very broad
sense, such data could be viewed as behavioural because participants perform a physical
act in order to produce their data. However, such data are most clearly interpretable as
indicators of cognitive events. Almost all data might be deemed ‘behavioural’ in this
second sense. That is, most psychological data arise from behaviour of some kind—
whether picking up a card, interacting with another person, pressing a button on a computer
keyboard, drawing a picture or marking a response on a questionnaire. Thus, the current
paper focuses on behaviour and behavioural data in the ﬁrst sense—data intended
to represent how a person acts rather than how a person thinks, feels or otherwise
responds.
Also excluded from the current paper are important forms of data that emerge from
behaviour but that are not themselves interpreted as indicators of behaviour. Perhaps most
signiﬁcant are two forms of data that are close to behaviour but are not considered
behavioural data in this manuscript. First, the current discussion does not include general
personality trait ratings based upon behavioural observations. For example, ‘thin slice’
research often focuses on personality trait judgments derived from observations of
individuals’ behaviour (e.g. Borkenau, Mauer, Riemann, Spinath, & Angleitner, 2004). In
such research, behaviour is the information upon which trait ratings are based. However,
the trait ratings, or other ratings reﬂecting inferences about psychological characteristics,
are typically the data of interest, and they are, in a sense, a step removed from behaviour
itself—they are taken as indicators of individuals’ psychological characteristics rather than
of the behaviour itself. If, in contrast, observers provide ratings of individuals’ behaviour
expressed within the thin slice, then such data would indeed be behavioural (see the
discussion of direct behavioural observations discussion, below). Of course, behaviourally
based trait ratings might be highly correlated with ratings of the behaviour itself; however,
this is an empirical question, and the two types of data reﬂect conceptually distinguishable
phenomena. A second important behaviourally relevant form of data excluded from the
current discussion is behavioural residue or behavioural traces. For example, Gosling, Ko,
Mannarelli, and Morris (2002) examined the degree to which personality trait judgments
were affected by interior ‘behavioural residue’ in the form of the personal environments
that people choose or create (e.g. the variety of books in their ofﬁces, the degree of clutter in
their bedrooms). Although such environmental qualities are indeed reﬂective of personality
and they are based upon behaviours (e.g. purchasing books, receiving books, ﬁnding
books, cleaning one’s bedroom or paying someone to clean one’s bedroom), they are not
indicators of speciﬁc behaviours themselves. Therefore, such behaviour traces are

interesting consequences of behaviour, but the assessment of behavioural traces is, again, a
step removed from behaviour.
As illustrated in Table 2, the nine types of behavioural data can be usefully differentiated
in several important ways. The ﬁrst is whether data reﬂect contextualized behaviour or
generalized behavioural tendencies. For some questions, researchers are interested in
behaviours within situational contexts. For example, Fleeson (2007) examined
conscientious behaviour within many situations encountered by participants across
several days. In contrast, some questions concern behaviours as they occur in general—
without regard to speciﬁc contexts. For example, Zentner and Renaud (2007) assessed
parental nurturing behaviour with questions such as ‘I express affection for my child, for
example, by holding and hugging my child’—without reference to speciﬁc situations or
contexts (p. 561). A second distinction lies between contextualized behavioural events that
are real versus hypothetical. Although researchers assess behaviours actually emitted by
participants, they sometimes ask participants to describe behaviours that would occur in
speciﬁc situations. A third distinction is the immediacy versus retrospectiveness in
assessment of real behavioural events. In some research, participants’ behaviour is assessed
as it occurs or within a very short period following its occurrence. Alternatively, behaviour
may be assessed after days or months—for example, Claeys, Timmers, and Phalet (1993)
asked participants to describe situations they had encountered over the past year and to
provide behavioural information for each. The ﬁnal distinction in Table 2 is the source of
behavioural information. Some research relies upon self-reports, but other work relies upon
information provided by other people—either independent observers or acquaintances
who know the participants and who may have witnessed relevant behavioural events.
The following discussion evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of each type of
behavioural data (see Table 3). The various forms of behavioural data are often used to
address different kinds of questions—for example, questions about contextualized
behavioural patterns across many speciﬁc situations, about general tendencies to engage in
maladaptive behaviours in ‘real life’, or about behaviour within speciﬁc situations of
conceptual interest. Therefore, each form of data can contribute to the ﬁeld’s general
understanding of personality, psychosocial processes and/or measurement. However, the
ﬁeld must recognize their limitations.
Although each type of data has weaknesses, some types of data are likely stronger than
others as indicators of participants’ actual behaviour. Thus, strong behavioural data are
psychometrically sound, with good reliability, good validity and minimal impact of
response biases such as memory bias and social desirability. As such, they are imperfect but
relatively accurate indicators of actual behaviour. This is essentially a matter of validity.
Behaviour can be seen as a latent variable that must be measured via some form of method
and instrument, and researchers do not capture ‘actual’ behaviour in a study any more than
they capture ‘actual’ intelligence or ‘actual’ personality—all behavioural data are
imperfect indicators of actual behaviour. Thus, when a participant’s behavioural data point
is a close approximation to what the person has actually done, it is a strong and valid
indicator of that behaviour.
I suggest that the ﬁrst three types of data to be discussed—direct behavioural
observation, experience sampling of behaviour and acquaintances’ reports of recent
behaviour—are the strongest methods of assessing a wide range of behaviour. Although
direct behavioural observation may be the strongest method of objectively assessing actual
behaviour, the balances of their strengths and weaknesses suggest that, when appropriate
for the research question, all three methods produce data that can be interpreted conﬁdently

as reﬂecting participants’ actual behaviour. Again, the other methods have strengths and
important applications; however, their weaknesses may limit signiﬁcantly their ability to
reﬂect participants’ actual behaviour. Furthermore, I believe that many of the differential
strengths within the ‘strong’ set of methods and within the relatively ‘weak’ set are less
signiﬁcant than the differences between the sets. In particular, the quality of behavioural
data derived from self-reports (e.g. experience sampling measurement of behaviour and
globally retrospective behavioural self-reports) does not clearly differ from the quality of
acquaintance-based behavioural data (e.g. acquaintance-reports of recent behaviour and
globally retrospective behavioural acquaintance-reports). As will be discussed, both
sources of information—self and acquaintance—have important strengths and weaknesses; furthermore, they provide non-redundant complementary information about
personality, behaviour and emotional experience (e.g. Fiedler, Oltmanns, & Turkheimer,
2004; Spain, Eaton, & Funder, 2000; Vazire & Mehl, 2008). The methods discussed below
reﬂect both self- and acquaintance-based sources of information, and both sources can
contribute strong behavioural data and relatively weaker behavioural data.
This discussion is important, because, to my knowledge, there has been no integrated
evaluation and comparison of the fundamental methods of measuring participants’ actual
behaviour. An integrated discussion of the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of each type
of behavioural data may enhance the ﬁeld’s ability to communicate about behaviour, its
appreciation of different forms of behavioural data, and ultimately, its production of highly
informative research.
Direct behavioural observations
In direct behavioural observation, independent observers supply systematic descriptions of
behaviours they have witnessed, usually in a controlled environment (Furr, Wagerman, &
Funder, in press). For such research, observers act as research staff to observe participants’
behaviour and to provide behavioural ratings. They are usually unacquainted with the

participants and often, actually ideally, operate independently. In addition, observation and
coding typically occurs while observers watch video-recordings of participants’ behaviour
(e.g. Asendorpf et al., 2002; Fast & Funder, 2008; Furr & Funder, 2004), while they listen
to participants’ verbal behaviour (Fast & Funder, 2008; Mehl, Vazire, Ramirez-Esparza,
Slatcher, & Pennebaker, 2007), or while they unobtrusively watch participants in real time
(e.g. Hart, Burock, London, Atkins, & Bonilla-Santiago, 2005). Direct behavioural
observation is likely the most demanding type of behavioural data, but it may provide the
strongest data for many purposes.
For example, as described earlier, Furr and Funder’s (2004) examination of crosssituational behavioural consistency used direct behavioural observation of participants in
six situations. Participants engaged in 5-minute videotaped dyadic interactions (e.g. an
unstructured conversational situation with an opposite-sex stranger, a competitive situation
with a same-sex acquaintance), and their behaviour was coded by observers who
independently watched videotapes and coded behaviour. To code behaviour, observers
used the Riverside Behavioral Q-sort (RBQ; Funder, Furr, & Colvin, 2000; Furr et al.,
in press), which is a multi-item instrument reﬂecting concrete behaviours (e.g. ‘smiles
frequently’, ‘is talkative’) and somewhat broader behavioural styles (e.g. ‘seems detached
from the interaction’, ‘exhibits an awkward interpersonal style’).1
Note that the sources of such data are diverse. Direct behavioural observations can be
derived, for example, from live observation of participants’ behaviour, video-recordings of
behaviour, and auditory recordings of behaviour. Indeed, technological advances have
broadened the type of information available for direct behavioural observation. For
example, participants in research conducted by Asendorpf and Meier (1993) carried
portable recorders for several days, recording the participants’ verbal behaviour during
their daily life. Recordings were then coded by the researchers to reﬂect each participant’s
frequency of speech versus non-speech. Similarly but more recently, Mehl and his
colleagues (Mehl & Pennebaker, 2003; Mehl, Pennebaker, Crow, Dabbs, & Price, 2001;
Mehl et al., 2007) have used the electronically activated recorder (EAR) to record verbal
behaviour and environmental sounds in participants’ daily lives. Their research reveals, for
example, that there is no gender difference in talkativeness (as measured by the number of
words recorded by the EAR) and that participants’ language use (as measure by the types of
words expressed in verbal behaviour as recorded by the EAR) was consistent across
contexts.
Strengths
As summarized in Table 3, there are important advantages to direct behavioural
observation. First, because this method is based on independent observations of a target
person’s behaviour, it avoids biases or inaccuracies arising from self-reported behaviour or
acquaintance-reported behaviour. Although both self-reported behaviour and acquaintance-reported behaviour may be quite valid, they can be affected by tendencies such as
self-enhancement or self-veriﬁcation or by expectations about a person’s behaviour based
upon previous experience. Thus, if one or more independent, unacquainted observers

The newly revised RBQ-3.0 now includes 67 items that are applicable to a wider range of social contexts than
previous versions of the RBQ (Furr et al., in press). Much of the items’ content and behavioural domains remain
the same as previous versions, but may items have been reworded, some have been dropped and some have been
added. In addition, the Riverside Accuracy Project has developed a ‘Q-sorter’ computer program that is available
for free download at http://rap.ucr.edu/qsorter, allowing Q-sorts (including the RBQ-3.0) to be completed and
recorded on a computer (details are available in Furr et al., in press).

describe a target person’s behaviour as friendly and charming, then we can have fairly
strong conﬁdence that the evaluation was not inﬂated by self-enhancement biases; we
might have less conﬁdence in an individual’s self-reported friendly and charming
behaviour, or in descriptions provided by spouses or parents. Potential biases are reduced
further if data are reliably aggregated across multiple independent observers, if those
observers share no biases. Second and similarly, direct behaviour observation avoids
potential errors arising when trying to recall behaviour across time. That is, behavioural
coding is usually done in a very immediate manner, almost always done during or
immediately after observing the behaviour itself.
Third, when behaviour is recorded in some way, coding options are ﬂexible and
powerful. For example, recorded stimuli—whether available on videotapes, DVDs or
through audio ﬁles (e.g. Mehl et al., 2001)—may be coded repeatedly using different
behavioural codes. That is, as new questions emerge, researchers can return to old (but still
useful) stimuli and re-code the behaviour to address those questions. For example, Furr and
Funder (2007) reported analyses of new data obtained from new observers of videotapes
that produced data used earlier by Furr and Funder (2004). Similarly, recorded stimuli can
be coded either globally or sequentially. In global coding, observers produce codes
representing an individual’s behaviour during an entire interaction—for example,
indicating a participant’s talkativeness or nervous behaviour across a 5-minute interaction
with a stranger. In contrast, observers doing sequential coding produce codes for discrete
segments of the interaction—for example, indicating a participant’s talkativeness or
nervousness during each 30-second segment of an interaction (Bakeman & Gottman,
1997). Sequential coding can provide insight into the unfolding of social interactions, but
its intensive nature essentially restricts it to observers who can pause and rewind behaviour.
Indeed, the potential ability to pause, rewind and study behavioural events repeatedly is an
important and unique strength of direct behavioural observation based on video-recorded
behaviours. When observers have the ability to review behaviours that are otherwise fast
and ﬂeeting, their ability to produce strong behavioural data is enhanced dramatically.
Fourth, when using direct behaviour observation, researchers can control, to some
degree, several important characteristics of the observers. Speciﬁcally, they can screen
potential observers to evaluate their motivation and ability, they can train observers
extensively, they can monitor observers over the course of a study, they can ensure
independence of observers when necessary and they can specify the precise number of
observers coding each participant. Such capabilities allow researchers to maximize the
quality of behavioural data and to tailor the research design to important speciﬁcations.
Fifth, researchers using direct behaviour observation may be able to manage
environmental conditions and create speciﬁc situations or situational themes. For
example, Asendorpf et al.’s (2002) behavioural examination of shyness required that
participants interact in ‘a shyness-inducing situation’, in which participants interacted with
an attractive stranger of the opposite sex who was ostensibly going to provide likeability
judgments of the participant. Thus, researchers can create highly speciﬁc situations and
hold those situations constant across participants.
Computer-generated ‘immersive virtual environments’ are a recent development with
potential relevance for direct behavioural coding. Such environments are deﬁned as states
in which individuals perceive themselves to be ‘enveloped by, included in, and interacting
with’ an environment that may include human-like agents (Blascovich, Loomis, Beall,
Swinth, Hoyt, & Bailenson, 2002, p. 105). Modern technology allows investigators to
administer the experience of stimuli with such speed and quality that, it has been argued, it

creates ‘a compelling sense of personal, social, and environmental presence for users . . ..
while allowing the investigator near-perfect control over the experimental environment and
actions within it’ (Blascovich et al., 2002, p. 106). Of particular relevance is the possibility
that researchers might create environments—social and nonsocial, common and novel—
that may be of great interest but that may be difﬁcult to create in the typical laboratory
environment. Of course, this potential beneﬁt comes with potential costs—some of the
weaknesses associated with direct behavioural observation (see below) are relevant and
perhaps signiﬁcantly pronounced for observation conducted within computer-generated
immersive virtual environments (e.g. artiﬁciality). Nevertheless, the technology raises
interesting possibilities for behavioural observation.
Weaknesses
Although direct behavioural observation has important strengths, it has several weaknesses
as well. First, as others have noted (Furr et al., in press; Gosling et al., 1998) it can be
demanding, in terms of time, effort and money. A common implementation of behavioural
coding will require: (a) Recruiting participants to engage in the behavioural tasks,
(b) planning and preparing the observational context and the recording strategy,
(c) purchase of recording equipment, (d) initial collection of raw behavioural recordings,
(e) preparation of the recorded behaviour (e.g. organizing, labelling and backing-up DVDs),
(f) recruitment and training of observers, (g) design or selection of a coding scheme (i.e.
precisely which behaviours will be coded and how), (h) organizing an assignment strategy
of target participants to observers, (i) collection of behavioural codings, (j) entry of coded
data and (k) a manager to coordinate tasks. Each of these elements can be signiﬁcantly
demanding it its own right, and many researchers may be forgiven for viewing their
combined effect as prohibitively difﬁcult or costly. Thus, the signiﬁcant demands of direct
behavioural observation may inhibit willingness to collect such data, and they may reduce
the amount of data collected when direct behavioural observations are conducted.
Limitations upon the amount of data may manifest itself in several ways—limiting the
number of behaviours being coded, limiting the number of observers contributing data, and
limiting the number of conditions under which participants are observed. Not only might
these limitations affect the psychometric quality of some direct observational data
(e.g. reliance on few observers may reduce reliability), but they may generate datasets
narrowly focused on a few speciﬁc behaviours and a few speciﬁc situations, rather than a
wide range of potentially important behaviours and contexts. Fortunately, several recent
sources guide researchers through the ins-and-outs of direct behavioural observation (Bakeman,
2000; Bakeman & Gottman, 1997; Cairns, 1979; Funder et al., 2000; Furr & Funder, 2007;
Furr et al., in press; Margolin et al., 1998; Thompson, Felce, & Symons, 2000),
Second, direct behavioural observation is usually limited to brief in-lab contexts (though
not always, e.g. Hart et al., 2005; Smith, Shoda, Cumming, & Smoll, in press). To make
participants’ behaviour available to independent observers or to recording devices and to
ensure participants’ informed consent, researchers typically invite participants into
laboratory settings that facilitate observation. This strategy, while having advantages
described above, comes with a potential cost common to all lab-based observational
work—questionable ecological validity. Some might wonder whether behaviours
exhibited in brief and often-artiﬁcial laboratory environments, based on tasks that may
be rather unusual, are representative of participants’ natural behavioural tendencies.
Third, when participants know that their behaviour is being observed and/or recorded,
unusual or intense self-presentational concerns might be activated. Although self-presentational
Copyright # 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DOI: 10.1002/per

<-----Page 14----->Personality and behaviour

383

concerns likely affect any social interaction, interactions observed and monitored by
psychologists may raise concerns or motivations that are particularly intense or that do
not emerge in normal interactions. Consequently, researchers may wonder whether
participants’ behaviour is fully representative of behaviour exhibited under more typical
motivational, affective and cognitive circumstances. Thus, although observers’ data might
accurately reﬂect the behaviour in the observational situation, the behaviour itself may be
somewhat unrepresentative of participants’ ‘normal’ behavioural tendencies. This may,
for instance, reduce correlations between self-reported personality traits (presumably
reﬂecting ‘normal’ cognitive, affective and behavioural tendencies) and behaviour
obtained from saliently observational contexts.
Fourth, although direct behavioural observation avoids some biases potentially
associated with behavioural self-reports or acquaintance-reports, they may be affected
by other biases or heuristics. For example, observers’ perceptions and interpretations of
behaviour might be affected by common stereotypes—for example, perceiving a male as
exhibiting assertive behaviour but perceiving a similarly-behaving woman as exhibiting
aggressive behaviour. Such biases may be less problematic for coding systems focusing on
relatively concrete behaviours requiring little psychological inference (e.g. corners of
the mouth lift upwards vs. exhibits a friendly smile, or speaks for 3.5 minutes vs. acts
assertively). However, they might be exacerbated if observers are not strongly interested in
the behavioural event. That is, depending upon the length and nature of the behavioural
event, observers’ interest and attention may wane, opening the door for biases that weaken
behavioural data. Fortunately, the use of multiple coders may mitigate such problems, as
long as the coders do not share biases.

Experience sampling reports of current behaviour
A second strong type of behavioural data is behavioural information obtained via
experience sampling methods (ESM; Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli, 2003; Conner, Barrett,
Tugade, & Tennen, 2007; Hektner, Schmidt, & Csikszentmihalyi, 2007). There are many
forms of ESM research, including beeper studies, daily diary studies, web-based diary
studies and social interaction diary studies (Fournier et al., 2008; Gosling et al., 1998; Wu
& Clark, 2003).
However, the strongest form of ESM study may be the ‘palm pilot’ study, which has
increased as hand-held computer technology has advanced. In a typical behavioural palmpilot ESM study, participants carry hand-held computers for several days, sometimes for
2 weeks or more. Several times each day, the computer signals participants to describe their
behaviours at that moment or within a period immediately preceding the signal. This
produces data reﬂecting the ebb and ﬂow of behaviour across an ostensibly representative
set of situations in participant’s real lives (e.g. Fleeson, 2001; Fleeson, 2007).
For example, Fleeson (2007) conducted a behavioural ESM study examining the
predictability of cross-situational behavioural contingencies. Participants carried handheld computers for several days and were signalled multiple times per day. Each time, they
responded to questions about their experience within the past 30 minutes, including nine
questions reﬂecting three behavioural domains (e.g. ‘During the last half hour, how
hardworking have you been?’). Results revealed, for example, that conscientious behaviour
was generally associated with perceived task orientation—when a person perceived a
situation as being task-oriented, he or she enacted a high level of conscientious behaviour.

Strengths
First, ESM data provide a fairly clear window onto participants’ behaviour and experiences
in everyday life (Conner et al., 2007; Scollon, Kim-Prieto, & Diener, 2003). By asking
participants to report their current or very recent behaviour at multiple times across
multiple days, researchers obtain a rich perspective upon the tendencies, variabilities and
contingencies characterizing each participant’s ‘real life’ behaviour. Furthermore,
participants often provide information about environments in which their behaviour
occurs. Along with providing insight into participants’ environments in their own right,
these data also facilitate the study of situation-behaviour contingencies or conditionalities
(Conner et al., 2007; Scollon et al., 2003). That is, such data allow researchers to examine,
on a person-by-person basis, the nature and degree of association between speciﬁc
environmental factors and speciﬁc behaviours. Some important contemporary perspectives
in personality psychology are well informed by such data (Furr, in press).
Second, ESM procedures can generate a large amount of behavioural data from each
participant. By asking participants to report behaviour at multiple points across multiple
days, researchers obtain extensive information about speciﬁc behaviours and situational
factors, or more generally, about processes and patterns of psychological responses within
each participant (Bolger et al., 2003; Conner et al., 2007; Scollon et al., 2003). This allows
researchers to examine important behavioural questions with a level of statistical precision
and power that may not be possible through other strong types of behavioural data.
Third, because ESM-based behavioural reports are usually provided during,
immediately after, or shortly after behavioural events, they reduce retrospective biases
likely affecting other forms of behavioural data (Bolger et al., 2003; Conner et al., 2007;
Scollon et al., 2003). Of course, the further removed a report is from the behavioural event
itself, the more susceptible it is to retrospective biases.
Fourth, the technology often used in ESM studies offers important practical beneﬁts. For
example, many computerized forms of ESM record the time at which a report was
completed, allowing researchers to identify reports occurring long after their intended
reporting occasion. Thus, researchers can detect and eliminate reports potentially suffering
from retrospective biases. In addition, data collected with hand-held computers can be
downloaded directly into secured databases, thereby enhancing security and reducing
problems arising from human data entry.

Weaknesses
First, researchers may be concerned about biases potentially affecting self-reports of
behaviour (Conner et al., 2007; Gosling et al., 1998; Scollon et al., 2003). Although ESM
data reduce retrospective biases, other biases can affect participants’ reports of their
behaviour. Whether arising though motivational factors, cognitive factors or factors
reﬂecting one’s unique perspective of one’s own behaviour, a variety of biases can shade
participants’ behavioural reports. Thus, the accuracy of ESM behavioural data depends
upon participants’ ability and motivation to provide valid behavioural reports. Researchers
should consider carefully the potential effect of stable individual differences in particular
response biases upon participants’ behavioural reports across multiple assessments. For
example, stable individual differences in a tendency to self-enhance might inﬂate some
participants’ reports of a generally desirable behaviour such as ‘acting friendly’ across
reporting occasions. This bias could create differences among participants’ mean levels of
reported-friendliness across occasions. However, it would not create differences among
Copyright # 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Eur. J. Pers. 23: 369–401 (2009)
DOI: 10.1002/per

<-----Page 16----->Personality and behaviour

385

participants’ patterns of responses across occasions or the within-person associations
between friendliness and a speciﬁc environmental variable (unless self-enhancement
manifested itself systematically in speciﬁc kinds of occasions but not others). In contrast,
stable individual differences in an extremity response bias might affect differences among
participants’ patterns of responses—creating more dramatic variability in some
participants’ patterns than in others’.
A second potential weakness is that the repetitive and frequent assessments required in
ESM research may affect participants’ responsiveness and reactivity (Bolger et al., 2003;
Conner et al., 2007; Scollon et al., 2003; Wheeler & Reis, 1991). Many ESM studies,
particularly those requiring multiple responses per day, demand hundreds of responses
across days and weeks. Although participants typically learn the process and importance of
the research, their responsiveness may wane during the study. Consequently, fatigue, loss
of interest and even irritation may affect participants feeling burdened by the relatively
invasive and long-lasting demands of ESM research. Eventually, such feelings may
decrease response accuracy in some participants and may increase attrition. In addition, the
relatively intensive nature of ESM research enhances concern about participant reactivity,
raising the possibility that ‘the self-reporting of experience changes the very experience
being measured’ (Conner et al., 2007, p. 90). For example, participants may be asked
repeatedly about the friendliness of their behaviour and about environments they
experience, and repeated reﬂection may lead them to change their behaviour or to seek
speciﬁc environments. In sum, one of the key strengths of an ESM approach—the intensive
study of participants’ behaviours in real life—is related to potential problems with fatigue,
attrition and reactivity.
A third potential limitation of ESM-based daily life behavioural research is that
researchers typically do not control environments that participants encounter. On one hand,
this is a potential strength providing insight into the environments that different kinds of
people naturally encounter, which may reveal important facets of personality. On the other
hand, the lack of situational control is a potential weakness. The fact that participants likely
encounter different situations, combined with the fact that behaviour is affected by
situational stimuli, produces thorny complexities. For example, differences in participants’
behavioural reports may arise from differences in the situations they encounter rather than
differences in stable personality characteristics. Whether such non-constancy of situational
stimuli across people should be considered a source of measurement error (e.g. in
comparing average levels of behaviour across people) may depend upon one’s theoretical
inclinations. In addition, non-constancy of situations across people reduces or eliminates
researchers’ ability to account for normativeness in analyses of individuals’ behavioural
proﬁles (Furr, in press, 2008; Shoda et al., 1994). Although a full description of behavioural normativeness is beyond the scope of the current paper, researchers studying
behavioural proﬁles are encouraged to consider the potential importance of accounting for
the degree to which each person’s behavioural proﬁle reﬂects the average behavioural
proﬁle (Furr, in press). Unfortunately, this cannot be done easily if participants’ behaviour
proﬁles reﬂect different situations.
One ﬁnal potential limitation of most ESM behavioural data is that limited information is
collected at any single assessment occasion (Bolger et al., 2003). To reduce the
intrusiveness and burden of the procedures, researchers usually present a relatively small
set of questions at each measurement occasion. Because each construct should be assessed
with multiple items in order to enhance reliability and content validity, relatively few
constructs can be assessed via the typical ESM procedure.

Acquaintance-reports of recent behaviour
By relying on participants’ acquaintances or interaction partners to report recent behaviour
that they have witnessed, researchers can obtain a third strong type of behavioural data. For
example, Mischel and his colleagues (e.g. Ayduk et al., 2007; Shoda et al., 1994; Wright &
Mischel, 1987) recruited counsellors to provide behavioural reports of adolescents at
summer camp. Counsellors and campers interacted in various activities, and, at the end of
each activity period, counsellors rated campers’ behaviours in several domains (e.g. ‘was
verbally aggressive. . .’, ‘was untalkative. . .’). Thus, the counsellors’ ratings reﬂected
behaviour very recently expressed by the campers.
This form of behavioural data differs from direct behavioural observation in an
important way. Acquaintance-reports of recent behaviour (ARRB) are provided by people
who have been involved with the participants and perhaps who were even involved in the
behavioural interactions. In contrast, direct behavioural observations are provided by
independent observers who do not know the participants and who were not directly
involved in the interaction.
Strengths
Generally speaking, ARRB shares several strengths with ESM. First, ARRB facilitates
observation in natural contexts, providing information about participants’ behaviour in
‘real life’ environments. Consequently, researchers obtain information that is quite
representative of participants’ behaviour in naturally occurring situations, including
situations that might not be easily replicable in a laboratory context. Second, ARRB data is
temporally close to the behavioural event. If acquaintances report on recent behaviour, then
the reports may avoid signiﬁcant retrospective biases potentially affecting weaker forms of
behavioural data. Third, ARRB data can produce many behavioural occasions for each
participant—if acquaintances agree to provide behavioural reports over a series of
interactions, then researchers can obtain in-depth information about each participant’s
behavioural trends across time and, perhaps, situations. For example, Shoda et al.’s (1994)
camp-based behavioural data included multiple situations in which each participant was
observed on multiple occasions. This depth of information allowed the researchers to
examine cross-situational behavioural proﬁles with psychometric conﬁdence.
Finally, like direct behavioural observation, ARRB avoids reliance on participants’ selfreports. As described earlier, self-reported behaviour may be susceptible to various biases;
because ARRB does not rely on self-reports, such biases are reduced.
Weaknesses
Although ARRB data may avoid potential biases associated with self-ratings of behaviour,
it may be susceptible to inaccuracies emerging from acquaintances’ or interactants’
perspectives. Acquaintances such as friends, parents, roommates, spouses, counsellors and
coworkers may provide ratings affected by prior experience with target participants,
expectancies about participants’ behavioural tendencies, and various motivational
inﬂuences on perception and interpretation of behaviour (e.g. social desirability, selfprotection, etc.). For example, based on previous encounters, a counsellor may view a
camper as generally temperamental. This impression could then colour the counsellor’s
interpretation of the camper’s behaviour in various situations, perhaps increasing the
likelihood that the counsellor describes the camper’s behaviour as more aggressive than it
merits. Even when relying upon interactants not previously acquainted with a participant,
Copyright # 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DOI: 10.1002/per

<-----Page 18----->Personality and behaviour

387

researchers should consider potential inaccuracies. For example, previously unacquainted
pairs might be asked to interact for 10 minute and then rate behaviour exhibited by their
interaction partner. Such ratings are not affected by previous experiences with the partner,
but they may be affected by other motivational or attentional biases (e.g. self-presentational
concerns may direct attention away from the partner’s behaviour, producing inaccurate
ratings).
A second potential difﬁculty with ARRB data is that, as with ESM, limited behavioural
information can be collected at any single occasion. Particularly if researchers examine
participants in naturalistic contexts, they may avoid demanding that acquaintances
complete an extensive set of ratings.
ARRB data share at least two weaknesses with direct behavioural observations. One is
that acquaintances and/or interactants need to be recruited and need training on the
observational process. Like direct behavioural coding, ARRB requires that additional
people—beyond the participants themselves—be recruited and compensated, and it
hinges on their continued involvement. In addition, reliance on others to provide
behavioural data requires that those others understand the observational process as
accurately as possible. Although this may be accomplished without great expense, it does
add time, people and potential difﬁculty to the research design. A second weakness shared
with direct behavioural observation is participant reactivity to being observed. As
described earlier, awareness of being observed may create unusual or intense selfpresentational concerns that could generate behaviours unlike those expressed under more
normal circumstances.
In sum, direct behavioural observations, experience sampling reports of current or recent
behaviour and acquaintance- (or interactant-) reports of recent behaviour are relatively
strong forms of behavioural data. Although no data perfectly reﬂect ‘actual behaviour’,
these methods provide relatively good approximations of participants’ actual behaviour in
speciﬁc contexts. Indeed, the accurate understanding of connections between personality
and behaviour (see Table 1) requires strong behavioural data—by having relatively clear
insight into what people actually do, we can more fully understand the factors truly
affecting important behaviours, the true role of behaviour in psychosocial processes, the
true behavioural implications of new constructs and measures and the true nature of
important phenomena such as behavioural consistency. The ﬁrst three forms of behavioural
data are crucial for achieving such understanding. Next, ﬁve additional forms of
behavioural data are brieﬂy reviewed. These methods provide information relevant to some
important questions, and they are generally less difﬁcult and less expensive to collect than
those previously reviewed. However, beneﬁts of ease and convenience may come at the
expense of relatively lower strength as reﬂections of participants’ actual behaviour.
Hypothetical behavioural self-reports
One convenient method of gauging behaviour across a variety of situations is to ask
participants to describe their likely behaviour in speciﬁc contexts (e.g. Hirschberger,
Florian, Mikulincer, Goldenberg, & Pyszczynski, 2002; Magnusson & Ekehammar, 1978;
Perkins & Corr, 2006). For example, in an interesting examination of attachment style,
participants described ‘what they would say or do’ in response to several negative
relationship events (Collins, 1996, p. 815). In this research, participants’ open-ended
descriptions were coded by trained coders rating their punitiveness and likelihood of
producing conﬂict. Similarly, in a recent study of behavioural inhibition and approach,

participants read descriptions of scenarios likely to induce anger, and they were asked to
‘imagine themselves in each scenario, and then rate how they would be likely to react in
that situation’, including ratings of ‘their actual behavioural and cognitive responses’
(Cooper, Gomez, & Buck, 2008, p. 407).
Strengths
Self-reported hypothetical behaviour has several appealing qualities. First and most
practically, such data are inexpensive and easy to collect—there is no need for special
technology, there is usually no need for additional people to observe and code behaviour,
there is no need to spend months or years coding video-recordings and there is no need for
specially prepared lab space. For researchers without large budgets, without access to many
students or assistants and without a wide time frame, such methods are appealing.
Second and more conceptually, self-reported hypothetical behaviour may offer insights
into behaviours in unusual or rare situations. For example, in the previously described
study of behavioural inhibition and approach, participants indicated their likely behaviour
across more than 20 situations potentially inducing anger (Cooper et al., 2008). The
situations probably would not be reﬂected heavily in studies relying on methods such as
direct behavioural observation and ESM. The demands of observing participants in
23 different situations in a direct behavioural observation study may be prohibitive, and
most participants in an ESM or ARRB study are unlikely to experience many, if any, of the
anger-inducing situations during the relatively brief course of such studies.
Third and relatedly, researchers studying self-reported hypothetical behaviour can exert
relatively great ‘control’ over the situations to which participants respond. They can control
the number of situations, and they can create descriptions reﬂecting the precise nature of
situations in a way that matches their goals. Moreover, by exposing all participants to the
same situations, researchers can maximize situational constancy, which has potential
beneﬁts as described earlier.
Fourth, the use of self-reported behaviour in hypothetical situations allows researchers to
‘observe’ participants in many situations and/or to ‘observe’ many behaviours. As
described above (see the ‘ESM’ section), the ability to obtain behavioural information
across many situations provides a level of precision that may not be possible through other
strong methods of obtaining behavioural data, and it allows researchers to examine
important ‘within-person’ questions such as situation–behaviour contingencies. Similarly,
the ability to capture many behaviours facilitates the wide-ranging examination of
behaviour, with a variety of conceptual and psychometric advantages.
Weaknesses
There are several crucial problems with hypothetical behavioural self-reports. First, as
outlined for ESM data, reliance on self-reported behaviour is potentially problematic—a
variety of potential biases may affect participants’ responses. This problem likely interacts
with the second problem, which is the potentially questionable ability of participants to
know how they would truly respond in speciﬁc situations, particularly situations they might
have never encountered. Participants may not be able to anticipate all relevant stimuli in the
supposed situations. In most research with hypothetical scenarios, the scenarios provide
limited detail (e.g. ‘how would you respond if someone cut in front of you in line at the
movies?’). Obviously, one’s actual behaviour depends upon a many factors, few of which
are speciﬁed in the scenarios presented to participants. Even if participants were aware of
all relevant stimuli, they still may not be able to predict their responses—how they would

389

actually feel, think and ultimately behave when faced with real situational stimuli. In sum,
researchers may reasonably worry about the degree to which hypothetical behavioural selfreports reﬂect actual behaviour.
A third problem is ambiguity in the interpretation of these data. In such studies—and
often within a given study—the data are variously described as reﬂecting behaviour,
behavioural intentions or willingness to behave (or other similar terms). These differences,
though perhaps subtle, are conceptually important—‘behaviour’ is not the same thing as
‘behavioural intentions’. Authors should be encouraged to label their data (e.g. as
behaviour or behavioural intentions) in a way that most accurately reﬂects the message that
they wish to convey. Furthermore, they should maintain that label or a label with highly
similar meaning throughout a paper.

Contextually retrospective or globally retrospective behavioural self-reports
Two additional types of behavioural data are participants’ self-report of past behaviour or
of general behavioural tendencies. In studies using these methods, participants are often
asked to rate behaviour as it occurred in speciﬁc contexts they have actually encountered,
or they are asked to rate behaviour as it generally occurs (e.g. Claeys et al., 1993; Dekeyser,
Raes, Leijssen, Leysen, & Dewulf, 2008; Lönnqvist, Leikas, Paunonen, Nissinen, &
Verkasalo, 2006; Paunonen, Haddock, Forsterling, & Keinonen, 2003; Westmaas, Moeller,
& Woicik, 2007). Although the distinction between contextually retrospective and
generalized behavioural reports has potentially important implications, it is not always
clear—thus, the two types of data will be discussed together.
For example, in an examination of cross-situational behavioural variability, participants
were asked to consider several situations they had experienced during the past year, to write
descriptions of each and to rate the degree they expressed four behavioural domains in each
(Claeys et al., 1993). Reﬂecting a more generalized approach, participants in a recent study
completed several self-report trait measures along with a self-report survey of behaviour
(Hong, Paunonen, & Slade, 2008). Intended to assess ‘complex behaviours of some social
signiﬁcance’, the behavioural survey included ‘overt behaviors such as grade point
average, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, participation in organized sports, and number
of parties attended per month’ (Hong et al., 2008, p. 162).
Strengths
Retrospective self-reports of behaviour share some advantages of self-reported
hypothetical behaviour. First, it is easier, cheaper and faster than some other ways of
assessing behaviour. Second, it allows researchers to inquire about behaviours and
situations that occur rarely in daily life or that may be difﬁcult to capture in a laboratory.
For example, Westmaas et al. (2007) examined personality correlates of behaviours related
to alcohol intoxication, including drunk driving, publicly exposing one’s body, giving
alcohol to one’s pets and having sexual contact with a stranger. Such behaviours are indeed
potentially important, but are either impossible or unethical to examine in a laboratory or
are unlikely to occur frequently during a time-limited ESM study. Third, for studies using
contextualized behavioural reports, the number and nature of situations can be controlled
to some degree. Fourth, given its relative ease and affordability, it allows researchers to
capture many behaviours and/or many situations for each participant.

A ﬁfth advantage of this type of data, as compared to self-reported hypothetical
behaviour, is that it may be based upon more accurate self-knowledge. Ostensibly based
upon behaviours actually expressed by participants, it may avoid pitfalls affecting
participants’ attempts to predict their behaviour in hypothetical situations that they may
have never encountered.
Weaknesses
Paralleling its shared advantages with self-reported hypothetical behaviour, retrospective
self-reported behaviour shares an important disadvantage. First and speciﬁcally, because it
relies upon self-reports, it potentially suffers from biases that may affect behavioural selfreports.
Second and relatedly, the retrospective or global nature of these methods may exacerbate
potential biases associated with self-report. Because they are based upon participants’
recollections of temporally distal behavioural events or upon their judgments of their
generalized behavioural tendencies, the ratings are based upon relatively abstract cognitive
phenomena as compared to the immediate behavioural self-reports obtained via ESM. As
such, their validity may be more seriously compromised by motivational and cognitive
response biases, along with simple inaccuracies in recollection.
Third, these methods can blur distinctions between behavioural data and self-reported
dispositions. That is, researchers may worry that retrospective behavioural self-report is
simply a slight variation on other kinds of trait-level or dispositional reports. As others have
noted (e.g. Cervone, Shadel, & Jencius, 2001) many personality inventories include items
referring to behaviour (along with items referring to other psychological and physiological
responses). In addition, some ‘behavioural’ self-reports include content that may not truly
reﬂect behaviour. For example, the behavioural report used by Paunonen et al. (2003)
includes ratings of important attributes such as attractiveness, popularity, honesty and
intelligence, and it includes items referring to grade point average and obesity. As
Paunonen et al. acknowledge, such items do not reﬂect behaviour, strictly deﬁned. The
inclusion of such items, though they reﬂect important phenomena, somewhat obscures the
distinction between ‘behavioural criteria’, ‘consequences of behaviour’ and ‘personality
attributes’. For researchers wishing to focus directly on behaviour, this is a signiﬁcant
problem.
Contextually retrospective or globally retrospective behavioural
acquaintance-reports
The ﬁnal methods to be discussed are contextually retrospective or globally retrospective
reports of behaviour provided by knowledgeable acquaintances (e.g. Lönnqvist et al.,
2006; Manders, Scholte, Janssens, & De Bruyn, 2006; Pursell, Laursen, Rubin, BoothLaForce, & Rose-Krasnor, 2008). Perhaps used most often with younger participants, these
methods rely on informants such as parents, teachers or peers to provide behavioural
information about target participants. For example, in a recent examination of personality,
prosocial behaviour and externalizing behaviour problems among adolescents, behavioural
data were obtained both from peer and self nominations and from maternal ratings (Pursell
et al., 2008). Prosocial behaviour was assessed by asking students to nominate six
classmates—potentially including themselves—who exhibited various prosocial
tendencies (e.g. ‘someone who helps others, someone who plays fair, someone who is
polite’). In addition, externalizing behaviours (or externalizing ‘problems’ as they were
Copyright # 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

391

also described, e.g. ﬁghting, stealing) were assessed through the aggression and
delinquency scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991a,b) as completed by
participants and mothers. Investigators concluded that ‘personality and prosocial behavior
are distinct predictors of externalizing problems for boys and overlapping predictors of
externalizing problems for girls’ (p. 479).
Strengths
Retrospective acquaintance-reports of behaviour share some advantages with retrospective
self-reported behaviour. Speciﬁcally, they may capture rare behaviours or behaviours in
unusual situations, and they allow some control over the nature and number of situations to
which participants respond (in terms of retrospective reports of behaviour in speciﬁc
situation). In addition, acquaintance-reports of behaviour avoid reliance on self-reports of
behaviour, limiting potential biases associated with such data.
Finally, retrospective acquaintance-reports of behaviour may provide important external
perspectives on behaviour—perspectives that may be particularly important for some
kinds of participants. For example, researchers studying children’s behaviour may rely on
parents or teachers to report the children’s maladaptive behavioural tendencies (e.g.
Caprara, Barbaranelli, Pastorelli, & Cervone, 2004). Such information may otherwise be
difﬁcult to collect with young participants.
Weaknesses
Although self-report biases are avoided, acquaintances (e.g. parents, teachers) may have
other biases creating inaccuracies in behavioural reports. In addition, the retrospective or
global nature of these data requires respondents to rely on potentially inaccurate memory
of participants’ behaviour, magnifying the impact of cognitive and motivational biases
possibly affecting acquaintance-reports of behaviour. Finally, the retrospective nature of
these data, and particularly the generalized form, may blur the distinction between
acquaintance-reports of participants’ personality dispositions and acquaintance-reports of
behaviour. For example, if a teacher rates a child as being aggressive, we might wonder
whether the rating reﬂects an aggregation of aggressive behavioural instances or the
teachers’ judgment of the child’s dispositional tendency—or both. Again, this should be a
signiﬁcant concern for researchers wishing to focus directly on behaviour.

HOW AND HOW OFTEN IS BEHAVIOUR ACTUALLY STUDIED IN
PERSONALITY PSYCHOLOGY?
Recently, researchers have argued that the ﬁeld has demonstrated meager commitment to
the study of behaviour (Baumeister et al., 2007); however, there appear to be only two
studies supporting these arguments. Baumeister and his colleagues examined trends in
behaviourally oriented research in personality and social psychology, concluding that ‘the
study of behavior has been in a steady decline since the early 1980s’ (p. 399). Their
analysis indicates that less than 20% of the studies published in the Journal of Personality
and Social Psychology in 2006 included ‘any direct observation of behavior’ (p. 398)—in
terms of either the dependent variable or as a vehicle for manipulating an independent
variable. Somewhat similarly, Robins et al. (2007) queried editorial boards of three
personality journals, asking members to rate the frequency with which they used various

assessment strategies. Of 17 assessment strategies, ‘behavioural observation’ and
‘behavioural responses’ were generally rated as being used slightly less than ‘somewhat’
frequently, with experience sampling being used even less frequently.
These analyses are revealing, but important questions remain unanswered. The analysis
by Baumeister et al. included research from both personality and social psychology, and
the analysis by Robins et al. rely on self-reported frequencies rather than examination of
actual publication trends. In addition, the previous analyses were not intended to
differentiate ﬁnely among types of behavioural data. Thus, the current paper will explore
actual publication trends in personality psychology, with special emphasis on the
fundamental types of data used to measure behaviour. This will provide insight into
the frequency with which behaviour is examined in personality psychology and into the
frequency with which speciﬁc types of behavioural data are used. The latter issue is
particularly important because it will reveal the degree to which the ﬁeld relies upon strong
measures of immediate or recent behaviour versus retrospective or hypothetical methods of
assessing behaviour.
Two leading personality journals were examined—the Journal of Personality (JP) and
the Personality Processes and Individual Differences section of Journal of Personality and
Social Psychology (JPSP). Volumes from 2007, 2002 and 1997 were examined to reveal
potential trends in the use of behavioural data across the past 10 to 15 years. For each year,
all issues of JP and the odd-numbered issues of JPSP were examined. As shown in Table 4,
the sample included more than 350 quantitative studies in more than 170 papers presenting
original research (i.e. not including conceptual papers, meta-analyses and case studies).

Coding was conducted for each paper and each study. First, to evaluate the degree to
which researchers claim to investigate behaviour, the title and abstract or each paper
were examined to identify those in which the study of behaviour was explicitly claimed
or heavily implied. If an paper’s title or abstract explicitly suggested that it included
the study of behaviour, it was coded as ‘claiming or implying the study of behaviour’.
In contrast, if an paper’s title or abstract referenced only constructs that were either
clearly non-behavioural (e.g. self-concept) or that could be interpreted in many nonbehavioural ways (e.g. decision-making, creativity), then it was coded as ‘not claiming or
implying the study of behaviour’. Similarly, each study’s conceptual presentation of its
variables was examined to identify studies in which one or more variables were described
as behavioural—this produced, at the level of individual studies, information regarding
the degree to which researchers claim to study behaviour. Second, coding was conducted
to evaluate the degree to which researchers actually engage in behavioural measurement
and to evaluate the degree to which researchers employ the various behavioural
measurement strategies outlined above. Thus, the methods of each study were examined
to identify those in which the measurement strategy for any variable matched one of the
nine types of behavioural data outlined in Table 2 or could be considered a narrowly
focused ‘behavioural test’ of some kind. If a behavioural measurement strategy was
included in a study, then the study was coded as ‘includes some form of behavioural data’
and the type of data was coded (see Table 4). As shown in Table 4, this information is
presented at the level of individual studies, and it was aggregated to the level of separate
papers.
Results reveal that the study of behaviour was relatively uncommon. In terms of the
general study of behaviour, approximately only 17% of the papers claimed or implied that
behaviour would be studied, and approximately 19% of the studies claimed to include one
or more behavioural variable. There appears to be no dramatic change in these values
across time. Somewhat more encouraging, according to the methods outlined in the current
paper, approximately 30% of the papers (22% of the studies) included one or more forms of
behavioural data. Again, data reveal no clear systematic trend in these values, although
there may be some trend toward fewer studies including behavioural data since 1997. This
may reﬂect a trend toward an increasing number of studies per paper (from about 1.8 in
1997 to 2.2 in 2007).
Importantly, papers claiming to study behaviour generally did so—the vast majority of
ostensibly ‘behavioural’ papers included one or more of the methods in Table 4. In fact,
some papers included data that could be considered behavioural, even though the data were
not explicitly framed as ‘behavioural’. For example, Holtgraves (1997, Study 3) conducted
a study ‘to assess how directly [participants] would phrase their remarks in various
settings’, and participants had to ‘choose which of several remarks (varying in directness)
they would be most likely to use in different situations’ (p. 629). According to Table 2, this
qualiﬁes as hypothetical behavioural self-reports.
Although most papers claiming to examine behaviour did in fact include behavioural
data, a small number did not. Those four papers were interesting and valuable contributions
in their own right, but their status as being ‘behavioural’ was clouded by relying upon
questionnaires (either self-report or informant-report) that included a few behavioural
items along with items referring to cognitive, affective, or other responses. Such data
reﬂect a blend of important psychological phenomena, rather than focusing sharply on
behaviour itself.

Results also revealed that, when behaviour was studied, relatively weak behavioural data
were often employed.2 As shown in Table 4, globally retrospective behavioural reports
(obtained either from the self or acquaintances) were used most frequently, followed by
narrowly forced behavioural tests of various kinds. Somewhat surprisingly, direct
behavioural observation was the next most frequently used form of behavioural data
(though it was used in only 5% of all papers), followed by contextually retrospective
behavioural self-reports and hypothetical behavioural self-reports. Note that, although
experience sampling has gained popularity over the years, it is not often used to assess
behaviour—more often reﬂecting phenomena such as emotion or cognition. Finally, the
current sample of studies, though large, included almost no examples of ARRB,
contextually retrospective behavioural acquaintance-reports or (not surprisingly)
hypothetical behavioural acquaintance reports. Although not reﬂected in Table 4, analysis
revealed that direct behavioural observation was used almost exclusively in single-study
papers. Of nine papers reporting direct behavioural observation, eight included only one
study, and the ninth included two studies. No robust temporal trends appear in Table 4;
however, results may indicate a recent increase in direct behavioural observation and a
steady decrease in globally retrospective behavioural self-reports.
In sum, these results provide important insight into the general use of behavioural data
and into the use of speciﬁc types of behavioural data. These analyses, along with those
reported by Baumeister et al. (2007) suggest that approximately 16–24% of the studies
published between 1996 and 2007 included behavioural data. Furthermore, the current
study revealed that globally retrospective reports of behaviour are the most common type
of behavioural data.3 These forms of behavioural data are important for answering certain
types of questions—indeed, the current ﬁndings may indicate that personality
psychologists are more interested in generalized behavioural tendencies than in
contextualized behaviour, though this may be changing. However, as discussed earlier,
these forms of data can suffer from potentially important limitations raising concerns about
their strength as indictors of actual behaviour (see Table 3).

IMPLICATIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS
For an ostensibly behavioural science, personality psychology has been accused of rarely
examining behaviour. More fundamentally, personality psychologists may not even agree
on what behaviour is, what qualiﬁes as behavioural data or what differentiates strong
behavioural data from weaker data. The current paper examines the actual study of
behaviour and the use of behavioural data in personality research, and it argues for greater
attention to behaviour and for increased use of strong, wide-ranging behavioural data.
Conceptual and methodological implications
By addressing these problems, the current paper is intended to initiate conversation that
will ultimately improve the ﬁeld both conceptually and methodologically. Readers are

Note that some paper/studies included more than one type of behavioural data.
Unlike the current study, the study by Baumeister et al. did not count ‘self-reports of past behaviour or of
hypothetical behaviours’ in their deﬁnition of behavioural data (p. 399). However, they did count a study as
behavioural if it included ‘any manipulation’ or if it ‘used behaviour as the conduit for manipulating the
independent variable’, whereas the current study’s focus on the types of behavioural measurement excluded
behavioural manipulations from the coding process (p. 399).

invited to evaluate this discussion—for example, is the proposed deﬁnition of behaviour
sufﬁciently (or overly) inclusive, is the list of core forms of behavioural data appropriately
inclusive, does it reﬂect accurately the strengths and weaknesses of each and is it
appropriate in its overall evaluation of one or more types of data? The discussion is
intended to motivate serious conversation with important conceptual and methodological
implications for personality psychology.
By deﬁning behaviour as verbal utterances (excluding verbal reports in psychological
assessment contexts) or movements that are potentially available to careful observers
using normal sensory processes, the paper begins to articulate what should be considered a
behaviour and what should not. This is an important conceptual issue in its own right, and it
has implications for the methods that should be viewed as producing truly ‘behavioural’
data. Furthermore, the current paper argues that behaviour is fundamental to personality
psychology in several key respects—as a core phenomenon to be explained, as the
foundation of important phenomena, as revealing the importance and nature of personality
constructs and measures and as an important mechanism within psychosocial processes.
Although other psychological responses may be important for similar reasons (e.g. affect is
an important phenomenon to be explained and can be a key part of psychosocial processes),
the lack of strong behavioural research suggests that the importance of behaviour may be
under-appreciated.
The current paper also articulated and evaluated core methods of measuring behaviour.
Many of us may have considered some advantages and disadvantages of some forms of
behavioural data, but there has been no comprehensive conversation and integration of
these issues. A review of the strengths and weaknesses of the core methods of obtaining
wide-ranging behavioural data leads me to believe that three methods are particularly
strong as ways of reﬂecting participants’ actual behaviour. Speciﬁcally, direct behavioural
observation, experience sampling of behaviour and acquaintances’ reports of recent
behaviour are strong ways to reﬂect participants’ contextualized behaviour. To be sure,
these methods have limitations and other methods have roles and strengths; however, these
three methods likely offer the greatest insight into real behaviour of real people.
Note that the methods summarized in the current paper can be used to measure
behaviour at a broad range of speciﬁcity versus generality. Indeed, according to the
discussion above, behaviour can be perceived and measured at very speciﬁc or micro levels
(e.g. subtle facial movements, Ekman, Friesen, & Hager, 2002) and at very general or
macro levels (e.g. managerial-autocratic behavioural style, Alden & Phillips, 1990). Such
differences have important links to the nature of one’s research questions and hypotheses,
but data from all levels qualify as behavioural data, within speciﬁc limits. On one end of the
continuum, behaviour is potentially available to careful observers using normal sensory
processes, according to the deﬁnition above. This places a lower limit on the potential
subtleness or speciﬁcity of micro-level codings. On the other end of the continuum,
behaviour is verbal utterances or movements, which allows for broad behavioural styles
but which excludes trait judgments. That is, behavioural coding can be done at a fairly
general or macro level (e.g. ‘behaved in a friendly manner’) but once the codings/ratings
are made in reference to more stable, general dispositional qualities (e.g. ‘is a friendly
person’) they no longer qualify as behaviour according to the present perspective.
Finally, the current paper provided empirical support for assertions that behaviour is
under-studied in personality psychology and that, when it is studied, it is studied via
relatively weak methods. Of more than 350 studies in 173 papert, only 22% included
behavioural data. It becomes difﬁcult to consider personality psychology a truly

behavioural science and to achieve important advances if fewer than a quarter of our studies
include any measurement of behaviour. Moreover, the methods through which we observe
behaviour are only rarely ‘strong’ in terms of having conﬁdence that they reﬂect actual
behaviour in real situations. Across three years examined in the current analysis, only 7%
of all papers included direct behavioural observation, experience sampling of behaviour or
ARRB, and another 8% included narrowly focused behavioural tests. More common were
relatively weak methods such as globally retrospective behavioural self-reports.
Practical implications and recommendations
The current examination has several important implications and leads to practical
recommendations. First, researchers should devote more attention to strong behavioural
data. As argued earlier, behaviour plays important roles in personality psychology;
however, strong behavioural data are obtained only rarely. Thus, what we think we learn
about personality and behaviour is largely based upon data with important limitations as
indicators of actual behaviour. Again, relatively weak behavioural strategies such as
retrospective/generalized self-reported behaviour or hypothetical behavioural reports can
be useful for addressing some issues in personality psychology. But stronger behavioural
strategies such as direct behavioural observation or experience sampling of behaviour can
provide more direct insight into what people actually do. Thus, they provide more
compelling information about the links between personality and behaviour.
Second, researchers should restrict use of the term ‘behaviour’ to only those forms of
data consensually viewed as behaviour. Table 2 provides a starting point for a discussion
that may ultimately produce good consensus about this issue. This is important because the
ﬁeld should be able to reach reasonable consensus on such a fundamental issue, and we
should communicate in ways that adhere to this consensus. This will limit potential
confusion and disagreement arising from loose or imprecise use of the term behaviour.
Relatedly and somewhat more narrowly, researchers studying behaviour should clarify
their measurement strategy early in their reports. More speciﬁcally, papers’ abstracts
should identify which type of behavioural data is to be reported. Currently, abstracts often
vaguely refer to ‘behaviour’ with minimal information about the nature of the ostensibly
behavioural data. Given the strengths and weaknesses of the types of behavioural data, this
information may affect readers’ desire to devote time and energy to an entire paper.
Fourth, editors, reviewers and funding agencies should exercise appropriate appreciation
for strong behavioural data. They should evaluate research according to the relative
strengths and weaknesses of the forms of behavioural data. My impression is that editors
and reviewers generally do this well. For example, as mentioned earlier, eight of the nine
paper reporting direct behavioural observation were one-study papers, but most papers
summarized in Table 4 included multiple studies. Thus, reviewers and editors seem to
recognize the importance and costs of direct behavioural observation, and they therefore
accepted one-study papers in which this type of data was used.
Fifth, as a ﬁeld, we should ensure that new constructs, phenomena or methods are tied to
strong behavioural data. As described earlier, behaviour reveals concrete implications of
constructs and measures. The lack of strong behavioural data means that few constructs and
measures may have strong demonstrable links to what people actually do. True, many
constructs and measures are linked to important cognitive and affective phenomena.
Despite the importance of such links, the greatest social and practical impact occurs
through peoples’ actual behaviour—behaviour is where cognitive, affective and

motivational events and tendencies directly affect the individual’s life outcomes and social
context. Without strong information about participants’ behaviour, we cannot understand
the full and perhaps most practically important implications of new personality variables
and measures. This is an accusation that I have heard levelled at much of the emerging
neuroscience measurements in personality psychology. Such research will merit greater
attention and interest when it is tied to strong behavioural data.
Sixth, going beyond the current analysis, the ﬁeld would beneﬁt from using methods
revealing a wide range of important behaviours. Indeed, the methods highlighted in the
current paper (see Table 2) can be applied to many behavioural domains at many levels of
abstraction. When such methods are used to gather information about a wide range of
behaviours, they can address important issues in personality psychology. One might argue
that psychology has never dedicated itself strongly to a comprehensive and coherent
examination of basic social behaviours (Baumeister et al., 2007; Furr et al., in press). True,
classic studies in experimental social psychology examined behaviour; however, each
study usually included one and only one behaviour—e.g. how much time was taken to help
someone ostensibly in need, how intensely a participant ostensibly shocked someone,
whether people on the street stopped to join a group that was ostensibly watching
something interesting. Such work is important, and the single behaviours included in each
study were carefully chosen for their relevance to the speciﬁc hypothesis being tested. But
the focus on various single behaviours provides scattered perspective on the fundamentally
multidimensional nature of behaviour. For example, did people express anxiety,
compassion or confusion as they helped someone, do different types of people express
concern versus apathy while harming someone, and are people who are willing to harm
someone also hesitant to help another person? A greater dedication to wide-ranging,
multidimensional examinations of behaviour could provide greater breadth, depth and
integration to our understanding of personality, social forces and human behaviour. Funder
has recently (2006) argued that among the three elements of the ‘personality triad’—
personality, situations and behaviour—behaviour is the most poorly understood. Although
studies of single or few behaviours are important, studies that include many behaviours will
allow researchers to understand more thoroughly the nature of behaviour in general, the
fundamental differences among types of behaviours and the potential structure of a
complex sets of behaviours.
In sum, personality psychology includes many important phenomena such as cognition,
affect, motivation, self-concept, social perceptions and trait structure. Attention to such
phenomena has revealed core psychological structures and processes that are fundamental
to human personality. The current paper echoes and extends a growing chorus of
researchers suggesting that our attention should be broadened to include more widespread
examination of behaviour in general, and greater use of strong behavioural data in
particular. That is, the ﬁeld must pay at least as much attention to what people do as it does
to what people think, feel and see. By clarifying the meaning of ‘behaviour’, the
importance of behaviour, the strengths and weaknesses of core types of behavioural data
and the lack of attention to strong behavioural data, the ﬁeld will solidify its conceptual and
methodological foundation.
