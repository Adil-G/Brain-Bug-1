Although scholars have long recognized the increased mortality risk that new
ventures face in terms of a “liability of newness,” most of the discussion
around this risk has been in terms of the contextual constraints that new ventures face and the difficulties that managers have in overcoming them. This
emphasis is in part a reflection of the perils of newness but also stems from
the retrospective and aggregate perspective taken by researchers. Although
the macro-level perspective of new venture mortality has made a significant contribution to our knowledge
of mortality risk patterns, there has been little interest in identifying how venture managers can address
the risks that all new organizations face.
We argue that in order to make progress in explaining new venture survival, a theoretical model
is required that uses a more micro-level perspective to explain new venture failure (and the flip side, new
venture survival). In this paper we develop such a model. We establish a definition of mortality risk and
argue that the liability of newness is largely dependent on the degree of novelty (ignorance) associated
with a new venture. Novelty is viewed in three different dimensions, viz.: to the market, to the technology
of production and to management. Novelty to the market concerns the degree to which the customers
are uncertain about the new venture. Novelty in production concerns the extent to which the production
technology used by the new venture is similar to the technologies in which the production team has
experience and knowledge. Novelty to management concerns the entrepreneurial team’s lack of busi-

with the degree of novelty in each dimension and with the number of dimensions in which the new venture
is novel.
We propose that the decline in mortality risk occurs as the venture’s novelty in each of the three
dimensions is eroded by information search and dissemination processes. This allows the new firm to
become an established business and explains what we term the “evolutionary” path of mortality—novelty
and risk decline monotonically, after a period of adolescence, as ignorance decays over time due to ‘passive learning’. We also propose that there is a “strategic” mortality risk path that reflects the impact of
positive and negative shocks (shocks are exogenous events that alter the overall degree of novelty at
a point in time— positive shocks decrease overall novelty, while negative shocks increase overall novelty) and reversals (endogenous actions that increase the overall novelty of the new venture at a point
in time) on the mortality risk of a new venture.
If the incidence and effects of these disruptions can be managed, then venture managers may be
able to mitigate the mortality risk for their venture. We argue that risk reduction strategies can be employed, most of which impact on one or more of the dimensions of mortality risk in order to increase
the firm’s chances of survival. A series of risk reduction strategies are proposed and their impact on the
determinants of mortality risk is considered.  2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION
One estimate of the failure rate for new ventures is 40% in the first year and 90% over
10 years (Timmons 1990). Although there is dispute amongst research scholars about
how high the failure rate for new ventures is, it is generally acknowledged that starting
a new business is a high-risk activity. Why do so many new ventures fail? The risks of
failure facing a new venture are derived from several sources: including the costs of
learning new tasks (Stinchcombe 1965; Singh et al. 1986); the characteristics of the new
product (Aldrich and Auster 1986); the strength of conflicts regarding new organizational roles (Stinchcombe 1965; Singh et al. 1986); the presence or absence of informal
organizational structures (Stinchcombe 1965); the stability of links with key stakeholders (Stinchcombe 1965; Singh et al. 1986); and the degree of organizational stability/
inertia (Hannan and Freeman 1984). Stinchcombe introduced the concept of the liability
of newness to explain why more new ventures failed than did established businesses
(Stinchcombe 1965).
There is considerable agreement that the above factors contribute to the liability
of newness and that the liability of newness declines over time.1 Researchers disagree,
however, over the ability of an entrepreneur to implement actions that might allow them
to more rapidly reduce mortality risk. Whittington (1993) proposes researchers typically
have either an evolutionary or procedural view of strategy. The evolutionary view investigates the survival of numbers of organizations across large populations to understand
the ability to learn. The procedural view concentrates on a more micro-level approach
and provides information about how learning takes place within and between organizations.
Some evolutionary scholars are pessimistic about the possibilities of one organization gaining competitive advantage through learning—new ventures enter a Darwinian
world to which they cannot adapt if they are unsuited to their business environment
(Hannan and Freeman 1989). It follows that new ventures which ‘begin wrongly’ are
most likely to perish despite attempts to change their course of action or behavior—

firms travel down an “evolutionary” path, and there is little the entrepreneur can do.
In this view, the question of why some new ventures succeed is either answered in terms
of good luck at founding or is left unaddressed.
Some evolutionary scholars, however, are optimistic that the acquisition of information and knowledge may improve a new organization’s chances of adaptation and
survival (Parkhe 1991) and argue that positive results stem from learning derived from
interactions among organizations (Davis 1991; Burns and Wholey 1993; Haunschild
1993). For example, Miner and Haunschild (1995) find that organizations do learn from
other organizations facing similar circumstances and that there is also a collective learning across organizations—a population-level learning. This research stream offers a micro-level perspective to learning what was previously only viewed through a macro-level
lens (Strang and Meyer 1994).
In hindsight, it may appear that new ventures are subject to the predetermined
laws proposed by evolutionary scholars. Closer scrutiny, however, reveals that entrepreneurs are continuously making decisions about highly uncertain environments and the
new venture’s internal structures that in turn modify its performance outcomes. New
venture managers may learn from past choices about how to perform better in the future. Sometimes, this learning can facilitate adaptation to changed environmental conditions—it is the strategic choices of managers that help define the environmental pressures a business faces and how it maneuvers to meet them. We propose that a new
venture manager’s decisions can impact the liability of newness—new venture managers
can affect this unique package of issues facing a new venture. This does not necessarily
deny the existence of a predetermined path proposed by evolutionary scholars, but suggests these paths are extremely broad and allow the entrepreneur strategic discretion
in the direction and speed of progress (Mintzberg 1990). We argue that managing this
strategic discretion can significantly improve a new venture’s chance of survival.
How new venture managers exercise their discretion depends on the information
available to them and to the parties with whom they must deal. Entrepreneurs often
start a new venture ignorant of many key dimensions of running their businesses and
must obtain the necessary information if they are to survive. The views of new venture
survival, discussed above, all share an emphasis on the acquisition of information, either
by venture managers or by customers, suppliers, buyers, regulators, and others. They
suggest that for new ventures to succeed, it is critical that their managers obtain information and distribute it quickly and appropriately. They differ on what information is required for survival, what parties need the information, and how easily it can be obtained.
To make progress in explaining new venture survival, a theoretical model is required that explains new venture failure (and the flip side—new venture survival) in
terms of a predetermined “evolutionary” path and strategic choices (in particular, risk
reduction strategies). In this paper we develop such a model. We begin by establishing
a definition of mortality risk and argue that the liability of newness is largely dependent
on the degree of novelty (ignorance) associated with a new venture. Novelty is viewed
in three different dimensions, viz.: to the market, to the technology of production, and
to management. We argue that mortality risk increases with the degree of novelty in
each dimension and with the number of dimensions in which the new venture is novel.
We propose the decline in mortality risk occurs as the venture’s novelty in each of the
three dimensions is eroded by information search and dissemination processes. This
allows the new firm to become an established business and explains the predetermined

“evolutionary” path of mortality. We argue that novelty and risk decline monotonically,
after a period of adolesence, as ignorance decays over time.2
We also propose that the decline in mortality risk for a new venture (the “evolutionary” path) can be disrupted by reversals in the decay of ignorance and/or environmental
shocks. If the incidence and effects of these disruptions can be managed, then venture
managers may be able to mitigate the mortality risk for their venture. We argue that
risk reduction strategies can be employed, most of which impact on one or more of the
dimensions of mortality risk in order to increase the firm’s chances of survival. A series
of risk reduction strategies are proposed and their impact on the determinants of mortality risk is considered.

MORTALITY RISK
In the context of new ventures, we define mortality risk to mean the probability that
a firm will become insolvent and be unable to recover from that insolvency before being
bankrupted and ceasing operations. Thus, new venture mortality refers to the departure
of the business entity from the market for reasons of insolvency. This definition is more
narrow than defining mortality as discontinuance (either change in ownership or closure
of the business (Fredland and Morris 1976)). A business may change ownership as a
result of its success, not as a result of poor performance. Our definition also differs from
that of Dun and Bradstreet (1979), which requires a business to either go into bankruptcy or cease operations with resulting losses to creditors. By our definition a business
that is technically bankrupt (based on an accounting definition) but has not ceased operations is not (yet) a mortality.
Business mortality simply requires that an unexpected fall in revenues and/or an
unexpected rise in expenses be of such magnitude(s) that the firm becomes insolvent,
is unable to attract new debt or equity funding (including the tolerance of creditors)
and thus cannot continue to operate.3 This approach to mortality is appropriate for this
paper as it is based on the life of the organization. It is not based on the life of the management team and is not dependent upon particular accounting operationalizations.
New organizations begin life with a basic expectation that they will survive, even
while continually subject to the risk that an unanticipated event or combination of
events will force them out of business. Some environments harbor more threats than
others do. Within the same general environment, some paths are more hazardous than
others are. At the same time, most new ventures will be initially more vulnerable to
environmental pressures than are otherwise similar, but more established firms. Threats
to the performance of established firms may threaten the very existence of new ventures.
Although more vulnerable than established firms, new ventures will differ in their
capabilities for meeting environmental threats. What are the factors that contribute to
one new venture being able to survive while others fail? As an entrepreneur, what can
2
Fichman and Levinthal (1991) refer to the period of adolescence as a honeymoon period—the initial
stage of venture development when it is protected from the external environment, and consequently there
is a low risk of failure. At the end of the period of adolescence, there is a rapid rise in mortality risk which
then follows the age-dependent, monotonically declining pattern described by the liability of newness (the
honeymoon is over) (Bruderl and Schussler 1990; Fichman and Levinthal 1991; Barron et al. 1993).

Note that mortality risk is quite different from business risk or investment risk. It is concerned with
survival, not the variance of profits around expected levels, except insofar as this would jeopardize solvency.

I do to increase my chance of survival? The rest of this paper addresses these two
questions.

MORTALITY RISK DEPENDS ON NOVELTY
Previous research investigates the activities organizations might undertake to acquire
information or knowledge and whether this learning occurs at the population-level
(Miner and Haunschild 1995), organization-level (Mezias and Glynn 1993), or whether
this learning has any affect at all on the survival chances of an organization. This paper
investigates where knowledge (or ignorance) resides and how a lack of knowledge and
a failure to acquire knowledge affects the mortality risk of a new venture. We propose
that the more novel a new venture is, the more information must be acquired to inform
managers and stakeholders.
The degree of novelty of a new organization may reside in production or in management, and both types of novelty contribute to the liability of newness. Novelty in these
two dimensions may also affect the organization’s absorptive capacity. Absorptive capacity is the ability of a firm to recognize the value of new, external information, assimilate it, and apply it to commercial ends—it is largely a function of the firm’s level of
prior related knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal 1990).
However, it is not only novelty to the organization (novelty in production and novelty in management) that influences venture survival, but also the novelty of the new
venture to the market. The less that customers know about a new venture, the lower
the probability of purchase thereby increasing the risk of new venture failure. Therefore,
we consider novelty on three separate dimensions, viz.: novelty to the market, novelty
to production, and novelty to management.

NOVELTY TO THE MARKET
Novelty to the market concerns the degree to which customers are uncertain about the
new venture. From the concept of the “liability of newness,” we know that the process
by which customers learn about a new venture and come to perceive it as established
will affect its risks, as well as its organizational momentum, legitimacy, and customer
trust (Singh et al. 1986; Aldrich and Fiol 1994). The new venture’s novelty to potential
customers is derived from more specific uncertainties regarding the new venture’s organization and management. Where customer knowledge is incomplete on the new venture’s organization or management, market novelty is present and can have a significant
and negative relationship of the new venture’s chances of survival (Shepherd and Shanley 1998).
For example, suppose that Nike launched a corporate venture into the motorbike
industry. Although Nike would be a new player in the motorbike industry, the firm is
a well-known producer of athletic footwear and sporting apparel. While there may be
few obvious relationships between footwear and motorbikes, customers’ knowledge
and/or experience with Nike may provide some legitimacy to its corporate venture. New
product releases from existing companies or even corporate ventures can be viewed as
more familiar (less novel) to the market than a new venture in which the customers
are completely ignorant about the organization launching themselves on to the market.4

New venture here refers to independent venture as in Aldrich and Fiol (1994).

<-----Page 5----->398

Potential customers are less likely to purchase from a more novel organization. In
its planning, the new venture must foresee expenditures on advertising to familiarize
and inform potential consumers about the new venture and, in so doing, reduce novelty
to the market. There is likely to be a large variance around the expected value of that
expenditure, since, until the depths of consumer ignorance have been plumbed (which
requires experience in the market), venture managers may have only a limited idea of
how much marketing is needed. Conversely, a new venture that is less novel to the market will likely have fewer advertising expenditures and less variance around those expenditures.

NOVELTY IN PRODUCTION
Novelty in production concerns the extent to which the production technology used by
the new venture is similar to the technologies in which the production team has experience
and knowledge. The difficulty of manufacturing the new venture’s product, relative to
the knowledge and experience of the production team, is a major indicator of the novelty
in production. For example, a new venture assembles a new production team—people
that have not worked with each other before. There are likely to be some conflicts regarding new organizational roles and the absence of an informal organizational structure. Furthermore, the new venture’s production team might be operating with new
production technology (or maybe just the newer version of the manufacturing machinery that they had used in the past), which introduces costs associated with learning new
tasks. These issues contribute to the liability of newness.
Furthermore, research into the learning curve provides evidence that the costs of
producing manufactured items decrease with the cumulative number of items produced
(Yelle 1979). The benefits of the learning curve may also benefit organizations in ways
unrelated to production costs, such as higher quality, more effective pricing decisions,
and marketing (Besanko et al. 1997). Although there is some evidence to suggest that
the lessons of experience may spillover from one activity to another (Hatch and Mowery
1998), this will depend on the relatedness of the activities at issue. High novelty in production relates to minimal experience spillover from previous businesses and therefore
reduced learning curve advantages.
Mortality risk increases with novelty in production because novelty will probably
require greater expenditures in terms of dollars and time to overcome the costs associated with overcoming conflicts about new organizational roles, the development of informal organizational structures, and learning new tasks.

NOVELTY TO MANAGEMENT
The primary criteria used by venture capitalists in assessing new venture proposals are
managerial capabilities and other factors related to competence such as: quality of management, management’s track record, entrepreneur’s knowledge, and management expertise (Hisrich and Jankowitz 1990; Shepherd, Ettenson, and Crouch in press). Other
researchers have found that venture capitalists believe failure lies primarily with incompetent senior management (Gorman and Sahlman 1986; Meyer et al. 1993; Shepherd,
Ettenson, and Crouch in press). Venture capitalists, in explaining their decisions, specifically refer to managerial skill in the particular sector being entered (Dixon 1991;

<-----Page 6----->NEW VENTURE SURVIVAL

399

Kahn 1987). Similarly, entrepreneurs perceived that management quality was one of
the reasons they were denied venture capital (Bruno and Tyebjee 1986).
The reliance of venture capitalists on the competence of the management team is
a response to the uncertainty facing a new venture. Venture capitalists can assess a venture’s strategy and projected environment via a business plan, but this only provides
the strategic intentions behind the venture. Plans almost certainly will not turn out as
predicted, and the environment faced by a venture will not be as anticipated and may
change frequently. Performance will deteriorate if changes in the environment are not
detected by the entrepreneur(s), if strategies are not reassessed, and if new strategies
are not formulated and implemented. These all require management skills.
Venture capitalists reduce their risk associated with an uncertain environment by
choosing carefully those ventures that are managed by entrepreneurs they believe will
be able to cope with uncertainty, especially those that have demonstrated their competence in prior adaptive activities. The importance that venture capitalists place on novelty to management implies that success is more likely to be achieved by those entering
an industry in which venturers have prior experience.
Industry-specific human capital appears to be a significant determinant of venture
survival, especially those ventures with founders that have experience with rapid growth
firms that compete in the same industry as the start up (Cooper et al. 1994; Roure and
Maidique 1986). The rapidity of change in emergent industries means that opportunities
are likely to occur too quickly to be grasped by outsiders. Venture managers must possess the necessary skills from the start (Feeser and Willard 1990).
Having said this, we also note that not all of the competencies necessary for venture
survival are industry-specific. Some are more general. Ventures need to be well managed by individuals with solid business skills. They need to have marketing acumen,
which involves not just knowledge of who to market towards, but also how to market.
The need for industry specific competencies should not blind venture managers or their
sponsors to the need for a wide portfolio of skills to be represented in the venture management team. Industry know-how is a necessary but not a sufficient requirement
for success.
Similarly, an entrepreneur’s experience with previous start up ventures and new
ventures in their early growth stages should not be neglected as a source of advantage.
For example, a chronic problem with a new venture is lack of organization. There is
conflict and confusion within a new venture in recognizing the tasks that need to be
performed and in allocating people to those tasks. There is also uncertainty for employees in the venture regarding how to perform their new role effectively and how to adjust
to market changes (Stinchcombe 1965). New ventures need to construct an organizational structure that specifies tasks, allocates people to those tasks, and provides avenues
of authority. Informal structures also need to be developed to facilitate communication
within the organization. Efforts are also required to create and foster relationships with
key stakeholders. These are issues for management that are relatively unique to new
ventures: that is, established ventures have structures in place, people performing their
identified tasks, and long standing relationships with stakeholders. An entrepreneur
who has experience with a start up or early stage new venture has had to deal with these
important management issues.
Although management skills may include a variety of general and specific components, what makes them essential to the venture situation is how venture managers use
them in the specific situations they face. Management skill is relatively more important

<-----Page 7----->400

FIGURE 1 A Venture’s Mortality Risk.

for new ventures than for established firms, since venture managers must address a variety of new and pressing problems without the slack available to managers of established
firms and without the prior history of interactions upon which managers in an established firm can draw. Thus, overall management skill for new ventures is highly situational and constitutes the principal means by which venture managers reduce uncertainty around them and establish their enterprises. Therefore, novelty to management
concerns the entrepreneurial team’s lack of business skills, industry specific information,
and start-up experience. Management novelty equates to a greater liability of newness
and a greater risk of failure.

RISK DECLINES OVER TIME FOR EACH CATEGORY
The decay of ignorance can be represented by a “learning curve” for each dimension—
novelty of the market, production, and management. In Figure 1, we show mortality
risk curves for three new ventures with various initial degrees of overall novelty. We
call these the “evolutionary” mortality risk curves—the decline in novelty in one or more
of the dimensions, mentioned above, due to passive learning—as proposed by evolutionary scholars. The “evolutionary” mortality curve indicates the decline in ignorance due
to the accumulation of information and experience in one or more of the three technologies, as time passes, for each venture. Movement along the curve is expected to take
place as the parties gradually accumulate information and experience about their particular technologies. The “evolutionary” mortality risk curve for each new venture is thus
negatively sloped with respect to time (after the period of adolescence). Thus, risk of
mortality is highest initially, when the new venture has had little time to reduce uncertainty in any area of novelty (with the exception of the period of adolescence).
We should expect the “evolutionary” mortality risk to decline and to approach
some minimum level over time. In principle, this benchmark level would be the mortality risk of the most established firm with a similar product in the same or similar industry
and market context. This benchmark level of risk should be understood to be a moving
target, shifting as macroeconomic and environmental conditions change. The above discussion leads to our first two propositions:

<-----Page 8----->NEW VENTURE SURVIVAL

401

Proposition 1: The overall decline in the “evolutionary” mortality risk curve of a new
venture is a function of the passive learning that occurs on each dimension of novelty
(the market, production, and management) and approaches some benchmark level
of risk.
Proposition 2: The “evolutionary” mortality risk for a new venture with a low overall
degree of novelty will begin lower than the “evolutionary” mortality risk of a more
novel new venture.

To extend the above discussion, it appears appropriate to investigate a new venture’s timing of entry, which is critical to a firm’s chances of survival and subsequent
success (Golder and Tellis 1993; Shepherd and Shanley 1998). Researchers of timing
of entry have typically investigated the differences between pioneers and late followers.
A pioneer is a venture that enters a new product market first (that is, they create an industry)—overall novelty is likely to be relatively high; a late follower is a venture that enters
late in an industry’s stage of development—overall novelty is likely to be relatively low.
Prior research indicates that market pioneers (relative to late followers) have higher
returns if they are successful (Abell 1978; DeCastro and Chrisman 1995; Rogers 1983),
have long lived market share advantages (Bond and Lean 1977; Kalyanaram and Urban
1992), but also must bear a higher risk of failure (Aaker and Day 1986; Mitchell 1991;
Carroll and Delacroix 1982). Pioneers must learn new roles with few (if any) role models
and often must establish links with key stakeholders that do not understand or acknowledge their existence (Hannan and Carroll 1992; Stinchcombe 1965)—pioneers have less
legitimacy then followers (Aldrich and Fiol 1994). We argue that a pioneer’s higher
risk of failure (lower legitimacy) is due to its higher level of overall novelty. The above
discussion leads to a third proposition:
Proposition 3: The “evolutionary” mortality risk for a pioneer will begin higher than
the “evolutionary” mortality risk for a late follower.

REVERSALS AND SHOCKS TO MORTALITY RISK
Although we suggest a continuing decline in mortality risk as time passes, it is also possible that the mortality risk of a new venture could increase, rather than decrease, as it
ages. This could occur due to reversals and/or shocks. Reversals refer to an endogenous
action that increases the overall novelty of the new venture at a point in time. Shocks refer
to an exogenous event that alters the overall degree of novelty at a point in time. Positive
shocks decrease overall novelty, while negative shocks increase overall novelty. Shocks
are conceptually similar to environmental jolts which are defined as “transient perturbations whose occurrences are difficult to foresee and whose impact on organizations are
disruptive and potentially inimical” (Meyer 1982: 515; Venkataraman and Van de Ven
1998)—a low probability-high consequence event with an adverse economic impact
(Venkataraman and Van de Ven 1998). This paper’s definition of shock is similar to
an environmental jolt, except that it directly affects the degree of novelty of a new venture which can have either a positive or negative influence on new venture survival—it
can increase novelty (a negative shock) or decrease novelty (a positive shock).
An example of a negative shock would be loss of a communication/promotion channel, for example, government legislation is enacted that bans companies that manufacture and sell alcohol from advertising on television or radio (similar to the ban on adver-

<-----Page 9----->402

tising for tobacco companies). This would immediately inhibit the ability of a new
venture to decrease its market novelty.
As producers learn the technology of production they may undertake exploratory
variations in the production process in search of lower materials costs, faster production
speed, higher output quality, and so on. If the change in the production process produces
a significant and unintended negative variation in product quality, the market reaction
may be so strongly adverse as to threaten the venture’s continued survival. In markets
for food, health, and medical products, a negative variation in product quality may be
life threatening, and the market may lose confidence in the new venture’s ability to avoid
such mistakes (reversals) in the future.
Concerning the reduction of management novelty, the firm may suffer a reversal
with the loss of a particular manager or other employee, such that the business needs
to rediscover some trade secrets or other information critical for the marketing or production process. Alternatively, analogous to negative production variations, the actions
of a manager may be so inept, bizarre, or unethical that the market loses confidence
in the firm’s managerial competence or even in its general abilities. In banking, for example, one can envision clients withdrawing their deposits because of an action taken by
the bank (or by bank personnel) which would threaten the security of one’s deposits
if it were allowed to happen again.
These reversals and negative shocks will affect the firm’s ability to reduce uncertainty in the market, production, and management and suggests a fourth proposition:
Proposition 4: Reversals and/or negative shocks shift a new venture’s mortality risk
to a higher curve at a given point in time. Positive shocks shift a new venture’s mortality
risk to a lower curve at a given point in time.

RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES
As discussed earlier, entrepreneurs are not necessarily passive in the learning process—
they can use risk reduction strategies. Risk reduction strategies are actions taken by the
new venture to decrease overall novelty. We propose that by lowering overall novelty,
the new venture reduces its mortality risk. In Figure 2, we show two mortality risk
curves—one represents an “evolutionary” mortality risk path and the other a “strategic” mortality risk path. The “evolutionary” mortality risk path demonstrates a monotonic decline of risk over time (after a period adolescence) and reflects the evolutionary
perspective of strategy. The “strategic” mortality risk path demonstrates the impact of
positive and negative shocks, reversals and risk reduction strategies on the mortality risk
of a single organization. Note that a risk reduction strategy has a similar impact as a
positive shock.
A risk reduction strategy provides new information to consumers, producers, or
managers which reduces their ignorance. Thus, risk reduction strategies are expected
to reduce the variability of potential cost and revenue outcomes and perhaps also increase the expected net present value of profits. On the other hand, the cost of risk
reduction strategies will typically reduce the firm’s margins (or ‘upside’ potential). The
main point of a risk reduction strategy is to truncate the ‘downside’ risk and consequently avoid the financial failure of the firm. This leads to our fifth proposition:
Proposition 5: Risk reduction strategies shift a new venture’s mortality risk to a lower
level at a given point in time.

FIGURE 2 Comparison of Evolutionary and Strategic Mortality Risk Paths.

Risk reduction strategies include a variety of actions, including insurance, advertising and promotion, and education and training. They can also include: poaching experienced and educated employees from other firms; and overfunding the venture or accelerating funding schedules. Furthermore, they can include a variety of strategies for
linking with other firms, such as: licensing rather than manufacturing; leasing rather
than buying assets; committing to a more moderate growth plan; forging marketing
agreements with established firms; and buying a franchise rather than starting an independent business. Staffing strategies can also aid in risk reduction, such as in hiring consultants when needed (rather than full-time accountants, lawyers, and other specialists),
hiring temporary rather than permanent staff; and operating from home or sharing office expenses to keep overheads down. We shall briefly consider how some of these
reduce risk by impacting upon the novelty to the market, production, and/or management.

RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES IMPACTING ON
CONSUMER IGNORANCE
Attempting to break into a market as a new venture confers additional mortality risks,
as compared to an established firm broadening its product line to include the same new
product (Lambkin and Day 1989). Informative advertising, and perhaps personal selling, must be undertaken to disseminate information and to overcome the reluctance
of potential customers to bear quality risk or switching costs. For example, customer
education must include demonstration, documentation, product performance information (Heiman and Muller, 1996) as well as engender customer trust in the new venture.
Thus, information dissemination to potential customers can be seen as a risk reduction activity, because it serves to better inform them about the new venture. Most ventures will need to disseminate information to consumers and other stakeholders. What
makes this activity strategic is when it involves substantial investments of human and
financial capital to lay the groundwork for the success of the venture. These investments

<-----Page 11----->404

are often unlikely to be justified on the basis of immediate sales but instead provide
a framework upon which stronger links with customers are developed, for example, the
building of corporate reputation and customer loyalty.
An alternative (or concurrent) risk reduction strategy may be to seek a marketing
agreement with an existing firm which would market the product either under the established firm’s brand name or allow the new venture to operate under the established
firm’s corporate umbrella more generally. The ability of a corporate identity to provide
an umbrella for new product development and new venturing is well-recognized (Dacin
and Brown 1997; Belch and Belch 1987; Keller and Aaker 1994; Wansink 1989). Existing
brand names and corporate logos from established organizations confer information
about the probable quality of the product, the quality of the service and/or warranty
associated with the product, and so on. Placing the new venture under the umbrella of
a legitimate established organization will thus serve to reduce novelty in the market
place and allow the new venture to avoid substantial marketing costs.
This relationship with an established organization may provide a reduction in the
financial risk associated with educating the market, although a portion of the rights to
revenues is also shifted to the umbrella organization. In addition, the venture also loses
opportunities to build brand and reputation capital through a successful launch. As a
result, venture managers should think carefully about the high costs of reducing consumer uncertainty through such a joint venture relationship.
Thus, the new venture may seek a joint venture with an established firm which has
an appropriate ’gap’ in its product line, and jointly package and market the product. This
should serve to assure the consumer (to some extent) that the new venture is legitimate
because an established firm would not be expected to risk loss of reputation by associating itself with an inappropriate partner.
These risk reduction strategies may have a positive impact on consumer ignorance
about the new venture although care must be taken to ensure that they do not overly
increase novelty on one or both of the other dimensions (a reversal), possibly increasing
rather than decreasing overall mortality risk. For example, entering into a joint venture
relationship with an established firm may reduce consumer ignorance but could also
increase risks in terms of quality assurance and the management of the joint venture relationship.

RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES IMPACTING ON
PRODUCER IGNORANCE
The production process will require the prior assembly of raw materials, productive
assets, personnel, and information, which cost money to purchase, hire, lease, rent, or
otherwise acquire. Much of this outlay may need to be made ‘up front’ which exposes
the new venture to an increased risk of financial failure if some cost and revenues are
incorrectly anticipated. Licensing production rights to, or contracting for manufacture
by, an established firm (rather than attempting to manufacture the product itself) is a
means by which the new venture can reduce production novelty and leverage the value
of their strategic assets, such as product design. This strategy will avoid most of the major
outlays (including learning expenses), which are necessary with a manufacturing strategy, and thus insulate the new venture from financial ruin to some large extent.
The troubles with this strategy are two-fold. First, the long-term success of the ven-

<-----Page 12----->NEW VENTURE SURVIVAL

405

ture may depend on the firm acquiring manufacturing skill and experience directly. This
is delayed by licensing production, and venture managers may find it more expensive
to acquire that experience at larger volumes than in increments. Second, to the extent
to which the production process is difficult to understand and subject to considerable
variation, the venture’s gains in reduced capital outlays may be offset by increased
transaction costs that are incurred in contracting with and monitoring the licensee
(Shane 1994).
Rather than acquire production knowledge through outsourcing, a risk reduction
strategy may be to build production knowledge through education and training programs as well as personnel hiring policies. For example, Microsoft was unable to hire
experienced computer programmers in the early to mid 1980s (due to the industry being
so young very few people could be classified as experienced). They were able to reduce
their production ignorance by hiring exceptionally ‘bright’ people—people who could
rapidly learn and adapt (continually shifting the production novelty level downwards
at a rapid rate).
Once gain, however, this risk reduction strategy in one dimension may increase
novelty in the other two dimensions. For example, managing such bright and creative
people created a number of novel management challenges for Microsoft, for example,
introducing control systems while maintaining intellectual freedom and creativity.

RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES IMPACTING ON
MANAGEMENT IGNORANCE
Management education and training, and/or the poaching of managers with required
skills and experience from other firms, will directly diminish ignorance of best practice
management technology. Successful entrepreneurs typically display management and
business skills which include the ability to recognize market opportunities, the ability
to develop informal organizational structures, to manage potential conflicts arising from
new organizational tasks, to develop links with key stakeholders, and to manage cash
flows. Such skills can be learned and/or further developed via formal business education
programs, short courses, and discussions with other entrepreneurs. To the extent that
managers learn something new and pertinent to the situation at hand, management ignorance is reduced, possibly reducing the downside risk of profit outcomes and thereby
shifting the mortality risk curve downwards.
Cooperative arrangements between a venture and other firms will help to round
out the skill set of the new venture by complementing its capabilities with those of its
partners. These will not successfully reduce managerial novelty, however, unless the
venture’s management team internalizes the skills gained through partnerships,
alliances, and other such arrangements. In fact, cooperative arrangements are more
common in ventures with experienced management teams rather than in those with inexperienced teams. This likely occurs because experienced managers are more knowledgeable about which skills the venture needs to augment through cooperative arrangements (McGee et al. 1995).
Insurance and cash reserves are mortality risk reduction strategies, which may obviate financial ruin in the aftermath of unexpected cost and negative revenue shocks. Such
decisions certainly require information (albeit estimates) of future costs and revenues,
with particular reference to their expected magnitudes, variances, and timing. On the

<-----Page 13----->406

D.A. SHEPHERD, E.J. DOUGLAS, AND M. SHANLEY

basis of such information received, competent financial managers will either insure and
conserve cash balances, or not.
Introducing management information and control systems may also help reduce
management novelty—these systems condense considerable information into ‘digestible’ chunks and decrease wastage of valuable resources. However this risk reduction
strategy may turn the company’s focus internally towards preparing reports and attending efficiency meetings and turn attention away from monitoring, responding to,
and educating the market—increasing novelty in the other dimensions of mortality risk.

COMBINATION RISK REDUCTION STRATEGIES
It is obvious from the above that some strategies reduce mortality risk by reducing more
than one dimension of novelty. Allowing another firm to manufacture and market under
license, for example, obviates the need for production knowledge, to build customer
awareness of the new venture, or manage the production and marketing functions. However, we must also be aware that, although a risk reduction strategy may have the desired
effect in one dimension, it may have an undesirable effect on ignorance in one or both
of the other dimensions of novelty and therefore mortality risk. For example, reducing
ignorance on production and management but failing to reduce ignorance for consumers may lead to the venture becoming more capable at activities that are not desired
by a changing marketplace—a competency trap. Risk reduction strategies must be analyzed in terms of their impact on all three dimensions and must be a result of the realization that the relationship between the dimensions of novelty and mortality risk may
be contingent in nature. This leads to our final proposition.
Proposition 6: The relationship between the dimensions of novelty and mortality risk
may be contingent (interactive) in nature.

CONCLUSION
Although scholars have long recognized the increased mortality risk that new ventures
face in terms of a “liability of newness,” most of the discussion around this risk has been
in terms of the contextual constraints that new ventures face and the difficulties that
managers have in overcoming them. This emphasis is in part a reflection of the perils
of newness but also stems from the retrospective and aggregate perspective taken by
researchers. Although the macro-level perspective of new venture mortality has made
a significant contribution to our knowledge of mortality risk, there has been little interest in identifying how venture managers can address the risks that all new organizations
face. This is a regrettable oversight given that it is unlikely that new ventures commence
with the explicit expectation of failure. On the contrary, venture capitalists and managers go to great lengths to improve the success prospects of the projects they support,
and it is reasonable to think that they are not just indulging in “wishful thinking” by
doing so.
In this paper, we have focused on the common emphasis of prior research—
informational limitations of new ventures—and suggested that new venture novelty is
a multidimensional phenomena and that this novelty and the ignorance that goes with
it are manageable aspects of new ventures. The theoretical model proposed in this paper
increases our understanding of the mortality risk of new ventures at the organization

<-----Page 14----->NEW VENTURE SURVIVAL

407

level and investigates the relationship between novelty (in three key dimensions) and
mortality risk in terms of both an “evolutionary” mortality risk path and a “strategic”
mortality risk path. Specifically, we proposed that mortality risk depends positively on
the degree of novelty in the market, production, and management. In turn, novelty in
these three technology dimensions depends negatively on the passage of time, due to
passive diffusion of information, or learning by doing, in each dimension. The rate at
which information diffuses should be expected to differ in the market, production, and
management, so the mortality risk function should have separate terms relating to the
learning rate in each of these novelty dimensions. Mortality risk, arising from novelty
in each dimension, may also be reduced through risk reduction strategies and may be
positively or negatively impacted by unexpected shocks and/or reversals in any of the
novelty dimensions.
The relationship between specific risk reduction strategies may be additive and/
or multiplicative in their impact on mortality risk. We should probably expect that some
risk reduction strategies, such as entrepreneurial education, would have a direct effect
on reducing the ignorance of managers, plus an indirect impact on the learning rate in
each dimension, as education acts as a catalyst to the learning process. Further, a risk
reduction strategy may have a different effect on each of the novelty dimensions, for
example, a positive effect on (reduction of) consumer novelty, neutral on production
novelty and negative on management novelty.
This paper’s model of mortality risk for a new venture did not include a discussion
of an industry effect. However, we do expect that mortality risk depends on the technological complexity of the particular industry into which the new venture enters. It may
be more risky, other things being equal, to start a new venture in the health or medical
field, than it would be to start a new venture in electronic consumer durable goods, for
example, due to the profusion of legislative and regulatory obstacles in the former. We
also expect it to be more risky to enter a “more-competitive” market (that is, where
at least some firms already know that the management technology and competitive pressures serve to keep margins low and induce highly competitive marketing behavior) as
compared to a less-competitive market. Thus, for a given industry, a new venture may
face more stringent competition from incumbent businesses in one geographic region,
or product niche, than it would in another. These considerations enter the mortality
risk function via the additional demands they place upon management technology in
more complex industries and more competitive markets (not to mention the wisdom
of choosing to enter such an industry in the first place). The combined needs for risk
reduction will also differ depending on the timing of entry. The balance of capabilities
needed for success as a pioneer will differ from those required of a later follower—
different skills and risk reduction strategies are required by each (Robinson et al. 1992).
Due to the research interest in new venture failure and the practical importance
of increased understanding in the causes of failure and the actions that can be taken
to reduce it, a significant contribution could be made by empirically testing all or part of
the proposed model. This requires the operationalization of the key variables, namely,
mortality risk, market novelty, production novelty, and management novelty. Although
there may be many ways to operationalize these constructs, we offer the following suggestions.
Mortality risk has typically been measured at the population-level, although it is
required at the organization-level here. One alternative may be to use experts to assess
the mortality risk of a new venture at various stages of its life. An example might be

<-----Page 15----->408

D.A. SHEPHERD, E.J. DOUGLAS, AND M. SHANLEY

to ask venture capitalists to assess a new venture’s probability of survival, or bankers
who often assess a business’ risk premium. (Although researchers must distinguish mortality risk from other decision criteria bankers may also use to determine a risk premium). Another operationalization of mortality risk might arise from using established
accounting failure ratios to analyze a new venture’s financial statements and calculate
the probability of failure—the higher the probability of failure, the higher the mortality risk.
Measures of novelty might come from surveying key people within the market (for
market novelty), production (for production novelty), and management (for management novelty). Objective measures may also be appropriate—management novelty
might include the number of years experience in this industry or a related industry or
the number of “start ups” in which the management team has been involved. Of course,
these operationalizations can be combined to provide triangulation of the measure. In
sum, this paper provides a model of mortality risk arising from a multidimensional perspective of novelty and argues that the decisions and actions of the new venture manager
can influence an “evolutionary” mortality risk pattern. We hope that further research
is conducted into this aspect of business mortality.
