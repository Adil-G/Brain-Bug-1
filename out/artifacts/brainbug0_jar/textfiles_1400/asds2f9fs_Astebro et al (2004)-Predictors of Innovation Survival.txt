ABSTRACT
We examine the impact of key success factors on the survival of innovations that have
reached the market and were developed by inventors outside of established organizations.
It is of interest to learn which characteristics predict, at an early stage, the duration of the
innovation’s length of sales, because this duration is important to the financial success of
new products. A focus on survival can also contribute conceptual clarity to the study of
new product development. We use the Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the
Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC) in Waterloo, Canada, as the source of data. The CIC
is a not-for-profit agency that provides various services to foster business development
involving innovative products and services. Analysts in the IAP evaluate a specific
product idea or invention on 37 dimensions before it has reached the market. The data
for the present study involved these 37 variables evaluated each with a three-point
linguistic scale. As the evaluations of the criteria are subjective, they might be argued to
contain inaccuracies compared to objective data. On the other hand, the analysts use
multiple related measures of concepts which have been shown to increase predictive
accuracy. The use of experts who are unrelated to the projects avoids decision-making
biases potentially associated with project managers’ assessment of their own projects,
such as unrealistic optimism. The recording of the expert evaluations of the ideas before
they reached the market and independent of the measure of success, rather than using
post-project completion evaluations, eliminates measurement biases such as hindsight
bias and common method variance bias. We used identifying information in these records
to conduct a telephone survey of the inventors, obtaining 561 usable telephone survey
responses for an adjusted response rate of 75%. Out of the 561 inventions, 50 had been
brought to market according to interviews. Three inventors could not recall the entry or
exit date, leaving 47 inventions for use in survival analysis. We identify and use an
exploratory method of data analysis that distinguishes research-appropriate constructs
and their indicators in these data. Cluster analysis was performed on all 561 observations
identifying 14 clusters. Survival regression correlated cluster scores with survival. For the
typical invention, the probability of exiting the market in each year is approximately 0.09.
Three variables were found to significantly shift this mean probability of exit up or down:
anticipated stable demand, price required for profitability, and technical product maturity.
In addition, the degree of competition had a marginally significant effect. Because these
variables can be assessed at an early stage of an inventions’ development, the expected
survival time for a specific invention may be computed by entering these assessment
values into the described survival model. Then this and other information may be used to
compute the expected return of an invention.

Introduction
An early stage evaluation of the potential merits of an innovation has been shown to have
considerable value (Mansfield et al., 1977, pp. 25-32). It is of interest to learn which
characteristics predict, at an early stage, the duration of the innovation’s length of sales, because
this duration is important to the financial success of new products. While there has been
extensive research on the predictors of project success (and failure) of innovations and new
products (reviewed by Montoya-Weiss and Calantone, 1994; Balachandra and Friar, 1997;
Henard and Szymanski, 2001) we have located little research on the determinants of innovations’
survival. Information about these determinants would have direct managerial implications for the
evaluation of new product development projects.
A focus on survival can also contribute conceptual clarity to the study of new product
development. Most studies use fuzzy or sometimes no definition of new product success,
allowing the research participants to interpret the outcome variable “success”. This produces
both measurement error and theoretical ambiguity. New product success entails at least three
criteria or outcomes: whether the product reaches the market (commercialization), how long the
product remains on the market (survival), and yearly profits. These success criteria may not
necessarily correlate. For example, a product that early on earn high yearly profits may not have
a long shelf life due to entry of imitators. It therefore makes good sense to study each of the three
success criteria separately to learn more about the drivers of total returns.
We examine the impact of key success factors on the survival of innovations that have
reached the market and were developed by inventors outside of established organizations.
Inventors are important sources of invention and economic renewal in society (Schumpeter,
1934) and thus merit attention in their own right. In addition, to the extent that new product
success depends upon product and market characteristics, distinct from organizational factors
(such as fit to a corporation's other products and services), this research should shed some light
on factors in product survival more generally.
Of course there are important differences between inventor and corporate product
development. However, some of these differences imply that there may be unique benefit to

<-----Page 5----->Survival of Innovations 2

using independent inventions for research focused on product and market predictors of survival.
Independent inventors operate outside of established organizations and thus do not suffer from
the decision-making biases often associated with established firms (Henderson and Clark, 1990;
Henderson, 1993). Consequently, the products offered to the market by independent inventors
may be somewhat different in their features from those offered by corporations, providing
opportunities to detect the influences of these features.
We use the Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC)
in Waterloo, Canada, as the source of data on new product development projects by independent
inventors. The CIC is a not-for-profit agency that provides various services to foster business
development involving innovative products and services. Analysts in the IAP evaluate a specific
product idea or invention before it has reached the market. The purpose of this evaluation is to
advise the potential entrepreneur on whether and how to continue efforts. [For further
descriptions see Udell (1989), Udell et al. (1993) and Åstebro and Gerchak (2001).]
IAP analysts use a fixed set of 37 criteria, each with a three-point linguistic scale to
evaluate each new product idea. As the evaluations of the criteria are subjective, they might be
argued to contain inaccuracies compared to objective data (Henard and Szymanski, 2001). On
the other hand, the analysts use multiple related measures of concepts which have been shown to
increase predictive accuracy (Henard and Szymanski, 2001). The use of experts who are
unrelated to the projects avoids decision-making biases potentially associated with project
managers’ assessment of their own projects, such as unrealistic optimism (Armor and Taylor,
2002) and hindsight bias (Fischhoff, 1975). The recording of the expert evaluations of the ideas
before they reached the market and independent of the measure of success, rather than using
post-project completion evaluations, eliminates measurement biases such as hindsight bias and
common method variance bias (Campbell and Fiske 1959, Fischhoff 1975).
Key Success Factors for New Products
There has been a great deal of research on the determinants of new product success.
Reviews can be found in Balachandra and Friar (1997), Lilien and Yoon (1989), Linton et al.
(2002), Montoya-Weiss and Calantone (1994) and Henard and Szymanski (2001). The factors

<-----Page 6----->Survival of Innovations 3

studied can be organized in the overall categories of product characteristics, organizational
development process, firm strategy, and market factors (Henard and Szymanski, 2001). This
research and meta-analyses has provided considerable evidence that a great number of factors
within these categories can influence the outcomes of new product development.
An example of this tradition is Cooper (1981), who conducted a retrospective survey of
195 new product projects to determine the factors perceived by R&D managers to be associated
with perceived success. A factor analysis was conducted on forty-eight variables to generate a
smaller and more manageable subset of factors. Thirteen factors explained 69.3 percent of the
variance of the original forty-eight variables. A total of seven of the thirteen factors were
significantly related to perceived project success at least at the 0.10 level. The model had an R2
of 0.42 and correctly predicted 84.1 percent of the projects’ outcomes in a naïve split-sample
test.
However, this study found little common agreement with others as to the relevant “success
factors” identified by Balachandra and Friar (1997). Performing a meta-analysis of 60 research
publications, these reviewers find contradictory results and little stability regarding the
significant determinants of success across these studies; in addition there seems to be no clear
agreement even on the direction of influence of the factors analyzed. Balachandra and Friar
(1997) noted four major sources of weakness in the studies on the success or failure of new
product development and R&D projects, namely the quality of data (low), the definition of a new
product (fuzzy), factor selection and definition (weak reliability and validity, small samples), and
measurement of factors (unclear, not standardized).
Henard and Szymanski (2001) found the following from their meta-analysis of 41 studies
of 24 antecedents that were reported frequently enough to permit meaningful investigation:
•

in multivariate analysis the significant and dominant drivers are relatively few:
product advantage, product innovativeness, marketing synergy, technological
synergy, market orientation and competitive response intensity, with product
advantage and technological synergy explaining the most variance;

<-----Page 7----->Survival of Innovations 4
•

a few select variables explains most of the variance – there is no need to measure a
large number of factors;

•

multi-item measures are more predictive than single-item measures;

•

the length of time that defines project success determines the importance of several
factors;

•

objective performance data yield stronger relationships than subjective performance
data.

Different measures of "success" have been used. Cooper and Kleinschmidt (1987) identify
three measures of success—financial performance, opportunity window and market share. Lilien
and Yoon (1989) and Griffin and Page (1993) add other dimensions. We acknowledge that
project “success” is a multidimensional concept. Our purpose is to analyze a single well-defined
and objective outcome measure: the length of survival of an innovation in the marketplace.
Focusing on the survival of new products, Asplund and Sandin (1999) discovered that new
beer brands with low and decreasing market shares have higher hazard rates and that products
from firms with the largest market shares face a greater risk of being withdrawn. The first result
is theorized to depend on the unpredictable nature of consumer demand, where firms gradually
learn about preferences over time (Jovanovic, 1982). The second result may be product market
specific. Results may be attributed to large beer producers trying to squeeze out smaller
producers by repeatedly releasing (and withdrawing) new products (Schmalensee, 1978).
Interestingly, Asplund and Sandin (1999) could not reject the hypothesis of a constant hazard
over time implying an exponential duration distribution.
The Present Study
The data for the present study involved 37 variables conceived by the IAP to be success
factors for new products. Most of these variables have been investigated previously. In fact, the
variables included in the original instrument were derived by Udell (for an overview see Udell,
1989) based on research in the early 1970s that was current when the original IAP instrument
was constructed. Appendix A lists the 37 variables.
Approximately half of the members of this set of variables are labeled in Appendix A as

<-----Page 8----->Survival of Innovations 5

"market" factors. Several of these variables, in the subcategory of "demand," are straight from
the economics literature (e.g., Mansfield 1968) and involve factors known to affect the diffusion
of innovations (size of market, growth of demand, duration of demand, demand predictability,
product line potential).
The greater the demand, demand growth and duration of demand, the greater the sales
opportunities and thus prospects for remaining profitable in the market. Uncertainty of demand
and product line potential also could play a role in determining survival. Given stochastic
demand and a fixed cost in each period (for example debt repayments), then the greater the
demand uncertainty, the greater the probability that demand will not be able to support the fixed
costs in any given time period (thus the shorter the duration of survival). Also, if demand
fluctuates from year to year for any given product line, then the greater the variety of product
lines, the lower the probability that a significant drop in demand for a single product line will
cause an inventor to discontinue sales of the innovation altogether. That is, greater applicability
across a variety of products or services provides for risk spreading and reduces the hazard of exit
due to random market events. Note that the uncertainty of demand and product line potential
does not necessarily affect the probability of commercialization unless one assumes the decisionmaker to be risk averse. These factors may therefore have a differential impact on innovation
survival compared to invention commercialization and the differential impact depends on risk
preferences.
The “acceptability” factors are derived from research on the psychology/sociology of
innovation adoption (Rogers 1995) (need, societal benefits, compatibility, learning, visibility,
appearance, comparative functionality, and durability). While these were conceptualized to
condition the adoption decision of individuals, they may also affect the duration of innovations’
survival. If adopters’ decisions are distributed over time, the greater acceptability will increase
the probability of adoption at any point in time thus increasing the sales also in later years,
marginally increasing survival.
The industrial organization literature predicts that industry structure (existing competition,
new competition) affects price and thus profits (Scherer and Ross 1999). Also relevant to price

<-----Page 9----->Survival of Innovations 6

and competition is protection (through patents, trade secrets etc.), which indicates the degree to
which the inventor can capture monopolistic rents (Cohen, 1995). Higher profits, either through
industry structure, price or IP protection would lead to longer survival duration.
Innovations arrive in the marketplace with different technical solutions, and producers only
learn over time consumers’ preferences (Jovanovic 1982). Inferior, or less developed, products
may be released on the market, but once released have greater likelihood of being discontinued
in each successive time period as better solutions attract higher demand. It would thus seem
reasonable that the technical factors (technical feasibility, functional performance, research and
development, technology significance) and the production factor “technology of production”
would affect survival. Further, a lower absolute investment for entry should lead to a higher
probability of exit (Åstebro and Simons, 2003). A lower absolute investment for entry means
there are more marginal inventors entering, inventors who would be the first to exit. Note that the
effect of the size of the initial investment is proposed to be negative on commercialization but
positive on survival duration (Åstebro and Simons, 2003).
Several product variables available in the data, such as expected safety and environmental
impact, were included in our analyses even though they may not have much variation. For
example, the rate of severe safety problems—sufficient to affect survival—may be too low in
order to detect their effects in research like ours.
One further reason to expect different predictors of survival as compared to
commercialization is that the range of variables drops when products with less favorable values
are kept off the market, and the remaining products then survive with varying durations. For the
same reasons then, finding significant predictors for survival might be more difficult than finding
predictors of successful commercialization.
Method
Data Collection Procedure
The sample frame for survival analysis consisted of all valid records of inventions
submitted to the IAP for evaluation during 1989 to 1993. We used identifying information in
these records to conduct a telephone survey of the inventors, obtaining 561 usable telephone

<-----Page 10----->Survival of Innovations 7

survey responses for an adjusted response rate of 75%. For background demographics data and
tests for sample selection bias, please see Åstebro and Gerchak (2001). Out of the 561
inventions, 50 had been brought to market according to interviews. Three inventors could not
recall the entry or exit date, leaving 47 inventions for use in survival analysis. The chance of
commercialization is therefore approximately 50/561=0.09. Correcting for sampling plan and
conducting sensitivity analysis, the probability of commercialization varies between 0.05 and
0.11 with a standard error of 0.007 (Åstebro 1998; Åstebro and Bernhardt, 1999; Åstebro and
Gerchak, 2001). This rate differs from Griffin (1997), who found the probability of
commercialization of new ideas to be approximately 0.25 among PDMA member firms.
Mansfield et al. (1971) arrive at a similar estimate for large established firms.
The 47 inventions reaching the market represent the sample on which we conduct the
survival regression analysis. Many of the inventions reviewed by the CIC are consumer-oriented
(47%).

Other fall into a variety of other categories, including high-technology (6%) and

industrial equipment (6%).
The sampled record for each invention included ratings for each of the 37 early stage
characteristics (Appendix A) on which analysts at the IAP evaluate product ideas. Data on the
independent variables were consequently collected before outcomes were observed and
independently of this study. We therefore avoid methods or hindsight bias.
Evaluations of the 37 criteria by the IAP experts were made on a three-point linguistic
scale ("acceptable," "borderline," and "critical weakness"). We transformed these into numeric
values with equal distance between the scores.
To alleviate concerns about inter-rater reliability, it is noted that the IAP employed the
same chief evaluator during the sampling period. Further, all IAP analysts were trained in the
procedure by the chief evaluator. The initial training took two days, and close supervision was
required for an additional fortnight. Baker and Albaum (1986) test the reliability of the
instrument across 86 judges and six products and find Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.84 to
0.96.

<-----Page 11----->Survival of Innovations 8

Results
Consistent with the recommendation in Henard and Szymanski (2001) to use multi-item
scales in product development research, our first task is to organize the set of 37 criteria into
subsets that can form composite variables, using empirical methods.
Formation of Composite Variables Describing Commercial Potential of Innovations
Rationale for using an empirical approach
The IAP's list of 37 criteria was developed with several purposes in mind. One is to
provide specific feedback to inventors about any shortcomings of products (technical, usability,
etc.) in case these could be addressed by additional development efforts. Another is to assess
overall likelihood of product success, which might lead either to dissuading inventors with a
poor prognosis, or enhancing the prospect of continuing product development and obtaining
funding for inventions judged very favorably.
While the original criteria were derived based on scientific research, the a priori grouping
of the criteria by the IAP appears to be somewhat arbitrary. For example, although the 37
criteria are organized into 4 overarching categories (technical, production, market, and risk
factors), some criteria in different categories seem likely to co-vary substantially (e.g., tooling
cost required to meet expected demand—classified as a “production” factor, and whether the
likely size of required investment was likely to be obtainable—a “risk” factor). Also, within
each category there appear to be quite separate subcategories, or “constructs” in the language of
scientific research. For example, “risk” factors included legal concerns (e.g. product liability
potential), dependence of the product on other products/systems, and direct financial risks.
Consequently we need to identify and use an exploratory method of data analysis that
would distinguish research-appropriate constructs and their indicators in these data. In particular
we seek to identify homogeneous subsets of criteria that can be combined to form readily
interpretable composite variables. In addition, it is necessary that these combinations be distinct
from one another, to reduce the problems that arise in predictive analyses when predictors are
overlapping.

<-----Page 12----->Survival of Innovations 9

Implementing a method of construct identification
Gorsuch (1983) notes that some investigators (e.g., Cureton et al. 1970) have combined
factor analysis with cluster analysis to improve detection of constructs when measures have not
been refined a priori to provide simple structure. In this two-stage procedure, correlations among
variables ultimately determine the inferred structure and scheme for combining measured
variables into composite variables. However, by first representing correlations in terms of
orthogonal factors1 (in a matrix of common factor loadings), it becomes possible to calculate a
matrix of the distances of measured variables from one another in the orthogonal-dimension
space described by the factors. Such a matrix of distances is necessary for the second stage of
analysis, cluster analysis.
In the clustering stage, measured variables (say, X1 and X2) are placed with one another in
a cluster to the extent that they correlate with variables in a similar pattern (e.g., X1 and X2 both
correlate highly with X3 and X4 but not with X5 and X6). As noted by Tryon and Bailey (1970),
this basis for forming composite variables2 corresponds very well with the concept of a
construct, for example, as discussed in Campbell and Fiske (1959).
Interpreting and using findings to form primary composite variables
Findings from the cluster analysis, which was performed on all 561 observations, are
presented as the "dendrogram" in Figure 1. The dendrogram is the pattern of lines connecting
the 37 criteria to one another in a branching, tree-like structure. When measured variables
appear near one another in the list in the left-hand part of the figure, and when they are seen to be
connected most directly by lines in the right-hand part, they are the ones most similar to one
another in how they correlated with other variables. Such similar variables thus are inferred to
be co-indicators of a construct.
[Insert Figure 1 about here]
We emphasize that this branching structure is fully empirical in nature; it is not a
representation of how we thought the items should join. Our judgment came into play in
labeling the divisions implied by branching structure. For our primary scheme for forming
composites, we divided the structure into the 14 clusters indicated in the column of Figure 1 that

<-----Page 13----->Survival of Innovations 10

gives each measured variable's cluster number ("Clu. num." column). One consideration in
arriving at 14 clusters was the fact that it takes approximately 14 groupings to divide 37
measured variables into groups with 2 or 3 indicators—and the wide range of content of the 37
variables implies there can only be a few indicators of each construct. In addition, although not
definitive, a Chi-square test of residual correlations after factoring pointed to the existence of 14
factors.
Most importantly, the 14 clusters are quite interpretable.

For example, Cluster 1 is

concerned with anticipated profit for the producer of the product. Cluster 2 involves price but
also investment costs for the producer, which is a complication that we will address. As a final
example, Cluster 3 concerns various marketing and sales costs for the producer. We will discuss
the nature of other clusters later in instances where they predict survival.
Thus, we calculate a set of 14 composite variables according to the cluster numbering
scheme in Figure 1. For example, the composite corresponding to cluster 1 was formed by
averaging ratings on Payback Period, Profitability, and Potential Sales. Table 1 shows the
Pearson correlations among the resulting composite variables. None of these correlations is high
enough to jeopardize inferences from using these variables in regression.
[ Insert Table 1 about here]
Regression
Given these potential predictors, the further task is to regress the dependent variable,
survival, on the composite variables while controlling for right censoring. A proportional hazard
model specification is used (Table 2). We use maximum likelihood estimation of a parametric
survival-time model of the general form:
h(tj)=ho(t)g(xj)
where ho(t) is the baseline hazard function, parametrized as e
distribution λ = e
g(xj)= e

x jβ

x jβ

−λ jt j

with the exponential survival

, and g(xj) is a nonnegative function of the covariates, here specified as

. We report unexponentiated coefficients, i.e. the β’s, and leave out reporting the

estimate of the baseline hazard, which is uninformative. The likelihood function is further
adjusted by adding a branch for those observations that are right censored at time τ, estimating

<-----Page 14----->Survival of Innovations 11

the probability of censoring given survival until time τ. The dependent variable is the probability
of failing in each time period, conditional on surviving until that time, and the independent
variables (covariates) are the fourteen clusters identified in Figure 1. Higher values on the
predictor variables indicate more favorable assessments by the IAP. Under the proportional
hazard model, a negative regression coefficient means that an increase in the predictor decreases
the probability of exit. Thus, significant negative coefficients point to predictors of longer
survival.
[ Insert Table 2 about here]
Findings from this regression analysis are presented in Table 2. Near the bottom of the
table we provide a test of overall model fit, a likelihood ratio test yielding a chi-square value of
25.45, which is significant at the 0.05 level. This test is analogous to a multiple d.f. test for
overall R-squared in a conventional regression model for continuous outcome data. Thus our
test indicates that there is some significant prediction of survival overall from these predictors
(despite the relatively small ratio of variables to cases and the resultant risk of over-fitting the
data). Not shown in the table is the implication of this model of an estimated baseline hazard
pointing to a constant probability of exit of 0.09 in each year.
Turning to the coefficients and statistical tests for individual predictor variables, we first
see that a significant (p<0.01) and positive (inverse) effect is obtained for "Entry cost and Price”.
“Technical product maturity” and “Demand certainty” have negative significant effects (p<0.05),
and “Competition” has a negative and near-significant effect (p<0.10).
"Entry cost and Price” combines three criteria: Price, Tooling cost, and Size of investment.
The positive association between price and exit probability is understandable because a higher
price is reflected by a lower (not higher) rating by the IAP. Analysts at the IAP rated lower price
as more favorable (higher ratings) as, according to them, it would make the product more
attractive to purchasers. However, we find that higher price is more favorable to survival. The
result lends support to the idea that price is exogenously determined. That is, prices are typically
determined by choice of product/industry, and are relatively fixed once entering competition
(Jovanovic, 1982). In this interpretation we are assuming that the inventors who bring their

<-----Page 15----->Survival of Innovations 12

products to market do, in fact, price their products higher when IAP evaluators indicate that the
price would have to be relatively high. That is, it should be kept in mind that this prediction
involving price and survival, like all other predictions here, is based on an evaluation before
product launch as it predicts later survival.
However, "Entry cost and Price” includes two indicators of the investment cost that
contaminates our ability to interpret the effect of price alone. Additional regression analysis
(proportional hazard) was therefore conducted where the effect of price is separated from the two
measures of investment cost. This regression shows price to have an independent positive and
significant coefficient value at 4.29 (p<0.05), supporting the previous interpretation, while the
average score of tooling cost and size of investment also has a positive and significant coefficient
value at 3.18 (p<0.05). A more favorable rating by the IAP of the size of investment, reflecting a
lower absolute investment, results in a higher probability of exit. The IAP considers a smaller
investment more favorable because an entrepreneur “does not have to take as large a risk”.
However, in terms of survival a lower absolute investment reflects a lower entry barrier and
therefore a greater probability to exit which appears to be due to the entry of greater numbers of
marginal innovations.
The next composite variable that predicts survival is labeled “Technical product maturity.”
It consists of the items “technical feasibility”, “functional performance,” “research and
development,” and “development risk.” High values on these variables at the time of IAP
evaluation imply that the invention is in a relatively advanced state of development.
The statistically significant composite variable “Demand Certainty” consists of two
criteria: “demand predictability,” and the breadth of products and services that the innovation
lends itself to—“product line potential”. A high rating of demand predictability suggests that the
innovation faces stable demand, rather than a highly fluctuating demand. The more stable the
estimated future demand, the longer the predicted survival. This result becomes most
understandable by assuming stochastic demand and a fixed cost in each period. A high rating on
product line potential, on the other hand, suggests that the innovation appears to lend itself to a
variety of products or services and this rating is also associated with greater sales longevity.

<-----Page 16----->Survival of Innovations 13

Again, a simple and analogous probabilistic argument can explain this result.

If demand

fluctuates from year to year for any given product line, then the greater the variety of product
lines the lower the probability that a significant drop in demand for a single product line will
cause an inventor to discontinue sales of the innovation altogether. That is, greater applicability
across a variety of products or services provides for risk spreading and reduces the hazard of exit
due to random events.
The composite variable “Competition” consists of items describing both competition from
established firms and the probability that there will be imitators entering one's market. Its effect
is in the predicted direction but is only marginally significant, in only one of two models.
Finally, to examine the robustness of results, an accelerated failure time model with an
exponential duration distribution also was estimated (not reported). Results are entirely
consistent with the proportional hazard model, except that “Competition” does not have a robust
effect across the two model specifications.3
Discussion
It is of interest to learn which characteristics predict, at an early stage, the duration of an
innovation’s length of sales, because this duration is important to the financial success of new
products. New products expected to live longer in the market are expected to return greater
profits, all else equal. Past research (Mansfield et al., 1977) indicates that managers can inform
their expectations by undertaking systematic evaluations of innovations at an early stage of
development.
We study the duration of sales of new and innovative product projects undertaken by
inventors/entrepreneurs. Although their projects are between four to eight times less likely to
reach the market compared to new products developed in established organizations (Mansfield et
al. 1971, Griffin 1997, Åstebro 1998), making generalizability to such products uncertain, we
note that commercially- and culturally-significant innovations often do come from "garage"based development efforts. Arguably, the original Apple computer is one example (Halliday,
1983). The pull-top beverage can is another (Dalton, 2003); the modern brassiere, yet another
(Levins, 1996).

<-----Page 17----->Survival of Innovations 14

Our results are not dissimilar to what would be expected from a study of the survival of
new products developed by established organizations. New products that are technically and
functionally sound (signaled here by the technical product maturity predictor), that compete in
industries with higher price (generating greater profits), and that face less intense competition are
more likely to survive longer. The results are analogous to those of the meta-analysis by Henard
and Szymanski (2001) in that the dimensions of product advantage and competitive response
appear in both. The differences may be more interesting and are discussed further as primarily a
function of the focus on new product survival, rather than due to the focus on independent
inventors and expert ratings.
If the entrepreneur has entered a market partly unaware that competitive conditions are as
severe as they appear after entry, those who entered paying a lower fixed entry cost and facing
higher demand uncertainty would be more likely to exit. This interpretation of our findings
meshes with Jovanovic’s theory (1982) which assumes that entrepreneurs have only a vague idea
about industry competitive conditions when entering and learn most about it after entry. It is to
be noted that lower cost of entry is likely to induce higher probability of entry while, as shown, it
also induces a higher probability of exit. Our idea of focusing on a single well-defined outcome
variable, the length of survival, is shown to bear fruit. If one had examined the impact on
“overall success”—mixing up the two outcomes—the differential effects of the investment cost
on entry and exit probabilities might have washed out. It is further not clear that demand
uncertainty and product line potential play any role in determining commercialization success.
We, however, showed these variables both theoretically and empirically to determine the
survival of innovations.
We also find higher “technical product maturity” to lead to longer survival duration. Our
interpretation is that development shortcomings carry through beyond product launch, such that
products launched before major development issues have been worked out encounter various
difficulties implied in the items of this cluster (cf., Jovanovic, 1982). These difficulties include
inadequate "functional performance" for the customer and a potentially wide range of problems
(e.g., product reliability, manufacturability) implied in the remaining items in this cluster. The

<-----Page 18----->Survival of Innovations 15

concept of product quality (e.g. Garvin 1988) captures many of these risks for products that are
less developed.
Our focus on survival contributes much needed conceptual and managerial clarity to the
study of new product development. We found that for the typical invention the probability of
exiting the market in each year is approximately 0.09. Three variables were found to
significantly shift this mean probability of exit up or down and these three are possible to assess
at an early stage of the inventions’ development. With estimates of these variables plugged in to
the described survival model, one can compute the expected survival time for a specific
invention and use this and other information to compute the expected return of an invention.
Gerchak and Åstebro (2000) provide formulas to plug numbers into.
The basic task in this research was to learn about innovation survival from secondary
analysis of an unusual and promising data base. However, it should be recognized that the data
were not originally intended for factor/cluster analysis and formal or statistical predictive
analysis. On the one hand, the small number of indicators for each composite variable was far
from ideal for power or stability of prediction. On the other hand, three of these composite
variables proved to be significant predictors of survival. In addition, there was substantial
collinearity in the raw data, suggesting the usefulness of cluster analysis to combine variables to
reduce collinearity. Moreover, the analysis resulted in composite variables that did not deviate a
great deal from the conceptual schema of the IAP and that were quite interpretable. In sum, we
judged the predictive variables to be good enough on the whole, although better measures
certainly should be sought for future research.
A potentially problematic issue is that the purpose of the early stage evaluation is to
provide the potential entrepreneur with advice on whether and how to continue R&D efforts,
rather than predicting the probability of survival. In other words, the ratings for the explanatory
variables for a specific invention may not stay the same after the evaluation if the
inventor/entrepreneur makes efforts to improve some of the characteristics according to the
advice provided by the IAP. If entrepreneurs work towards correcting problems identified by the
IAP and then succeed in launching products then the explanatory power of the original criteria

<-----Page 19----->Survival of Innovations 16

are biased downwards. In addition, the sample used for predicting survival was fairly small, 47
observations, leading to low statistical power. Finally, one should notice that the evaluation was
done well ahead of market launch.
Given these limitations, it is impressive that several IAP criteria did predict survival
individually, and that the set of criteria collectively provided statistically significant prediction of
survival (according to the likelihood ratio test, as reported in Table 2). Holding the pattern of
findings at arm's length, we see distinct kinds of composite variables that did not provide any
significant prediction, and other kinds that sometimes did. A seemingly key variable that did not
provide prediction was one involving profit quite directly (cluster 1). This variable was of a
summary or integrative-judgmental nature, and its failure to predict is consistent with literature
concerning superiority of statistical over subjective integration and prediction (Dawes et al.,
1989). For predictive purposes, at least, it appears that it is best to use component or attribute
ratings that go into such summary judgments, instead of the summary judgments themselves.
Another kind of variable that did not predict survival concerned risks such as product liability or
windfalls as when a product spawns unusual societal benefit. Although variables of this kind
may affect survival, we suspect that the rate is too low for detection of effects in a relatively
small sample like ours.
Many would-be entrepreneurs probably will find most surprising the lack of findings for
some of the composite variables that concern Market Factors, particularly Need, Potential
Market, Visibility of product advantages, and Comparative Functionality. We reiterate that this
result might be due to our focus on product survival. The variables may still be determinants of
the probability of entry, and/or the yearly profit rate conditional on entry. [See Åstebro
(forthcoming) for an analysis of determinants of the probability of entry.] Evidently, "building a
better mousetrap" in these respects is not enough for product survival. The innovation should (a)
face stable demand, (b) be saleable at a price sufficient for profit, and (c) undergo development
before product launch to an extent likely to promote product quality on a variety of dimensions.
These are, of course, business considerations of the kind that the IAP was designed to bring to
inventors' attention.

What can other researchers learn from this study for future research? It is certainly possible
and of interest to replicate this study’s design using other samples. What seem to be critical
ingredients are: a) a large sample of projects, b) project screening criteria measured at an early
stage, c) a clear outcome variable. Future researchers and early-stage evaluators may also benefit
from considering the empirical scheme (Figure 1) derived for this study, which groups and
distinguishes many important product evaluation variables. The previous dominant research
design of post-outcome mail surveys with fuzzy or no definition of the outcome variable should
be avoided.

FOOTNOTES
1 We used principal axis factoring as the method of factor extraction, retaining the 10

factors with eigenvalues above 1. No rotation of factors was used because the clustering method
yields invariant findings as long as factors remain orthogonal. Input data were the 37 ratings on
all inventions evaluated by the IAP in the study period, including those not brought to market
(thus allowing a favorable ratio of cases to variables and maintaining relevant variability in the
data).
2 Hierarchical clustering by the diameter (or furthest neighbor) method was performed on a

proximity matrix calculated among variables (rows) in the factor matrix. The proximity of any
variable pair (x, y) was a cosine calculated as
3

∑ (x y )
i

(∑

).

We also experimented with other survival functions that did not constrain the hazard to

be constant over time. Additional parameters reflecting non-constant hazards over time were not
significant, supporting the use of the exponential duration distribution. Detailed results are
available from the corresponding author on request. Also see Gerchak and Åstebro (2000).
