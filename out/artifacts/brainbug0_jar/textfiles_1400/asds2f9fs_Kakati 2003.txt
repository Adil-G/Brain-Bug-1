Abstract
This paper seeks to identify the criteria that influence the performance of high-tech new ventures. Twenty-seven venture capitalists
who experienced both failure and success in high-tech ventures were asked to rate one of their most successful ventures and one
of the least successful or failed ventures on 38 criteria identified under six groups: entrepreneur quality, resource-based capability,
competitive strategy, product characteristics, market characteristics and financial criteria. The venture capitalists were subsequently
interviewed to overcome biased or forced results and to know more about success criteria.
The study reveals that entrepreneur quality, resource-based capability, and competitive strategy are the critical determinants of
the firm’s viability and achievement. It is seen from cluster analysis that successful entrepreneurs develop multiple resource-based
capabilities to backup multiple-strategies to push their products through market. Furthermore, it is concluded that it is not the unique
products relative to competitors that brings success rather it is the firm’s ability to meet the unique requirements of customers that
bring success.

1. Introduction
Several studies (Tyebjee and Bruno, 1984; MacMillan
et al., 1985; Knight, 1986) have identified criteria that
are used by the venture capitalists to evaluate venture
proposals. MacMillan et al. (1987) addressed whether
these criteria are actually helpful in distinguishing successful from unsuccessful ventures. They (MacMillan et
al., 1987) tested 25 criteria covering four areas: entrepreneur characteristics, product characteristics, market
characteristics and financial consideration. Even though
their results were significant and interesting, the relatively low explanatory power of their model indicates
that new venture performance stems from forces not
included or adequately captured by their measures. Stuart and Abetti (1987) and Maidique (1985) have studied
the success factors in high-tech industries. Though their
regression models have relatively high explanatory
power, their studies ignored two important influencers
of new venture performance-competitive strategy and
resource-based capability of the new ventures. The

recent studies (Chandler and Hanks, 1994; Mahoney and
Pandian, 1992; Kakati, 1999) argue that the new venture
performance stems among others from multiple strategies, market attractiveness and resource-based capabilities. Their findings are based on the studies on lowtech new ventures and, therefore, may or may not be
generalizable to new high-tech ventures. Hence, it seems
a useful exercise to conduct a study on factors contributing to success of high-tech using both the old and new
criteria. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine
the extent to which success criteria identified in the past
and recent studies and by venture capitalists are useful
predictors of performance of new ventures in the hightech industries.
2. Research design
We contacted 43 venture capitalists that are financing
high-tech industries and experienced both success and
failure. Out of which 27 participated in the exercise. The
reason for selecting venture capitalists as respondents is
that they have experienced both success and failure, and
hence clearly see the differences between success and
failed ventures. Furthermore, since, they participated in
the venture development process since inception, they

have strong insight into the working of the ventures they
financed. Most of the participated venture capitalists
have ⬎50% foreign equity holdings and have their operations in India and South-East Asian Countries. Their
mode of financing is equity participation with
expected/realized portfolio returns of 30–200%. The
usual process of venture evaluation is the investigations
of the proposal using some of the criteria taken in the
study and the IRR, NPV, Break-even Analysis and Sensitivity Analysis. The size of the venture capitalist team
varies from five to 11 with the CEO heading the team.
The team includes at least one legal expert and others
with industry experts. They specialize by industry and
finance only high-tech industries: computer software, IT,
pharmaceutical, medical equipments, bio-technology,
telecom and data communication, industrial products and
machinery (CNC, Sensor, process control, machine
vision, instrumentation, pollution and recycling related).
The failed and successful ventures reported here belong
to these industries.
We followed the methodology of MacMillan et al.
(1987) but included 38 criteria under six groups: four
groups of MacMillan et al. plus resource-based capability and competitive strategy of the ventures. Our study
considered four broad criteria under resource-based
capability: managerial capability (problem solving,
decision making, employee retention, managing collaboration and networking etc.), technical capability
(technology, technical expertise, expertise in product
development), marketing capability (expertise in customer service, adaptability to market dynamics, marketing expertise, distribution logistic), and input sourcing
capability (access to low cost of capital, raw material,
and skilled labor). The study also tested four competitive
strategies: cost strategy (emphasis on cost reduction in
all facets of operations, process innovation to reduce
cost, and improve productivity), quality strategy
(emphasis on producing error free product and offering
superior products to customer), innovation strategy
(emphasis on product innovation, innovation in marketing techniques, packaging etc.), and customization strategy (emphasis on meeting unique customer requirement
and tastes).
We develop two sets of questions, identical except for
their instructions — the first asked the respondent to rate
one of the most successful ventures they have funded
and the second asked for a rating of one of the least
successful ventures they have funded. We insisted that
the chosen ventures registered failure or success within
eight years of their operations. An 8 year time horizon
was chosen to define a new venture (Biggadike, 1979).
In both cases, a five-point scale was used: 1, highly
dissatisfactory/disagree; 2, marginally dissatisfactory/
disagree; 3, ‘neither’ satisfactory nor dissatisfactory; 4,
marginally satisfactory/agree; 5, highly satisfactory/
agree. We were concerned that respondents would tend

to overrate successful ventures and underrate unsuccessful ventures. It was felt that such upward and downward
biases would ‘force’ the results. Hence, we interviewed
the respondents with special emphasis on those criteria,
which are rated very high or very low and adjusted the
rating where necessary.
Success was defined as the achievement of something
desired, planned or attempted (Maidique and Zirger,
1985; MacMillan et al., 1987). We asked the venture
capitalists to assess the venture performance on seven
performance variables [sales, market share, marketing
costs, production costs, general and administrative cost,
profit and return on investment (ROI)] against their
expectations using five-point scale (1, significantly
worse than expectation; 2, marginally worse than expectation; 3, achieved expectation; 4, marginally better than
expectation; 5, much better than expectation). MacMillan et al. also used the same measures in their study.
Most of the new venture researches have focused on
ROI as a measure of new venture performance
(Sandberg, 1986), despite the pitfalls of using ROI (i.e.
the firms would not be expected to achieve break-even
within the first few years and ROI is sensitive to
accounting practices). Tsai et al. (1991) advocate market
share gain as the best measure of new venture performance as market share gain measures the market acceptance of the new firm’s product. This measure may be
problematic for pioneering ventures, as they would
initially have 100% of the market, only to have this
reduced as new firms entered (Miller et al., 1988). The
annual level of sales is also another popular measure of
performance of new ventures (Doutriaux, 1992; Brush
and Vander Werf, 1992) because of being readily available, easy to measure and non-confidential. In this study,
multiple performance criteria were used to overcome the
deficiency of using a single criterion.
3. Results
Table 1 provides the mean score of the successful and
unsuccessful ventures, and significance difference
between mean using the t-test (t-distribution). Out of 38
criteria, the successful venture score significantly higher
than unsuccessful in 21 criteria implying that a host of
factor together influences the success or failure of a new
venture. That means incorporation of limited criteria in
the venture performance study or in the evaluation of a
venture may overlook important aspects of a venture.
Furthermore, the successful ventures are found to differ
in nine criteria relating to the characteristics of
entrepreneurs out of 13 criteria considered in the study.
It indicates that the role of entrepreneurial characteristics
in the venture success cannot simply be discounted, reinforcing the venture capitalists’ strong belief in the importance of the entrepreneurs’ quality in the new venture
performance.

Major difference between successful and unsuccessful
ventures was noticed in the case of eight criteria, four
of them related to resource-based capability and another
four of them to venture competitive strategy. These criteria were either ignored or given less focus/important by
the previous researchers on venture capitalists’ decision
criteria and new venture success criteria.
Unlike the previous three categories of characteristics,
the product characteristics do not appear to be as critical
as it was thought to be. Product uniqueness (which
depends on R&D intensity) was shown not be a significant factor in determining initial success, despite the
tendency of high-tech firm to emphasize R&D and technological excellence. Once the product is designed and
developed up to a functioning prototype and enjoys some
protection, it appears that further R&D intensity to make
it an unique product is not necessary for initial success.
The findings support the previous study of Stuart and
Abetti (1987) on the high-tech new ventures, where R&
D intensity showed up negative relationship with initial
venture success.
The significant difference was also not seen in the case
of most of the market related criteria. Out of the seven
criteria considered here, difference was seen in only two
criteria: market growth rate and stimulating existing
market. It appears that one can achieve initial success
more easily and rapidly in the growing market and by
stimulating existing market instead of creating a new
market. All other criteria within this category appear to
have insignificant influence on the venture performance.
No significant difference between successful and
unsuccessful venture was seen in respect of financial
considerations. That means financial consideration itself
is not important determinant of venture success but if
the right entrepreneur, right strategy and right product
are chosen and right capability is developed, return will
follow. The finding supports the practice of many venture capitalists that do not consider financial aspects in
the proposal screening stage but try to capture risk/return
potentials through several of other criteria examined
by them.
The above findings must be interpreted cautiously for
two reasons. Firstly, though we have interviewed the
venture capitalists, there is still some possibility that they
may overrate the successful one and underrate the unsuccessful one. Secondly but most importantly, the study
found 17 insignificant criteria. It does not mean that all
of them are unimportant. Some of them may be
important in that sense that their absence may cause serious problem to the venture success. Hence, it is desirable
to classify criteria into two- winning criteria and qualifying criteria. The winning criteria are those, which
directly and significantly contribute to winning business.
Raising performance in winning criteria will either result
in more business or improve the chances of gaining more
business. All the significant criteria in Table 1 may be

called winning criteria. Qualifying criteria may not the
major determinants of success, but important in another
way. Any reduction in the performance of qualifying criteria will be particularly serious if it drops below the
critical level. Once above the critical level, further
improvement in qualifying criteria is unlikely to contribute much to the success. Some criteria (desire for success, courage, uniqueness of products), appear to be
qualifying criteria. Both the successful and unsuccessful
ventures score high in these variables. High score perhaps is not helping the failed ventures to be successful
but poor performance could have drifted the successful
ventures into a trouble.
The above grouping was based on the performance of
the ventures, not on the chosen criteria. We now want
to do the reverse, first to group ventures having similar
profiles across the criteria chosen and then to see the
performance of each group. That will provide us insight
on whether there are particular profiles of ventures with
similar characteristics, and how the pattern or profile
influences venture performance. Some of the successful
and unsuccessful ventures may share similar pattern.
MacMillan et al. also noticed that each of their classes
of successes has a look-like class of failures that are very
similar except some flaws. We want to see how many
failed and successful ventures show similar pattern, and
how many of them show distinct pattern. We chose cluster analysis to do so.
3.1. Cluster analysis
A two-step cluster analysis technique was used. In the
first step, a hierarchical agglomerative method was used
to determine appropriate number of cluster. Ward’s
minimum variance method was used to determine the
cluster linkage. All solutions between two and ten were
investigated and finally three-cluster solution was used
to group ventures having similar profiles across the criteria chosen. Several criteria guided the choice of three
cluster solution:
1. three cluster solution generate solution in which the
ventures had a relatively even distribution among
the clusters;
2. highest flattening in the dendogram when three cluster
solution was used; and
3. the clusters were better and well separated based on
the Euclidian distances from their centers when three
cluster solution was used.
From this preliminary analysis, the centroids associated
with the three-cluster solution were then used in the
second step as initial starting values in an ‘iterative partitioning analysis’ (using Spss Quick Cluster) for the
final solution. Table 2 shows the result of cluster analysis
along with mean cluster scores. In order to allocate a

descriptive label to each of the three clusters, the cluster
mean for each criterion from the original data set was
compared to the respective global mean for that criterion. Interpretation and evaluation of the clusters was
done by identifying as key diagnostic criteria those with
group mean that differed by 1 SD from the global mean
calculated from the raw, untransformed data [as suggested by Birley and Westhead (1992)].

The first cluster consists of exclusively 20 failed ventures. The entrepreneurs of these ventures lack leadership quality and ability to evaluate and react to risk.
They, however, have the other desired qualities of an
entrepreneur (though in a modest scale) and that help
them to get qualified for first round of investment from
venture capitalists. One of the biggest flaws in this group
is that they have failed to gather resources to enhance

their capabilities (managerial, technical, marketing and
input sourcing) and to develop competitive strategies to
push their product through markets. The group has failed
to show strong emphasis on any of the strategy and to
stimulate the existing markets. The group has shown
very poor performance in respect of sales, market share,
profit and ROI
The second group of ventures comprises the 15 successful ventures and has opposite characteristic of the
first group of ventures. This group has exceptional
entrepreneurial quality — the venture team is creative
and gives attention to details. The team has ability to
articulate in the discussion and to evaluate and react to
risk well. The team has good leadership quality with
good track record. The most important aspect is that this
group has developed capability to gather resources and
to use them effectively. The presence of a diversified
management team, in which technological expertise is
balanced with other business skills and capabilities help
this group of ventures to achieve early success in their
new ventures. They also use multiple strategies in concert to stimulate existing and growing markets. Their
products enjoy protection. The products they have selected evolved over years and gained market acceptance.
Due to the above reasons, the group enjoys higher sales,
market share, profit and ROI.
The third group consists of 19 ventures out of which
12 are successful and seven are failure. In this group,
the successful and unsuccessful ventures share common
properties. In none of the criteria, the group scores
exceptionally high or low. The ventures of this group
occupy the middle position of first and second group
and are taking the high risk of being either successful
or unsuccessful.

3.2. Regression model
Several step-wise regression analyses were run to
determine those criteria that had significant betas for
each of the performance measures in the study. The
results are shown in Table 3. The relatively high R2
values indicate that the criteria selected in this study can
explain most of the variations in the performance measures. This is in contrast with other previous studies
where R2 was found to be low, probably due to exclusion
of two important sets of criteria- resource-based capability and competitive strategy.
As can be seen from Table 3, 54% of the variations in
the expected sales can be explained by the three criteria:
1. ability to evaluate and react to risk well;
2. protection of product; and
3. stimulating existing market.
The ventures, which surpass the venture capitalists’
expectation in sales are those that could protect their products from competitors’ attacks, who stimulate the existing markets and anticipate and are proactive to unforeseen events.
The venture enjoying high market share are those,
which could stimulate existing established markets
through customization strategy, i.e. offering products or
services tailoring to the needs of individual customers.
These two factors together explain 52% of the variations
of market shares of the ventures. It appears that stimulating established markets are essential condition for getting bigger cake (sales or market share) in the markets.
There is little difference between the successful and
unsuccessful ventures in respect of their performance in

marketing costs. Whatever difference is there, it is
influenced by the degree of customization. Those ventures, which have gone for mass markets eventually met
with high marketing costs. On the other hand, those
offered customized package to limited customers met
with low marketing costs.
As expected, technical capability influenced production cost significantly. Higher the level of technical
capability better is the performance of the venture in
respect of production costs. Surprisingly, customized
and nascent products help the ventures in reducing the
production costs. The very high R2 in this regression
model indicates that the production costs are relatively
easier to predict.
The reduction of general and administrative costs is
found in those ventures where venture team had given
attention to details. The size of the venture team and
their sustained intense efforts are found to depress ROI.
On the other hand, the ventures with better input sourcing capabilities and customization strategy could do better in respect of the ROI. Furthermore, more profits are
reported by those who could exploit existing markets
with customization strategy.

As can be seen from the regression table, there are
two criteria (customization strategy, stimulating existing
market) that predict venture performance across several
performance variables. The result suggests that at the
generic level the most desirable ventures are those for
which there is existing market and ventures concentrate
on specialized products in market segments where customization and high levels of customer service create
unique advantage or opportunity. It is evident that serving the customer well should be the utmost important to
new ventures.
3.3. Factor analysis
The responses were factor-analyzed to determine the
major groupings among criteria. An R-mode principal
components analysis (PCA), with a varimax rotation
(using Spss), was used to reduce the data. For the purpose of describing the underlying factor structure, the
‘eigenvalue-one criterion’ was used to determine the
number of components to extract for further analysis.
Using a conservative component loading of 0.4 as a cutoff for significance (Nunnally, 1978), none of the vari-

<-----Page 7----->454

ables loaded on more than one component. On the basis
of the component loadings, the nine factors extracted by
PCA were given descriptive names. Since the success of
the new venture depends on the effectiveness of managing risks of the ventures, the factors are patterned around
the concern for risk management. The results of the factor analysis are shown in Table 4.
Factor one loads on several attributes related to venture team general capability, their capability to gather
resource and to develop appropriate strategy. The factor

reflects a grouping of criteria around the ‘incapability
risk’ — the danger that the team will not be able to
develop capabilities required to succeed. This factor is
analogous to the ‘management risk’ factor identified by
previous researchers (MacMillan et al., 1985; Tyebjee
and Bruno’s study, 1984) except inclusion of many more
criteria from resource-based capability and competitive
strategies. This factor is the major factor explaining
37.9% of the total variance.
The next factor has been named as ‘inexperience risk’,

which captures the risk of initiating high-tech venture
without relevant track record and market knowledge.
The third factor reflects the risk arising out of product
features. In the case of novel or untried ideas, there is
a risk of whether the product can be produced and commercialized. Even technically elegant products may fail
to exploit the untapped market. Even if the market
accepts the product, there is risk that competitors may
incorporate the new features immediately due to the
absence of legal or artificial protection.
Furthermore, the initial success of the product may
invite new competitors to the industry. The venture capitalists may specialize by the industry and yet anticipating
such risk may be difficult. The factor four captures this
risk i.e. risk of being exposed to competition after initial
success and yet not being perceived even if venture capitalists and entrepreneurs have enough exposure to that
industry.
The next risk factor is the ‘entrepreneurial risk’ factor,
which arises due to dampening effort/personal attention
of the entrepreneur with the passage of time. Young,
innovative entrepreneurs may have bright ideas, but due
to lack of hard work, courage and sustained effort, they
may fail to implement their ideas successfully.
The next factor is named as market risk, which may
result from several factors such as non-acceptance of
products by customers, declining growth rate, failure to
stimulate existing market through innovative products
etc.
Non-access to the distribution facilities could also
bring risk to the new venture in general and specially to
the products for mass market. Absence of this facility
restricts geographical penetration and make marketing
the products very costly. The factor seven captures
this risk.
When both product and market are new, another risk
may arise due to uncertainty surrounding both the product and market. The product may not be developed to
the satisfaction of customers and the venture may fail to
develop the new market for the new product. This risk
we have named as ‘infancy risk’ or ‘implementation
risk’. A venture may be insulated from product failure
if the entrepreneur has already developed a prototype
and market for the product. The last factor is named as
‘investment risk’. A venture, which can be made easily
liquid and does not require subsequent investment is not
much exposed to the risk of loss of investment.
The factor analysis shows a moderate convergence
with findings of the previous studies. The management
risk, competitive exposure risk, inexperience risk was
found in MacMillan et al. (1985). Tyebjee and Bruno’s
study (1984) also discovered investment risk, management risk, competitive risk, implementation risk and
Pandey (1996) study discovered market risk, product
risk, and entrepreneurial risk. Of course, the criteria
grouped under various risk factors are not exactly same.

The foregoing discussion suggests that high-tech ventures are fraud with many risks and need to identify and
manage various sources of risk. Among them, the most
dangerous sources of risk appear to be ‘incapability risk’
(being highest number of significant criteria clubbed
under this risk). Though venture capitalists spends considerable time in assessing this risk, the subjective nature
of assessment of this risk creates immense problem for
them specially when the entrepreneur is a first generation
entrepreneur. Nevertheless, there is need for honing the
venture capitalists skills in assessing the capability of
entrepreneurs in gathering resources and developing
strategies appropriate for the market environment. Most
venture capitalist feels that product and market risk are
not prominent as they are specialists by industry. But
when both product and market is new, infancy risk cause
major concern.

4. Discussions and conclusions
Several interesting findings are observed from the
study as follows.
1. The study disagrees with some of the earlier
researchers (Sandberg and Hofer, 1987) who tend to
discount the role of the entrepreneur in favor of other
variables (such as resource-based capabilities, strategy and industry structures) in the success of a new
venture. Our mean analysis, cluster analysis and
regression model suggests that entrepreneurial quality
play as critical role as other variables in the success
of a new venture. In a start-up firm, it is the founders
that gather resources and develop strategies to use
them and to push the product through market. The
resources alone are not sufficient to achieve competitive advantages and above-average performance. For
them to occur, organization leadership must transform
resources into rent achieving capability. It is ultimately the entrepreneur quality that impact resourcebased capability and the strategy the firm select. They
are inter-related as evidence from the grouping of
many variables of resource-based capability, strategy
and entrepreneurial quality under the factor one in our
factor analysis.
2. The successful ventures appear to follow multiple patterns of strategic behavior, i.e. venture performance
is superior when two or more competitive strategies
are used in concert. The finding is remarkably consistent with the international evidence for new venture
performance (Sandberg, 1986; McDougall, 1989).
Among the four competitive strategies, customization
strategy (emphasis on meeting unique customer
requirement and tastes at shortest possible time)
appears to work best on most of the performance measures used in the study. This result contradicts the

<-----Page 9----->456

M. Kakati / Technovation 23 (2003) 447–457

findings of the similar study on low-tech new ventures
by Kakati, 1999, where it was found that customization strategy is least effective strategy in the lowtech new venture. In fact, the customization strategy
in the low-tech ventures has severely affected profitability, retarded growth and business volume. This
observation is intuitively plausible in that, relative to
low-tech industries, high-tech industries can charge
higher price premium for their unique and customized
offerings as the prospective consumers may not be as
cognizant of what constitutes a reasonable product
price and therefore, price may not be as important a
purchase criteria. In the low-tech industries the situation may be somewhat different. In low-tech industries consumers are frequently familiar with the product offerings and consequently, often have good
sense of what the product ‘should’ cost. Relatively
low prices give prospective consumers the impression
that they will be getting a bargain price and therefore,
firm cannot charge higher price even for unique and
customized products. Hence, the customization strategy is less effective in low-tech but more effective in
high-tech industries. Of course, data do not justify any
specific conclusions relating to the relative effectiveness of customization strategy in low-tech and hightech industries. Future research into this issue could
be very worthwhile.
3. Much has been debated on the appropriate choice of
strategies for a start-up firm. Some researchers support broad based strategies while entering growing
markets and focus strategy while entering mature
market. The other supports focus strategy in the early
stage of products. Though this issue was not directly
explored in our study, it tentatively suggests that
choice of strategy should be linked to resource-availability with the firm in addition to the industry structure. Our cluster analysis shows that the failed ventures could not develop capabilities to backup any
single strategy (lowest cluster scores in capability and
strategic variables), whereas most of the successful
ventures developed multiple resource-based capabilities to backup multiple-strategies (highest cluster
scores in both). Multiple strategies are the logical
choice provided the firm acquires multiple resources.
Of course, it is difficult for many new ventures to
develop multiple resources to effectively implement
and to capitalize on broad breadth strategies. They
(those with limited resources) should pursue
focus/customized strategy with specialized products
in market segments where customization and high
levels of customer service create unique advantage or
opportunity. Performance of a new venture is
enhanced when there is a fit between firm’s resources
and strategies (Chandler and Hanks, 1994).
4. It appears that the development of new technology or
product does not in itself guarantee commercial suc-

cess for firms operating in the high-tech industries.
The presence of diversified skills and capabilities, in
which technological expertise is balanced with business skills and capabilities in other areas such as marketing, input-sourcing, and general management, is
the key determinant of success in technology-based
start-ups. Furthermore, once the product is designed
and developed up to a prototype and enjoys some protection, over-emphasis on technological side of the
business or R&D efforts to make unique products
may not lead to success. Rather, there should be a
corporate transformation from a technology-driven to
a market-led enterprise, in which technical, marketing, input sourcing skills and capabilities should be
put together to produce products and services to meet
unique/customized requirements of customer. It is not
the unique product that is important for success. The
most important is the meeting the unique requirement
of customers. This is consistent with the view of some
authors (Roberts, 1991; Berry, 1996) who propose
that technology-based firms must undergo a transformation from a management philosophy of merely
identifying profitable commercial markets for the
company’s R&D output to one that is market-driven
with far tighter linkage being established between R&
D efforts and identified market opportunities. The
business must evolve from a primarily inward orientation focused upon technical inventiveness towards
an
outward
orientation
where
management/entrepreneur increasingly devotes its
attention to the needs of customers and the marketplace.
5. The relatively low explanatory power of the most of
the previous new venture performance models suggests that the venture performance stems from forces
not included in their studies. This study tried to use
many more variables in the analysis from the review
of past researches and from the interview of few venture capitalists. We, however, do not suggest that the
study represents a complete picture of new venture
performance. Neither can we claim that we exhausted
every variable that impacts venture performance, in
the administration of our questionnaire and interview.
However, we can suggest that the traditional new venture model (that have dominated the academic
research) must be extended to incorporate variables
related to entrepreneurs, resource-based capabilities,
strategies, industry/market structure, fit between
resource availability and strategies, between market
structure and strategies, and interactive effect of these
factors. Though some efforts have been made recently
[for example Chandler and Hanks (1994), the model
exploring all these factors is yet to be tested. Hence,
it may provide a fruitful stream of future research.
