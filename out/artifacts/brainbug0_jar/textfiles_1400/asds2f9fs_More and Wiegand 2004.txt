<-----Page 1----->Abstract
Business negotiation support systems (NSS) are slowly entering the market, although they lack a
clear theoretical basis as of yet. Negotiation is a complicated process with many aspects that have
only partially been described with the formal rigidity needed to build support systems. Most
theories about negotiation are descriptive and not prescriptive, which, among other things, prevents
their use as a basis for negotiation support systems. Complicating matters is that a negotiation
process consists of several distinct stages, each with its own characteristics. Furthermore, there are
many types of negotiations, depending on the domain. This suggests that we should not strive for
one general negotiation support system, but for a set of domain-specific tools. To ground the
development and application of these tools in different scenarios of use, we propose an integrated
theoretical framework. After giving an overview of existing negotiation support approaches, we
construct a business negotiation support metamodel for NSS analysis. The metamodel is illustrated
through analyzing the case of the MeMo project, which concerns contract negotiations in small and
medium enterprises in the European construction industry. The MeMo system is one of the first
business NSS with an explicit international orientation.
Keywords: business negotiation, negotiation support systems, metamodel, MeMo.

Electronic commerce is quickly transforming from hype into reality. Many popular e-commerce
applications have thus far focused on rather straightforward business-to-customer applications,
such as information kiosks and ordering portals, and simple electronic auctions, in which vendors
can offer consumer goods for sale and individual customers can bid on these goods.1 However, for
more complex forms of e-commerce, especially those in the business-to-business domain, more
extensive support is needed. In many cases, it is not sufficient merely to facilitate the selection of
business partners, retrieval of information profiles, ordering of products, or monitoring of order
status information. Also, oftentimes quite complex negotiations need to be conducted for a deal to
close. However, negotiation theory is still relatively young, and only a few applications have been
developed that provide the kind of support actually needed in practical business cases. If theory is
to progress and more adequate support systems for business negotiations are to be designed, then a
clear conceptual framework should be developed and applied to the analysis of real-world systems.
In Section 2 we survey some concepts that are important to the development of a theory on
business negotiation. In Section 3 we show how this process can be supported and give an
overview of some influential negotiation support systems. Based on our discussion of theoretical
concepts and practical support systems, we construct a business negotiation support metamodel. In
Section 4 we describe and analyze empirical findings from the MeMo system, which supports
complex business contract negotiations in relatively well-defined domains with many players. We
end the paper with some conclusions and directions for future research in Section 5.
2. Towards a Theory of Business Negotiation Support
A mature theory on business negotiation support does not yet exist. On the one hand, there are
several generic negotiation theories, drawing from such diverse fields as conflict resolution, game
and decision theory, and even cultural anthropology. Important contributions have been made by
Raiffa (1982) on decision-theoretic issues, Fisher and Ury (1981) on how to use win-win strategies,
and Mastenbroek (1989) on emotional aspects, among others. However, these theories do not
sufficiently meet the need for an applied business negotiation theory that can be used as a basis for
negotiation support systems (NSS). This need is becoming increasingly clear as research on ecommerce progresses. A comprehensive theory is needed, in which elements from these generic
negotiation theories are positioned in an integrated business framework. Robinson and Volkov
(1998) have examined this objective with their framework for supporting the negotiation life cycle.
Still, their work does not address important issues. We, therefore, will also refer to other theories
that offer additional ideas relevant to business negotiation support models, with the aim of
generating some high-level synthesis.
This paper presents only an initial outline of what such an integrated theory should look like. We
briefly describe some key concepts and explain their relevance to a theory of business negotiation.
First, we discuss the concept of negotiation itself. Then, we present several models of negotiation
that show different ways of looking at this process. We discuss the contents of the negotiation
process in more detail by examining negotiation stages, products, and roles. Finally, we consider
the role of negotiation protocols and patterns in supporting the negotiation process.

3

<-----Page 3----->2.1. Negotiation
There are numerous definitions of negotiation; we provide three characteristic examples. Gulliver
(1979: 79) defines negotiation as a process in the public domain in which two parties, with
supporters of various kinds, attempt to reach a joint decision on issues under dispute. Robinson and
Volkov (1998) view negotiation as a process in which participants bring their goals to a bargaining
table, strategically share information, and search for alternatives that are mutually beneficial.
According to Putnam and Roloff (1992), negotiation is a special form of communication that
centers on perceived incompatibilities and focuses on reaching mutually acceptable agreements.
Although these definitions differ in their details, they share some common elements: in negotiation
(1) there are two or more interdependent participants, (2) each of whom has some individual goals
that may be partially incompatible. In some form of (3) process, (4) alternatives are investigated
(5) with the purpose of agreeing upon one of them.
This definition is also applicable to business negotiation. We do not want to go as far as Gulliver,
who sees disputes as the driving force of negotiations. Rather, we are especially interested in the
kind of negotiations involving some form of mutual exchange of goods, services, and money. The
driving force behind these negotiations is a voluntary cooperation between two or more business
partners who would like to explore potential business opportunities that might result in a contract
explicitly formalizing mutual obligations. Note that this particular type of business negotiation
focuses on trade. Other kinds of business negotiations are conceivable, such as merger or labor
management negotiations. Sometimes the negotiations are political in nature. However, we think
that a focus on trade is important, as sales comprise the vast majority of business transactions. We
hope that our analysis can be extended to other types of business negotiations later. Based on the
analysis to follow, in Section 3.3 we construct a business negotiation support metamodel in. Such a
metamodel offers a generic framework with parameters that can be tailored to the particular
negotiation situation at hand.
2.2. Types of Negotiation Models
Negotiation models can be classified along different dimensions. A first key dimension is the
degree of guidance that they offer in the actual negotiation support - their normative status, in other
words. The second dimension is the perspective by which the negotiation is modelled.
Model Status. An important distinction in negotiation models is whether they are descriptive or
prescriptive (Gulliver 1979; Kersten and Cray 1996). Descriptive models try to carefully describe
what actually happens, whereas prescriptive models are normative in the sense that they prescribe
what negotiators should do to achieve the desired result.
Kersten and Cray (1996) offer some guidelines that recommend the appropriate role in negotiation
support for both kinds of models. Any negotiation supporting method should first of all be based
on a descriptive model that analyzes and explains the cognitive perspectives and behavior of the
participants without making unrealistic assumptions about their rationality. Only after this
cognitive level has been described is it useful to provide predictive and prescriptive support at the
instrumental level. Negotiation support should allow contrasting descriptive representations to be
developed. Then, predictions and prescriptions can be generated based on an analysis of the needs
of the opponent, the specifics of the situation, and decision-making conditions. Instead of trying to
predict outcomes, often, only the decision options for the various participants need be identified.
4

<-----Page 4----->The participants then make the actual decisions based on their interpretation of rich, albeit informal,
context knowledge.
Next, we introduce some modelling perspectives. Although models of both a descriptive and a
prescriptive nature can be developed in all the following perspectives, they are not always relevant
in each case. For example, as we shall see, game-theoretical models often oversimplify reality so
that their descriptive qualities are sometimes questionable.
Model Perspective. Negotiation models can be analyzed from different perspectives.
perspectives provide a focus for identifying key processes and structural constructs.

These

Many different classifications of negotiation models exist, some of which are described in Putnam
and Roloff (1992). Because negotiation is very much dependent on the specific application domain
in which it is conducted, some kind of domain classification is useful. Lim and Benbasat (1992)
see political, economic, and social settings as important application domains; they therefore
distinguish between political, economic, and social-psychological models. Political models aim to
predict political behavior by analyzing potential conflicts of interest. Economic models are
dynamic and focus both on process and outcome. They are often quite specific in terms of the
domain covered and stress the formation of expectations regarding the behavior of the other
negotiation parties. Socio-psychological models are mostly descriptive as opposed to prescriptive,
analyzing various behaviors in socio-psychological terms.
Negotiation is not only characterized by content matter, but also by its communication aspects.
There are three key characteristics of a communications perspective on negotiation: micro
elements; dynamics; and systems of meaning (Putnam and Roloff 1992). First, communication
processes consist of many micro elements that occur in a specific context. For instance, messages
are related to previous and subsequent messages in the context of a particular goal. Second, the
dynamics of communication need to be studied. For example, it is important to examine how offers
are formulated and changed. Third, systems of meaning from individual, interpersonal, situational,
and cultural perspectives need to be uncovered to guide the negotiation process in a proper manner.
Especially in computer-mediated business negotiations, sufficient attention needs to be paid to
developing an appropriate communication model. Patterns, such as those needed to construct
offers or information requests, must be defined. Defining who can do what and how the various
information products are changed in negotiation subprocesses is very important. Different sets of
meanings adopted by, for example, business partners from different countries need to be carefully
defined. In this way, computer support can be made sufficiently sensitive to the complexity and
dynamics of real negotiation situations. Much research has been done on communication aspects in
face-to-face negotiations (e.g. (Ulijn and Strother 1995)). However, most research in computermediated negotiations so far has focused on analyzing relatively simple context-free and artificial
negotiation situations, while little is known about the determinants of, for instance, intercultural
negotiations (Kersten and Noronha 1999). Some interesting work in this respect includes the
Culture Classification Model of Schuster and Copeland (1996), which can be used to analyze
differences between cultures in the roles of time, task, and relationships in making business
negotiation decisions. These dimensions have implications for communication styles that should
be acknowledged in the design of negotiation support systems.
2.3. Negotiation Stages

5

<-----Page 5----->Each negotiation process has a life cycle consisting of a number of stages. Depending on the
negotiation model used, the definitions of these stages differs considerably.
Some only take into account the planning and conduct of the negotiation itself, while not directly
paying attention to final results. Robinson and Volkov (1998), inspired by the software life cycle,
talk about the negotiation analysis, design, and implementation stages. The first two stages
together form the preparatory stage, whereas the actual conduct of the negotiation takes place in the
implementation stage (note that to them, implementation refers to the negotiation process, whereas
often it concerns what happens to the end results once this process is complete).
An example of an elaborate decision theoretic stage model has been proposed by Lim and Benbasat
(1999). They distinguish an issue identification stage, a range specification stage of the values of
the negotiation variables, a utility definition stage in which participants specify their own utility
curves and those of their opponents, and finally the negotiation dance in which the negotiation itself
takes place.
One of the most extensive socio-psychological/cultural stage models is provided by Gulliver. In
his developmental model of negotiation (Gulliver 1979: 82), he distinguishes eight stages: (1)
searching for an arena; (2) formulating an agenda and working definitions of the issues to be
negotiated; (3) making preliminary statements of demands and offers, exploring the dimensions and
limits of issues, and emphasizing the differences between the parties; (4) narrowing the differences
and reaching agreement on some issues; (5) preliminaries to final bargaining; (6) final bargaining;
(7) ritual confirmation of the final outcome; and (8) the implementation of the outcome.
In summary, most process models agree that there is at least some form of (1) negotiation
preparation, (2) actual conducting of the negotiations, and (3) implementation of the results,
sometimes including their renegotiation (e.g. Gulliver 1979; Kersten and Noronha 1999). When
constructing a particular negotiation model using a metamodel, not all stages necessarily have to be
included, but at least their absence should be justified.
Bargaining. Some authors consider the negotiation and bargaining processes to be identical (Lim
and Benbasat 1992; Putnam and Roloff 1992). However, we adopt Gulliver's narrower definition
of bargaining as a subprocess of negotiation that consists of the presentation and exchange of more
or less specific proposals for the terms of agreement on particular issues (Gulliver 1979: 71).
We focus on bargaining here because of the complex nature of communication involved, and
because detailed protocols for it already exist. This stage in particular requires - and can obtain automated negotiation support. The pre- and post-bargaining stages of the negotiation process also
deserve attention, but especially in contract negotiations, bargaining is a key element.
The utility functions used for alternative generation in decision theoretical approaches offer one
form of automated business negotiation support for the bargaining process. A participant first
specifies his or her own utilities and then estimates those of the other party. Sophisticated
(computer) analyses subsequently are done on these data, after which opening offers are made (see
e.g. Belluci and Zeleznikow 1997; Lim 1999).
The use of utility-based bargaining processes is questionable in many types of negotiations
(Kersten and Cray 1996). In many cases, such utility analyses can only be done informally by the
negotiation participants. This seems an obvious limitation in, for instance, political negotiations
because these are influenced by many subtle interests that are hard to formalize, let alone quantify.

6

<-----Page 6----->However, business negotiations also involve many factors that are hard to quantify, if not in theory
then at least in practice. Much tacit knowledge, for example, is needed in business contract
negotiations to assess credibility, trust, etc. Decision-making support in the form of automated
utility analysis therefore should at most play a supportive, not decisive, role in business
negotiations.
2.4. Negotiation Products
In the various stages of the negotiation process, a number of (intermediate) negotiation products are
created and used as input. In general, negotiation products become more clearly defined in the later
stages. Robinson and Volkov (1998) propose a negotiation support model in which they describe
the products of the negotiation process and their relations. The four main types of products are
agent models (issues, goals, and preferences), conflicts (goals and means conflicts), alternatives,
and deals.
In business negotiations, all four categories of products are needed, although some products may
need to be more formally and explicitly defined than others. Agent models are required to
determine what participants want and why they do so. Conflicts must be modelled to focus
negotiation efforts. Alternatives provide options from which the parties can choose. Deals come in
the form of contracts in which commitments are made explicit. Other kinds of additional
intermediate products are needed as well, such as many kinds of business documents and
communication results.
2.5. Negotiation Roles
The negotiation process is executed by participants not acting as autonomous individuals, but
playing different actor roles. To know what actions are acceptable for a particular participant,
these roles need to be well understood.
Surprisingly, not much work has been done on actor role classifications. One of the most extensive
classifications of negotiation roles is presented by Robinson and Volkov (1998). They distinguish
six main roles: owner (main stakeholder of outcome), analyst (formulates owner's goals and
analyzes domain alternatives), designer (plans the negotiation process), technologist (provides the
communication infrastructure), facilitator (facilitates the actual negotiations), and negotiator
(conducts the negotiations on behalf of the owner). A facilitator is also referred to as a mediator,
who can be an interested party (directly related to one of the parties) or neutral in the sense of not
having a direct interest in the outcome (Gulliver 1979). Others, however, consider a mediator to
play a more controlling role than mere facilitation (Rangaswamy and Shell 1997). At any rate, role
classifications and their integrations with other negotiation process constructs, like norms, could
benefit from substantial future research.
2.6. Negotiation Protocols
If negotiation is to be adequately supported, it is not enough to merely describe the various aspects
of this process. Instead, prescriptive guidance in the form of negotiation protocols is also needed.
These can be defined as protocols that standardize agents’ communication patterns through an
ordered interchange of structured messages. Using this definition, Robinson and Volkov claim that
7

<-----Page 7----->negotiation protocols regulate four types of behavior: revealing agent models; identifying conflicts;
searching for alternatives/conflict resolution; and selecting an alternative. Using these protocols,
negotiation strategies can be employed that consist of the plans by which agents interact with each
other to achieve a desired goal (Robinson and Volkov 1998). Of course, such agents can be
humans or machines, or a combination of both, although it is still theoretically unclear when to use
what kind of agent.
In business negotiations, protocols can play an important role. They increase the transparency of
the process and help engender trust. They also can make the negotiation process more efficient.
To prevent the reinvention of the wheel again and again, standard protocols are very helpful. When
the parties make use of a support system, it can implement the protocol by showing at each moment
what actions are permitted or required and by making explicit the effects of a particular step at a
certain stage (e.g., is this quote legally binding?). Protocols are necessary when the negotiation
process is being delegated to software agents.
Being transparent and showing options or limits is very important in business negotiations. The
parties involved are often strangers, especially in the new markets enabled by the Internet, and
sometimes are not familiar with the acceptable cultural and technological practices. Trust in the
negotiation process and knowledge of its context are therefore essential.
Negotiation Patterns. Given that proper negotiation classifications can be made, it should be
possible to develop negotiation patterns (Weigand and van den Heuvel 1998). Sources of these
classifications can be, for instance, organizational or cultural variables. The patterns can combine
entities such as process steps, roles, products, etc., and can help configure quickly the negotiation
protocols in a context-dependent way. Such patterns can thus act as reference models, which help
increase the efficacy of the negotiation process, similar to the use of these models in structuring
complex communication processes like information system specification (van der Rijst and de
Moor 1996). So far, only little research has been done on the development of negotiation reference
models and patterns. The creation of useful patterns will, to a large extent, depend on the analysis
of numerous cases. The findings should be interpreted in theoretical frameworks generic enough to
allow cross-case comparisons while at the same time sufficiently precise to deal with the specifics
of each case.

3. Negotiation Support Systems
To enable the various negotiation processes across time and space, negotiation support systems
(NSS) are needed. Such systems should not replace human participation in negotiations, but should
be used to augment and mediate their involvement (Jarke et al. 1987; Rieke and Sillars 1984;
Robinson and Volkov 1998). NSS can be defined as a composite of computer techniques that
support the social or analytical aspects of the negotiation life cycle (Robinson and Volkov 1998).
NSS are useful because, first, they improve the quality of negotiation outcomes through their
various functionalities.
Computers are better than people at providing many of these
functionalities, e.g., keeping track of and ordering intermediate negotiation results. Second, as the
frequency and amount of business being conducted electronically increases, the need for electronic
negotiation support increases as well (Rangaswamy and Shell 1997).

8

<-----Page 8----->However, attention must be paid to the following issues: (1) general purpose systems are too
unconstrained, so NSS should focus on specific domains; (2) in practice, most systems tend to be
used rarely in actual negotiations, so special care must be taken to adapt them to the context of their
use; and (3) there is a trend away from quantitative (e.g. decision theoretic) systems towards
systems that support more qualitative negotiation processes (see Belluci and Zeleznikow 1997 for a
more refined discussion of these aspects).
Negotiation support systems evolved from the general class of decision support systems (DSS)
(Kersten and Cray 1996). NSS consist of two parts: a DSS and some kind of group support system
(GSS). As such, they can be considered a subclass of group decision support systems (GDSS).
The DSS is used for example to rank alternatives and analyses; the GSS supports the
communication process (Delaney et al. 1997; Lim and Benbasat 1992). Empirical evidence
suggests that such comprehensive NSS result in more successful negotiations than do DSS without
a GSS component (Delaney et al. 1997; Foroughi et al. 1995). However, most studies have been
conducted in a restricted laboratory context, an exception being the comprehensive case study of
real labor management contract negotiations in the University of Arizona’s electronic meeting
room (Carmel et al. 1993).
DSS can be useful in supporting the decision-making processes required for negotiation. They help
prepare and weigh alternatives, calculate scenarios, etc. Such systems are becoming quite
advanced. For example, Kersten and Cray (1996) propose increasing the reasoning capabilities of
DSS by applying insights from cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Thus, in these cases,
‘agentware’ can be used, in addition to the groupware-systems that support human negotiators
(Robinson and Volkov 1998). Some propose the use of intelligent agents that either have a
complete set of possible strategies in their memory or are in the form of learning agents (e.g. Beam
and Segev 1997). Such agents use automated negotiation techniques such as sophisticated goal
analysis methods (which, for instance, classify goal interactions as being cooperative or conflicting)
and resolution generation methods (which create new decision alternatives such as new values or
goals) (Robinson and Volkov 1998). However, communication can only be formalized so much.
Thus, human actors remain essential in providing the analytical capabilities needed for decisionmaking situations (Rieke and Sillars 1984; Weigand and Dignum 1997).
Empirical studies have shown that the GSS component of an NSS increases satisfaction among
negotiators compared with negotiation support systems that do not use electronic means to
communicate (Delaney et al. 1997). On the other hand, electronic communication can also slow
down and inhibit certain parts of negotiations, especially the bargaining process. This results in a
lack of synchronization between the different parties, which is problematic as bargaining phases
alternate between differentiation and integration of opinions, positions, etc. Synchronization can be
improved, however, by having a set procedure or agenda coordinating the moves, and the media not
being too slow or too hard to learn (Poole et al. 1992).

3.1. NSS Components
The above is a conceptual subdivision that applies to each NSS. However, in practice, these
systems consist of many components, which can be analyzed both based on the negotiation
functionalities they provide and the tools by which they are implemented.

9

<-----Page 9----->NSS Functionalities. Rangaswamy and Shell (1997) distinguish between negotiation preparation
and evaluation systems (to help individuals prepare and evaluate negotiation information), process
support systems (to restructure the dynamics and procedures of the negotiation process in order to
promote integrative bargaining), mediation systems (in which the computer model substitutes or
assists the human mediator in prompting parties into action, while directing all communication
through the mediator), and interactive bargaining systems (which enable parties to communicate
directly). Robinson and Volkov (1998), on the other hand, distinguish between such categories as
autonomous software agents, standard DSS, and so-called component configuration systems
(systems that support policy definition or resolution of resource allocation conflicts), such as
contract systems. Yet another classification of functionalities is provided by Lim and Benbasat
(1992), who want NSS to first support requirements analysis, second, strategic analysis, including
the assessment of the needs of the other party, and, third, the interaction itself. A sophisticated
class of NSS are cognitive support systems (Kersten and Cray 1996). These systems allow decision
makers to generate stories describing sequences of situations. Because the needs and abilities of
the decision maker are paramount, metamodels are used to interpret the situation and assess
problem parameters, which are both quantitative and qualitative.
The systems build
representations, select and organize the appropriate formal models, retrieve relevant information,
and determine the order of processing.
Contract Management. It is interesting that in most perspectives, negotiation is only viewed as a
dialogue - a process in which messages are exchanged - whereas in practice the collaborative
drafting of texts often plays an important role – since the results of the negotation can easily be lost
if they are not recorded in some permanent form. In business negotiations, the texts are typically
(versions of) contracts. So, when supporting contract negotiations, both the communication
process and the structure and contents of the contract need to be addressed (Weigand et al., 2003).
The structure of the contract includes contract elements and the relations between them. Contract
elements can be derived from templates and include unalterable as well as negotiable components
(Gisler et al. 1999). There is a great variety of contract elements, depending on the domain, the
purpose, and the users of the contract.
Contract management includes, aside from the core negotiation process, contract validation
(ensuring that the contract satisfies the validity rules of the contract domain), contract monitoring
(ensuring that the performed activities correspond to the contract), contract enforcement (ensuring
that corrective action is taken if the contract has not been honored) and contract arbitration
(settling contract disputes) (Gisler et al. 1999).
To model and provide automated support for contract negotiation processes, some formal language
is needed. One such language is the Formal Language for Business Communication (FLBC)
(Kimbrough 1998). FLBC allows for business communication processes to be modelled as
sequences of speech acts, thus providing a powerful and comprehensive framework for describing
the contents of business transactions as well as specifying precisely the roles that business partners
are to play. This framework has been extended by Weigand and van den Heuvel (1998), who
specifically define the semantics of the contract elements and negotiation processes.
3.2. NSS Tools
The required functionalities of NSS are implemented by sets of information tools, ranging from
generic e-mail applications to dedicated web servers. The media or tools that are used in
10

<-----Page 10----->negotiations are not neutral and actively shape negotiation situations and outcomes (Putnam and
Roloff 1992). Furthermore, no single tool is best suited for all (sub-) stages of the negotiation
process (Poole et al. 1992). Thus, to assemble successful support systems, the choice of the right
mix of tools is not trivial, and complex social context factors must be assessed (Preece 2000). For
example, e-mail-mediated negotiation is known to be less successful than face-to-face negotiation
due to the lack of social context cues. Nevertheless, e-mail-based negotiation is known to be more
productive when negotiators establish trust and rapport, which they themselves can promote by
mutual self-disclosure. Experiments have shown how this can be facilitated by making available
personal information about counterparts (e.g. through home pages on the web) and by having a
non-task-related conversation prior to the actual negotiation process, mediated, for instance, by an
electronic chat tool like ICQ (Moore et al. 1999).
Complex tool configurations can be represented as combinations of elementary media. For
example, a (complex) computer conference system can be said to consist of a text editing tool plus
a particular type of group decision support system (Poole et al. 1992). Furthermore, it is very
important that elementary or more complex tools are matched to the particular negotiation stages or
functionalities as described above. For example, for issue identification, electronic brainstorming
plus an evaluation tool may be used, while for utility function definition a spreadsheet could prove
useful (Lim 1999).
NSS Tool Examples. Many specialized NSS tools exist. In this section, we only describe a sample,
as our goal is to illustrate conceptual elements of negotiation support systems, but not to be
comprehensive in our survey.
An example of a sophisticated tool is the INSPIRE (InterNeg Support Program for Intercultural
Research) (Cray and Kersten 1999). This system supports negotiation using conjoint analysis for
utility construction, a messaging facility for the argumentation process, and a visualization facility
for the construction of graphs representing negotiation dynamics and history. It applies a phasemodel of negotiation: the negotiation phase consists of climate setting, presenting, mid-point
bargaining, and closing. The post-settlement stage consists of the support system checking the
efficiency of the compromises made by taking into account the entered utility values.
Three commercially available business-to-business NSS tools are Fair Internet Trader, diCarta and
Ozro Negotiate. An example of a simple communication model-based NSS is the Fair Internet
Trader.2 One can act either as a buyer or a seller. An offer is negotiated using some simple
parameters like product, quantity, price, and VAT. An order is then produced, and a payment can
be made. For this reason, the system pays a lot of attention to security. diCarta3 provides
negotiation support in the context of contract management, which considers the complete contract
life cycle, including negotiation, contract drafting, fulfilment, renewal and evaluation. diCarta
offers substantial support for the management aspects of contract negotiation, such as planning,
proper party involvement, authorizations, version control, etc. The negotiation process is based on
collaborative document drafting. Ozro Negotiate4 also offers business-to-business negotiation
support. Negotiation here is considered to be the exchange of requests and offers using
standardized forms that typically include bill-of-materials lists and standardized contract terms (e.g.
delivery terms). Increased speed, reduced error, and security are mentioned as key benefits of this
system.
In summary, there are many advanced NSS tools. Still, their functionalities are generally
specialized and hard to change, as process models are embedded in the software and not
parameterized. Matching complex negotiation functionality requirements with the restricted

11

<-----Page 11----->functionalities provided by these tools is not a trivial process. To adequately support complex
communication processes like negotiation, such functionality matching deserves careful attention
(de Moor and van den Heuvel 2001).

3.3. The Business Negotiation Support Metamodel
Negotiation being such a complex process, support systems must help in identifying context
factors, tailoring process model and support system designs, and making implicit assumptions
explicit. A metamodel would be valuable here, as it would provide a checklist of components to
consider. It could also be used to compare different models and support systems, allowing for
strengths and weaknesses of a particular system to be identified and benchmarks to be developed.
Figure 1: The Business Negotiation Support Metamodel
Previously in this paper, we defined the core components necessary in the construction of useful
negotiation support systems. In Figure 1, we relate the most important of these elements in a
Business Negotiation Support Metamodel. Our model only includes the basic categories of
constructs to be considered, leaving further subdivision open to others. The model does, however,
allow for theoretical constructs and practical findings to be defined, related, and seen in their
context.
Each negotiation process is embedded in a social context. More or less explicit norms govern
acceptable behavior of the negotiators. For example, various cultures have different norms with
respect to acceptable task, time, and relationship aspects (Schuster and Copeland 1996). Based on
these informal norms, explicit protocols can be defined that prescribe acceptable negotiation steps,
communication moves, and decision making process procedures. These protocols formalizing the
norms are the foundation of automated negotiation support.
The following are the core elements of the negotiation process:
•
•
•

•

Each negotiation process consists of a sequence of stages. These stages comprise the
preparation, conduct, and implementation of negotiation results, although their particular
classification is left up to the users of the model.
In each stage, participants play different negotiation roles. Although the specific roles
differ per negotiation model, they should include such responsibilities as defined in Section
2.5, like owners, analysts, designers, and facilitators.
The participants in their various roles interact in a communication process. Such a process
consists of sequences of communication moves, like series of related speech acts.
Acceptable moves are governed by norms that are operationalized in communication
protocols. For example, a negotiation owner is permitted to request that a negotiator present
alternatives to the opponent, after which the negotiator can accept them or request
additional instructions.
Embedded in this communication process are one or more individual or group decisionmaking processes. These processes can be partially automated, for example in the form of
utility analysis software. Human interpretation also plays a role here, for example in
selecting the best alternative from a set of options prepared by the analysis software.
Decision-making processes are triggered by communication moves. In the negotiation
preparation stage, for instance, decision making must take place for relevant agenda items.
12

<-----Page 12----->•

Decision-making software can analyze participants’ priorities, calculate expected durations,
and furnish a recommended set of agenda items to be evaluated by the negotiators. This
process could be triggered after the negotiation participants have agreed to create an
electronic negotiation workspace in some predefined communication process.
The communication processes lead to one or more intermediate and final negotiation
products in each stage. For example, in the agenda formulation stage, intermediate products
can be the set of potential agenda items, while a final product might be the agenda agreed
upon by all negotiators.

The negotiation sub-processes are enabled by the functionalities of the NSS. The entire system is
implemented by a set of either dedicated negotiation tools or more generic all-purpose information
tools such as mailers or spreadsheets. The functionality enabled by these tools must be matched
carefully with the functionality required by the negotiation community, paying attention to both
sociability (human interactions) and usability (human-computer interactions) (Preece 2000).
Community members should be actively involved in these complex design processes. Which users
to involve at what time in system adaptation is defined by communal norms (de Moor and Jeusfeld
2001) and should be reflected in the negotiation protocols for the NSS to remain adequate and
current.
The metamodel can be used for several purposes. One application is to serve as a template for NSS
analysis, which would allow for the examination of how a tool fits its context of negotiation use.
Another use is as a reference model, which allows for best practices to be recorded (van der Rijst
and de Moor 1996). Yet another application is to serve as an instrument for comparing different
applications by clarifying similarities, differences, and gaps in functionality. In the next section,
we show an example of how the metamodel assists in analyzing the usefulness of one particular
NSS, the MeMo system, which is used to support contract negotiations in the construction industry.
4. MEdiating & MOnitoring electronic commerce
Electronic Commerce means doing business via electronic networks such as the Internet.
Electronic commerce can be seen as the successor of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), but it goes
far beyond EDI in that it aims to support complete external business transactions. Such
transactions consist of three stages: the information stage; negotiation stage; and fulfilment stage.
Nowadays, the information stage of the transaction process is already supported in several ways.
Information about potential business partners can be obtained through specialized databases,
chambers of commerce, and more recently on the WWW. The fulfilment stage of the transaction is
also well served. There exist many systems that support electronic payment, either directly or
through some documentary credit facilities. Furthermore, order control can be managed
electronically through the use of EDI messages.
However, there is still limited support for the negotiation stage. The coordination and execution of
this stage thus far has had to be done manually, which has presented a major obstacle for the uptake
of electronic commerce by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Big companies can
usually afford to undertake the time and cost of negotiating interchange agreements because they
can establish long-term relations with their suppliers (or customers) and they have in-house
expertise. For smaller-sized companies, however, the expense and efforts incurred are often
prohibitive.

13

<-----Page 13----->The MeMo (Mediating and Monitoring Electronic Commerce) project was a European initiative in
which several research and industrial partners collaborated to design e-commerce support systems
for SMEs.5 MeMo was dedicated to finding ways for SMEs to negotiate transactions via the
Internet and then generate the necessary fulfilment procedures (EDI or more advanced)
automatically.
Figure 2 denotes the different stages through which business transactions pass (on a very high
level) and the (electronic) support that is offered by MeMo at each level.
Figure 2: Overview of the MeMo system
The main innovation of MeMo is its support of the negotiation stage, which focuses specifically on
negotiation communication processes that result in the complex contract negotiation product.
4.1. MeMo requirements
The design of the MeMo system is based on the assumption that to be of practical use in
international trade, the support of the electronic commerce process should meet the following three
requirements:
•
•
•

It should be possible to use product and business information from many different sources.
It is not realistic to assume that companies are willing to submit their databases to one
central database. Indeed, this assumption has been confirmed by MeMo user groups.
Support for the information and negotiation stage should inspire a level of trust among the
partners, such that they are willing to enter the fulfilment stage (payment and delivery)
based on the negotiated contract.
Several different payment and delivery models should be supported in the fulfilment stage
to accommodate all the possible contracts and cope with different cultural practices and the
many different legal requirements in international trade.

The purpose of the MeMo Project was to obtain knowledge and expertise to construct an open
environment to serve as an Electronic Commerce Broker Service (ECBS) for SMEs in order to
promote cross-border e-commerce activities. A prototype of the ECBS was delivered in June 2001.
4.2. Main activities in the MeMo project
The MeMo project included the following key activities: the development of partner searching as
well as negotiation and contracting mechanisms; business data management; operational and
product integration support; and extensive user evaluations.
Partner Searching Mechanism. The partner searching mechanism is a tool that allows companies
to quickly and efficiently locate potential business partners and specific products and services.
Traditional e-commerce systems offer almost no such facilities other than a searchable catalogue.
Although browsing catalogues might be efficient for business-to-consumer electronic commerce,
inter-company trade in a rapidly-changing environment requires specialized search support in order
to adequately respond to business opportunities. Incorporated within the MeMo electronic
commerce brokering service is a range of supported search strategies, ranging from basic keyword
searching, via browsable specialized subject gateways, to full-fledged knowledge navigation tools
using industry-related concepts.
14

<-----Page 14----->Negotiation and Contracting Mechanism. The Negotiation Module of MeMo supports business-tobusiness negotiations and contract building. A precondition for business relations is a sense of trust
between all business partners. This trust depends on informal personal contact on the one hand and
formal contracts and legislation on the other hand. The MeMo negotiation module does not replace
human informal communication, but enables human agents to structure their communication using
the Formal Language for Business Communication (Weigand and van den Heuvel 1998). Figure 3
provides an example of how this is implemented on the WWW. Because results of negotiations are
typically enumerated in a contract, MeMo also offers a repository of standard contracts and a
shared workspace in which a standard document can be adapted by the partners to suit their
particular needs. It facilitates different scenarios and provides SMEs with safe "negotiation
rooms." Since language is often a large barrier for international trade, especially for small
companies in Europe, the Negotiation Module also contains a multilingual thesaurus in which key
terms in international trade are presented in multiple languages. In this way, it is possible for the
human agents to personalize their MeMo interface with their particular language. Using these
means, MeMo is one of the first systems that actually facilitates practical business negotiation via
the Internet.6
Figure 3: MeMo negotiation menu
Business Data Management. A metadata repository that forms the memory of the electronic
commerce broker has been developed. The repository provides a common access point for all
information that is available in the broker system, including information that is integrated from
external heterogeneous information sources, e.g. company profiles from the chambers of commerce
and product profiles from the individual companies.
Operational Support and Product Integration. Although fulfilment is not the main focus of the
MeMo project, it is important to show SMEs the interaction between new R&D outcomes and
traditional standardization schemes, like EDIFACT messaging. EDIFACT is a UN standard that
regulates the electronic exchange of business documents and messages7. The new initiatives
developed in MeMo take into account that there is wide implementation of this standard in the
different branches of the market and that it is widely used between SMEs and medium-to-large size
companies. For that reason, the MeMo Negotiation System is linked to an EDIFACT-based EDI
workflow manager.
During the project, it was found that negotiation support can also be offered during the fulfilment
stage. This is because contracts are sometimes negotiated in steps, starting with a general statement
and continuing with more levels of detail. Another need for negotiation support arises from dispute
resolution. Contracts often have to be renegotiated because one of the parties fails to deliver or
because there are important changes in the environment. The document-based negotiation protocol
of MeMo seems particularly useful to support dispute resolution. The mere on-line availability of
the contracts is nevertheless already helpful to parties when something goes wrong during the
fulfilment.
User Evaluation. In order to involve a group of SMEs in the project, MeMo formed an SMEs
Round Table in Spain, Germany and the Netherlands. These user group round tables provided a
good environment to discuss continually incremental developments and test the EC-Brokering
Service (ECBS) with SME-user companies. The most extensive evaluation of the system has taken
place in the Dutch construction industry.

15

<-----Page 15----->One of the results of this evaluation was the finding that traditional non-automated negotiation
causes agreements to contain many errors, resulting in high failure costs in the fulfilment stage. An
integrated system like MeMo can help reduce errors as less copying is needed from one medium to
another and because it can include automatic checks. In other words, the primary business value of
an electronic NSS seems to be the potential to improve the quality of communication.
Another result was arriving at the conclusion that negotiation means quite different things for
different roles in the value chain, and that a system like MeMo must be tuned to a particular role
before it can be used effectively. For example, a wholesaler negotiates with manufacturers about
frame contracts on a yearly basis. Wholesalers negotiate with contractors on a project-by-project
basis. During and after these negotiations, the wholesaler forwards specific orders (electronically)
to the manufacturers within the boundaries of the frame contract. Negotiation and fulfilment are
not strictly distinguishable because contracts are modified and updated many times before the final
delivery. Contractors negotiate with wholesalers on a project-by-project basis, and do this typically
by asking several parties for quotes and then using this information in bargaining. The bargaining
is seldom merely about price, but more often about delivery options and extra services. So, for the
manufacturer it is important that MeMo supports frame contracts and automatic processing of
orders based on these frame contracts. For the wholesaler, it is important that the system supports
him in his task as intermediary, which means that he is often simultaneously involved in two
related negotiations (and many unrelated). For contractors, MeMo should provide tendering
functions, and in general, MeMo should fit in their project management environment.

4.3. The MeMo Negotiation Model
To illustrate the use of the Business Negotiation Support Metamodel, we apply it to the MeMo
negotiation support system.
MeMo takes a communication perspective towards negotiation, as it mainly focuses on the support
of the communication processes and does not offer much support for the decision processes at each
stage. It also clearly has a strong socio-psychological perspective, given its focus on supporting
informal, and often international and intercultural, negotiation processes.
There is a great variety of norms in MeMo because of the strong, traditional customs in the
construction industry and the various cultural backgrounds of users. Many of these norms are
implicit, although a substantial amount has been made explicit in the form of detailed, official
construction guidelines and procedures. An example of informal norms is the importance of fair
competition (leading to some kind of tender-based protocol). This norm is typically more
important in public tenders. Cultural differences between the participants may also be an indicator
for a certain type of protocol - for example, one in which implicit steps are made more explicit. In
future research, we consider addressing more explicitly cultural reference models used to generate
situated protocols (protocols that take into account the cultural background of the participants).
Such reference models could be informed by work like the Culture Classification Model mentioned
in Section 2.2 and the Ulijn group’s research (Ulijn and Campbell 1997; Ulijn and Lincke 2002).
Protocols are prominent in MeMo. One of the design goals of the project is to support different
protocols in order to allow for the variation in business contexts and cultural settings. For that
reason, MeMo supports the specification of protocols in a declarative language XLBC (Weigand
and Hasselbring 2001). XLBC not only allows the designer to specify message types (based on
16

<-----Page 16----->speech-act theory), but also larger communicative units (transactions, conversations). Although it
has been proven hard to generate the operational system completely on the basis of an XLBC
protocol specification - especially because the layout and style of the screens are hard to specify on
an abstract level - the result has been that MeMo offers a number of protocols and new ones can be
added with relatively little effort.
Based on experiences in the Dutch construction industry, three types of negotiation protocols have
been distinguished: quotation-based (also called norm-based); tender-based; and document-based
(Weigand et al., 2003). The first group of protocols is aimed at bilateral negotiations. These
consist of multiple stages, and each stage has a clear result in terms of commitments, for instance,
the commitment to prepare a quote. Tender-based protocols are aimed at negotiations with
multiple partners. To assure fair competition, it is necessary to make the protocol completely
transparent. Therefore, it is usually not possible to start a discussion on some item with only one
party. The document-based protocol family is based on the drafting of a document such as a
purchase order.
MeMo provides comprehensive support for all stages of the negotiation process: information
(preparation); negotiation (conduct); and fulfilment (implementation).
These stages are
interrelated, for example, by the use of integrated business data management facilities.
The roles supported by MeMo are still rather primitive. There are buyers and sellers, but little
attention is paid to others, such as intermediaries that could fulfill services, like, possibly,
tendering, preparing summary reports of new product developments, financial services, etc. Formal
roles might be defined in the future for banks, industry associations, and government agencies, so
that more tailored support can be provided.
Communication processes are extensively supported. For example, in bilateral negotiations, a
distinction is made between a success layer and a discussion layer. The negotiations take place at
the success layer. The discussion layer is entered when there is a question or a problem, for
example, about the validity of a certain claim, or an exchange of proposals on a certain issue.
When such a discussion is finished, the partners can continue from the point at which the success
layer was interrupted. The communication process in the document-based process consists of
proposals and counter-proposals. It is possible to subdivide the document in parts and assign a
specific stage in the negotiation process to each part.
The decision process functions of MeMo are limited in comparison to a system like INSPIRE,
mentioned above. This is because MeMo was meant mainly to support the communication process.
Still, some decision support for the evaluation of tenders is included in the system since this task is
directly related to the semantics of the tender protocol. Furthermore, the stance was taken that, in
the future, each party is free to add a DSS, intelligent agent, or already available ERP system, to
perform tasks such as ranking alternatives or generating a quoteThe connection of such systems to
MeMo is relatively easy, since MeMo makes use of structured messages based on XML (Extended
Markup Language)8. XML is a meta-language that allows the structure and meaning of messages
and documents to be precisely defined.
MeMo produces a wide range of complex, often related products.
For example, in tender
negotiations, typical intermediate products are calls for tenders and the tenders themselves. The
final product is the announcement of the selected party. In a document-based type of negotiation,
intermediate products are document parts upon which some level of commitment has been
achieved. The final product is an agreed upon contract such as a completed purchase order form.

17

<-----Page 17----->The final product can also be a contract ready for execution, that is, the configuration of a
fulfilment procedure using EDI.
The MeMo system offers a wide set of functionalities in the form of services, using various
information tools. For example, the multilingual thesaurus discussed earlier provides a basic
translation service. A shared workspace gives the participants the opportunity to exchange
background documents of any type. Furthermore, a repository of contract templates is available,
such as the ICC international sales contract. Originally, MeMo planned to offer some contract
verification services as well, based on formal logical representations of the contract, but these
services have not yet been implemented.
An interesting question is whether the use of the Internet in general, and an NSS in particular,
impacts the negotiation climate (Mastenbroek 1989). The MeMo system has been evaluated in the
context of the Dutch construction industry. As part of the evaluation, contractors, manufacturers
and wholesalers were asked whether the Internet would change their negotiation behavior.
Although the answers varied to some degree depending on the parties’ different roles, generally, it
was believed that the Internet would make the negotiators more tenacious (less concessive), more
dominating, and more evasive (rather than explorative). In other words, the Internet would create a
more hostile climate. In a business domain where relationships and mutual trust are considered
important, this would not be a positive development. One way to counter-balance this development
is to move into hybrid forms: to use the Internet for the first phases of negotiation and to move into
face-to-face negotiations with selected parties afterwards. However, there will be consequences for
NSS systems like MeMo One consequence is that these systems should give extra support for the
initial selection phases and perhaps the final contracting phase. Most importantly, the system
should not assume that all negotiations are conducted only through the system. This would also
entail that significant attention be paid to aligning system-generated negotiation products with
results from the informal negotiations.
5. Conclusions
Examining the academic literature on business negotiations on the one hand, and the commerciallyavailable systems on the Internet on the other hand, a wide gap looms between theory and practice.
In this paper, we have tried to bring theory and practice closer together. We have given an
overview of negotiation theory in general and, more particularly, the theory of negotiation support
systems. A business negotiation support metamodel was defined that can be used in the analysis of
strengths and weaknesses of current systems. Furthermore, we have described the MeMo project in
which a complete NSS was built to support European SMEs in business negotiations. Empirical
findings from MeMo were analyzed using the metamodel.
As we said, theory and practice still differ widely in their focus. Much of the formal theory is
based on decision theory and the search for optimal strategies. In practice, however, the demand is
primarily for communication process support, as was demonstrated by the MeMo user evaluations.
Theory-based decision and communication tools are valuable, but need to be embedded in business
practice and deal with all the related requirements, such as cultural norms, language issues, legal
aspects, standard and frame contracts, role assignments, document management, and integration
with back-office systems. The challenge to theory is to take all these considerations into account, if
it wants to be relevant, and to systematically analyze and compare the findings. Theoretical
reflections, in turn, can inspire the design of higher quality practical systems. In this analysis

18

<-----Page 18----->process, our business negotiation support metamodel could be useful.
analyses, we hope to extend and refine the model.

By doing more case

In addition, more empirical research is needed to improve the implementation of the currently
available systems. Traditionally, empirical research on negotiation has focused mostly on face-toface settings or, in the last few years, e-mail. With complex and structured NSS for practical use,
such as MeMo, becoming available, comparative studies involving several media can be set up to
assess the effectiveness of NSS and to gain better knowledge about the media effects. What is
important is that this knowledge goes beyond the purely descriptive to address the level of norms
that are or should be used in negotiation processes. In this way, it will be possible to translate this
knowledge more effectively into design requirements for future NSS.

At the time of finalizing this paper, the Dutch parliament started an investigation of large-scale
fraud in tender contract negotiations in the Dutch construction industry. One key problem concerns
the lack of competition at the regional level. Internationally operating NSS like MeMo, by
increasing the number of potential suppliers, could - to some extent - help increase the fairness of
free market operations.
