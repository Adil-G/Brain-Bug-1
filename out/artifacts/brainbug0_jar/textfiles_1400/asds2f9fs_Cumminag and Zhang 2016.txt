ABSTRACT

Angel investors finance small high growth entrepreneurial firms in exchange for equity.
Unlike venture capital (VC) and private equity (PE) funds that invest capital from institutional
investors, Angels invest with their own money. This comparative disintermediation of Angel
finance enables us to examine the impact from legal and cultural conditions on financial
intermediation. We are using PitchBook's comprehensive data collect of over 5,000 Angel deals
and 80,000 PE/VC deals from 96 countries over the years 1977-2012. The data indicate that
relative to PE/VC funds, Angel investors are more sensitive to stock market conditions, legal
environments, and Hofstede’s cultural conditions (specifically higher levels of individualism and
risk intolerance). The data further indicate that investee firms funded by Angels are less likely to
successfully exit in either an IPO or acquisition on average, whether those Angels are involved in
the first round or later stages. Our tests results are robust to propensity score matching methods,
as well as clustering standard errors, among other things. In addition to those results, we also
perform difference-in-differences tests to confirm that more stringent disclosure regulation and
more forgiving bankruptcy legal changes can spawn entrepreneurial activities induced by both
Angels and PE/VC funds.

it’s sexy and want to be part of that lifestyle”
- New York Times, December 2015, “Tips for the Aspiring Angel Investor” 1

1. Introduction
Originally, the term “Angel” referred to wealthy individuals who funded the expensive
Broadway theatre productions in New York. It was first used as a business terminology when
William Wetzel completed his pioneering study on how entrepreneurs raised seed capital in the
U.S. and described the investors who supported those entrepreneurs as “Angels” (Wetzel, 1983).
Colorful quotes such as the one above illustrate the oft-repeated view that there is a culture to
Angel investing. However, unlike the private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) literature,
there is little evidence on Angel investments around the world and the comparative role of
international differences in culture and legal institutions in the determinants of and outcomes
from Angel investments.
In this paper, we seek to add to the Angel literature by examining theory and international
evidence on differences between Angel investments and PE/VC investments. We aim to shed
light on how Angel investments look around the world, how Angel involvement is different from
PE/VC funds, what legal and cultural environments affect Angel investments and divestments.
We also consider whether regulatory changes have promoted more Angel and PE/VC funds
activities.
Our analysis exploits the comprehensive data collected at the deal level of investee firms
from PitchBook, which comprise 85,940 completed private equity (PE) deals from 96 countries
spanning the 1977 to 2012 period. Within those deals, there are 5,397 deals in 42 countries are
involved with Angels (either single funded by Angels or coinvested/syndicated with PE/VC
funds). The dataset allows us to directly compare Angels and PE/VC funds at both the deal and
investee firm level.

<-----Page 3----->The data indicate that, relative to PE/VC funds, Angels prefer investing in smaller
entrepreneurial firms in wealthier countries with better stock market conditions, worse legal
environments, and countries with cultures characterized by higher levels of individualism and
lower levels of risk-taking. Such behaviors are robust both for the first round deals and deals at all
other stages. We also find that relative to PE/VC funds, those investee firms funded by Angels
will have lower probability to have successful exits, in either IPO or acquisition, but better legal
environments can help mitigate the negative effects, especially for IPO exits. Moreover, in our
subsample tests, the “stepping stone” logic of Angels still cannot be proved because we find that
firms who have received Angel investments in the first round will have lower probabilities to
successfully exit in later rounds. At a country/market level, we also find significant determinants
which can work together to build a well-rounded environment and spawn both Angels and PE/VC
funds activities. In addition to those results, we also perform difference-in-differences tests to
confirm that more stringent disclosure regulation and more forgiving bankruptcy law changes can
also spawn the entrepreneurial activities induced by Angels and PE/VC funds. Our tests results
are robust under various clustering methods to correct standard errors while controlling fixed
effects and are robust when performing propensity score matching.
Our paper is related to a small but growing literature on Angel investors. While the
literature has focused more on PE/VC finance, many studies have found that Angels are as
important as VCs for start-ups and the total market for Angels is approximately the same size as
VC market (Sohl, 2003; Mason and Harrison, 2002; Goldfarb, Hoberg, Kirsch and Triantis, 2007;
Sudek, Mitteness and Baucus, 2008; Shane, 2008; OECD report, 2011); as such, more research
on Angels is clearly warranted. The most basic reason, we believe, for comparative lack of work
on Angels is the fact that data are readily available on PE/VC deals, but scantly available on
Angels.
Prior research has established that Angels play a more and more important role in funding
entrepreneurs in the seed and early stages and their importance in the entrepreneurial economy

4

<-----Page 4----->has been recognized in recent years (Wetzel, 1987; Mason and Harrison, 1995; Morrissette,
2007). Angels usually can be found among the friends or family members of an entrepreneur and
their capital support could be a one-time injection or an ongoing support over the lifecycle of the
start-ups. Besides the financial support, most of the Angels will often provide managerial
assistances as well (Landstrom, 1993; Shane, 2009; Maxwell, Jeffrey and Lévesque, 2011).
Angels also geographically prefer investing in local firms, they do not prefer using conventional
control mechanisms such as board seats, staging financings or contracting provisions and they
usually hold small positions in the investee firms as compared with VCs (Wong, Bhatia and
Freeman, 2009; Wong, 2010).
Recent empirical studies of Angels are more focused on their contributions to the
investee firms as well as documenting the differences between VCs and Angels. Kerr, Lerner and
Schoar (2014) found that Angels can improve the survival, exits, employment, patenting, web
traffic and financing of investee firms using a regression discontinuity analysis. Although their
study only used two Angel groups’ investments, their findings confirm the positive side of Angel
group financing in that firms funded by those groups are achieving successful exits and reaching
high employment levels. But unfortunately, their study cannot investigate the interrelationships
between Angels and VCs. Hellmann, Schure and Vo (2015) found that the investor type is
dynamically persistent and Angels and VCs are dynamic substitutes of which companies that
obtained more Angel financing in the past are less likely to subsequently obtain VC funding, and
vice versa. Their tests results favor the views that VC funding is still associated with better exit
outcomes. Dutta and Folta (2016) also find similar results regarding the successful exits rates
with bigger impact from VCs, but they also find that Angels will have equivalent impact as VCs
on improving the innovation rates using patents data.
Moreover, there are several theoretical studies have built useful foundations to compare
Angels and VCs. Under the assumptions that VCs will add value to the investee firms while
Angels do not, Chemmanur and Chen (2006) developed a model to explain the reasons behind

5

<-----Page 5----->why entrepreneurs might want to obtain Angel investments first before approaching to VCs.
Schwienbacher (2009) assumed that both Angels and VCs can add value, and his model enables
to explain the differences to choose early-stage financiers between Angels and VCs from the
perspective of entrepreneurs. Hellmann and Thiele (2014) provided a “Friends or Foes” theory
that explicitly models the interdependences between Angels and VCs. Their model assumes that
the investee firms want to proceed from Angel financing to VC financing, those VCs might use
their market power or control rights to squeeze out Angels in later stages. Angels need to seek
alternative exit routes when facing situation like this. One key insight from this theory is that the
bargaining dynamics between Angels and VCs may determine whether the relationship between
them is complements or substitutes.
Our paper builds on these important prior studies by providing large sample empirical
evidence on Angel investments versus PE/VC investments around the world. To the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to use a multi-country private equity deal-level database to
observe the investment behaviors of Angels versus PE/VC funds. In doing so, we not only
document Angel activities around the world, but also show how legal and cultural differences
affect (not intermediated) Angel investors versus (intermediated) PE/VC funds. We provide
evidence that legal and cultural differences around the world have a more pronounced impact on
Angel investors relative to PE/VC investors.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the prior
literature and develops our hypotheses. Section 3 presents the data and our summary statistics,
while section 4 covers the regression analyses and robustness checks. Section 5 discusses some
limitations of the dataset and possible tests. Section 6 concludes and provides an outlook for
future research.

<-----Page 6----->2. Hypotheses

There is extant research confirming the significant role of private equity investments that
are catalysts for the entrepreneurial growth and innovation and thus are spawning the economic
growth around the world (Timmons and Bygrave, 1986; Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Gompers
and Lerner, 1999; Cumming and Johan, 2013; Makhene, 2009; De Beer and Nhleko, 2009). Prior
studies of Angels, however, mainly focus on the U.S. market (Kerr et al., 2014; Dutta and Folta,
2016). Very few have jumped out of this scope to consider the international differences between
Angels and PE/VC funds. Mason and Harrison (2002) was studying the U.K. cases by using
survey methods, Li, Shi, Wu, Wu and Zheng (2015) talks about the Chinese government policies
in promoting Angel investments, Hellmann et al., (2015) is using provincial-level Angel data of
Canada to compare Angels and PE/VC funds relationships, and Ding, Sun and Au (2014)
compares the Angels’ selection criteria in China and Denmark. Most of these studies are singlecountry or two-country comparison analysis of Angels and they did not consider the institutional
differences between Angels and PE/VC funds in an international setting. In the literatures of VC
and entrepreneurship, international studies have discussed that the institutional differences matter
for both financial market and economic development (Cumming and Johan, 2013; Nahata et al.,
2014). However, studies of Angels have not considered such international differences. Our study
fills the gap to investigate how Angels are different from PE/VC funds when making their
investment decisions facing different institutional environments across the globe.
Angel investors have a long history as informal investors in the narrow subset of private
equity market (Lamoreaux, Levenstein and Sokoloff, 2004; Shane, 2009). A current trend for
Angels is to form Angel groups to pool in money to make larger investments like seed-stage VC
funds (Shane, 2012; Kerr et al., 2014), but such format of Angels only account for about 2% of
the total investments they have made (Wiltbank and Boeker, 2007).

7

<-----Page 7----->Prior literature has outlined several major differences between Angels and PE/VC funds.
First, Angels prefer investing in the seed or early stage of the start-ups while PE/VC funds
usually take part in later-stage deals when firms are getting more mature. Second, the investment
screen process is more sophisticated for PE/VC funds that due diligence and term sheet tools will
be used to build their portfolios (Cumming and Johan, 2013). On the other hand, Angels select
projects only based on their personal relationships and relatively informal procedures (Sudek,
2006). Third, the investment amount is way smaller for Angels (Ibrahim, 2008). Although Sohl
(2003) estimated that there are around 300,000 to 350,000 Angels in the U.S. to invest totally
about $30 billion in around 50,000 firms yearly, the average investment amount is only around $1
– 2 million. Fourth, Angels use their own money to invest while PE/VC funds as financial
intermediaries are investing in private firms on behalf of their investors (Avdeitchikova et al.,
2008). In this way, theoretically, they are facing different incentives and constraints where their
investment risk tolerance profile and expected returns are deemed to be different. Aernoudt
(1999) estimated that PE/VC funds are looking for investment project with expected returns
around 35% - 45% while Angels only expect returns around 20%. Fifth, there are different fee
structures for those two types: Angels only pay fees when they are forming groups to make
investments, but PE/VC funds will have management fees plus a carried interest up to 20% - 30%
(Cochrane, 2005). Moreover, according to the survey study of Shane (2005), Angels are not only
investing for financial returns, but also they are investing for other social or economic reasons
such as supporting communities, favoring known partners, finding a job, learning, helping
company succeed and for fun, etc. Angels are also investing their knowledge and time (Chua and
Wu, 2012). It seems the original aim for Angels are quite different from PE/VC funds, they are
investing in the person more than the company and they want the company to succeed but not just
for huge profit from their investments.
Because PE/VC funds invest “other peoples’ money” while Angels invest their own
money, we may expect that Angel investments will be more closely linked to legal, economic,

8

<-----Page 8----->and cultural conditions relative to PE/VC investments, even after controlling for other things
being equal in terms of the types of investments. PE/VC funds are intermediaries between large
institutional investors and entrepreneurial firms, while Angel investors invest their own capital
without the process of financial intermediation. Prior work has well established that PE/VC
activity is positively affected by better economic conditions, better stock market development,
better legal protections for minority shareholders, and cultures favoring entrepreneurship
development (Nahata, 2014).
One important aspect of the legal environment is bankruptcy law. As personal bankruptcy
law is dealing with persons who have become unable to pay off their debts and thus the level of
punishment or forgiveness from this law will be the critical factor to determine the debtor’s
consequences of failure. It is quite related to both Angels and entrepreneurs who would face
similar insolvent situations if unfortunate things happened to their own businesses. It has been
documented that more forgiving bankruptcy law can be understood as a partial insurance contract
offered to entrepreneurs against the consequences of failure (Jackson, 1985; Adler, Polack, and
Schwartz, 2000; Lee, Peng and Barney, 2007). Moreover, bankruptcy law has also been shown to
be related to the credit supply of entrepreneurial activities where less severe bankruptcy laws are
correlated with greater incidence of credit rationing by lenders to small businesses (Berkowitz
and White, 2004) and greater state-level exemptions in bankruptcy law in the U.S. are associated
with an increase in overall entrepreneurship (Fan and White, 2003).
In addition, bankruptcy law will also determine the availability of “fresh start” if any
failures happened to the entrepreneurs (White, 2005). In this sense, forgiving bankruptcy law
which can offer such “fresh start” opportunity from pre-bankruptcy debts will permit
entrepreneurs to enter into the economy again rapidly after business failures (Georgakopoulos,
2002; Landier, 2004; Ayotte, 2007). In fact, such repeat entrepreneurship is not uncommon in
countries where a “fresh start” is permitted (Baird and Morrison, 2005; Stam, Audretsch and
Meijaard, 2008). Under cross-jurisdictional setting, Armour and Cumming (2008) find that

9

<-----Page 9----->“forgiving” personal bankruptcy law has a statistically and economically significant positive
effect on entrepreneurship using self-employment rates. We thus propose that in those countries
with more “forgiving” bankruptcy law change will have positive impacts on the activities of
entrepreneurs and such impacts are expected to be associated with a greater overall level of Angel
investment, and more pronounced relative to the impact on PE/VC activity documented in prior
work (Armour and Cumming, 2006).
The governance structure imposed in a venture capital fund through institutional investor
veto rights, monitoring through annual (or quarterly or semi-annual) reports, and limited
partnership agreements implies that PE/VC fund activities will be less sensitive to behavioral
biases than Angel investors that can act without such constraints and oversight. PE/VC fund
managers face less pronounced risks associated with losing their own money, and have primarily
financial reasons for investment; by contrast, Angels invest directly their own money and may do
so not only for pure financial reasons. We may expect angel investments will be very subject to
cultural conditions of uncertain avoidance. Furthermore, as typically make investment decisions
by themselves, Angels are more likely to be in individualistic societies. Finally, as individuals are
more financially constrained in economic downturns relative to PE/VC funds, and because Angel
investment decisions are made alone are more subject to behavioral biases, Angel investments are
more likely to be affected by economic conditions relative to PE/VC funds.

Hypothesis 1:

Angel investment activity is more sensitive to legal, economic, and
cultural conditions relative to PE/VC investment activity around the
world.

PE/VC funds can provide benefits such as certification, guidance, and network to startups and such certification and endorsement effect has been shown very important for the
investment performances and exits in previous studies (Megginson and Weiss, 1991; Stuart,

10

<-----Page 10----->Hoang and Hybels, 1999; Hsu, 2004; Hochberg, Ljungqvist and Lu, 2007; Hellmann et al., 2015;
Dutta and Folta, 2016). As Angels are different from PE/VC funds in many aspects we have
discussed, they may be lack of the expected expertise and benefits which can bring certification
effect to the investee firms, especially during the divestment stages. Therefore, we expect that, by
controlling international differences, the successful exits rates will be lower for the investee firms
funded by Angels, as posited in Hypothesis 2a:

Hypothesis 2a:

Firms funded by Angels will have lower probability to exit successfully
by IPO or acquisition as compared with firms with PE/VC funds.

Although Angels might not be as good as PE/VC funds to bring start-ups IPO or
acquisition exits, if such company attract Angel investments in its early stage, this still sends a
positive signal to the market and enables further credit through the investments tracking process.
Moreover, it has been documented that PE/VC funds rarely invest in companies who received
Angel funding before, only a very small fraction of those companies will attract PE/VC funding
later on (Shane, 2009). Ibrahim (2008) also found that Angels will try to simplify contract terms
to seek selling companies or attract PE/VC funds to reduce costs. In this sense, if those companies
succeed in IPO or acquisition exits, it is still possible that the certification effect from Angels
exists (Kerr et al., 2014). This is similar to a common view that Angel financing is a “stepping
stone” to obtain venture capital and Angels and VCs are synergistic members of a common
financing ecosystem. The best companies like Google, Facebook and Tesla Motors all benefit
from the combination of these attributes and powerfully illustrate such “stepping stone” logic. We
therefore expect that investee firms who have received Angel investments in the 1st round, they
might have a better chance to exit successfully by an IPO or acquisition, as summarized in
Hypothesis 2b:

11

<-----Page 11----->Hypothesis 2b:

Firms receiving angel investments in the first round will have relatively
higher probability to exit successfully by IPO or acquisition.

3. Data and Summary Statistics

Our analysis exploits the comprehensive data collected at the deal level of investee firms
from PitchBook, which comprise 85,940 completed PE deals in 42,617 investee firms from 96
countries spanning the 1977 to 2012 period. Among those deals, there are 5,397 deals in 4,266
investee firms from 42 countries are involved with Angels (either single funded by Angels or
coinvested/syndicated with PE/VC funds). Such dataset allows us to compare Angel deals and
PE/VC deals at the same time to shed more lights on this underdeveloped area in academia.
In order to provide a detailed picture for how Angel investors evolve as a more and more
important financial source for entrepreneurial firms, Figure 1 and 2 outline both the Angels and
PE/VC funds activities over the period from 1977 to 2012. Over the 36 years period, we can find
that the overall trends for both Angels and PE/VC funds activities are upward-sloping, with small
zigzags which captures the dot-com bubble and recent financial crisis. In terms of the total
number of deals for each year, we can find that Angels present a little different trend as compared
with PE/VC funds. It seems that the number of deals completed by Angels had not been hit too
hard by the recent financial crisis with the total numbers for each year rebounded very quickly.
Combined with the trend for total deal sizes, we can find that Angels and PE/VC funds share a
quite different manner. In Figure 1 for Angels, the total deal sizes are peaked in 2007 and
continued shrinking until recently. While in Figure 2 for PE/VC funds, the total deal sizes trend is
much more synchronized with the total number of deals completed. Angels seems to be more
cautious after the financial crisis than PE/VC funds.

[Insert Figure 1 and 2 About Here]

12

<-----Page 12----->After we have shown the overall picture of both Angels and PE/VC funds activities
during our sample period, we further present some key features of our PitchBook data. Table I
summarizes the key features associated with the sample distribution of completed deals across the
world. Table I Panel A presents the top 10 country distribution for those completed deals in three
separate groups: All Deals, All Angel Deals and All PE/VC Deals. U.S., Canada and U.K. are
always the Top 3 players in all three categories. Most of the Top 10 countries in three categories
are OECD countries in developed markets, but we can find that India and China cannot be
neglected to be the active members from emerging markets. In terms of the industry distribution
for our data, among the Top 10 industries we have listed in three categories, high-growth and
high-tech industries are interchanging their ranks with software industry always ranked No. 1 for
each category. However, we still can find that Angels will prefer investing and involving in deals
in the retail industry which differentiate them from PE/VC funds in these league tables.

[Insert Table I About Here]

In our Table II, we further present the characteristics of Angel-involved deals in 42
countries across the world. We aim to show a detailed picture for how Angels involved in all
rounds, at the 1st round and their successful exit rates, both at the investee firm level and deal
level. In Table II Panel A, we are focusing on the investee firm level characteristics. For each of
those 42 countries who have Angel-involved deals completed, we calculate the total number of
investee firms, the percentage of firms with Angel Financing (at all rounds), the percentage of
firms with Angel Financing (at 1st round) and the percentage of firms with successful exits. On
average, we have shown that about 11% of investee firms in those 42 countries are having Angels
involved, with about 8% of those firms are with Angels in the first round and about 24% of those
investee firms will have successful exits in either IPO or acquisition. In Table II Panel B, we

13

<-----Page 13----->present similar characteristics as Panel A, but with focus at the deal level. As shown in Panel B,
although there are, on average, more than 2,000 deals completed for each country yearly, only
about 7% will be Angel involved deals. This is not surprising as Angel data are rarely available
and therefore our PitchBook data only captures some of the big and prominent players in this
market. Furthermore, only 5% of those deals will be receiving Angel involvement in the 1st round
and about 15% of total deals will have successful exits.

[Insert Table II About Here]

Table III summarizes the main variables in our dataset. We aim to investigate the
preferences of picking investee firms among different investor types. The different indicator
variables of All Angels, Pure Angel, Mixed Angels and PE/VC funds will be our main dependent
variables. The explanatory variables include GDP per capita for the economic conditions, the
domestic stock market capitalization and MSCI returns for each country’s stock market
conditions, minority shareholders protection index for the legal environment, Hofstede’s
dimensions of cultural variables, as well as a variety of control variables to capture investee firm
and industry characteristics.
From our data, we can empirically confirm there are many differences between Angels
and PE/VC funds in different countries and over our sample period. This provides us with a
unique opportunity to explore all the possible reasons behind their investment and divestment
behaviors and to compare those two investor types with each other. Moreover, the PitchBook
database provides detailed information on testing international differences across countries and
over time, which can further shed lights on Angel behaviors.

[Insert Table III About Here]

14

<-----Page 14----->In Table IV, we also present a pair-wise correlation matrix for each of our variables for
this study. Note that our correlations highlight some potential collinearity issues across different
explanatory variables, which we explore in our multivariate empirical tests in the next section.
And we choose the most related and those variables having the most explanatory power in the
following multivariate tests.

[Insert Table IV About Here]

Before we start the multivariate regression analysis, our next step is to show some of the
highlighted details from our PitchBook data, and provide preliminary means difference test
results regarding different characteristics between several subgroups in Table V. In panel A of
Table V, we divide our entire data sample by All Angel Deals versus All PE/VC funds at the first
place. And then we divide the All Angel Deals into Pure Angel and Mixed Angels deals to further
compare different characteristics among those subgroups. Here below we summarize several
interesting results in different categories: First, in terms of deal characteristics, Angels will
always involve in smaller size deals and they prefer involving with active investee firms with
more deal making every year; Second, in terms of investee firm characteristics, we find
interesting results that Angels’ firms have smaller sizes of employees and when PE/VC funds are
coinvesting/syndicating in the same deal, the company valuation are significantly lower than Pure
Angel-involved deals. This is not surprising and is consistent with the “Friends or Foes” theory
proposition that when VC joined the deal in later stage they will lower the company valuation to
squeeze the Angels out (Hellmann and Thiele, 2015); Third, in terms of the country
characteristics differences, Angel deals are quite different in almost all facets we list: they prefer
being in countries with larger entrepreneurial density, wealthier countries with larger stock
market, a little better legal environment and in countries with cultures favoring individualism and
entrepreneurship. Although the means difference tests have shown those characteristics

15

<-----Page 15----->differences are significant, but in actual numbers the differences are trivial which we need to
focus more on the following multivariate tests. Fourth, in the last category of exit outcomes, we
can find that Angels are relatively poor performers in either taking the investee firms going public
or being acquired compared with PE/VC funds who are much more sophisticated investors. The
only subpanel which Angels perform a little better is comparing Pure Angels with Mixed Angels.
It seems coinvestment/syndication does not increase the likelihood to exit successfully. Both
parties fighting for control rights might explain the poor results here.
As we outline several interesting comparison results between subgroups in Panel A of
Table V, we extend our analysis to present more results between U.S. and Non U.S. subsamples.
Combined with the overall trends shown in Figure 1 and 2, we also separate our sample into preand post-financial crisis period to provide a more detailed picture for the data. In the first
subpanel of Panel B in Table V, we show that the U.S. is an active and mature market for
entrepreneurial activities. Although the U.S. deals have smaller sizes and those U.S. investee
firms are relatively smaller and receiving lower company valuations, this market is much more
active in terms of total number of deals per year and have much more Angel activities each year.
The density for both Angels and PE/VC funds activities are much higher in the U.S. as compared
with the rest of the world. The U.S. is a quite different market in terms of country characteristics
in this subpanel which further emphasize the importance of our study to jump out of many
previous studies with focus only on the U.S. Angel market and our study can provide more
evidences to show how Angels and PE/VC funds are different internationally. The only category
we need to highlight is the exit outcome. The U.S. subsample performs worse than counterparties
around the world in terms of successful exits rates.
With regards to the recent financial crisis, in the 2nd subpanel of Panel B in Table V, we
can find that deal making is becoming less and the sizes of deals are shrinking. However, the
Angel market actually is becoming even more active after the financial crisis, the total numbers of
deals are larger and the density of Angel activities is even bigger at the country level. And deals

16

<-----Page 16----->are shifting to occur at wealthier countries with larger stock market, better legal environment.
Moreover, we can find that the recent financial crisis hit the IPO market harder than the
acquisition market as during the post-financial crisis period, the overall successful exits rates
actually increase and this is mainly driven by the increasing rates of acquisition. The IPO rates
significantly declined after the financial crisis and such trend reflects possible prudent and
cautious moods among entrepreneurs, Angels and PE/VC funds to bring private firms public.

4. Regression Analyses and Robustness Checks

Now that we have laid out some of the unique interesting results from our means
difference tests and some consistent findings from other studies, we perform our regression
analyses in this section mainly using clustering PROBIT models by controlling year effects in
addition to controlling the industry and country fixed effects and we report associated marginal
effects on each explanatory variable. We also perform several subsample tests and show several
robustness checks before drawing our conclusions.

4.1. What factors determine Angel investments versus PE/VC investments?

In our main regression analyses as shown in Table VI, we use dummy variables to
indicate different investor type as the main dependent variables. Throughout Models (1) to (4),
All Angels dummy is the major dependent variable and the dummies for Pure Angel, Mixed
Angels and PE/VC funds are dependent variables in Models (5) to (7), respectively. We add
different control variables from various facets in order to test how differently that different
investors prefer choosing investee firms and making their investments internationally. The

17

<-----Page 17----->regressions include control variables for economic and stock market conditions, legal
environments, investee firm characteristics, as well as for Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. The
main PROBIT regression models in Table VI use the following specification:

Dummy Variable of Investor Type = f (Economic and Stock Market Conditions, Legal
Environments, Investee Firm Characteristics, Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions, Industry
and Country Dummies)

Most of the major variables are defined in Table III. Note that there are a large number of
explanatory variables that we could have included but chose to exclude. The primary reasons for
our parsimonious specification are as follows. First, the selected variables are plausibly pertinent
to investment choices across different facets and are chosen for the purpose of testing Hypothesis
1 and the following hypotheses. Second, note that the excluded variables are highly collinear.
Hence, any additional control variables for the available sets of countries and years would not be
perfectly suitable without potentially introducing spurious results into the regressions. Examples
include some of the other dimensions of Hofstede’s cultural variables, as well as other legal and
institutional variables. Our selection and reporting of variables was conducted to assess the
factors that directly capture the differences of investors in different institutional environments
across the world.
In order to present a clear picture for how Angels make investment decisions given
different institutional environments, we add different facets step by step from Model (1) to Model
(4). In Model (1) of Table VI Panel A, we use the natural logarithm of GDP per capita to proxy
the economic condition and the natural logarithm of domestic stock market capitalization as well
as the MSCI returns to proxy the stock market conditions. From Model (1) results, we can find
that Angels prefer investing in and choosing those investee firms in countries with higher GDP
per capita (significant at 1%), smaller stock market (significant at 10%) with higher returns

18

<-----Page 18----->(significant at 5%). The economic significances are also large: Angels will be 12.59% more likely
to involve in deals when there is a 1% increase in the natural logarithm of GDP per capita, they
will also be 3.81% less likely to involve in deals when there is a 1% increase in the natural
logarithm of domestic stock market capitalization and they will be 3.60% more likely to involve
in deals when there is a 1% increase in the MSCI returns.
In addition to Model (1) specification, we add minority shareholders protection index into
the regression Model (2) to capture the legal environments. The minority shareholders protection
index is the coded weighted average index on the ten key legal provisions identified by legal
scholars as most relevant to the protection of minority shareholder rights (Guillén and Capron,
2015): powers of the general meeting for de facto changes; agenda-setting power; anticipation of
shareholder decision facilitated; prohibition of multiple voting rights; independent board
members; feasibility of directors’ dismissal; private enforcement of directors’ duties (derivative
suit); shareholder action against resolutions of the general meeting; mandatory bid; and disclosure
of major share ownership (Lele and Siems, 2007; Siems, 2008). Higher values indicate “better”
degree of minority shareholders’ protection and legal systems. 2 From Model (2) results, it is a
little surprising that the marginal effects of minority shareholders protection index return negative
results (significant at 1%). If there is a 1% increase in the minority shareholders protection index,
the Angel involvement will be 3.03% lower. Angels prefer investing in and choosing those
investee firms in countries of worse legal environment relative to PE/VC funds. As discussed in
Hellmann and Thiele (2015), better legal environment might incur higher costs of contracting for
Angels, in this sense, they might circumvent to reduce such costs and prefer making more deals in
those firms residing in worse legal environments.
As we move on to test any impact from investee firm level characteristics, we utilize two
variables to capture the size and activeness of the investee firm. The natural logarithm of number

environment with more countries and years covered.

19

<-----Page 19----->of employees is used to capture the firm size effect and the number of deals per year for each
investee firm is used to capture the investee firm and entrepreneurs’ activities within a calendar
year. Model (3) in Panel A returns consistent results for other explanatory variables, all signs
remain the same with three variables reducing the statistical significance. For our interested
variable of investee firm characteristics, we find that Angels prefer investing in and choosing
those investee firms with more active entrepreneurs and smaller sizes (both significant at 1%).
The marginal effects of Model (3) also indicate that a 1% increase in the natural logarithm of
number of employees, Angel involvement will be 1.20% lower and a 1% increase in the number
of deals per year will increase the Angel involvement likelihood by 0.62%.
There are more and more international studies finding out that culture dimensions cannot
be neglected in exploring the institutional differences around the world. Following the literatures
confirming that cultural dimensions are related to entrepreneurship at the national level (Shane,
1993; Hayton, George and Zahra, 2002; Cumming, Johan and Zhang, 2014), we choose two out
of six Hofstede’s cultural dimensions: individualism (IDV) and uncertainty avoidance (UAI) in
our study to further control the cultural environment in Model (4) in Panel A. The results in
Model (4) show that national cultural environment seems to have insignificant impact on the
Angels’ investment decisions, other factors such as legal environments, stock market conditions
and investee firm characteristics are more important determinants for Angels’ decisions.
Up to Model (4), we have outlined a picture of how Angels, relative to PE/VC funds,
make their investments decisions and choose investee firms based on different preferences:
smaller firms with active entrepreneurs residing in countries with better stock market returns and
worse legal environments. In the next step, we want to further test whether Pure Angel and Mixed
Angels will have any different preferences. In Model (5) of Panel A, we reserve all the
explanatory variables as in Model (4) with Pure Angel dummy as the main dependent variable,
the results have shown that Pure Angel investors prefer investing in and choosing those smaller
investee firms with active entrepreneurs in countries where stock market returns are higher and

20

<-----Page 20----->legal environment is worse. In Model (6) of Panel A, we re-run the similar regression model with
Mixed Angels dummy as the dependent variable, the results are qualitatively unchanged as
compared with Model (4) for all Angel investors. In the final Model (7) in Panel A, PE/VC funds
dummy is used as the dependent variable. The results have shown the quite different behaviors
from such sophisticated investors like PE/VC funds, relative to Angel investors, they prefer
investing in and choosing larger investee firms with less active entrepreneurs residing in countries
with worse stock market returns and better legal environments. Thus, our Hypothesis 1 is partially
supported from our tests in Table VI Panel A.
Moreover, as a robustness check, we present our regression tests using only the first
round deals to explore the different investor preferences in Panel B of Table VI. As most of the
Angels are involved in early and seed stages of start-up development, it is worthwhile to perform
a subsample test to find out whether their decisions are similar at the initial stages and we expect
the results will be more compelling. Throughout our Models (8) to (14), all the tests are replicated
the specifications from Models (1) to (7) in Panel A, and the results support our Hypothesis 1
fully and the statistical significances are even bigger for the 1st-round deal tests. Angels will have
quite different investment behaviors as compared with PE/VC funds: they prefer investing in and
choosing smaller investee firms with more active entrepreneurs residing in countries with better
economic conditions, smaller stock markets with higher return as well as having national cultures
favoring more individualism and less risk-taking. And the economic significances are much
larger for the 1st round deal tests: given results from our Model (11) as a main example, a 1%
increase in the natural logarithm of GDP per capita will increase the Angel involvement
likelihood by 14.88%, a 1% increase in the natural logarithm of domestic stock market
capitalization will decrease the Angel involvement likelihood by 5.56%, a 1% increase in the
MSCI returns will increase the Angel involvement likelihood by 3.62%, a 1% increase in the
minority shareholders protection index will decrease the Angel involvement likelihood by 2.90%,
a 1% increase in the natural logarithm of number of employees will decrease the Angel

21

<-----Page 21----->involvement likelihood by 1.17%, a 1% increase in the number of deals per year will increase the
Angel involvement likelihood by 3.57%, a 1% increase in the individualism index will increase
the Angel involvement likelihood by 1.28% and a 1% increase in the uncertainty avoidance index
will increase the Angel involvement likelihood by 0.62%.

4.2. Any certification effect from angel investors on successful exits?

After we present the different investment behaviors between Angels and PE/VC funds,
we want to find out how Angels perform from their investments in those investee firms. Are they
receiving higher or lower returns compared with other investors? Since it is hard to get creditable
performance measures like IRRs or performance multiples, we follow previous literatures (Shane,
2005; Wiltbank, 2005; DeGennaro and Dwyer, 2010) to explore the successful exits rates as an
alternative measure for the performances. The successful exits include either an initial public
offering (IPO) exit or a successful acquisition exit. Similar to Table VI, we are using clustering
PROBIT models by controlling year effects in addition to controlling the industry and country
fixed effects in Table VII and our main regression models use the following specification 3:

Dummy Variable of Successful Exits Type = f (Investor Type Dummy, Economic and
Stock Market Conditions, Legal Environments, Investee Firm Characteristics, Hofstede’s
Cultural Dimensions, Industry and Country Dummies)

3

For conciseness, we exclude all control variables which contain the exact same variables in Table VI: LN
of GDP per capita, LN of Domestic Market Capitalization, MSCI Returns, Minority Protection Index, LN
of Number of Employees, Number of Deals per Year, IDV and UAI. These variables are all excluded in
Table VII, VIII and IX.

22

<-----Page 22----->We report the successful exits tests first in Panel A and then perform IPO and acquisition
exits tests in Panels B and C, respectively. We also perform interaction tests of minority
protection index to find out whether better legal environment can help increase the successful
exits performance.
In Panel A of Table VII, all dependent variable across Models (1) to (8) is the dummy
variable indicating the deal is an successful exit, either in IPO or acquisition format. From
Models (1) to (3), all three Angel investor type dummy returns significant negative marginal
effects at 1% level, which confirm our H2a that firms funded by Angels will have lower
probability to exit successfully by IPO or acquisition as compared with firms with PE/VC funds.
The economic significances are thus large that All Angels will be 26.61% less likely to exit
successfully relative to PE/VC funds and for Pure Angel and Mixed Angels, the likelihoods are
18.05% and 31.89% lower, respectively. The certification effect as documented in the literatures
about VCs cannot apply to Angels. Model (4) results confirm the previous view and PE/VC funds
will have 26.61% higher probability to bring investee firms public or through acquisition. In
Model (5), we further include both Mixed Angels dummy and PE/VC funds dummy at the same
time to compare whether the coinvestment/syndication actions with PE/VC funds of Angels will
increase their successful exits rate. Unfortunately, still PE/VC funds certification effect exists.
We have found that only pure PE/VC funds financed firms will achieve better exit outcomes,
those companies do not mix Angel and PE/VC funding, and those results are consistent with the
view that VCs tend to do best when investing on their own (Goldfarb, Hoberg, Kirsch and
Triantis, 2012). And one explanation for these results is driven by the split of control rights
between Angels and PE/VC funds who might aim to obtain more aggressive control rights
(Goldfarb et al., 2012). But note that, if we interact the minority shareholders protection index
with the Angel-related investor type dummy in Models (6) to (8), we can find that better legal
protection can help increase the successful exits rate for Angels, especially for Pure Angels. But

23

<-----Page 23----->the marginal effects become statistically insignificant which lead us to perform additional
subsample tests on IPO or acquisition exits of legal protection impacts.
In Panels B and C of Table VII, the main results stay similar to the results in Panel A that
firms funded by Angels will have lower probability to exit successfully by IPO or acquisition and
the certification effect only apply to PE/VC funds. For example, Panel B results indicate that
Angels will be 8.23% less likely to exit by IPO relative to PE/VC funds and Panel C results
indicate that Angels will also be 20.73% less likely to exit by acquisition relative to PE/VC funds.
Moreover, from our interaction tests in Panels B and C, we can find that legal environment is
very important in shaping a good capital market. From results of Models (14) and (15), better
legal protection of minority shareholders will increase the likelihood for Angels to exit by IPO.
But from results of Models (22) to (24), we cannot find similar results to support that better legal
protection of minority shareholders will increase the likelihood for Angels to exit by acquisition.
Better legal protection of minority shareholders will have a much bigger impact on IPO exits than
on acquisition exits for Angels relative to PE/VC funds.

[Insert Table VII About Here]

Although our tests in Table VII help support our proposition in Hypothesis 2a, we are
still thinking whether Angels might bring any good signals to future investors or buyers. In this
way, we create a dummy variable to capture those firms who have received their 1st-round
funding from Angels and we re-run similar tests of Table VII to explore the possibility of our
predictions. In Table VIII, we include the new dummy variable as the main explanatory variable
with different exit dummies as dependent variables. The results from Table VIII reject our
Hypothesis 2b and show that firms receiving Angel investments in the 1st round will still have
relatively lower probability to exit successfully, especially by an acquisition exit. Although
Model (2) returns negative but insignificant marginal effects, combined with Models (1) and (3)

24

<-----Page 24----->results, we can confirm that the “stepping stone” logic cannot be applied to Angels, at least in our
dataset. And the economic significances cannot be neglected that those firms receiving Angel
investments in the 1st round will be 4.41% less likely to exit successfully, 0.33% less likely to exit
by IPO and 4.72% less likely to exit by acquisition relative to those firms without 1st round Angel
investments.

4.3. What environments will spawn Angel activities?

After investigating the exit performance for Angels as well as PE/VC funds, we extend
our study to perform tests at national level to find out what factors will spawn Angel activities
within a country and what policies might be utilized in the future to promote more entrepreneurial
activities induced by Angels and PE/VC funds. As a first step, we generate several dependent
variables to capture the density of Angels and PE/VC funds activities at the national level. For
example, in Table IX Model (1), the dependent variable is Angel Density (scaled by Total
Population) which is the sum number of all Angel deals within a specific country in a calendar
year and then divide by the total population of this country in that year (in millions). The other
three dependent variables in Models (2) to (4) are created using similar methods, with Model (2)
using total GDP as the denominator and Models (3) and (4) are for PE/VC funds densities. We
use the double clustering OLS models by controlling both investee firm and year effects in
addition to controlling the industry fixed effects but relaxed the country fixed effects to reduce
collinearity issues and our main regression models use the following specification:

Density Variables = f (Economic and Stock Market Conditions, Legal Environments,
Investee Firm Characteristics, Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions, Industry Dummies)

25

<-----Page 25----->We find very consistent results across all models in Panel A of Table IX, higher Angels
density and PE/VC funds density are associated with larger GDP per capita, larger domestic stock
market capitalization, better minority shareholder protection, smaller investee firms with more
active entrepreneurs and with national cultures favoring less individualism and encouraging more
risk-taking. The economic significances are also non-negligible: for example, given results from
our Model (1) in Panel A, a one standard deviation increase in the natural logarithm of GDP per
capita will increase the Angel density by 47.81%, a one standard deviation increase in the natural
logarithm of domestic market capitalization will increase the Angel density by 38.84%, a one
standard deviation increase in the MSCI returns will increase the Angel density by 11.32%, a one
standard deviation increase in the minority shareholder protection index will increase the Angel
density by 26.22%, a one standard deviation decrease in the natural logarithm of number of
employees will increase the Angel density by 6.42%, a one standard deviation increase in the
number of deals per year will increase the Angel density by 4.60%, a one standard deviation
decrease in the individualism index will increase the Angel density by 53.20% and a one standard
deviation decrease in the uncertainty avoidance index will increase the Angel density by 15.52%.
All other models in Panel A of Table IX return similar results with comparable economic
significances. Note that our results are consistent with previous findings in the literatures which
emphasize that some key factors for successful Angel investing will be in the areas with more
supplies of both wealthy people and entrepreneurs as well as located in large cities or tech hubs
where those areas have friendly attitudes towards entrepreneurship (Shane, 2005; DeGennaro,
2010). Our study extended such views on U.S. studies to an international atmosphere which can
help policy makers across the world to build and spawn a healthy farm for both Angels and
PE/VC funds.
Furthermore, we present additional one-year lead dependent variable analysis in Panel B
in addition to the contemporaneous analysis in Panel A of Table IX, the results are robust and

26

<-----Page 26----->consistent. All the main explanatory variables signs and statistical significances did not change
and such effect is very consistent to increase the density of entrepreneurial activities within a
country. Overall, countries with higher GDP per capita, larger stock market, better legal
environment, and having cultures favoring less individualism and more risk-taking will supply
more entrepreneurs and investors. Thus, the density for entrepreneurial activities will be
enhanced.

4.4. Will disclosure regulation change and bankruptcy law change have any impact on Angel
activities?

In order to complement our previous results regarding Angels and PE/VC funds activities
around the world, we further perform difference-in-differences tests to assess specifically the
effects from regulatory changes in specific countries that are associated with more stringent
disclosure rule and more forgiving bankruptcy law changes. Cumming and Johan (2013) found
that more stringent securities regulation is positively associated with the supply and performance
of VC as well as the entrepreneurial spawning induced by VC around the world. More stringent
disclosure rules will enhance the entrepreneurial activities as predicted in their study which
inspire us to perform similar tests in our paper about Angels 4. Following Armour and Cumming
(2008) who found that “forgiving” personal bankruptcy law has positive effect on

4

Following Cumming and Knill (2012), the countries with disclosure regulatory changes in the sample
term examined are: United States (“SOX”; 2002), South Korea (“Addendum to Securities Exchange Act”;
2004), Mexico (“Code of Best Practices”; 2005), Brazil (“Novo Mercado”; 2005); India (“Clause 49”;
2005).

27

<-----Page 27----->entrepreneurship, we carried out a similar search of all bankruptcy law changes across all of the
countries and years covered by our sample 5.
Before we move on to talk about the difference-in-differences analysis results, we first
run preliminary means difference tests in Table X. In panel A of Table X, we compare the
characteristics under the disclosure regulation change. The first subpanel is presenting the results
for all deals, then for Angel deals and PE/VC deals subsequently. We can find that the regulation
change with emphasis on more disclosure will have significant impact with regards to different
characteristics of our sample. After the disclosure regulation change, the total number of deals is
decreasing while the number of Angel deals is increasing, the investee firm company valuation
become larger but those firm sizes are shrinking, the four density variables are all increasing after
the disclosure regulation change indicating such rule change is favorable to foster more Angel
and PE/VC activities. And those trends are consistent for both Angels and PE/VC funds. The
successful exits rates are also declining but such change is mainly driven by the decreasing IPO
exits rates and PE/VC deals performances.
In panel B of Table X, we compare the characteristics under the bankruptcy law change.
Similar to Panel A, we have found quite similar results regarding deal, the investee firm and the
density characteristics, only the exit outcomes return a little different results with the acquisition
rates are increasing after the bankruptcy law change and such change is mainly driven by PE/VC
deals. Moreover, we can find that both regulatory changes are in favor of spawning more
entrepreneurial activities induced by both Angels and PE/VC funds. The four density variables
and the number of Angel deals are significantly higher during the periods after those regulatory
changes and those results are consistent across all means tests in Table X. However, for Angels,
5

Following Armour and Cumming (2008) and the data from International Insolvency Institute, the
countries with bankruptcy law changes in the sample term examined are: Austria, Belgium, Brazil,
Bulgaria, Canada, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong,
Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Philippines,
Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United
Kingdom, United States, Uruguay and Vietnam.

28

<-----Page 28----->both regulatory changes seem not to affect their divestment strategies which infer again that they
are different investor type compared with sophisticated investor type like PE/VC funds. Their risk
profiles and preferences might be totally different.

[Insert Table X About Here]

Table XI reports the difference-in-differences regressions for different characteristics as
dependent variables to test the impact from disclosure regulation change. We are looking for the
key variable (Treat * After) across all models to support our means difference tests of Table X.
From the results of Panel A for all deals, Panel B for all Angel deals and Panel C for all PE/VC
deals, we find that all entrepreneurial activity related variables return statistically significant
results where Model (4) for testing the total number of Angel deals and Models (8) to (11) for
testing four entrepreneurial density variables all return positive coefficients and are statistically
significant at 1% level. We find these difference-in-differences tests to be quite compelling as
they highlight the effect of changes on subsequent entrepreneurial spawning densities, and show
directly that entrepreneurial spawning activities induced by Angels and PE/VC funds are more
pronounced for countries with more stringent disclosure regulation change. Furthermore, the data
also show in Table XI that exit outcomes via IPOs are less likely and this is mainly driven by
PE/VC deals. We have also reported the difference-in-differences regressions results in Table XII
to test the impact from bankruptcy law change. We find qualitative similar results in Table XI
that the difference-in-differences tests results highlight the effect of changes on subsequent
entrepreneurial spawning densities, and show directly that entrepreneurial spawning activities
induced by Angels and PE/VC funds are more pronounced for countries with more forgiving
bankruptcy law change.

<-----Page 29----->5. Limitations

We present for the first time large sample international evidence on Angel deals around
the world. Despite this new step, the data are not without limitations which we hope will inspire
others to work towards in the future. We cannot rule out the endogeneity fully and our dataset
suffers some problems might cause concerns for the results. For example, we cannot identify the
substantial heterogeneity across Angels, we don’t know whether they are a group of wealthy
investors, business angels or some other organizational structures, but given our summary
statistics, the magnitude of the impact we have documented in this study is likely to capture some
of the large and successful Angels in the market.
Moreover, we also do not know all of the angels in all countries around the world; but our
findings are robust to subsamples of the data and randomly kicking out different countries out of
the sample. Our conclusions are based on the data we have from PitchBook, it might be better to
consider other datasets in the future. Our data also have the limitations on variables regarding
financial performances results at the investee firms. If those variables are available in the future,
we can investigate whether Angels or PE/VC funds can bring benefits to those investee firms and
by how much.

6. Conclusions and Future Research Directions

Our analysis exploits the comprehensive data collected at the deal level of investee firms
from PitchBook, which comprise 85,940 completed private equity deals from 96 countries
spanning the 1977 to 2012 period. Within those deals, there are 5,397 deals in 42 countries are
involved with Angels (either single funded by Angels or coinvested/syndicated with PE/VC
funds). Such dataset allows us to compare Angels and PE/VC funds at both the deal and investee

30

<-----Page 30----->firm level at the same time. We find that, relative to PE/VC funds, Angels prefer investing in
active smaller entrepreneurial firms in wealthier countries with better stock market conditions,
worse legal environments and having cultures favored in higher levels of individualism and lower
levels of risk-taking. Such behaviors are robust both for the first round deals and deals at all other
stages. We also find that, relative to PE/VC funds, those investee firms funded by Angels will
have lower probability to have successful exits, in either IPO or acquisition, but better legal
environments can help mitigate the negative effects on IPO exits. Moreover, in our subsample
tests, the “stepping stone” logic of Angels still cannot be proved because we find that firms who
have received Angel investments in the first round will have lower probabilities to successfully
divest in later rounds. At a country/market level, we also find significant determinants which can
work together to build a well rounded environment and spawn both Angels and PE/VC funds
activities. In addition to those results, we also perform difference-in-differences tests to confirm
that more stringent disclosure regulation and more forgiving bankruptcy law changes can also
spawn the entrepreneurial activities induced by Angels and PE/VC funds. Our tests results are
robust under various clustering methods to correct standard errors while controlling fixed effects
and are robust when performing propensity score matching.
Angels still remain as an underdeveloped area in the academia, with more creditable data
becoming available in the future, researchers can explore more in this area to shed more lights on
what Angels prefer, how they make investments, both locally and internationally, where the
preferred locations are, how they syndicate or coinvest with other investors, which financial
contracts they are using to control the rights of the firms, what the real relationships between
entrepreneurs and Angels are, or how the heterogeneity among Angels will have different impact
on their investments, etc.
Our study also has several policy implications which governments of countries around
the world can consider to promote entrepreneurial activities: economic and stock market
development conditions are important, but other factors like cultures, the national attitudes

31

<-----Page 31----->towards promoting entrepreneurship will also be important area to develop. In addition, legal
reforms can also be focused on setting more stringent disclosure regulations and drafting more
forgiving personal bankruptcy laws.

APPENDIX – Selection Problems and Propensity Score Matching Tests

There are worries that possible sample selection bias might cause problems for our exit
outcomes tests results in the study, we use propensity score (PS) matching methods (Rosenbaum
and Rubin, 1983) to address such problems following Lee and Wahal (2004) and after the PS
matching, we generate two subsamples to perform the counterfactual analysis on the exit
outcomes in our study. We want to find the impact of Angel funding against specific alternative
counterfactuals, such as whether the investee firms would have been better off with PE/VC
funding or been worse off with Angel funding.
It is true that PE/VC funds may choose those investee firms and deals which have certain
type of inherent characteristics making them fit their exit strategies as compared with Angels will
do. What if Angels can choose and invest in similar firms and deals like PE/VC funds, what will
be the exit outcomes and is there any certification effect from Angels? Such potential endogeneity
problem and the selection issue maybe particularly important with regards to successful exits and
we aim to address those problems.
First, we perform the PS matching based on the deal sizes and investee firm industries as
PE/VC funds’ selection criteria to match Angels’ to create the first subsample. Then we pose
more strict matching criteria based on all characteristics as presented in Table V to generate the
second subsample. We present the means difference tests results in Table A1 which include the
original unmatched sample differences between All Angel Deals and All PE/VC deals and the
two PS-matched subsamples differences in the other two subpanels. As shown in Table A1, we
can find that as compared with the original unmatched sample, PE/VC funds select quite different

32

<-----Page 32----->deals as the differences between almost all characteristics of theirs are significantly different from
Angels. In the subsequent two subpanels, we can find that, after the PS matching, the two new
subsamples are presenting almost the same characteristics between Angels and PE/VC funds.
Those matched subsamples help us limit the selection bias to some extent. We can move on to
perform our counterfactual analysis to see whether Angels will have certification effects on the
exit outcomes.
[Insert Table A1 About Here]

As the two new subsamples are presenting almost the same characteristics, we are
confident to perform a similar regression test as we did in Table VII. We report our PROBIT
regression results in Table A2. What if Angels were investing in and choosing investee firms and
deals which have almost the same characteristics as those of PE/VC funds, and as previously we
have found the certification effects only apply to PE/VC funds, we propose that Angels could also
have such certification effects on exit outcomes. However, after we perform our subsample tests,
we have found consistent results as we found in Table VII, Models (1) to (3) return similar results
with the marginal effects for Angels dummy are all negative and statistically significant at 1%
level. Angels will be 26.61% less likely to exit successfully in our original sample, they will also
be 41.80% and 41.93% less likely to exit successfully in our two newly PS-matched samples,
respectively. Angels still do not provide any certification effect like their counterparts PE/VC
funds even if they are investing in and choosing investee firms and deals having almost the same
characteristics. It seems that PE/VC funds can bring more expertise to the investee firms and have
higher likelihood to exit their investments by IPO or acquisition. It might be other unobserved
characteristics that can be explained such results but by using propensity score matching methods,
we provide another robustness check for our main results.

GDP per Capita

GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population.
GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the
economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in
the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for
depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of
natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars. Source: World Bank.

LN of GDP per Capita

Natural logarithm of GDP per capita.

Domestic Market Capitalization

The domestic market capitalization of a stock exchange is the total
number of issued shares of domestic companies, including their several
classes, multiplied by their respective prices at a given time from the
World Federation of Exchanges. This figure reflects the comprehensive
value of the market at that time, in M$. Source: http://www.worldexchanges.org/statistics/statistics-definitions.

Minority Shareholders Protection
Index

The minority shareholders protection index is the coded weighted
average index on the ten key legal provisions identified by legal scholars
as most relevant to the protection of minority shareholder rights (as per
Guillen and Capron, 2015): powers of the general meeting for de facto
changes; agenda-setting power; anticipation of shareholder decision
facilitated; prohibition of multiple voting rights; independent board
members; feasibility of directors’ dismissal; private enforcement of
directors’ duties (derivative suit); shareholder action against resolutions
of the general meeting; mandatory bid; and disclosure of major share
ownership (as per Lele and Siems, 2007 and Siems, 2008). Higher values
indicate “better” degree of minority shareholders’ protection and legal
systems.

Hofstede’s index of individualism versus collectivism. The high side of
this dimension, called individualism, can be defined as a preference for a
loosely-knit social framework in which individuals are expected to take
care of only themselves and their immediate families. Its opposite,
collectivism, represents a preference for a tightly-knit framework in
society in which individuals can expect their relatives or members of a
particular in-group to look after them in exchange for unquestioning
loyalty. A society's position on this dimension is reflected in whether
people’s self-image is defined in terms of “I” or “we.” Source:

UAI

Hofstede’s index of uncertainty avoidance. The Uncertainty Avoidance
dimension expresses the degree to which the members of a society feel
uncomfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity. The fundamental issue
here is how a society deals with the fact that the future can never be
known: should we try to control the future or just let it happen? Countries
exhibiting strong UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are
intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas. Weak UAI societies
maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than
principles. Source: http://geert-hofstede.com/national-culture.html.
