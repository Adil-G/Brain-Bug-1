In recent years, companies have increased their use of internal and external sources in pursuit of
a competitive advantage through the effective and timely commercialization of new technology.
Grounded in the resource-based view of the firm, this study examines the effect of a company’s
use of internal and external sources on multiple dimensions of successful technology commercialization (TC). The study also explores the moderating role of formal vs. informal integration
mechanisms on these relationships. Applying a longitudinal design and data from 119 companies,
the results show that internal human and technology-based manufacturing sources are positively
associated with successful TC. Formal and informal integration mechanisms also significantly
moderate the relationships observed between capability sources and TC. Copyright  2002 John

Successful technology commercialization (TC)
is important for survival in today’s competitive
markets (Cooper, 2000). Mitchell and Singh (1996:
170) view TC as ‘the process of acquiring ideas,
augmenting them with complementary knowledge,
developing and manufacturing saleable goods, and
selling the goods in a market.’ This process begins
with product conception; includes the product definition, design, prototyping and pretesting stages;
and is consummated by effective product manufacturing and marketing. Successful TC allows the
firm to satisfy its customers’ needs in terms of
the cost, speed, quality, and newness attributes of
their technologies. However, TC requires strong
and varied capabilities, especially in manufacturing (Ettlie, 1997; Siegel, Hansen, and Pellas,
1995). Manufacturing capabilities are grounded in
the firm’s people, skills, knowledge, processes,
systems, and equipment. These capabilities can

be assembled from different internal and external
sources (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997) and then
deployed to create products and introduce them to
the market in a timely manner.
Despite the growing use of internal and external sources of capabilities, researchers have not
systematically documented the contributions of
these sources to TC. This is especially the case
with manufacturing sources. Consequently, most
of the existing evidence is anecdotal (Eisenhardt
and Tabrizi, 1995). Internal and external manufacturing sources have advantages and shortcomings
that arise from their nature or the way they are
managed (Barney, 1999). Though some shortcomings can be overcome through the effective integration of these sources into TC (Song, Souder, and
Dyer, 1997), empirical evidence is sparse (Ragatz,
Handfield, and Scannell, 1997). This gap in the
literature reflects researchers’ focus on the integration of the manufacturing unit, rather than the
sources of capabilities in TC. Researchers have
also studied the conditions that favor different
sources (Williamson, 1999), emphasizing industry
and competitive conditions (Combs and Ketchen,

1999; Teece, 1986) but have failed to analyze
how companies integrate their internal and external sources within TC. It is also not clear from
the literature how formal and informal integration
mechanisms influence the relationships between
manufacturing sources and the various TC dimensions. Researchers have also selectively analyzed
particular dimensions of TC while ignoring others, overlooking the potential trade-offs among
these dimensions. This article attempts to address
these gaps in the literature by considering multiple
dimensions of TC.
The objectives of this study are twofold. First,
it examines the effect of a firm’s use of internal and external sources on TC. The study analyzes the impact of different manufacturing sources
on TC but does not consider how these capabilities are assembled. Second, it explores the moderating effect of integration on the relationships
between different manufacturing sources and various TC dimensions. Integration involves formal
or informal mechanisms that coordinate the use of
internal and external manufacturing sources within
TC (Song et al., 1997). These sources determine
the type, quality, and deftness of manufacturing
capabilities. These capabilities indicate the firm’s
capacity to perform productive activities (Grant,
1998). The study considers the moderating effects
of formal and informal integration mechanisms on
internal or external manufacturing sources on TC.
This study makes three contributions to literature. First, it recognizes the multiplicity of manufacturing sources and their potential implications
for TC. Second, it simultaneously considers TC
as a multidimensional construct. Prior research has
examined these dimensions separately, resulting in
contradictory findings. Third, the study’s research
design provides insights into the effects of manufacturing sources on TC over time. Prior studies
have used cross-sectional designs, making it difficult to evaluate the long-term effect of manufacturing sources on TC. We use a 3-year lag between
TC dimensions and sources. We also rely on secondary data to capture TC and primary data to
gauge sources, overcoming concerns about prior
results that have used perceptual data.
The next section of the article reviews the literature, highlighting the importance and the multiple dimensions of TC. Drawing on the resourcebased view (RBV), the article advances hypotheses on the relationships between manufacturing
sources and integration mechanisms on TC. The

article then presents a study that empirically tests
these hypotheses, followed by a discussion of
the findings and their managerial and scholarly
implications.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND
HYPOTHESES
Successful TC is multifaceted. It refers to a firm’s
ability to: (1) develop and introduce a large number of product and process technologies (Zahra
and Covin, 1993); (2) create radically new products (Zahra, 1996); (3) expedite the introduction of
these new products to the market (Stevens, Burley,
and Divine, 1999); and (4) create new knowledge
(Leonard-Barton, 1995). We believe these dimensions should be considered simultaneously in order
to understand the factors that influence TC.
Different TC dimensions play different roles in
enabling the firm to develop a competitive advantage. The intensity of a firm’s product introductions refers to the frequent introduction of products
relative to the industry average or key rivals. New
products help a company gain market leadership,
and to achieve growth and profitability (Iansiti,
1995). They also enhance the company’s understanding of its customers’ needs and improve its
responsiveness to the market (Day, 1999). Product radicalness signifies the newness or innovativeness of the products being introduced to the
market (Rosenau, 2001). It enables the company
to develop new markets or capture existing market
share and thereby achieve growth. TC speed indicates a firm’s ability to introduce new products
or technologies more quickly than its competitors.
This allows the firm to flank or attack its competitors, reduce costs, improve quality, absorb new
technologies, expedite learning from customers
(Eisenhardt, 1990; Iansiti, 1995), and improve
new market performance (Calantone, Vickery, and
Droge, 1995). The new knowledge created through
TC also enables the firm to develop radically
innovative products that transform the competitive
landscape.
The RBV suggests that internal and external
manufacturing sources, derived from human or
technical assets and resources (Teece, 1986),
can determine TC success. These sources give
the firm the knowledge it needs to successfully
pursue TC. This knowledge determines TC
success. Though TC is the outcome of several
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 2----->Capabilities and Technology Commercialization
organizational processes (e.g., strategic planning)
and strategic choices (including manufacturing
sources), and processes (e.g., strategic planning),
different manufacturing sources significantly affect
TC dimensions differently. As Figure 1 suggests,
these effects will be moderated by integration, as
discussed in the following paragraphs.

Capability sources and TC
Manufacturing plays a key role in determining a
firm’s competitive position (White, 1996).
Internal and external sources are the foundations of a firm’s manufacturing capabilities (Grant,
1998). These capabilities evolve, reflecting shifts
in technological trajectories, defined as the paths
particular technologies follow over time (Dosi,
1982). These evolutionary paths depend on existing scientific knowledge and are fueled by a quest
for improving a given technology’s performance.
As this technology enters a new phase, some companies experience a mismatch between their existing capabilities and the requirements for successful TC.
The RBV suggests that a company with strong
manufacturing capabilities can enjoy an enduring
competitive advantage and achieve superior performance (Stalk, Evans, and Shulman 1992). These
capabilities enable the firm to develop new products and expedite their market introductions. However, external market factors sometimes constrain

379

the supply of certain manufacturing sources (Dierickx and Cool, 1989). Some manufacturing sources
are not tradable and must be built internally (Barney, 1999). Over time, some internal capabilities
become rigid and limit TC success. Further, in
dynamic markets, exclusive reliance on the internal
sources of manufacturing capabilities have serious
drawbacks. New products are increasingly complex (Leonard-Barton, 1995) and require multiple
capabilities that few companies have internally.
Companies also selectively build certain manufacturing capabilities, leaving them vulnerable
to market shifts. A firm’s internal manufacturing capabilities might also be constrained by its
prior investments, poor management, and internal
process inefficiencies. Capabilities also develop at
different rates and follow different evolutionary
paths, creating significant difficulties in accumulating those capabilities needed for successful TC.
Developing internal sources of manufacturing
capabilities is also a time-consuming and costly
process that may take years. Once assembled,
these capabilities should be kept current. Organizational politics determine those capabilities to
be upgraded, leading to inefficiencies. Overcoming
these inefficiencies requires assembling capabilities from new internal or external sources.
External manufacturing sources enable the firm
to develop needed capabilities quickly, leading
to flexibility and reducing costs (Gil and de la
Fe, 1999). Externally acquired capabilities do not
always fit the firm’s internal systems and processes

(Leonard-Barton, 1995), demanding the retraining
of personnel or changing the flow of the production process. These changes can raise the cost of
operations, create inefficiencies and slow down
TC speed. Some external sources are also easier
for outsiders to imitate. Excessive use of external
sources can also reduce the investments in developing internal manufacturing capabilities, which
can weaken a firm’s competitive position (Lei,
Hitt, and Bettis, 1996). These factors limit a firm’s
potential gains from using external sources. Given
the advantages and shortcomings of the various
sources of manufacturing, there is a need to document their effects on TC success.
Human resource (HR) sources
The HR component of internal manufacturing
capabilities usually includes the knowledge, expertise, talents, creativity, and skills of a firm’s manufacturing personnel (Cohen and Zysman, 1988;
Davenport, 1992). The RBV posits that the unique
skills and experiences of internally based manufacturing personnel can give the firm a competitive
advantage (Lado and Wilson, 1994). This firmspecific, tacit knowledge takes years to develop
(Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995), making it difficult
for others to copy those capabilities that embody
this knowledge (Yeoh and Roth, 1999).
Following the RBV, a firm should maintain
strong internal HR-based manufacturing capabilities in order to gain a competitive advantage.
This can be achieved by recruiting (Ettlie and Vellenga, 1979) and maintaining a well-trained labor
force and managers whose knowledge, skills, and
experience serve as a source of innovation within
manufacturing (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Recruitment also gives the firm access to current techniques and knowledge. New employees’ skills are
also honed through the experiences gained through
learning by doing and the training the firm provides. These experiences also improve TC success by facilitating the development of innovative products (Yeoh and Roth, 1999). Ettlie and
Vallenga (1979) have shown that new employees bring new skills and knowledge to the firm.
This knowledge can expedite the speedy adoption
of innovative technologies, which facilitates rapid
product development and expedites TC. As manufacturing personnel gain experience, they become
proficient in developing new products that expedite TC. These improvements also enhance the
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

efficiency of the TC process, allowing the firm
to reach the market quickly. Skilled manufacturing personnel also help the company by reducing costs, eliminating waste, and shortening the
product development cycle. They also enhance the
flexibility of a firm’s manufacturing operations by
adjusting its new product specifications and expediting TC cycles (Sanchez, 1995). Experienced and
well-trained employees are also better equipped to
implement changes in the internal processes, systems, and technologies needed for successful TC
(Dertouzos et al., 1988). Therefore:
Hypothesis 1: Use of internal HR-based manufacturing sources leads to successful TC.
Some HR-based manufacturing capabilities are
assembled from external sources (Figure 1) by
joining strategic alliances, employing consultants
and outside experts, or maintaining close ties with
universities and other research centers (Ragatz
et al., 1997). External sources fill serious voids in
the firm’s internal manufacturing sources (Teece,
1986), thereby promoting successful TC (LeonardBarton, 1995).
The RBV holds that a firm’s ability to develop
innovative and different uses of external sources
can become a source of competitive advantage.
A company can deploy its external manufacturing sources in ways that expedite TC. Kamath
and Liker (1994) note that the early involvement
of suppliers and exploitation of their skills have
helped several leading U.S. and Japanese companies succeed in TC. Suppliers also improve TC
success by expanding the company’s knowledge
base (Quinn and Hilmer, 1994). Inputs from suppliers also enable the firm to focus TC activities on
those sources that add value to new products while
expediting TC (Dyer, 1996). Interactions with suppliers and other external groups also improve the
manufacturing function’s learning about the industry’s best practices and applying them to TC,
which would enhance the firm’s knowledge base
and TC speed. Therefore:
Hypothesis 2: Use of external HR-based manufacturing sources leads to successful TC.
Technology-based manufacturing sources
A key source of manufacturing capabilities is
the firm’s technological core, systems, assets, and
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 4----->Capabilities and Technology Commercialization
resources (Figure 1). Japanese and Korean companies’ success in TC has been attributed, in part,
to the major improvements they have made in
modernizing their manufacturing technologies and
processes (Kodama, 1995). Companies that use
modern manufacturing technologies are successful
in TC (Dertouzos et al., 1988). Modern technologies give the firm flexibility to manufacture different products and upgrade existing ones (Sanchez,
1995). They also foster other types of flexibility
that expedite TC (Cohen and Zysman, 1988). The
RBV proposes that companies that make effective
use of modern technologies develop unique products and therefore gain a competitive advantage.
Modern manufacturing technologies also enable
a firm to achieve economies of scope and increase
the variety of their products while simultaneously reducing costs through economies of scale
(Sanchez, 1995). These economies ‘exist where
multiple products can be more cheaply produced
in combination than separately’ (Jelinek and Goldhar, 1983: 29). New technologies also facilitate the
rapid sharing of information in the TC process,
which improves TC speed and efficiency. Following the RBV, innovative technologies are expected
to promote successful TC. Therefore:
Hypothesis 3: Use of internal technical manufacturing sources leads to successful TC.
A firm can also use external sources to obtain
modern manufacturing technologies (Lambe and
Spekman, 1997), as noted in Figure 1. The RBV
suggests that these technologies enable the firm
to create differentiated products or lower costs.
Sourcing can also reduce investing in the development of the company’s internal manufacturing
base. Using licensing and outsourcing arrangements gives the company access to highly specialized technologies or processes and standardized components. External sources can also reduce
the costs and the time associated with TC, while
encouraging suppliers to upgrade their technological base (Dyer, 1996). Similarly, outsourcing
or licensing agreements give the firm access to
several components or manufacturing processes,
which would enhance TC success by exploiting
the suppliers’ technologies and knowledge (Bettis,
Bradley, and Hamel, 1992). Therefore:
Hypothesis 4: Use of external technical manufacturing sources leads to successful TC.

The moderating effect of integration
Integration is the process by which the firm coordinates and deploys its different manufacturing
sources in order to achieve successful TC (Grant,
1991). It includes the approaches, systems, and
processes management uses to involve the firm’s
manufacturing staff in the TC process (Song et al.,
1997). This process centers on the deployment
and use of the different internal and external
manufacturing sources within TC. Integration is
a conceptually distinct process from other internal manufacturing-related decisions (e.g., machine
selection), activities or, capabilities that influence
TC success. These variables typically fall under the
input side of the manufacturing process, are functionally based, and relate to production activities.
They also demand specialized knowledge bases.
Iansiti and Clark (1994) propose that the integration of internal and external sources is positively
associated with successful TC. However, some
companies that excel in developing their manufacturing sources and creating important capabilities fail in TC because of ineffective integration.
Manufacturing integration promotes and cultivates
cross-functional skills while understanding the TC
task(s), considering when and how to involve the
manufacturing staff, and selecting effective ways
to harmonize the work of different functions associated with TC. This process requires political
savvy and strong communication, and is usually
grounded in a firm’s culture and the trust that
prevails among its units and employees. Integration corresponds to the transformation (throughput) of the firm’s sources within its manufacturing
operations.
Some companies succeed in obtaining manufacturing resources from internal and external
sources but fail to gain the full benefits of these
inputs because they do not effectively integrate
their manufacturing sources into TC (Ettlie, 1988).
Organizational culture, politics, lack of experience, and poor management may cause this failure to integrate different manufacturing sources
into TC. Thus, the abundance of manufacturing resources does not guarantee that the firm
will excel in, or practice, effective manufacturing integration (Hitt, Hoskisson, and Nixon, 1993).
Conversely, other companies with limited internal sources have maximized their financial gains
from TC through effective integration (Song et al.,
1997). Still, companies with developed internal
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 5----->382

manufacturing sources may tightly integrate the
various functions within their operations, improving the efficient use of the resources employed to
develop capabilities. These capabilities are multifaceted and some may not relate directly to
TC. The effect of this dynamic interplay between
resources and integration within the manufacturing
unit becomes evident in the long run (5 years or
longer), rather than within this study’s time frame.
Consequently, in this study, internal sources and
integration are treated as independent constructs
because of our focus on the use of different manufacturing sources, rather than their creation.1
Figure 1 suggests that the contribution of manufacturing integration to the success of TC will
be greater when integration is high, rather than
when it is low (e.g., Ettlie, 1995; Ettlie and Reza,
1992). Effective integration starts at the earliest
stages (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995) and continues through the entire TC process. The early
integration of manufacturing sources into the TC
process is important because a large percentage of
manufacturing costs (Whitney, 1988), and the features and quality of new products are determined
early in the design stage. Integration also reduces
slack within the TC process (Stalk and Hout, 1990)
and provides the manufacturing staff with information that improves capacity planning and machine
layout decisions (Leonard-Barton, 1992), ensuring TC success. Integration also improves learning
(Iansiti and West, 1997) and makes the overlapping
of the different internal and external manufacturing
sources within TC possible, expediting TC.
When integration of manufacturing sources in
TC is high, the alignment of different internal and
external sources with product specifications will
be stronger than when integration is low (Kahn,
1996). This ensures a problem-free transfer of
new product designs into manufacturing, promoting efficient and speedy TC. When integration is
high, the manufacturing staff can also contribute
to successful TC by: developing ideas for new

products using existing and untapped capabilities,
serving as a learning laboratory for the TC team
(Iansiti, 1995), and reducing costs while improving
manufacturability (Gerwin, 1993).
Integration also improves coordination among
the various groups involved in the TC process.
It increases intergroup interactions (Kahn, 1996)
and encourages joint problem solving and ownership and cross-learning, leading to successful
TC (Ettlie, 1995). Collaboration facilitates the
learning of tacit knowledge, which is firm specific. This learning can increase the firm’s innovation, expedite new product development, and
enhance the radicalness of the firm’s new products. Integration also synchronizes external and
internal manufacturing sources (Leonard-Barton,
1995), improving the firm’s ability to customize
its externally acquired components in ways that
differentiate its products from those of the competition. Customization allows the firm to create
unique technologies that are hard for rivals to imitate. Therefore:
Hypothesis 5a: The effect of internal HR sources
on TC success is significantly higher when integration is high rather than when it is low.
Hypothesis 5b: The effect of external HR sources
on TC success is significantly higher when integration is high rather than when it is low.
Hypothesis 5c: The effect of internal manufacturing technology sources on TC success is significantly higher when integration is high rather
than when it is low.
Hypothesis 5d: The effect of external manufacturing technology sources on TC success is significantly higher when integration is high rather
than when it is low.

The RBV supports the separation of these two constructs (Teece
et al., 1997). Prior researchers (Ettlie and Reza, 1992; LeonardBarton, 1995; Song et al., 1997) also discussed these concepts
as separate constructs, which is consistent with this study’s
position. Further, as reported later, the simple correlations among
measures of integration and sources of capabilities were modest,
with the highest simple correlation being 0.24. Further, we ran an
orthogonal factor analysis with the measures of integration and
internal sources to establish the distinctiveness of these variables.
The multiple measures, as reported later, emerged as separate
factors, suggesting that integration and internal sources were two
different constructs.

Sample
To test the hypotheses, data were collected using
two mail surveys (conducted in 1996 and 1999),
which were supplemented and validated with secondary data. Initially, we identified the names
of 600 established companies. Defined at the 4digit SICs, 20 U.S.-based industries were chosen because of their differences in manufacturing
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 6----->Capabilities and Technology Commercialization
technologies, innovation rates, and profitability.
These variations were desirable in order to provide
a valid test of the hypotheses.
Two criteria were used in developing the sample. First, to avoid problems arising from ‘liability
of newness,’ a company had to be at least 5 years
old. New companies may not have access to many
external sources and often possess few internal
resources, thereby constraining their TC efforts.
These companies usually do not have significant
experiences in all phases of TC, possibly limiting
their gains from TC. Second, given that the need
for integration increases as the firm’s size grows, a
company also had to have at least five employees
in order to minimize the effects of extremely small
company size. Larger companies often have multiple product lines, use multiple external sources and
maintain a specialized labor force, making integration necessary. Very small firms may not face
these issues or have the resources or the established
relationships necessary to gain access to external
manufacturing sources.
Names and addresses of companies and their
senior executives were obtained from multiple
sources including Lexis-Nexis, companies’ annual
reports, and Business Week 1000. Surveys were
mailed to each company’s chief executive officer (CEO) or highest-ranking official, who were
the most knowledgeable about his/her firms’ manufacturing operations (Gerwin, 1993; Hitt and Ireland, 1985) and innovation (Hitt et al., 1996).
In the 1996 survey, two mailings were used. Of
the 600 surveys mailed out, 23 were undeliverable. Completed responses were received from
149 companies, for a response rate of 25.82 percent. This response rate compared favorably with
those achieved in similar studies (e.g., Gupta and
Somers, 1996). The 1999 survey consisted of a
single-page questionnaire that targeted those companies that responded to the 1996 survey. Three
mailings, combined with follow-up calls and emails, yielded 97 completed responses.
Sample representation
We established the representativeness of the sample by comparing responding and non-responding
companies based on their age, size (full-time
employees), and sales volume. t-Tests showed
that the two groups did not differ significantly
in these variables. The χ 2 test also revealed that
industry type and response to the survey were
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

383

not significantly associated. A χ 2 test of the
association between company location (by state)
and response to the survey was not significant.
Finally, t-tests compared early respondents to the
1996 survey (those that sent their questionnaire
in within the first 2 weeks) and later respondents
(those that sent their replies within the third week
or later). Early and later respondents did not differ in their age, size (employees), or responses to
the study’s variables. These analyses supported the
representativeness of the sample. Similar analyses
for the 1999 survey showed no significant differences by company age, size, or location.
Testing for source bias
We safeguarded against source bias by collecting
data from secondary and primary sources. Data for
three of the four dependent variables as well as
company age, size, and industry type came from
different secondary sources. Further, we conducted
the ‘single factor’ test on the 1996 survey data, as
done in some prior research (Simonin, 1999). A
principal component factor analysis of responses to
all survey items yielded 12 factors with eigenvalues of 1.0 or higher. The analysis produced 12 factors rather than one, indicating that source bias was
not a serious concern (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986).
Testing for inter-rater agreement
In 1996, a second copy of the questionnaire
was sent to the vice presidents for manufacturing operations (or equivalent) in each of the 149
responding companies. Completed responses were
received from 67 manufacturing managers. These
responses served to establish inter-rater reliability. We matched the data already received from
their CEOs (or highest-ranking executives) with
the responses of manufacturing managers, as done
in prior studies (Hitt et al., 1996; Zahra and Covin,
1993). We repeated this process in 1999, generating responses from two managers from 56 companies. Responses by the second executive were
correlated with those of their firm’s CEOs (or
highest-ranking executive) on the study’s variables
using the 1996 (r = 0.65, n = 67, p < 0.001) and
the 1999 (r = 0.67, n = 59, p < 0.001) surveys.
This indicated a significant inter-rater reliability on
the study’s key variables. Data collected from the
first (primary) respondents were used in the analyses. Finally, where possible, secondary data were
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 7----->384

collected and correlated with the survey-based
measures, a commonly accepted practice (e.g.,
Zahra, 1996). This analysis showed positive and
significant associations, supporting the validity of
the measures. The results of this procedure are
described next.
Measures
The dependent variables were measured and averaged over the 1997–99 period. The independent
and control variables were measured over the preceding 3-year period.
Dependent variables
We collected data for four TC measures: the number of new products, number of radical new products, number of patents, and TC speed. Data for the
first three measures were gathered from secondary
sources, whereas the data for TC speed came from
the 1999 survey.
Number of new products
We measured this
variable by the number of announcements of
new product introductions each firm made over
the 1997–99 period (e.g., Singh and Mitchell,
1996). The number of announcements came from
Lexis-Nexis, a comprehensive research database
(e.g., Anand and Khanna, 2000; Mitchell and
Singh, 1996). We counted each product introduction only once, even if it appeared in multiple
announcements.
Radical new products
Given the high risks,
costs, and rewards of radical new products
(Cooper, 2000), we reclassified product announcements into radical vs. incremental (Chaney and
Devinney, 1992; Devinney, 1992). Following
past research (e.g., Kotabe and Swan, 1995),
three MBA students independently reviewed all
announcements related to a given product introduction and rated it based on its radicalness (Cooper,
2000). Given that strong disagreements persisted
on the classification of 13 announcements, they
were excluded from the analyses. We coded radically new products as 1 and incremental products
as zero.
Number of patents
We counted the number
of a firm’s patents, using data from the U.S.
Patent Office. Data were available for 103 firms.
Patents are an important measure of a company’s
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

innovation (Narin, Noma, and Perry, 1987), hence
the knowledge created through TC. However,
patent counts did not separate significant from
incremental innovations. Also, some patents did
not generate new products (DeCarolis and Deeds,
1999).
TC speed
Data for this measure came from the
1999 survey. Following the literature (Buzzell and
Gale, 1987), the survey asked managers, ‘Once
your company has developed a new product, how
long on average does it take your company to introduce it to the market?’ Respondents provided data
in months. We validated this measure in two ways.
First, using Lexis-Nexis we found references to the
length of time it took some companies in the sample to develop and introduce new products. Where
information existed for more than one new product, we averaged the figures and used this average
in the analysis. We correlated the information from
secondary sources with the figures gathered by the
1999 survey (r = 0.71, n = 39, p < 0.001). Second, we correlated a statement in the 1999 survey
with the figures that managers reported (in months)
about the speed of their new product introductions. The statement was, ‘Compared to its key
competitors, our company has a shorter product
development cycle’ (1 = strongly disagree vs. 5 =
strongly agree). The correlation was positive and
significant (r = 0.81, n = 97, p < 0.001).
Independent variable
We measured internal and external manufacturing
sources, as follows:
Internal sources
We measured internal manufacturing sources by eight items that were extracted
from the literature (e.g., Hitt and Ireland, 1985;
Lee and Na, 1994). A varimax factor solution
(with an orthogonal rotation) yielded two significant factors, each with an eigenvalue above
1.0. As Table 1 shows, the two factors explained
56.03 percent of variance. The first factor (five
items, α = 0.73) indicated the existence of strong
internal manufacturing-related HR skills among
a firm’s management and employees (Snell and
Dean, 1992). The second factor (three items, α =
0.67) showed the use of external consultants and
temporary employees.
External sources
Fourteen items, also extracted
from the literature (e.g., Dyer, 1996; Lambe and

varimax rotation yielded the three factors presented
in Table 3. These three factors explained 70.21
percent of variance.
The first factor (five items, α = 0.82) captured
the formal coordination between manufacturing
and other functional units in TC (Rauscher and
Smith, 1995). The second (three items, α = 0.73)
indicated the involvement of manufacturing in TC
(Leonard-Barton, 1992). The third factor (three
items, α = 0.73) showed the existence of informal
manufacturing coordination (Kahn, 1996; Kahn

Spekman, 1997), showed the extent of a firm’s
use of external manufacturing sources. An orthogonal factor analysis (with a varimax rotation) of
these items yielded three significant factors. As
Table 2 shows, each factor had an eigenvalue
above 1.0. The three factors explained 66.11 percent of variance.
The first factor (five items, α = 0.74) showed
the existence of strong internal manufacturing
technological resources and facilities (Dertouzos
et al., 1988). The second (five items, α = 0.70)
captured the use of joint ventures and alliances in
manufacturing (Kotabe and Swan, 1995). The third
factor (four items, α = 0.68) showed a firm’s use
of outsourcing and licensing (Quinn and Hilmer,
1994).
Moderator variable
We measured integration in TC by 11 items that
were extracted from the literature (Eisenhardt and
Tabrizi, 1995; Ettlie, 1995; Gerwin, 1993; Kahn,

We controlled for a company’s size, age, industry,
and past performance, as follows.
Company size
The analysis controlled for a
company’s size because of its potential impact
on new product introductions (Yeoh and Roth,
1999) and access to external sources (Mosakowski,
1991). Company size was measured by the company’s full-time employees (e.g.,Yeoh and Roth,
1999).
Company age
The analysis also controlled for
age because established companies had more
access to external sources (Mosakowski, 1991)
and engaged in frequent new product introductions
and patenting (Deeds and Hill, 1996). Age was
measured by the number of years a company has
existed.
Industry type
The study controlled also for
industry type, which could determine the companies’ technological opportunities (Ali, Kalwani,
and Kovenock, 1993; Klevornick et al., 1995).
Abundant technological opportunities might encourage companies to develop a large number of
new products. Industries also varied in the payoff from speedy TC (Ali et al., 1993). They also
differed in the extent of their use of internal vs.
external sources (Teece, 1986); frequency of radically new products (Kotabe and Swan, 1995); and
TC speed (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman,
1990).
Industries were defined at the 4-digit SIC level.
To control for industry type, an industry’s average
score on a given variable was subtracted from a

fabricated metals (3442, 3443, 3465), industrial
machinery and equipment (3556, 3559), computers

related products (3812, 3825, 3826, 3842, 3845).
Past company performance
A company’s past
financial performance was expected to increase
the slack resources available for TC. When
slack resources were abundant, companies were
expected to develop radically new products and
introduce them quickly to the market (Eisenhardt
and Tabrizi, 1995), modernize their manufacturing
base, attract qualified employees, spend more on
employee training, and use different manufacturing
sources. Slack resources were expected to promote

control variable.

ANALYSIS
Table 4 presents the means, standard deviations,
and intercorrelations for the study’s variables.
These figures were based on data from 119 firms.
Given that the need for integration increases with
size, companies with less than 100 employees (n =
19) were excluded. Missing data further reduced
the sample to 119. Table 4 suggests that the
correlations among the dependent and independent variables were consistent with expectations.
Regression diagnostics also revealed a lack of serious multicollinearity among the variables.
We used hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test the hypotheses. In step 1, the control

Hypotheses 1–4
The analyses showed that use of internal HR manufacturing sources was positively and significantly
related to the number of new products (Table 5),
radicalness of new products (Table 6), patents
(Table 7), and TC speed (Table 8). These results
supported Hypothesis 1.
External HR manufacturing sources were also
positively and significantly related to the number
of new products (Table 5) and TC speed (Table 8).
These two results supported Hypothesis 2. However, external HR sources were negatively related
to the number of patents (Table 7) and radicalness of new products (Table 6), which contradicted
Hypothesis 2. Thus, the results partially supported
Hypothesis 2.
The use of internal technological sources (measured by the ‘internal proprietary manufacturing technologies’) was positively and significantly
related to the number of new products (Table 5),
radical new products (Table 6), patents (Table 7),
and TC speed (Table 8). These results supported
Hypothesis 3.
Focusing on external technological sources, outsourcing and alliances were positively and significantly related to new product radicalness and TC
speed. These results supported Hypothesis 4. Outsourcing was significantly but negatively associated with product radicalness (Table 6) and patents
(Table 7), contradicting Hypothesis 4. The use of
alliances and joint ventures had positive but nonsignificant signs with patents (Table 7) and TC
radicalness (Table 8), also contradicting Hypothesis 4. The results partially supported Hypothesis 4.
Hypothesis 5
The results supported the moderating effect of integration, as indicated by the data from steps 3.1
through 3.3 in Tables 5–8. In all cases, adding the
moderators significantly improved the results from
step 2 (p < 0.05). Also, 14 of the 15 moderating relationships were significant (p < 0.05) for
the number of new products. Twelve of the 15
moderators were significant at p < 0.05 and one at
p < 0.10 with TC radicalness. Twelve moderators
(out of 15) were also significant (p < 0.05) in the
case of patents.
Hypothesis 5a suggested that the effect of internal HR sources on TC will be significantly higher
under higher than lower integration. The results
(Tables 5–8) strongly supported this prediction.
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

All interaction terms for manufacturing involvement, formal coordination and informal coordination with internal HR sources were statistically
significant with the number new products, radically
new products, patents, and TC speed.
Hypothesis 5b suggested that the effect of external HR sources on TC will be significantly higher
under higher than lower integration. The results
(Tables 5–8) partially supported Hypothesis 5b.
The three interaction terms for involvement, formal coordination and informal coordination with
external HR sources were significant with the
number of new products. For TC radicalness,
the interaction of involvement with external HR
sources was significant at p < 0.05, whereas the
interaction term for informal coordination was
marginally significant (p < 0.10). The interaction
term for formal coordination was not significant.
The results for patents (Table 7) also showed that
only the interaction term for formal coordination and external HR was significant (p < 0.05).
The interaction terms for involvement and informal coordination were not significant. For speed,
two of the three interactions were significant, the
exception being the interaction term for informal
coordination (Table 8).
Hypothesis 5c posited that the effect of internal
manufacturing sources on TC would be significantly higher when integration was high than low.
The results (Tables 5–8) uniformly supported this
prediction. Whether the dependent variable was
the number of products, radical products, patents,
or TC speed, the interaction terms for involvement, formal coordination, and informal coordination were significant.
Hypothesis 5d suggested that the effect of external manufacturing sources on TC would be significantly higher when integration was high rather
than low. The results supported this prediction.
Tables 5–8 showed that 19 of the 24 interaction
terms for involvement, formal coordination, and
informal coordination were positive and significant, validating our expectations. Nonsignificant
interactions included alliances and joint ventures
with informal coordination (Tables 5 and 6), and
informal coordination and outsourcing (Table 7)
with patents. For speed (Table 8), the four interaction terms for involvement and formal coordination
were significant, but the two interaction terms for
informal coordination were not. Thus, with 79.2
percent of the interaction terms being positive and
significant, Hypothesis 5d was supported.

company with the knowledge needed for successful
TC. The results suggest that strong internal technical manufacturing capabilities lead to successful
TC. Given these significant results, investments in
and the development of internal HR and technical manufacturing sources should be a managerial
priority.

Step 3.1

The analyses also highlight the importance of,
and challenges associated with, using external HR
manufacturing sources. These sources significantly
improve the number of new products and TC
speed. Likewise, outsourcing and alliances facilitate new product introductions and speedy TC.
However, the results also show that firms might
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 16----->Capabilities and Technology Commercialization
have to trade off the radicalness of their new products and patents as they intensify their product
introductions and the speed of these introductions,
especially when using external sources. Specifically, external HR sources are negatively associated with TC radicalness and patents. The data also
indicate that outsourcing is negatively related to
new product radicalness and patents. Given that
the number of patents and new product radicalness
capture a firm’s ability to develop new knowledge, the negative coefficients observed in this
study signal a serious loss of proprietary knowledge because of a company’s reliance on external
sources. Outsourcing and other external sources
adversely influence the development of tacit and
firm-specific knowledge necessary for radical innovation that yields new knowledge. In contrast,
frequent new product introductions and speedy
TC can be achieved through incremental product
and process innovation. However, it takes time
to acquire, assimilate, and deploy external knowledge. Transforming a firm from imitation to radical
innovation also takes years to occur. Radical innovation and new knowledge creation also require
considerable learning by doing to develop requisite knowledge. External sources may not yield
tacit knowledge, either because acquired items
are standard components or are sold without suppliers’ sharing their knowledge with the firm.
Tacit knowledge is not easily transferred in formal market transactions and substantial effort is
needed to assimilate this knowledge (Zahra and
George, 2002).
Integration of capability sources
Integration emerges as a strong and significant moderator of the relationship between
manufacturing sources and TC. Thus, the effect of
the manufacturing sources on different TC dimensions is higher and significant when integration
is high. Three key points are evident from the
results. First, both formal and informal integration is important but the contributions of formal
integration are clearly identifiable in this research.
Informal coordination adds significantly to the
explanatory power in the regressions in two out
of four cases (number of new products and radically new products). 19 and 18 of the 20 interaction terms for involvement and formal coordination, respectively, are significant. Conversely, 12
of the 20 interactions for informal coordination
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

393

are significant. Formal coordination yields greater
synergies between internal and external capability
sources, which promotes TC.
Second, the moderating effects of integration are
also stronger for internal human and technological sources than external human and technological
sources. All 12 interaction terms for internal and
external HR sources are positive and significant.
Companies that develop internal HR and manufacturing sources gain significantly in TC, especially when integration of manufacturing sources
in TC is high. These firms can combine different resources and skills that increase the firm’s
combinative knowledge that creates radically new
products and patents and achieves speedy TC. Integration of internal sources also yields the resource
combinations and proprietary knowledge that facilitate successful TC.
Third, informal integration mechanisms do not
help in assimilating external sources to the extent
they do internal sources. 7 of the 12 interactions
for external HR and 19 out of 24 interactions for
external technological sources are positive and significant, showing that integration of internal and
external sources can be beneficial in terms of TC.
Some organizational cultures promote the sharing of knowledge among the firm’s units regarding internal sources. Common and well-understood
routines that permeate organizational units also
facilitate communication, generating combinative
knowledge and fostering learning by doing.
There are several factors that limit the role
of informal integration in assimilating external
sources. These sources often embody tacit and different knowledge bases that are not easily comprehended by the recipient firm. The use of multiple
external sources also constrains a firm’s ability to
decipher and understand the knowledge embedded
in these sources. Informal integration also necessitates trust based on shared experiences and goals.
The suppliers of some external sources do not fully
understand or share the recipient firm’s goals, complicating the integration of different sources. Informal, and often post hoc, integration may not suffice
to overcome these critical shortcomings. For example, though informal coordination may facilitate
the sharing of sensitive information in alliances
and joint ventures, it may not suffice to integrate
the knowledge gained from these transactions into
the TC process.
The above observations highlight the limits of
transaction cost and RBV explanations of the
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 17----->394

S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen

differential use of internal and external sources
(Steensma and Corley, 2001). Transaction cost and
RBV analyses usually ignore the role of a firm’s
absorptive capacity in assimilating external sources
of knowledge (Zahra and George, 2002). Reliance
on economic criteria to make sourcing decisions
also obscures the need for adaptation and learning
in order to benefit from externally acquired products, components, or knowledge. Sourcing decisions should also recognize the importance and
costs of organizational learning and the evolution
of capabilities as an outcome of the various phases
of the TC process.
Limitations
The above discussion urges caution in interpreting our results. Even though the sample represents
its target population, it does not cover all U.S.
manufacturing industries and the results may not
apply to all sectors of the economy. The study has
also examined the relationships between manufacturing sources and integration with TC, ignoring
other functions. The focus on the extent rather than
the process of integration is another shortcoming.
Finally, the study did not probe a company’s motivations for using different manufacturing sources.
Still, the results make several contributions to the
field, as discussed below.
Contributions to the literature
Empirically, this article recognizes and measures
four dimensions of TC. Prior research has examined selected dimensions of TC, possibly overlooking the trade-offs that might exist among these
dimensions. In contrast, this study provides a richer
understanding of the relationships among these
dimensions while setting the stage for exploring
their influence on a firm’s competitive advantage
and performance. Another contribution is linking internal and external manufacturing sources
to the four TC dimensions and developing measures of several internal and external manufacturing sources as well as informal integration. A
third contribution is using multiple data sources to
gauge the study’s various constructs, while using
a 3-year lag between the independent and dependent variables. This overcomes a limitation of
prior research that has employed cross-sectional
designs and used data gathered from a single
respondent.
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The article also contributes to theory development. It examines manufacturing integration
within TC, which is different from the integration of the manufacturing function or unit into
the firm’s planning or strategy formulation process.
Focusing on integration moves us closer to where
it can significantly influence a firm’s financial performance. Similarly, studying internal and external
manufacturing sources has implications for conducting thoughtful analyses of a firm’s boundary
decisions and the locus of its productive activities, which is a fundamental issue in the study of
strategy (Williamson, 1999). Further, though the
concept of integration has commanded great interest in the literature, this study has analyzed the
various formal and informal mechanisms that a
firm can use to integrate various sources of knowledge with its TC process. The results inform future
theory development on the efficiency of formal
vs. informal integration mechanisms, especially in
terms of their impact on TC.
The article also highlights knowledge creation
as an important dimension of TC, thereby connecting research on manufacturing capabilities with the
knowledge-based view of the firm (Grant, 1998).
Concerns have been raised about the boundaries
and potential contributions of the RBV (Priem
and Butler, 2001; Barney, 2001). Even though
the article offers a test of the propositions of
the RBV within the TC and manufacturing arena,
its results show a need to go beyond this perspective and investigate the role of knowledge
in creating dynamic capabilities that foster successful TC. In particular, the article links TC
dimensions with the growing literature on the
knowledge-based theory of the firm. This article
departs from the literature by suggesting that decisions related to TC and sourcing decisions should
incorporate criteria that consider their potential
effect on knowledge creation and exploitation.
TC is a knowledge-intensive process that requires
managers to consider internal or external resources
based on their potential effects on a firm’s knowledge base (Lee, Lee, and Pennings, 2001).
Managerial implications
The results also highlight the importance of having strong internal manufacturing sources for successful TC. This requires patient investments to
acquire new skills and upgrade existing ones.
Strategic audits should also enable executives to
Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002)

<-----Page 18----->Capabilities and Technology Commercialization
identify the firm’s internal resources and explore
ways to develop the manufacturing capabilities that
improve TC success.
Managers need also to develop strong HR-based
manufacturing skills that ensure successful TC.
Internal HR sources improve learning by doing,
yielding the tacit knowledge essential for TC. The
strategic value of internal HR sources is further
highlighted by the weak and negative associations observed between external HR manufacturing
sources and some of the TC measures. Excessive use of external HR manufacturing sources
may also cause companies to lose opportunities
to develop the proprietary and tacit knowledge
needed to introduce radically new products. While
the use of external sources is a competitive necessity today, managers should identify the critical
resources and capabilities that should be developed
internally.
Integration also significantly influences the number and radicalness of a firm’s new products. It
improves the contributions of the internal technical
and HR manufacturing sources to TC and offsets
some of the shortcomings of the external sources
of technical and HR sources. Importantly, formal
coordination is more important for TC success than
informal coordination. Managers can establish the
mechanisms that encourage the involvement of the
firm’s manufacturing activities within TC by using
specialized and cross-functional task forces that
combine and coordinate the use of different manufacturing sources.
Implications for future research
Our analyses indicate that different internal and
external manufacturing sources significantly differentially influence TC dimensions. The four TC
dimensions analyzed in this article offer different
but complementary paths to various types of competitive advantages. The specific links between
these four dimensions of TC and different sources
of competitive advantages should be explored in
future studies. Research on this issue can capture
the complementarities (or trade-offs) that might
exist among different TC dimensions. A formal
meta-analysis of TC dimensions can also clarify
the relationships among TC, integration, and company performance.
The distinction between internal and external
sources is a thorny issue. With recent changes in
the way firms assemble their diverse capabilities,
Copyright  2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

395

we need to revise existing definitions of internal vs. external sources. The complexity of the
transactions involved and ownership systems that
might exist in today’s business environments suggest that a new classification of these sources
would be beneficial. Once such distinctions are
made, researchers can examine the systems and
processes employed to integrate internal and external sources and the factors that influence such integration. Future research can also identify industry
and firm-related factors that influence the integration of internal and external sources of manufacturing capabilities. Finally, the processes by
which this integration occurs within TC should
be examined. Toward this end, the domain and
measurement of integration should be clarified and
the contextual variables that influence the associations between integration and TC should be
investigated.

CONCLUSION
Technology commercialization is an important
means for gaining market share, satisfying
customers’ needs and achieving profitability. Our
results show that a company’s internal human
and technological sources are important for
successful TC. Further, some external sources
(both human and technological) are conducive
to successful TC. The contributions of internal
and external manufacturing sources, in particular,
to TC increase significantly with the use of
formal integration. The pay-off from informal
coordination in enhancing TC success is higher
with internal than with external technological
sources. The results invite future empirical
research into the effect of integration of
manufacturing sources on TC.
