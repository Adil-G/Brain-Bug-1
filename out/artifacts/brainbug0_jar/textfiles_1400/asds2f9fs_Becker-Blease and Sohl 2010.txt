The Effect of Gender
Diversity on Angel
Group Investment
John R. Becker-Blease
Jeffrey E. Sohl

We examine the impact that gender diversity has on angel group investment behavior for a
sample of 183 group-years between 2000 and 2006. Our evidence suggests that gender
diversity is a significant predictor of group investment behavior, and that the proportion of
women angels in the group has a negative though nonlinear effect on investment likelihood.
These data are most consistent with a situational interpretation that women invest differently
when they are in the small minority compared with other situations. These results have
important implications for the availability of funds for women entrepreneurs and call for
greater participation of women investors in the angel marketplace.

Introduction
Securing equity capital is important for the success of entrepreneurial ventures (Carter
& Rosa, 1998; Cassar, 2004; Gaston & Bell, 1988; Mason & Harrison, 1992; Wetzel,
1986). Although equity investments come in many forms, an emerging consensus is that
angel capital is particularly critical for early-stage success (GEM, 2001; Harrison &
Mason, 2000; Sohl, Van Osnabrugge, & Robinson, 2000; Sohl, 2003). However, as
highlighted in a recent special issue of Venture Capital: An International Journal of
Entrepreneurial Finance (October, 2008), comparatively little is known about the angel
market, due in large part to its invisible nature (Mason & Harrison, 2008).
Angels who participate in a formal organization or group have received considerable
attention, in part, because they are relatively easy to identify. Several researchers have
suggested that angel groups are also of growing economic importance. May (2002) and
May and O’Halloran (2003), for instance, discuss the increased professionalism of the
angel market as it transitions from one that is largely invisible and dominated by individuals to one with organized groups (or syndicates). Preston (2004) notes a similar
increase in the role of groups and the enhanced sophistication they bring to the angel
market while Mason (2006) argues that angel groups have become significant components
for the development and maintenance of the entrepreneurial economy.
Despite their comparative ease of study, many questions remain regarding angel
groups including the effect of gender on angel group investment behavior. Some empirical

degree of confidence, social capital, and risk tolerance, which can affect their tendency to
make investments into new ventures.1 This can lead to a relation between angel group
investment and its gender composition. Similarly, angel group composition can affect
situational forces in the form of stereotype threat, which can lead to changes in investment
behavior.2 In this paper, we examine these possibilities for a sample of angel groups
between 2000 and 2006.
This work is important for several reasons. First, investments into early-stage ventures
are most commonly made within a close network (Boden & Nucci, 2000; Brush, Carter,
Gatewood, Greene, & Hart, 2004; Carter, Brush, Greene, Gatewood, & Hart, 2003;
Greene, Brush, Hart, & Saparito, 2001; Harrison & Mason, 2007) and homophily, or the
tendency to interact with others who are of similar socioeconomic status, race, age, and
especially sex, is an important determinant of the network composition of entrepreneurs
(Franke, Gruber, Harhoff, & Henkel, 2006; Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1954; McPherson,
Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001; Ruef, Aldrich, & Carter, 2003). Evidence suggests that
women entrepreneurs have more restricted networks than do men, and that these networks
are comprised disproportionately of members of the same sex (Aldrich, 1989; Brush,
1992, 1997). This tendency toward sex-based homophily appears to extend to the seeking
of angel capital. In particular, Greene et al., Harrison and Mason, and Becker-Blease and
Sohl (2007) report evidence of sex-based homophily in the angel and venture capital
markets with entrepreneurs predominantly seeking capital from investors of the same sex.
Thus, if women entrepreneurs are more likely to be aware of and seek funding from angel
groups with more women investors, and these angel groups invest differently compared
with other groups, then women entrepreneurs may have different access to crucial earlystage funds than do men.
This work also provides new evidence on the role of women in the angel market.
Brush, Carter, Greene, Hart, and Gatewood (2002), Amatucci and Sohl (2004), and de
Bruin, Brush, and Welter (2007), among others, have called for a more thorough understanding of women’s role in the angel market as both entrepreneurs and investors. This
study provides new insights into the effect that women angels have on angel group
investment behavior. Finally, Ahl (2006), Campbell (2005), and Petterson (2005), among
others, have suggested that research into entrepreneurship will benefit from a heightened
awareness of how context and structure affect the market. This study provides new
evidence of how group composition, as measured by the gender diversity of angel investor
groups, influences the overall performance of the group.
In the next section, we discuss the theory and develop our hypotheses. We then
describe the sample and methodology, followed by a discussion of the results. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results and conclude.

Literature Review and Hypothesis Development
Framework
Ahl (2006), following Harding (1987), suggests that feminist theory can be classified
into three general areas: liberal, social, and poststructuralist. Liberal feminism, sometimes

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->called the situational perspective, posits that men and women begin with equal potential
and that differences manifest as a result of systematic inequalities in education, employment opportunities, social networks, and experience (Brush, 1997; Carter & Allen, 1997;
Cliff, 1998; Fischer, Reuber, & Dyke, 1993; Liou & Aldrich, 1995). Social feminism, or
the dispositional perspective, suggests that different social experiences have led men and
women to develop different yet equally valid self-perceptions, motivations, and belief
structures. Poststructuralist feminism, in contrast, is less concerned with what gender is
than with what effects gender construction has on the social order. Consistent with this
third perspective, Carter, Williams, and Reynolds (1997) suggest that the important
question is not whether the situational or dispositional perspective best explains observed
patterns, but rather whether both provide important insights into the nature of women’s
experience.
In this paper, we examine how the dispositional and situational perspectives can
jointly provide insights into the investment behavior of angel groups. We hypothesize that
differences in confidence, risk aversion, social capital, and susceptibility to stereotype
threat will result in different investment behavior for men and women angels, which will
manifest in a relation between the proportion of women participating in an angel group
and the investment pattern of that group.3

Confidence
Although investors may invest for many different reasons, Barber and Odean (2000)
report that most individual investors hold portfolios consistent with active investment
management. Active investment management is premised on the identification of mispriced securities and is a function of the investor’s confidence in their perceived ability to
develop and capitalize on firm- or industry-specific knowledge. As such, confidence
regarding investment ability will be an important factor in determining investment
patterns.
Perceived ability and actual ability can diverge. A substantial literature suggests that
individuals are overconfident in that they overestimate the precision of their knowledge
(Fischhoff, Slovic, & Lichtenstein, 1977; Lichtenstein & Fischhoff, 1981) or the probability of favorable future events (Ito, 1990; Weinstein, 1980). Overconfidence is generally an issue of calibration and is therefore particularly severe for difficult tasks with
limited or sporadic feedback (Fischhoff et al.; Griffin & Tversky, 1992), such as investments into entrepreneurial ventures.
Although there is no direct evidence on the existence of overconfidence among angel
investors, one can glean its likely existence by understanding that most angels are highly
successful cashed-out entrepreneurs or entrepreneurially minded business executives.
Kirzner (1973) and Venkataraman (1997) argue that entrepreneurs are susceptible to the
same cognitive biases such as overconfidence as are other investors and Gervais and
Odean (2001) show how attribution bias engenders overconfidence among successful
investors. Given their previous entrepreneurial or investment success, it is plausible that
angel investors are overconfident. Consistent with this assertion, Zacharakis and Shepherd
3. The differences framework is not without controversy. Kantor (2002), Bird and Brush (2002), and Marlow
and Patton (2005), for instance, argue that the research should seek to further develop theory beyond
investigations of differences. Further, as discussed by Ahl (2004, 2006), Leitch and Hill (2006), and Harrison
and Mason (2007), the dichotomous nature of the differences framework can contribute to perpetuating the
perception or assumption of differences, despite empirical evidence to the contrary. However, given the early
state of the angel literature in this area, we feel the differences framework is informative and appropriate.

overconfident.
In general, gender and confidence appear related. For instance, women are reported to
have lower confidence in “male-oriented” tasks such as mathematics (Mura, 1987), spatial
tasks (Rosenfield & Stephan, 1978), and business (Barber & Odean, 2001). This tendency
of lower confidence is easily understood within the context of the Gervais and Odean
(2001) model if, as Beyer and Bowden (1997) suggest, women begin with a lower degree
of attribution bias than men. The authors argue that if women begin with lower confidence
in their ability to succeed at male-oriented tasks and women have lower attribution bias,
then high performance will be attributed to “unstable causes” such as luck or effort, while
poor performance, which is consistent with expectations, will be attributed to lack of
ability. By comparison, men will overly associate superior performance to personal ability
and poor performance to unstable causes. As a result, women will develop and possess
lower levels of overall confidence for achieving a given level of success, ceteris paribus,
in certain tasks than will men.4

Risk Tolerance
Risk tolerance is an important determinant of human behavior. Baumrind (1991) and
Byrnes (1998), for instance, argue that people cannot successfully adapt to their surroundings by avoiding all risks. Rather, individuals must make choices regarding the quantity
and characteristics of risks they wish to bear. A substantial literature, summarized by
Byrnes et al. (1999), suggests that men and women differ in their tolerances for bearing
risk.
Felton, Gibson, and Sanbonmatsu (2003), and Watson and McNaughton (2007)
suggest that explanations for different risk tolerances can be grouped into biological and
sociocultural explanations. Biological explanations are couched primarily in an evolutionary parental investment framework, as for instance in MacDonald (1995), and Buss
and Schmitt (1993). That is, sex-differentiated patterns of parental investment lead the
low-investment parent (typically the male) to relatively benefit from risk taking, neophilia,
and exploratory behavior, while the high-investment parent, typically the female, will not
find such behavior advantageous.
Other researchers stress the role of socialization in the determination of risk tolerance.
Krimsky and Golding (1992) and Slovic (1992), for instance, suggest that the perception
of risk is inherently subjective. Indeed, Flynn, Slovic, and Mertz (1994) and Byrnes
(1998) argue that sociopolitical and environmental factors, such as status and power,
influence tolerance for risk and that exposure to these factors varies by sex. Risk tolerance
is an important determinant of investment choices. Risk tolerance is associated with
willingness to make investments (Barsky, Juster, Kimball, & Shapiro, 1997; Keller &
Siegrist, 2006), the riskiness of those investments (Kimball, Sahm, & Shapiro, 2007), and
the frequency with which one trades (Fellner & Maciejovsky, 2007). In addition, evidence
suggests that the different perceptions of risk between men and women are sufficiently
material to affect investment behavior (Cohn, Lewellen, Lease, & Schlarbaum, 1975;
Riley & Chow, 1992) and performance (Sunden & Surette, 1998; Watson & McNaughton,
2007).

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->Social Capital
Social capital is a broad concept generally dealing with access to resources through
reciprocal dealings within an interpersonal social network. The concept is widespread
throughout the social sciences due in part to the theoretical works by Pierre Bourdieu
(1991), James Coleman (1988), and Glen Loury (1977) and can exist at the macro
(Coleman, 1990; Putnam, 1995a, 1995b) or micro level (Bourdieu, 1980; Erickson, 1996;
Lin, 1999, 2001). In relation to entrepreneurship, micro-level social capital, also known as
relational or individual, is frequently identified as particularly important. Burt (2000), for
instance, argues that social capital can provide access to customers, suppliers, and potential investors and Aldrich (1999) and Maula, Autio, and Murray (2003) contend that social
capital is a vital component to value creation. The empirical evidence is generally consistent with social capital’s importance to entrepreneurial success (Davidsson & Honig,
2003; Shane & Cable, 2002; Watson, 2007; Zhang, Souitaris, Soh, & Wong, 2008).5
Social capital is likely more nuanced than simple binary connections. Granovetter
(1973), for instance, discusses the differences between strong and weak ties, wherein
weak ties, in essence, provide information but a lesser sense of reciprocity or reliability
and strong ties provide dependable and potentially multifaceted support. Cook and Whitmeyer (1992) suggest that both forms of ties are important to success and Davidsson and
Honig (2003) provide support for this hypothesis by finding that both “bridging” social
capital (weak ties) and “bonding” social capital (strong ties) are essential for early-stage
entrepreneurial success.
While there is substantial evidence of the importance of social capital and its effect on
entrepreneurship, the evidence concerning the impact of sex on social capital is less clear.
The preponderance of the evidence suggests that men and women have different networks
and social capital. For instance, Moog and Backes-Gellner (2009) find in a sample of
5,000 university students that women possess significantly less social capital than men.
Greve and Salaff (2003) find that women entrepreneurs’ use of kin is higher than that of
men. Burt (1998) contends that social capital can be measured by the relative degree to
which social contact networks are constrained and finds that women typically have limited
social capital even after attaining senior ranks. Similarly, Munch, McPherson, and SmithLovin (1997) and Ibarra (1997) report significant differences in the network composition
of men and women. In particular, the nodes (or social actors) in men’s networks typically
provide both social support, in the form of friendship and encouragement, and instrumental support in the form of access to resources. Women, by contrast, tend to rely more on
other women to provide social support and men to provide instrumental support. Consistent with this pattern, Aldrich and Sakano (1995) find that women frequently rely on
third-party brokers to access necessary resources, suggesting more restricted instrumental
support. Thus, women’s social capital may differ from men’s due to both the number of
nodes as well as the form of the ties.
Whether these differences in social capital affect women’s business success is less
clear. A substantial literature suggests that women have impeded access to early-stage
financing (Aldrich, 1989; Becker-Blease & Sohl, 2007; Brush, 1992; Brush, Carter,
Gatewood, Greene, & Hart, 2001; Greene et al., 2001; Olm, Carsrud, & Alvey, 1988).
However, Aldrich, Elam, and Reese (1997) and Renzulli, Aldrich, and Moody (2000) find
limited evidence that differences in social networks affect business survival or performance. Indeed, Aldrich et al. suggest that differences in networks may benefit women
entrepreneurs.

<-----Page 5----->While the preponderance of the attention on social capital focuses on the entrepreneur,
Brush et al. (2002), Carter et al. (2003), and Sohl and Hill (2007) emphasize that social
capital is not just important from the entrepreneur’s perspective (as a demander of capital),
but also from the investor’s perspective (as a supplier of capital). That is, a critical element
to successfully investing in new ventures is the quantity and quality of the deal flow. They
suggest that social capital may be an important determinant of deal flow, but note the lack
of empirical investigation.
Some preliminary evidence can be gleaned from Harrison and Mason (2007), who
note that although the source of deal flow between men and women investors is similar,
men tend to rely more heavily on active personal searches while women rely more heavily
on business associates, lawyers, and accountants. This result is consistent with Burt’s
(1998) assertion that the social capital relationships of men and women are different. As
a result, while men can rely on relationships to directly identify viable investment opportunities, women must rely on “borrowed” social capital in order to identify viable investments. One implication, which Harrison and Mason identify as untested, is that women’s
involvement in the angel capital market may be impeded relative to men.6

Impact on Angel Investment Behavior
Confidence, social capital, and risk tolerance are generally accepted as having a direct
impact on investment behavior. Camerer and Lovallo (1999) and Barber and Odean
(2000), for instance, contend that market entry and participation are functions of the level
of investor confidence, where lower confidence is associated with less willingness to
invest. Similarly, Fellner and Maciejovsky (2007) show that individual risk attitudes are
systematically related to investment behavior with greater risk aversion being negatively
associated with market activity. Finally, Brush et al. (2002), Carter et al. (2003), and
Harrison and Mason (2007) suggest that social capital is related to the quality and quantity
of deal flow to angels. Thus, if women angels are systematically lower than men in their
confidence, social capital, or risk tolerance, then they will be expected to be more reluctant
investors, ceteris paribus.
In general, angel groups either invest as a single organized group with pooled
resources or in smaller ad hoc groups and individually. As described more thoroughly in
the next section, our convenience sample is comprised almost exclusively of the latter type
of group in that each angel is free to make individual investment decisions.7 As such, we
believe that the individual differences in risk aversion, social capital, and confidence will
manifest in a direct impact on overall group investment. In particular, if gender is an
important determinant of these forces, then we expect to observe a relation between the
proportion of women angels and the investment behavior of the larger angel group. Thus,
the relation between gender and group investment behavior is an indirect relation caused
by different individual levels of risk aversion, social capital, and confidence. This leads to
our first two related hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: The proportion of women angels in a group is negatively related to the
likelihood of a proposal receiving funding.
6. Conversely, it is possible that women angels have achieved heightened social capital due to their success.
See, for instance, Glaeser, Laibson, Scheinkman, and Soutter (2000) and Ball, Eckel, Grossman, and Zame
(2001).
7. Angels may not necessarily have the option of making no investments as group rules or culture may require
some minimum number of investments. We are aware of no such rules that limit investment.

<-----Page 6----->Hypothesis 2: The proportion of women angels in a group is negatively related to the
likelihood of member angels funding any proposals.

Stereotype Threat
Stereotype threat is the pressure individuals feel when they are at risk of confirming
negative stereotypes (Inzlicht & Ben-Zeev, 2000, 2003; Steele & Aronson, 1995). Predominantly associated with minorities, stereotype threat typically manifests in the threatened group responding by confirming the stereotype. For instance, Fredrickson, Roberts,
Noll, Quinn, and Twenge (1998) and Brown and Josephs (1999) find that females’
performance on math exams is worse when taken in a context that reinforces negative
stereotypes, but identically when taken in other contexts. McGuire and Padawer-Singer
(1976) suggest that simply being in a context that makes the minority aware of their status
is sufficient to trigger awareness. For instance, a small group of women engineering
students in a male-dominated class will be reminded of their status by sitting in the same
classroom. The effect can become particularly large for individuals or solo-status
(McGuire, McGuire, & Winton, 1979). However, Inzlicht et al. (2006) suggest that the
converse can also be true. That is, as the minority representation increases in an environment, minorities become less aware of their status and are more likely to act according to
their natural disposition rather than based on stereotypes.
Many stereotypes exist concerning women in business including their lower business
acumen, lesser willingness to compete, and low risk tolerance. If having minority status in
angel groups activates women’s stereotype threat, this can manifest in women angels
having less confidence about investing overall and being less willing to make a given
investment. However, Inzlicht et al. (2006) suggest that this effect will be nonlinear. That
is, as the proportion of women increases, stereotype threat will dissipate. This leads to our
second set of hypotheses:
Hypothesis 3: The proportion of women angels will have a negative, nonlinear
relation to the likelihood of a proposal receiving funding.
Hypothesis 4: The proportion of women angels will have a negative, nonlinear
relation to the likelihood of member angels funding any proposals.

Sample and Methodology
Mason and Harrison (1999) and Brush et al. (2002) highlight the difficulty of obtaining data on angel investors. Angel markets are not formalized markets with easily obtainable participant lists and angels are generally reluctant to identify themselves. Harrison
and Mason (2007) and Becker-Blease and Sohl (2007) address this issue by focusing on
angel organizations called Business Angel Networks or groups. These angel groups are
comprised of angels who join with other angels in an organized form. Groups provide a
method for angels to pool resources, reduce search and transaction costs, and mitigate
adverse selection and agency costs (Sohl et al., 2000). Although the question arises of
whether results for groups can be generalized to angels as a whole, Van Osnabrugge
(1998) argues that angels who participate in groups are sufficiently similar to allow
generalizations.
The most complete database of angel groups in the United States is collected by the
Center for Venture Research (CVR). This longitudinal database is based on annual surveys
July, 2010

7

<-----Page 7----->of angel groups beginning in 2000. Each group is contacted multiple times each year using
different media. The data come from a survey completed by either the CEO or lead
member of the management team of the group. The questionnaire contains two sections:
the characteristics of the angel organization and the characteristics of the individual
investors who are members of the organization. The operational practices of the groups
include industry preferences, membership and participation rates, yield rates, deal sourcing, and related investment activity. Member investor characteristics include stage preference, due diligence procedures, valuations, deal size, and participation by women
entrepreneurs and investors.
The responding groups include significant differences with respect to size (number of
members), organizational structure (highly organized with formal bylaws to informal
collections of angels), regions (geographical diversity), investment objectives (sector
specific to a wide range of sectors), and age (organizations founded over a decade ago to
those in the last few years). Overall, we believe that this sample represents a broad
cross-section of angel groups between 2000 and 2006.
We received responses from between 33 and 47 angel groups per year, representing a
response rate of 21% to 36%. The total number of angel investors represented in the
annual survey ranged from 1,685 to 5,021, of which roughly 10% were women. The
proportion of women angels per group ranged from 0% to 100% across most years. This
pattern is similar to that reported by Becker-Blease and Sohl (2007), Sohl and Hill (2007),
and Harrison and Mason (2007).
To get a better sense of the range of women’s participation in the sample angel groups,
we divide the pooled time-series cross-section groups into six classifications depending on
the proportion of women angels in the group. We report the frequency of observations
in the first row of Table 1.
We find that the majority of groups have 0% to 25% women angels (164 of 183 groups
with all necessary data). In addition, we note that groups with greater than 50% women
are predominantly women-only groups as we have one group with 80% women and one
with 90% women. We report the mean (median) values of various test and control
variables for each of these six groups.

Results
Two-Limit Tobit Analysis
Hypotheses 1 and 3 concern the likelihood of investment. We measure likelihood
based on the proportion of submitted proposals that receive funding, or the Yield. As a
proportion, Yield is bounded at 0 and 1. Under many situations, ordinary least squares
(OLS) estimates on bounded data will not lie within the bounded interval. One possible
solution is to transform the variable via a log-function. Alternatively, a two-limit Tobit
model, originally presented by Rossett and Nelson (1975) and discussed more thoroughly
in Maddala (1992) and Long (1997) can be fitted, and marginal effects calculated at the
mean. We follow this second procedure throughout, but note that results are robust to
alternative techniques.8
The test variable for hypothesis 1 is the Proportion of Women Angels, which is
predicted to have a negative sign. We test the basic relation between Proportion of Women
Angels and Yield in the presence of annual indicator variable (unreported) and present the
8. Indeed, given that our data contain very few actual limit observations (0,1), OLS estimates can be
informative and concur with our transformed and Tobit analyses.

<-----Page 9----->results in model (1) of Table 2. Consistent with our predictions, we find that higher
proportions of women angels are associated with a lower probability of a venture receiving funding.

Controls
We next include several control variables that may affect the relation between the
Proportion of Women Angels and Yield. Many angel investors are only interested in
funding ventures with high-growth potential, such as technology-related investments.
Greene et al. (2001) report that women entrepreneurs are concentrated in the service and
retail sectors that often do not offer the high-growth potential early-stage investors seek.
If women entrepreneurs have a greater propensity to submit relatively low-growth potential proposals, such as for retail-oriented businesses, then, given homophily in the seeking
process, groups with more women angels may receive a disproportionate number of
low-growth and thus unattractive proposals. We control for this by including the variable
Retail, which is the proportion of all funding provided that is awarded to retail ventures
and expect a negative coefficient estimate.9
Groups with more women angels may also receive proposals that differ systematically
in their stages of development. For instance, if women entrepreneurs start ventures with
fewer resources and have greater difficulty securing alternative forms of early capital
(Brush et al., 2002; Buttner & Rosen, 1988; Coleman, 2000; Fay & Williams, 1993;
Greene et al., 2001; Riding & Swift, 1990), then they may submit earlier-stage proposals
than men, which are relatively less attractive. Again, given homophily in the seeking
process, this pattern could result in women-dominated groups receiving a disproportionate
number of very early stage proposals and thus result in a higher rejection rate. To control
for this possibility we include the variable Early Financing, which is the proportion of
funding provided to entrepreneurs reported as “seed,” “start-up,” or “early-stage” and
expect a negative coefficient estimate.
Although unexplored in the literature, women angels may also have access to
lower levels of resources, notably investable funds, compared with men angels. As a
result, they may be forced to be more discriminating in their investment choices. To
control for investable funds, we include the variable Log(Total Group Investments),
which is the natural log of the product of the average investment made by the groups
and the total number of investments made. We expect this coefficient estimate to be
positive.
An additional explanation for differences in investment rates is differences in the
motivation to join an angel group. Although many angels join strictly to identify
promising investment opportunities, anecdotal evidence suggests that some angels join
for social reasons as well.10 These more social-oriented angels may be less inclined to
make an investment. Social benefits are likely the greatest for the larger groups,
and therefore, in order to control for this possibility, we include the variable Log
(Total Number of Angels), which is the natural log of the count of all member angels
within a group during a given year. We expect a negative coefficient estimate for this
variable.

9. The CVR database does not contain the proportion of retail proposals submitted. We therefore elect to use
the proportion of retail proposals funded assuming that portals that make frequent retail investments are more
likely to receive a high proportion of retail proposals.

Dependent variables are all defined at the group level and include in Panel A Yield, which is defined as the ratio of all proposals funded to the total proposals submitted;
in Panel B,WOB(MOB) Yield, which is the ratio of number of women(men)-owned business proposals funded to the total proposals submitted; and WOB(MOB) Prop,
which is the ratio of number of women-owned business proposals funded to the total number of proposals funded. The test variable is Proportion Women Angels, a
continuous measure of the ratio of women angel investors to total angel investors within a given group and Proportion Women Angels2, which is its square; Retail, which
is the proportion of all funding provided by the group made to retail-oriented business plans; Early Financing, which is the proportion of all funding provided by the
group made to businesses in the “seed” or “start-up” stages; Log(Total Group Investments) is the natural log of the total value of financing provided by the group during
the fiscal year; Log(Total Number of Angels) is the natural log of the count of all angels involved in the group during the year; Log(Average Funding Requested) is the
natural log of the total amount requested from the group during the year; Women Seek Rate is the proportion of all deals submitted that were submitted by WOBs. Each
regression also includes annual indicator variables, and reports the marginal effect evaluated at the mean and the robust standard error in the parentheses.

<-----Page 11----->Finally, we include a series of indicator variables to capture the gender of the person
completing the survey to control for any gender bias in the response as well as annual
indicator variables to capture any temporal patterns.11
We report the coefficient estimates in model (2). Similar to earlier evidence, we find
a negative relation between Yield and Proportion Women Angels. Retail, Early Financing,
and the Number of Angels are also negatively related to yield, consistent with retail
proposals being comparatively unattractive investment opportunities, angels preferring
more seasoned proposals, and larger groups attracting less active angels. Conversely,
groups with more investable wealth accept a higher proportion of proposals.
In model (3), we include an additional control for the amount of funds requested. It is
possible that since women entrepreneurs typically start with fewer resources, they may
systematically request different levels of funding that may affect the group’s willingness
to fund the proposal.12 Again, with the presence of homophily, these proposals are likely
to be made disproportionately to groups with women angels. Forty sample group-years
have missing data for this variable, reducing our sample size from 183 to 143. We find that
the inclusion of this control variable does not affect our overall result.
In model (4), we directly investigate whether the proportion of proposals submitted by
women (Women Seek Rate) affects the Yield or the relation between Proportion Women
Angels and Yield. Due to missing data, our sample is reduced from 183 to 172. Our
primary result is unaffected by the inclusion of this control. Overall, models (1)–(3) are
consistent with a dispositional effect leading to a negative relation between Proportion of
Women Angels and Yield.13

Analysis of Nonlinearity
Hypothesis 3 suggests that the negative relation between women’s presence in angel
groups and the investment likelihood of the group will be nonlinear. We examine this
hypothesis in models (5)–(8) by including the square of the Proportion of Women Angels
and expect a positive coefficient on the square term. The results in all specifications are
consistent with the negative effect of women’s presence in angel groups dissipating.
Further, in unreported categorical analysis, we find that once women’s presence exceeds
10%, the relation between Yield and Proportion of Women Angels is positive and that
all-women groups have similar yields to all-men groups. This evidence is consistent with
the presence of a gender-based situational effect within our sample of angel groups,
consistent with the predictions of hypothesis 3.

Robustness Analysis
We are concerned that due to the reoccurrence of sample groups across multiple years
we may have an unobserved heterogeneity problem. Treating the data as a panel can help
11. It is possible that since the person completing the survey is also a participating angel, there may exist
collinearity between the gender dummy variable and our independent variable. We test the pairwise correlation and find although it is significant, its value (0.20) is below the traditional threshold of concern. Results
are robust to the exclusion of this indicator variable.
12. We do not assume that women may request more because it is unclear whether women elect or are forced
to launch businesses with fewer resources.
13. We examine the pair-wise correlations of all independent variables. The highest correlation exists
between group total investments and the number of angels (0.43) and the proportion of women angels and
Woman Seek Rate (0.52). These are beneath traditional thresholds of concern for collinearity. In addition, we
estimate the variance inflation factors and none exceed 1.58, suggesting that multicollinearity is not altering
the results.

12

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->to address this issue. However, we note that the panel is unbalanced and although a group
can potentially appear up to seven times in our sample, none actually do. Indeed, 49
groups appear only once, 25 appear twice, 15 appear three times, 6 appear four times, and
3 appear five times. To investigate whether unobserved heterogeneity affects our results,
we limit the analysis to the 49 groups that appear more than once in the sample and
re-estimate the relation as a panel (with 134 observations). Our fundamental result of a
negative relation between Yield and Proportion Women Angels and a positive coefficient
on the square term persists. In addition, we separately examine the 49 groups that appear
only once as well as the first year of data for each of the 98 unique groups (to remove
multiple observations of a group) and find similar results.
Becker-Blease and Sohl (2007) report evidence consistent with homophily in the
seeking and to a lesser extent the awarding of angel capital. In particular, they find that
angel groups with a relatively high proportion of men (women) angels are more likely to
receive funding requests and to fund proposals from men (women). Homophily could
offer an alternative explanation to the nonlinear relation if the effect is stronger for women
than for men.14 Specifically, if a greater proportion of women angels leads to a higher
submission rate by women entrepreneurs and women angels potentially favor these
proposals, then the dispositional aversion to investing may be overwhelmed by the
homophily-based desire to invest.
We provide evidence on this possibility in Panel B by examining the relation
between Proportion of Women Angels and its square on the investment rates into proposals from women entrepreneurs (WOB Yield) in model (9) and men entrepreneurs
(MOB Yield) in model (10). Similarly, in models (11) and (12), we examine the relation
to the proportion of all funded deals that go to women entrepreneurs (WOB Prop) and
men entrepreneurs (MOB Prop). If homophily in the awarding of capital explains the
documented nonlinear effect, then we expect to find a positive coefficient on Proportion
of Women Angels in model (9), which we do not find. Similarly, if women angels are
systematically less willing to fund proposals from men, then we expect a negative linear
effect, and therefore an insignificant square term in model (10) as the effect will not
dissipate. Again, we fail to find this result. Finally, if there is systematic homophily in
the awarding process, we expect to find a positive coefficient on Proportion Women
Angels in model (11) and a negative coefficient in model (12). We fail to find either of
these results. Thus, overall, our results are consistent with a situational effect explaining
the nonlinearity.

Analysis of Participation Rates
Most angel groups do not require members to make investments during each period.
Within our sample, in fact, the mean (median) proportion of angels who make at least one
investment during a given year is 48% (49%), suggesting that over half remain latent. We
define Participation Rate as the ratio of the number of angels who make at least one
investment during a given year to the total number of angels who belong to that group.
Given that angels have individual discretion with their investments, hypothesis 2 predicts
that due to lower confidence, social capital, or risk tolerance of its members, groups with
a higher proportion of women angels will have a lower participation rate. Similarly,
hypothesis 4 predicts that the negative relation will be nonlinear.
14. Although we are aware of no empirical support for this contention, it is plausible especially if some
women angels are more likely to join groups for the explicit purpose of helping other women than are men.

Dependent variable is the ratio of number of angels who make at least one investment to the number of angels in the portal.
The test variable is Proportion Women Angels, a continuous measure of the ratio of women angel investors to total angel
investors within a given group; Retail, which is the proportion of all funding provided by the group made to retail-oriented
business plans; Early Financing, which is the proportion of all funding provided by the group made to businesses in the
“seed” or “start-up” stages; Log(Total Group Investments) is the natural log of the total value of financing provided by the
group during the fiscal year; Log (Total Number of Angels) is the natural log of the count of all angels involved in the group
during the year; Log(Average Funding Requested) is the natural log of the total amount requested from the group during the
year; Women Seek Rate is the proportion of all deals submitted that were submitted by WOBs. Each regression also includes
annual indicator variables, and reports the marginal effect evaluated at the mean and the robust standard error in the
parentheses. *, **, *** denote statistical significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Our tests of hypotheses 2 and 4 are similar to those for hypotheses 1 and 3. We use
Tobit analysis and test the relation in a simple and multivariate framework controlling for
other factors that might affect participation. We report the results from these tests in
Table 3.
Models (1)–(3) test hypothesis 2 and models (4)–(6) test hypothesis 4. We find in both
the simple and multivariate settings that the Proportion of Women Angels is negatively
related to the Participation Rate in all specifications and this relation is nonlinear. Similar
to the results with Yield, we find in unreported categorical analysis that for groups where
women represent 10% or more of angels, there is a positive relation between Proportion
Women Angels and Participation Rate.

Discussion and Limitations
We hypothesize that systematic differences between men and women in confidence,
risk tolerance, and social capital will lead to an inverse relation between the proportion of
14

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->women angels participating in an angel group and the investment likelihood (hypothesis
1) and participation rates (hypothesis 2) of the angel group. Our evidence is consistent
with these hypotheses in that in each specification, we find that the higher the proportion
of women angels in a group, the lower is the proportion of proposals receiving funding and
the lower is the proportion of angels who make at least one investment. These results are
consistent with the evidence that women investors, in general, have less confidence than
do men investors (e.g., Barber & Odean, 2001), are comparatively less risk tolerant (e.g.,
Barsky et al., 1997), and/or possess lower levels of social capital (Burt, 1998).
We next examine whether the relation between the proportion of women investors
and the likelihood of making a given investment (hypothesis 3), or any investment
(hypothesis 4), is nonlinear due to the reduced stereotype threat associated with higher
representation of women within the group. Our evidence is consistent with these
hypotheses and supports the assertion of Inzlicht and Ben-Zeev (2000, 2003) and Inzlicht et al. (2006), among others, that stereotype threat exists but diminishes in certain
environments.
On the surface, our evidence is consistent with both a situational and dispositional
effect of gender on the investment behavior of angel groups. The dispositional effect,
represented in hypotheses 1 and 2, is supported by the negative coefficient on the presence
of women angels. The situational effect, represented in hypotheses 3 and 4, is supported
by the significance of the square term in each specification. However, when considered in
combination, we believe the evidence favors a situational rather than dispositional explanation. If the reluctance of groups with more women angels to make investments is due to
a dispositional effect, we are aware of no explanation outside of homophily for the effect
to be nonlinear. However, our data are inconsistent with the homophily explanation in that
the functional form of the relation between the proportion of women investors and yield
is similar for both men and women entrepreneurs.
In contrast, the situational perspective based on stereotype threat is consistent with a
U-shaped relation. If being in a weak minority leads to stereotype threat and therefore
greater reluctance to invest, and this effect dissipates as the environment changes, then one
would observe not just an attenuation of the effect, but a reversal as women angels
returned to their dispositional behavior. This latter is the pattern that we document with
both investment and participation rates. Indeed, in both sets of analysis, we find that once
women represent at least 10% of a group, their investment and participation behavior
begins to resemble that of men. Thus, while it remains plausible that there may be some
dispositional differences between men and women angels, the interpretation that is most
consistent with our data is that any effect due to gender diversity of angel groups is
predominantly a situational effect.
These results support the basic contention of Ahl (2006), Campbell (2005), and
Petterson (2005) that context or situational elements are an important, though often
overlooked, dimension of women’s business experience. In this particular instance, the
situational effect is interesting not only for its presence, but also for the speed with which
it apparently dissipates. That is, at a relatively low rate of representation (10%) the
likelihood of a given entrepreneur receiving funding begins to return to the all-men/allwomen group averages of about 25%. If stereotype threat is the explanation for
this relation, the results suggest that women angels seem particularly resilient to this
phenomenon.
One explanation for this resiliency could be women angels’ high degree of selfmonitoring. Inzlicht et al. (2006) define self-monitoring as “the desire and ability to
control one’s self-expressions in order to cultivate a desired public image” (p. 325).
Women angels’ previous success as entrepreneurs or executives may indicate high selfJuly, 2010

15

<-----Page 15----->monitoring ability and Inzlicht et al. find that high self-monitors are particularly resilient
to stereotype threat. This is an interesting avenue for future research.
We acknowledge certain limitations related to the study. First, we lack deal-specific
information about either the entrepreneurs or angel investors and thus we are unable to
determine whether deal quality is similar across the various angel groups. This introduces
a potential endogeneity problem.
We have limited data on the composition of the groups. Since we do not know the exact
composition of the groups, we cannot know with any degree of certainty whether sample
angels belong to more than one angel group and whether entrepreneurs present proposals to
more than one group, which may compromise the independence of our observations.
However, given the wide geographic dispersion of the groups and their varying industries
of interest, the fact that there is frequently a fee associated with belonging to angel groups
as well as one to present to the group, and the important role that social networks, which are
limited, play in matching entrepreneurs and angels, we believe this issue introduces limited
concerns with the independence of the cross-sectional observations.
We also lack specific information on the internal operations of the groups, such as
their reviewing process or investment objectives. To the best of our knowledge, in all
instances angels are free to independently elect whether they make a particular investment; these are not group decisions. This assertion is supported by the fact that in only six
group-year observations are all angels within a group reported to have made an investment
during the year. Although our understanding is that even in these six instances, the angels
had individual discretion, our results reported throughout are robust to the exclusion of
these six observations. A second issue related to internal operations is whether some
groups are explicitly more committed to providing investments, rather than an information
forum. If group investment objectives vary with gender diversity, we face an omitted
variable problem.
We are also unable to disentangle whether confidence, risk tolerance, and social
capital differ between men and women. We rely on an indirect grouped test for these
dispositional differences and although we hypothesize and find evidence of a difference
between men and women (hypotheses 1 and 2), we are unable to investigate whether
individual attributes differ between men and women.
In addition, we do not know the extent to which our results can be extrapolated. That
is, although we have a sample that is diverse in geography, size, and composition, we do
not know how representative the sample is for the underlying population of angel groups.
As such, we cannot necessarily speak to the relation between gender diversity and
investment behavior for all angel groups. Further, this paper offers no insights into the
investment behavior of individual angels.
Finally, we rely on the CEO/contact person to provide accurate data on the group’s
characteristics and investment activity during a given year. Although we do not have an
alternative source to verify the coding, we have some evidence that the data are reliable
and valid. First, we note that all data are single-item, face-valid measures of discrete facts,
or as Rossiter (2002) defines them, “Concrete Attributes,” for which single-item measures
are appropriate. The reliability of the data can be gleaned from test/re-test analysis.
Although we have only a single observation for each group-year, we do have multiple
observations for 49 groups across two or more years. For this subsample, we can examine
the inter-responder reliability by examining the correlation across years of the same
responder versus those groups in which a different person completed the survey in
different years. We find no systematic pattern that same-responders are more likely to give
similar answers than different-responders. Similarly, we contend that we face limited
concerns with the common method variance problem (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &
16

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 16----->Podsakoff, 2003) because the questions are face-valid questions with little ambiguity and
in most instances, although it is possible that respondents did not recall or report annual
data, we have no reason to believe the variance would be large or nonrandom. Although
there may be a socially desirable response to some of our questions, we note that our
questionnaires are non-face-to-face, which Martin and Nagao (1989) and Richman,
Kiesler, Weisband, and Drasgow (1999) argue mitigates the problem. Finally, we expect
that if this inclination leads to a systematic bias, it is most likely in the direction of a more
egalitarian-appearing group, which will bias towards finding no differences among men
and women angels.

Implications and Conclusion
The most important implication of our study is for entrepreneurs seeking vital,
early-stage capital. Our evidence suggests that not all angel groups invest in the same
manner and the demographic composition of the group, at least as it relates to gender, is
important. However, too many questions remain to draw normative conclusions from
these data. That is, although we document a significant relation between angel group
gender diversity and investment likelihood, it is unclear whether gender is the cause of this
pattern. For instance, although our data suggest that an entrepreneur is least likely to
receive funding from a gender-diverse group when women represent a small minority, we
cannot speak to the other potential benefits that such groups might provide. For instance,
there is an extensive literature on the impact of group diversity on performance (see Kerr
& Tindale, 2004, for a survey) and it is possible that although the probability of funding
is lower, the probability of a funded venture being nurtured to success might be higher.
This remains an important avenue for future research.
This research also provides important support for efforts to encourage greater participation of women investors in the angel market, especially in the form of predominantly or
all-women groups (Abramson, 2001; Hudson, Kenefake, & Grinstead, 2006). The benefit
of these groups is not that they will favor women entrepreneurs’ proposals; our evidence
suggests that they will not. However, our evidence suggests that when women angels have
a sizeable representation within an angel group, their investment tendency will mirror that
of men. As a result, if women entrepreneurs, due to homophily, are more likely to know
about and seek funding from groups with more women, and these groups invest at rates
similar to groups that receive high proportions of proposals from men, then this will help
to insure equality of access for women entrepreneurs to vital early-stage capital.
This research also leaves many questions unanswered. First, it remains unclear
whether men and women angels have dispositional differences in risk tolerance, confidence, and social capital. Although our evidence suggests that differences potentially
exist, one would require specific measures of these three attributes to determine whether
a difference exists. This is an interesting area for future examination.
Similarly, although we have elected to partition angel groups based on gender composition, it is possible that the relation with gender is spurious and that some other,
currently unidentified, variable is driving the observed relation between gender diversity
and investment behavior. Potential alternative explanations include the experience of the
angels, the form of the angel group, and the diversity of proposals reviewed. A more
detailed examination of proposals received and the review process in general is warranted.
Finally, we have hypothesized that stereotype threat is the cause of any situational
effect. It is possible that some other situational force or group dynamic, as likely affecting

efforts should seek to better disentangle this question.
Overall, this article contributes to the broader field of entrepreneurship by providing
some preliminary evidence that gender diversity may affect the investment pattern of
angel groups. Although this research ultimately poses more questions than it answers, we
believe this is an important and under-investigated area of entrepreneurship.
