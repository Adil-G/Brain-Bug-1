Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory
of human decision making: A frame
of reference for the study of preand post-decision
processes *
Ola Svenson
Lund Unit~ersity,Lund, Sweden

Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory of decision making models human decision making as
an active process in which one alternative
is gradually
differentiated
from other available
alternatives.
The theory is based on the assumption
that it is not sufficient to choose the best
alternative,
but that a decision
involves the selection
and creation
of a candidate
that is
sufficiently
superior
for a decision. This is achieved in differentiation
processes
which are
wholistic, structural
or process related. To exemplify, structural
differentiation
includes both
facts and attractiveness
restructuring.
Following a decision, the theory predicts consolidation
processes which work in favor of the chosen alternative.
Both differentiation
and consolidation
are driven by the fact that through experience with the impredictability
of the future. a decision
maker has learned
to prepare
for threats against the chosen alternative.
The further
this
alternative
has been differentiated
and consolidated,
the less the risk of post-decision
ambiguity,
regret or decision reversal. The study is concluded
with references
to other decision theories
some of which are viewed as subtheories
of Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory.

The process of making a decision involves different stages. In the
first of these a decision maker realizes that a decision problem is
emerging. Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory applies to the
stages beyond this initial phase and models decision making as a
process in which one alternative
is tentatively
chosen and gradually
differentiated
from the others until the degree of differentiation

<-----Page 1----->sufficient for a decision. In most non-trivial decisions it is not sufficient to choose an alternative that is just better according to Differentiation and Consolidation
Theory.
Instead, the chosen alternative
should be so much better than its closest competitor
so that the
chosen alternative would remain the best even if its relative advantage
after the decision would be reduced in one way or the other.
Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory explicitly links pre- and
post-decision
processes
and considers
pre-decision
processes
as a
preparation
for the post-decision
future. Through experience with the
unpredictability
of the future, a decision maker has learned that a
decision may not be followed by the future that was predicted at the
time of the decision. Therefore,
decisions should be made to withstand the roughness of the future. In particular, post-decision
external
events and outcomes and internal changes in the decision maker himor herself could suggest that another decision would have been better.
If, at the time of decision, the chosen alternative is only slightly better
than another alternative,
the risk of post-decision
preference
reversal
is higher than if the differentiation
is greater. Therefore,
the goal of a
decision process is to differentiate
the chosen alternative
from its
competitors
to a degree that is sufficient for not becoming reduced to
zero or a preference
reversal in the post-decision
phase.
Differentiation
of one decision alternative
from the others is an
active process, which involves both the use of decision rules, facts and
attractiveness
representation
and structuring.
There are different decision rules which can be found in the decision-making
literature (cf.,
Svenson, 1979, for a review), and which can be used in arriving at a
decision. The decision rules arc applied to the decision maker’s
attractiveness
representation
which is related to his or her representation of the facts of a decision problem. However, both decision rules
and facts and attractiveness
representations
are negotiable according
to Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory. That is, the choice of
decision rules to be applied depends on the decision maker who also
has the freedom,
within some limits, to choose how he wants to
represent
a decision problem.
The coping with the future is not over at the time when a decision
is made. Instead, post-decision
differentiation
processes, also called
consolidation
processes, serve the purpose of defending the decision
against threats which may evolve. The greater the degree of differentiation favoring the chosen candidate, the less the risk of post-decision

<-----Page 2----->0. Sl~enson / Differentiation and consolidation

145

reversal of that decision. Therefore,
post-decision
differentiation
processes involve consolidation
of a decision through strengthening
or
defending
the degree of differentiation
achieved at the moment of
decision. For example, post-decision
consolidation
processes may involve the decision maker unconsciously
increasing his or her attractiveness appraisal of the chosen alternative on an important attribute.
Research
in social psychology
has shown that people. seem to
consider themselves
as consistent
although they may have changed
attitudes (Ross and Shulman 1973). They even revise their memories
of past behaviors
to bring them more in line with their current
attitudes (Ross et al. 1981). Therefore,
post-decision
consolidation
can
be seen to serve a similar purpose in bringing the appraisal of an
earlier decision more in line with the perception
of the decision as
reflecting their current attitudes (Conway and Ross 1984). Most of
this is likely not to be conscious to the decision maker and it is
necessary to assume that she or he holds a mental model of her- or
himself as consistent over time (cf., Conway and Ross 1984).
The following will first give a systematic presentation
of Differentiation and Consolidation
Theory, and then the theory will be briefly
related to other theories of decision making.

Differentiation

and Consolidation

Theory

Recently, I suggested ways of classifying decision problems from the
decision maker’s point of view (Svenson 1990). One way of doing so is
to classify according to the extent to which the decision maker uses his
or her own value system in a decision. A decision maker’s value
system is a term used here to summarize
all fundamental
values,
attitudes,
motivations,
drives and so forth, which are of potential
importance
for a decision. When the value system is mapped onto a
decision problem, this creates an attractiveness
representation
of the
aspects of the alternatives
of the problem. Svenson (1990) suggested
four different levels of decisions based on the attractiveness
representation needed at each level.
To illustrate this, level-l decisions do not at all need any attractiveness representation
when they are made. For example, level-l decisions are often made in quick habitual processes. The decision maker
recognizes that a situation is similar to an earlier one, and he chooses

<-----Page 3----->the same alternative
as last time. Although, such decisions do have
some relationship
to values in the past, the attractiveness
representation is not likely to influence these decisions. Instead, other perceptual or cognitive principles (e.g., similarity by matching) may guide
level-l decisions. However, when the habits or categories were formed
attractiveness
and decision rules were guiding principles.
Level-1
decisions may function as subprocesses
in higher level decisions.
In level-2 decisions,
the decision maker feels that he refers to
attractiveness
on one or a few attributes.
However, these decisions
represent
stereotypical
and static mappings of the alternatives
(e.g.,
biggest is best). For example no trade-offs between conflicting attractiveness values may be performed.
Decisions which are made through
direct holistic references to emotions or affects belong to this category
as well as (cf., Wright 1975; Zajonc
1980). This type of decision
processes, as well as level-l processing, appear in the initial stages of
most differentiation
processes of a more elaborate nature.
Level-3 decisions do not presuppose
an automatic correspondence
between a decision maker’s value system and the attractiveness
of the
alternatives.
Decisions at this level may use trade-offs
between the
attractiveness
of aspects on different
attributes
and transform
attributes into new ones, etc. Decisions at this level are fundamental
for
most decisions at levels 1 and 2, which at one time were level-3 (or 4-j
decisions that were later transformed
into routine decisions. Differentiation and Consolidation
Theory was primarily developed for level-3
decisions and applies to level-l and and level-2 decisions primarily in
their forming stages on level 3. In addition to level 3, the theory also
includes level-4 decisions.
At level 4 the decision maker encounters
a new and unfamiliar
problem in which decision alternatives
have to be elicited or created.
Parts of decision-making
processes
at this level include problem
solving.
Representation

of decision alterna tir ses

A decision problem presents a set of alternatives,
where an alternative (e.g., a car) will be represented
by aspects, e, (e.g., 5.2 ml on
attributes (e.g., length). The physical length of 5.2 m corresponds
to a
perceived, I,!J=f,(e),
length, which in turn is linked to an attractil-eness
scale of length of cars. To illustrate a 5.2 m long car may be (visually)

<-----Page 4----->0. Slvnson

/ Differentiation

and consolidation

147

perceived
as shorter than another car of the same length. The attribute of perceived length of cars is related to a corresponding
attructiceness attribute of length through a =f,C$,>. In this case, this
may imply increased attractiveness
up to a certain point (e.g., when
it’s very hard to park in a small space) after which attractiveness
may
decrease. Thus, attractiveness
may either increase monotonically
or it
may increase on a perceived attribute up to a certain point (e.g., when
the car is too big for parking) after which attractiveness
decreases
(Svenson 1979).
A fundamental
characteristic
of attractiveness
representations,
as
used in the present context, is their variability. Thus, there is no point
estimate of the attractiveness
of an aspect which can be assumed
strictly invariant over time, because there is always a variation
of
attractiveness
caused by, for example, the stream of environmental
inputs and the decision maker’s own inner processes.
A decision
maker’s uncertainty
about how to represent
his own value in a
decision problem has been pointed out by Fischhoff et al. (1980) and
Fischhoff (1991) exemplifies one source of the variability of attractiveness. Different ways of framing the same decision problem can elicit
different
perspectives
which introduces
variability
of attractiveness
(cf., Tvcrsky and Kahneman
1981). Perceived uncertainty
about the
outcome of a decision can also contribute
to and affect the uncertainty of the attractiveness
of decision alternatives.
Note that attributes
may correspond
to, for example, interval or
ratio scales, but the present representation
does not a priori imply
anything more than rank-order scales on each attribute. As mentioned
above, uncertainty
can be added to this representation.
However, the
application
of most decision rules presupposes
more than intra-attribute rank-order
scales, and therefore higher-order
metric characteristics are often assumed on top of the present generic attributewise
attractiveness
structural representation.
For example, commensurability means that scales across different
attributes
refer to the same
scaling unit which is necessary for so-called compensatory
rules to be
presented
below. The concept of structure has no meaning except in
conjunction
with procedures
for processing the information.
In decision making, decision rules give meaning to the representation
of a
decision problem when used to differentiate
one alternative from the
others.
During a decision process the representation
system and the se-

<-----Page 5----->quence of rules applied are continuously
influencing each other according to Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory (cf., Svenson
1979; Montgomery
1983; Svenson 1990; Payne et al. 1992). Thus, a
decision maker is assumed to change, for example, the degree of
complexity of the representation
system to meet the requirements
of a
decision rule he wants to apply. Correspondingly,
the choice of a
decision rule or a sequence of decision rules may be a function of the
representation
of the decision problem, because some of the simpler
rules are only applicable in a limited number of cases.
Decision

rules

A number of decision rules have been suggested in the decision
research literature.
Svenson (1979) classified and summarized
them
and provided a review of the empirical evidence. He classified the
rules according to their requirements
on the metric level of attractiveness, lexicographic importance order of attributes and commensurability across attributes.
The following will illustrate the wide range of
decision rules through examples belonging to these different
categories (see Svenson 1979, or Beach 1990, for more detailed information).
( 1) Ordinul attrwctir’eness and no commensurability
- is a set of rules
including the Dominance,
Conjunctive
and Disjunctive decision rules.
The Conjunctive
and Disjunctive
rules have been presented
and
axiomatized by Coombs ( 1964) and Dawes ( 1X14).
(2) Ordinal attractil’eness, lexicographic order and no commensurability - This group of decision
rules is exemplified
by the Lexicographic (Fishburn
19741, Elimination
by aspects (Tversky 1972) and
Pre-tree (Tversky and Sattath 1979) decision rules.
(3) Ordinal attructil’eness difyerence, lexicographic order and no comby the Minimum

lexicomensurability
- is exemplified
graphic rule and the Lexicographic
semiorder rule (Tvcrsky 1969).
(4) Ordinal attractir’eness and commensurability
- In addition
to
ordinal attractiveness,
the following rules also require attractiveness
values which are comparable
(commensurate)
across different
attributes. Such rules are also called compensatory.
The Maximizing
number of attributes with greater attractiveness
rule (Svenson 1979)
prescribes
a choice of the alternative
with the greater number of

<-----Page 6----->0. Srmson

and consolidafion

149

favorable attributes.
This has also been called the ‘Majority of Confirming Dimensions’ rule’ (Russo and Dosher 1983) and the ‘Number
of Potentially Profitable Dimensions’ rule’ (Beach 1990).
(5) Ordinal attractiveness differences and commensurability - The
choice by Greatest
attractiveness
difference
rule implies that the
decision maker first looks for the attribute with the greatest attractiveness difference.
After this he chooses the alternative which is more
attractive on this attribute, irrespective
of the other attributes.
This
rule may be seen as an analog to the Minimax regret principle in game
theory.
(6) Interrlal attractiveness (utility) and commensurability - At a
higher level of representation,
the concept of attractiveness
can be
replaced by the term utility, although the more generic term attractiveness will be used in the present study. The Addition of attractiveness rule states that a decision is based on a summation
of all
attractiveness
values for each alternative.
The alternative
with the
greater sum of attractiveness
will then be chosen.
The Addition of attractiveness
differences
rule states that a decision is based on differences
between
the attractiveness
values of
different alternatives on the same attribute. However, the differences
(a,,, - azk) between alternatives
A, and A, on attribute
k do not
have to contribute
linearly to the overall evaluation.
Instead, they
enter as arguments in a function which determines the contribution
of
each attractiveness
difference
to the overall evaluation process. This
rule was proposed by Tversky (19691, who reported that subjects used
it for making decisions.
(7) Ratio attractiLleness and commensurability - The Subjective expected utility model implies that the ratio attractiveness
value or
utility of each aspect should be weighted by the subjective probability
(ratio scale) of its occurrence
when summing the utilities for an
alternative.
Comments - The above exemplifies
rules which can be used in
differentiating
one alternative from the others. Note, however, that all
the original versions of the rules only require an alternative
to be
better than its closest competitor. They do not indicate anything about
differentiation
level.

<-----Page 7----->Some fundamental
oly

elements

o,fDijrerentiation

and Consolidation

The-

The earlier presentation
of structural representation
and processing
rules provides the theoretical foundation on which Differentiation
and
Consolidation
Theory rests. These and other basic elements, which
are grounded
in psychological
theory and empirical findings, will be
presented
below.
( 1) The goal of a decision process is not only to select the best
alternative but an alternative that is sufficiently differentiated
from its
closest competitor.
During a decision process one alternative is gradually differentiated
from its competitors.
This predicts that, through
analyzing the pre-decision
process, it should be possible to identify the
finally chosen alternative
before a decision is made. This was shown
by Montgomery
and Svenson (1983).
(2) Decision problems appear and are solved at different levels.
(3) In the post-decision
phase potential
threats can appear that
may decrease or reverse the differentiation
advantage for the chosen
alternative (e.g., new facts or changes of attractiveness).
(4) The larger these post-decision
threats loom, the greater the
degree of differentiation
aspired for by a decision maker. The greater
the involvement in a decision, the greater the strengths of differention
and consolidation.
(5) Post-decision
processes in the decision maker him- or herself,
as well as external events, provide an opportunity
to learn from a
decision. Post-decision
processes serve the function of aiding a person
in coping with a decision and the sequence of events after a decision
has been made.
(6) Pre-decision
differentiation
and post-decision
differentiation
(also called consolidation)
basically draw on the same basic set of
subprocesses.
However, during the pre-decision
phase, for example,
non-compensatory
rules or quick level-l or level-2 processes tend to
initiate the process and to be followed by compensatory
rules. In the
post-decision
phase rules such as the attractiveness
difference rule arc
predicted to become more frequent.
(7) Differentiation
processes are (a) of a quick level-l and level-2

type, (b) of a process/rule
type, and (cl of a structural

restructuring)
type.

The process of making a decision
A pre-decision
process usually starts with the elimination
of alternatives (e.g., through
attributewise
search and application
of the
conjunctive
rule) so that only two or three candidates
remain for
further
consideration
(cf., Kleinmuntz
1963; Svenson 1974; Payne
1976; Svenson 1979; Montgomery
and Svenson 1989; Svenson 1990;
Bettman et al. 1991). In effect, this is the first stage of differentiation
of the set of options into two subsets of which the non-rejected
set is
processed further. Sometimes a reference alternative representing,
for
example, the least attractive
and yet acceptable
alternative
can be
selected and used in the elimination
process (cf., Bell et al. 1989;
Svenson 1990). In fact, this reference
alternative does not have to be
among the options of a particular
decision problem. But it should
belong to the same category of alternatives.
When a manageable
set of possible alternatives
is left, or if the
original decision problem only had very few alternatives,
a tentative
choice will be made. This is often called a promising alternative (cf.,
Montgomery
1983; Montgomery
and Svenson 1989; Lewicka 1991) and
the differentiation
process will be directed
towards this tentative
choice alternative
and its most serious competitor.
However,
the
magnitude
of differentiation
between the best and the second best
alternative is usually not immediately
sufficient for a decision. Sometimes the differentiation
process indicates
that the first tentative
choice is inferior and therefore
is rejected in favor of its most serious
competitor
(cf., Montgomery
and Svenson 1989).
At the time of decision, this commitment
changes the scene and the
decision has to be defended against threatening
factors (cf., Borcherding and Rohrman
1990). In this phase psychological
differentiation
processes similar to those in the pre-decision
phase take over. They
serve the purpose of preventing the differentiation
advantage of the
chosen alternative
to be reduced to zero or to a negative difference
implying a preference
reversal.

<-----Page 9----->Regret is viewed as a component
in the testing of a tentative
decision alternative
in the pre-decision
phase which is often followed
up in the post-decision
phase. Because of decision makers’ familiarity
(not always on a conscious level) with the regret phenomenon,
differentiation
and consolidation
processes
are needed
to ensure that
post-decision
regret does not destabilize a decision. Regret has been
treated in different
contexts such as policy making, economics
and
psychology
(Fcstinger
1964; Bell 1981; Loomes and Sugden 1982;
Kahneman
and Tversky 1982; Landman 1987).

The differentiation

variable,

d

The differentiation
variable, d, is a hypothetical
construct which is
related to overall attractiveness
difference between two decision alternatives. As a hypothetical
construct
it is reflected
in, for example,
decisions, choice frequencies
and attractiveness
difference
measures.
However, no single measure could aspire to be isomorphic with the
differentiation
variable, n. The cl variable has interval ratio scale
properties
and constitutes the basis for the decision criterion c, which
is affected by, for example, envisioned
post-decision
factors. The d
variable has no denomination.
To illustrate, assume the d variable in a decision made between
two alternatives
according to the Lexicographic
rule with a difference
between the alternatives
on the first most important
attribute. Then
the attractiveness
difference on that attribute is the only attractiveness
difference
that is monotonically
related to d. To exemplify further,
assume a version of the Addition
of attractiveness
rule, in which
attractiveness
differences
on only the two most important
attributes
arc given twice the weight of the other attributes.
Then, changes of
attractiveness
difference
on the most important attributes would contribute to CI differentiation
to a greater extent than a corresponding
change in attractiveness
difference on the less weighed attribute.
This predicts that if more important
attributes
arc given greater
importance
weights in a decision rule, structural differentiation
processes applied to the most important
attributccs)
would be more
efficient
in order to meet the differentiation
criterion,
c, than if
applied to less important
attributes.
The c variable also retlects

<-----Page 10----->0. Sl~enson / Differentiutim

and consolidution

153

changes of standards, anchors and aspiration levels during the process
of making a decision.
Furthermore,
the criterion value c which d has to equal or exceed
depends on, for example, the task (e.g., reversible-irreversible,
degree
of responsibility)
and the decision maker’s personality (e.g., wish to be
consistent and wish to be thorough). Note, however, that Differentiation and Consolidation
Theory assumes that a decision maker always
strives for increasing d in preparing for the future or in consolidating
a decision. The criterion c is a level sufficient for a specific type of
preference
indication (judgment, choice, etc.) and not necessarily the
ultimate goal of the differentiation
process.
Let alternative
1 be the promising alternative that is differentiated
from alternative
2. At time t,, d,, is then related to a,j,tl, where i (1,
k) is attribute and j (1, 2) alternative, through the general function F

When d,, > c,, this means that a decision or other significant step in
the process can be taken.
The function
F in eq. (1) cannot be specified further until the
decision rule or rules have been identified. To exemplify, the Addition

rule would specify the contribution

processes will be elaborated
next.

<-----Page 11----->Differentiation

processes

(I) Holistic, lel>el-I and lellel-2 differentiation

Characteristic
for this type of differentiation
processes is that they
are quick and often they seem not to be reflected in consciousness
or
enter working memory. In level-l decisions there is no reference
to
attractiveness.
In level-2 decisions attractiveness
is represented
as a
holistic evaluative experience,
for example, intuition or an emotional
reaction.
These differentiation
processes
share characteristics
with
perceptual
holistic type cognitive processes (cf., Zajonc 1980).
Therefore,
some kind of prototype and/or exemplar theory is more
adequate
in describing such differentiation
processes. Similarity between present and past related situations
and alternatives
play an
important
role (e.g., Franks and Branford
1971). Feature
theories
which use less holistic representations
of alternatives
may also be
applicable to this type of differentiation
processes. This brings the old
distinction between holistic and separable representations
into mind
(cf., Garner 1974; Spoehr and Lehmkuhlc
1982). As mentioned above,
these quick processes reflect former processes in which attractiveness
was considered.
It is important to point out that holistic differentiation
often leads
to differentiation
which is immediately
sufficient for a decision. However, it may also be part of more complex differentiation
processes.
Perceptual
and holistic differentiation
processes arc particularly
efficient in pre-decision
differentiation
resulting in, for example, a reference or a promising alternative, because they arc fast and do not need
much psychological
effort.
(II) Process differentiation

There are quite a number of decision rules which can bc used to
differentiate
a final alternative
from its competitors.
Among those
some use criterion levels as, for example, the Conjunctive
rule. The
variation
of criterion
level also belongs to process differentiation.
Note, that decision rules as used in the litcraturc typically have been
used only to prescribe or predict the choice of an alternative,
and not
to indicate the degree of differentiation
(separation)
of the alternatives. However, several rules imply attractiveness
differences
which
may be related to the differentiation
variable.

<-----Page 12----->0. Sorenson / Differentiation

and cormlidation

(1) Decision rule differentiation
Decisions among more than two alternatives seem to involve different decision rules applied in sequence. Typically, some kind of screening of alternatives
starts the process (cf., Svenson 1974; Kahneman
and Tversky 1979; Montgomery
1983; Goldstein and Einhorn, 1987) to
eliminate some of them. In this process rules like the Conjunctive rule
can be used. In the next phase of the decision process, rules using
trade-offs,
so-called compensatory
rules (rules nos. 4-7 above), are
typically applied. Through the application of several rules, all pointing
in the same direction, the d parameter,
favoring the chosen alternative, is likely to increase to the advantage of the chosen alternative.
Furthermore,
the greater the separation
of alternatives
according to
individual rules the greater the differentiation.
Many decision rules or
principles lead to the choice of the same alternative,
and some have
greater overlaps with other rules which therefore may appear stronger
than others. For example, the Addition of utilities rule prescribes the
same choice as many other rules in many cases, a fact which explains
high correlations
with final decisions in many studies.
In the post-decision
consolidation
phase some of the rules used in
pre-decision
differentiation
may be reiterated
to maintain the degree
of differentiation
obtained at the moment of decision. However, rules
not applied in the pre-decision
phase may also be used as arguments
in an effort to maintain the differentiation
in the post-decision
period.
To exemplify,
a decision may be made on ethically unjustifiable
grounds and therefore
post-decision
consolidation
can involve quite a
different set of rules (and/or
criteria and attributes) than the pre-decision stage.
(2) Criterion differentiation
The existence of the variation of criterion levels on different
attributes has been acknowledged
for a long time (cf., Svenson 1974,
1979), exemplified
in the literature
on aspiration
levels and their
contingency
on the situation in, for example, bargaining (cf., Tietz,
1983, for an overview of the field) and in sequential search models.
The Conjunctive,
the Satisficing, the Disjunctive,
the Minimum
difference
lexicographic,
the Elimination
by aspect, and the Pre-tree
decision rules, all need criteria which can be varied during a decision
process. If one of these decision rules is not applicable in the first
round or if the differentiation
is not great enough, the decision maker

<-----Page 13----->IS6

/ Differentmtton

and consolidation

may either change the criterion level further down or go to another
rule for solving the decision problem. This process can in principle be
repeated
at any time during the pre- and post-decision
stages. The
nomination of a reference alternative can serve the purpose of anchoring criterion levels for a decision problem, while the differentiation
of
a promising alternative is tested against these criterion levels.
(III) Structural

differentiation

Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory postulates that all structural differentiation
(changes of representation)
is performed
in relation to a decision rule or a holistic classification
in support of an
alternative.
As mentioned
above, post-decision
consolidation
may not
be performed
through reference
to the same rules as used in the
decision process. Structural differentiations
are of four different types:
(1) attractiveness
restructuring,
(2) attribute importance
restructuring,
(3) facts restructuring,
and (4) decision problem restructuring.
(I) Differentiation through attractirleness restructuring
The mapping of a decision maker’s value system on a problem can
be changed
in relation
to the rules and criterion
differentiation
processes activated. Attractiveness
restructuring
differentiation
is performed to change the representation
of a decision problem so that
one or more rules are supported. To illustrate this, assume attractiveness restructuring
and a decision between
two cars in which the
decision maker may at first be ambivalent. The differentiation
process
may start downgrading
of the initially great appreciation
of the color
of one of the cars. The decision maker may also downgrade
the
attractiveness
of that car’s stronger engine. Following these attractiveness re-evaluations
the degree of differentiation
favoring the other car
(based e.g., on its better price and superior quality) may be sufficient
for a decision according to one or several decision rules.
(2) Differentiation through attribute importance restructuring
Not only can the position of an aspect on an attractiveness
change but also the importance
of that whole attribute. For
initially the attribute of beauty of a set of available decision
tives may seem quite important. But in the process of further
tiating the alternatives,
aspects referring to this attribute may

attribute

<-----Page 14----->0. S~wson / D(fferentiation and consolidation

157

very little importance
or weight, and in the extreme they may be
ignored implying a zero importance of that attribute. An attribute may
also gain importance which can be exemplified by a cost attribute, the
knowledge about which may gradually unfold in pre- and post-decision processes. As in other structural
differentiation
processes,
the
process is driven by the rules and/or
criterion processes activated at
the same time.
(3) Differentiation through facts restructuring
Attractiveness
mappings refer to underlying facts exemplified
by,
for example, size, price and color. In the differentiation
processes
presented
earlier in this section, facts e, and their psychological
representation,
+!t, have been regarded as fixed. In the present type of
differentiation
processes, facts are not assumed as invariant over preand post-decision
processes. Instead, the representation
of facts and
new objective facts, e, may be used to increase differentiation
favoring
an alternative.
Facts differentiation
may be achieved through, for
example, use of problem uncertainty
in processes leading to wishful
thinking, selective attention and so on.
To illustrate, although a person may have a greater initial preference for one car, he or she may have to buy another car for reasons of
price. The pre-decision
differentiation
process in this case would
include (let’s say) the decision maker starting to question that the first
preferred
car will serve him or her all the years the manufacturer’s
statistics indicate (e). Similar type post-decision
consolidation
of the
choice of the cheaper car could include the decision maker remembering the price of the non-chosen
car as higher than it actually was.
Fischhoff’s (197.5) seminal paper on hindsight illustrates facts restructuring as well as Einhorn and Hogarth (1985) with their adjustment of
probabilities
under ambiguity.
(4) Differentiation through decision problem restructuring
Some decision problems are level-4 decisions and initially ill-defined (cf., Abelson and Levi 1985) or lend themselves
to problem
restructuring
involving the creation of new alternatives.
For example,
the decision of which manufacturer
of prefabricated
homes one wants
to buy from may involve considerable
problem-solving
efforts in composing alternatives
from the different manufacturers.
Following, and
in parallel with this, an attractiveness
representation
is created.

<-----Page 15----->Other decision problems are elaborated
in level-4 decision making
because they may appear hard to make through differentiation
processes at lower levels. One particular
instance of this is to import a
new reference
alternative
to the decision situation without seriously
considering
it. This may lead to increased differentiation
as exemplified by Tyszka (1983) and Payne (19821, who found that if two
alternatives
are close in attractiveness
and a third alternative
is
offered which dominates one of the first two alternatives,
the attractiveness of the non-dominated
alternative increases significantly.

Predictions

of Differentiation

and Consolidation

Theory

The fact that a decision process consists of successive differentiation of one alternative
from another predicts that it should, in principle, be possible to identify the chosen alternative
before a decision
has been reached. This was illustrated by Montgomery
and Svenson
(1989) who found that after 3/4 of a decision process 3/4 of the final
decisions could be predicted
from the greater degree of attention
given to the finally chosen alternative.
Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory predicts that it is not
sufficient
that a formal decision rule applies to reach a decision.
Further differentiation
will normally be required in any decision of
some importance
with reasonably
close decision alternatives.
For
example, even an alternative that dominates its competitors
will have
to be further differentiated.
This was recently illustrated by Svenson
and Benthorn (1992) who studied consolidation
in decisions with one
dominating alternative.
For example, the further away in attractiveness
one alternative
is
from its competitors
the quicker the differentiation
process leading to
a decision. This is because some of the needed differentiation
is
already there.
In general, there are (1) factors related to the decision problem
determining
how easy it is to differentiate,
and (2) factors related to
the individual determining
how far the differentiation
should proceed
for a decision.
The greater the commitment
to a decision, the greater the pre-decision differentiation
and post-decision
consolidation
as mentioned

<-----Page 16----->0. .Censon

/ Differentiation

and consolidation

159

above. This general principle
generates
a number
of predictions
among which are the following.
Decision problems judged more important
will be differentiated
further than less important decisions. Decisions involving more action
on the decision maker’s part will be differentiated
further than hypothetical decisions. Decisions with real consequences
for the decision
maker will be differentiated
further than decisions with no consequences (Svenson and Malmsten 19921. Irreversible
decisions will be
differentiated
further than non-reversible
decisions and decisions in
which the responsibility
of the decision maker is greater will be
differentiated
more than decisions with less responsibility.
Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory predicts that a person
who, for example, has bought some good will not accept the same
monetary amount as a compensation
to cancel the decision. This is
because post-decision
consolidation
(of the chosen good) increases the
attractiveness.
This is in line with empirical research which has shown
that the maximum paying price is smaller than the minimum selling
price for a good (Thaler 1980; Knetsch 1989; Kahneman et al. 1990).
This contrasts with standard
economic
and decision theory (Willig
1976) and was called the endowment
effect by Thaler (19801. The
effect of ‘sunk costs’ and escalation
of commitment
to a decision,
which means that initial investments
are overevaluated
in following
decisions, are also predicted
by Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory (cf., Staw 19811.
There is an implicit trade-off between the degree of differentiation
aspired for and the subjective evaluation of that differentiation
on the
one hand and the assessment and evaluation of resource demands for
achieving this differentiation
on the other. The outcome
of this
trade-off
process depends on individual and situational
factors. It
seems reasonable to assume a certain degree of invariance in individuals across situations and for situations across individuals. In empirical
tests of the above predictions,
independent
problem and individually
related variables as well as dependent
judgment and decision-related
variables can be assessed through experimental
controls and human
judgments.
In addition, information
search patterns,
time spent in
different
stages, ratings, decisions and actions can be collected
as
dependent
variables reflecting differentiation
processes.
In general,
favorable
post-decision
consequences
automatically
support the level of differentiation
arrived at when the decision was

<-----Page 17----->made in that differentiation
based on facts is supported (Svenson and
Malmsten
1992). Such consolidation
processes
are effortless.
However, attractiveness
differentiation
may be threatened
even if the
outcome was optima1 because a decision always means that something
has to be given up and those aspects can threaten a decision (more so
if the consequences
turn out bad). Brehm (1966) pointed out that a
decision implies that the freedoms to reject the chosen and accept the
non-chosen
alternative are lost. These ‘lost freedoms’ can be assumed
to lead to a motivational
state decreasing
the attractiveness
of the
chosen and increasing the attractiveness
of the non-chosen
alternative. One predicition
is that given an adequate level of differentiation
a decision should withstand the effects of such adverse and destabilizing influences.

Relations between Differentiation
approaches

and Consolidation

Theory and other

Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory has many links with other
theoretical
approaches
in decision-making
research. Lack of space will
only allow very brief moments regarding each of these approaches
including some comparisons
with Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory. In fact, the theory is the kind of theory which subordinates
many other theories as subtheories.
For more complete
reviews of
alternative theories of judgment and decision making see for example,
Hogarth
(1987), Yates (19901, Payne et al. (1992). Note that only
theoretical
approaches
focused on decision and choice will be treated
(and not e.g., judgments).
Primarily structural

approaches

In 1954 Ward Edwards wrote a seminal paper which became the
starting point for more extended psychological decision research (Edwards 1954) and introduced
Subjective Expected
Utility Theory. Its
later relative, Multi-attribute
Utility Theory, MAUT (cf., von Winterfeldt and Edwards
19861, shares aspects of the representation
of
decision problems
with Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory.
However, the metric properties
of the attractiveness
representations
are basically static (with random errors) and have fixed metric proper-

<-----Page 18----->0. Sr,enson / Differentiation and consolidation

161

ties in MAUT.
subset of those

The decision rules applied in MAUT represent
a
in Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory. Signal
Detection Theory also dates back to the fifties (cf., Tanner and Swets
1954; Swets et al. 1961) and, although it was developed for perceptual
detection, has features also present in Differentiation
and Consolidation Theory.
In particular,
the differentiation
parameter
and the
variable criterion value for a decision can be compared to the Signal
Detection Theory parameters
of d’ and the decision criterion. Note,
however, that Signal Detection Theory assumes a fixed d’ in contrast
to the variable d of Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory. Criterion Dependent Choice Models postulate a sequential evaluation process resulting in an intention to choose one of two alternatives when
enough evidence to meet a criterion has been accumulated
to make
sure that the alternative
is the best one (cf., Wald 1950; Feller 1957;
Estes 1959; Audley 1960; Wallsten 1980; Busemeyer
1984; Aschenbrenner et al. 1984; Dietrich 1989). It is clear that later versions of
these models (cf., Albert et al. 1989) have features in common with
the pre-decision
phase of Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory
such as the systematic variability of the criterion value. However,
Criterion Dependent
Choice Theory explicitly handles only a subset of
the decision rules of Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory and
models attractiveness
variability as a random process. Prospect Theory
(Kahneman
and Tversky 1979) proposes an initial editing phase which
has similarities to many process theories of decision making including
Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory. It also uses the concept of
reference point which is mirrored in the reference alternative used in
the present study.

Process approaches
In contrast
to structural
approaches,
process approaches
study
decision making over time, not just the result of the process. There is
a long tradition of this kind of research starting in the fifties with
Brehm (1956) and related to Festinger (1957). In contrast to the early
structural
approaches,
who only treated decisions, early process approaches also studied post-decision
processes (e.g., Brehm and Cohen
1959; Brock 1963; Zajonc 1968). Festinger’s
Conflict, Decision and
Dissonance Theory is the first systematic exploration of both pre- and
post decision processes in the literature. In contrast with Differentia-

<-----Page 19----->tion and Consolidation
Theory,
Festinger
(1964) does not assume
systematic
problem restructuring
in the pre-decision
phase. In the
post-decision
phase, Festinger’s
theory predicts active restructuring,
information
selection and dissonance
reduction,
which is a result of
the spontaneously
occurring dissonance
after a decision to which a
decision maker is committed (cf., Frey 1986). This is also rcflectcd in
Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory. The attributewise
representation of decision problems of the present theory was not used in
the Festinger approach. Janis and Mann’s Conflict, Choice and Commitment Theory contrasts with Festinger’s in that it considers pre-decision to involve restructuring
more or less consciously until a decision
is reached. Regarding post-decision
processes, Janis and Mann (1977)
postulate
that neither regret nor bolstering will occur unless some
conditions prevail which make for persisting decisional conflict. Among
those necessary
conditions
are those inducing hypervigilance,
for
example,
time pressure
(Svenson
and Maule 19931 or a decision
situation with seemingly unavoidable
great negative consequences.
Janis and Mann (1977) did not use an attributewise
representation
of
decision alternatives.
March’s (19781 Posterior preference
approach
relaxes the requirement
of priority and allows preferences
to rationalize after the fact. This perspective
focuses on post-decision
processes
and suggests that we find meaning
in our decisions
and actions
afterwards when the consequences
are observed and interpreted.
The Suenson and Montogomery Process Approach - During the early
years of the seventies a study later published as Svenson (19741 was
circulated
in draft form. Here, an attributewise
representation
was
used in the coding of think aloud protocols from decision processes.
In 1974 an accompanying
theoretical
frame of reference
was first
published (Svenson and Montgomery
19741, later revised and published as Montgomery
and Svenson (1976). In a later paper summing
up the empirical research in the area, Svenson (1979), asserted that a
number of different
decision rules were applied on attractiveness
representations
of the decision alternatives.
In this early theoretical
frame of reference
roughly the same decision theoretic attributewise
representation
system was used as in the present Differentiation
and
Consolidation
Theory. There was explicit mentioning
of changes of
criterion
levels to fit rules and in 1979 Svenson wrote ‘During a
decision process the representation
system and the sequence of rules
applied may be continuously
influencing each other. For instance, it

<-----Page 20----->0. S~nson

/ Differentiation

and consolidation

163

may be assumed that a decision maker may change the degree of
complexity of the representation
system to meet the requirements
of a
decision rule he wants to apply. Correspondingly,
the choice of a
decision rule or sequence of rules may be a function of the representation of the decision problem’ (Svenson 1979: 88, 89). There was no
interest in post-decision
processes at that time.
Contingent Processing and Constructicle Decision Making Theory At the same time as the present author collected verbal protocols in
Sweden in the early seventies, John Payne worked along the same line
in the USA (cf., Payne 1976). His work was developed into a Theory of
Contingent Decision Behacior (Payne 1982; cf., Bettman et al. 19911,
and later into a Theory of Constructice Decision Making (Payne et al.
1992). Payne (1976) pointed out that the choice of decision rules was
dependent
on the decision problems and in Bettman et al. (1991) the
contingent strategy selection was structured around the three types of
influential factors: problem, person and social context. The theoretical
approach of Payne and colleagues largely focuses on the choice of
decision rules and the relation of this choice to task variables (including e.g., time pressure and complexity, Payne et al. 1990). Post-decision processes sometimes involve feedback about a desired judgment
or choice in the Payne and coworkers approach. Otherwise, post-decision processes are not included in this approach. However, the connection to learning also found in studies of dynamic decision making
or systems control (cf., Holtgrave 1990) provides a link to Differentiation and Consolidation
Theory.
Dominance Structuring Theory - After the Montgomery
and Svenson (1976) and Svenson (1979) papers, Montgomery (1983) published a
paper on decision rules and the search for a dominance
structure.
From here and on, Montgomery
asserts that all decision-making
processes are made with the purpose of arriving at dominance for one
alternative
over the other alternatives.
In contrast to Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory, all other rules serve this purpose and have
little independent
roles in themselves in Dominance
Structuring Theory. Attractiveness
restructuring
is also a way of changing a decision
situation into dominance
or at least closer to it. Thus attractiveness
restructuring
is shared by Dominance
Structuring and Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory as well as the fundamental
attributewise
representation
of decision problems. Another
similarity is the role
given a tentative decision or the promising alternative
in a decision

<-----Page 21----->process. Once dominance
is achieved a decision will be made, and
there is no further need to differentiate
the alternatives in Dominance
Structuring
Theory which is not the case in Differentiation
and
Consolidation
Theory. In the latter theory, decisions according to all
rules are differentiated
further, including dominance.
Although not
initially created for post-decision
processes, Dominance
Theory has
been extended
to, for example, justifications
of decisions (Montgomery 1989). image Theory was recently presented in bookformat
by
Beach (1990) and contrasts with the other theories in that it does not
concentrate
on the decision maker’s evaluation
neither of complete
holistic alternatives,
nor of attributewise
representations.
Instead, it
uses the term image for scenario-like
representations
governing decision processes. As in Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory it uses
adoption decisions of a candidate
alternative
who meets some goal
plan and which roughly corresponds
to a hypothetical
choice or
promising alternative in the present theory. Image Theory is a process
theory which models compatibility
tests (testing for adoption
of a
candidate)
followed by profitability
tests of the candidate(s)
sclccted
in the first phase. However, although Differentiation
and Consolidation Theory acknowledges
that facts and attractiveness
representations are closely related to scenarios,
scripts or images for their
creation, they do not occupy such a prominent
theoretical
role as in
Image Theory.
Concluding

remarks

Differentiation
and Consolidation
Theory provides a general theoretical framework for pre- and post-decision
making processes in that
it relates to earlier theories, unifies different theoretical
features in
one comprehensive
framework using the new leading principle of preand post-decision
differentiation.
In contrast to earlier theories
it
predicts that an alternative
has to be not only the best candidate but
also sufficiently
better than its competitors.
It views both pre- and
post-decision
processes as part of the same general active creative
process in which decision problem structures
and processing of clcments in this structure
are accommodated
to each other. In this
process differentiation
processes of different kinds operate in order to
harmonize
the decision maker with the decision problem, his or her
own decision and its consequences.
