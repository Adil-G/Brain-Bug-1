Abstract
Purpose – The aim of the paper is to define the role of trust and reliance in business relationships.
Design/methodology/approach – After this paper identifies gaps in the literature, a conceptual
model is developed, and its implications analyzed and discussed.
Findings – One of the particularities of trust is its inherent anthropocentricity. As a concept, trust
appears to be more applicable at the level of inter-personal relationships than to inter-organizational
relationships. Business relationships involve both inter-personal and inter-organizational
relationships. The paper considers a number of other possibilities and argues that there is a need
to look at reliance as an incremental intellectual lens on business relationships.
Research limitations/implications – Within a business-to-business marketing context, the paper
discusses the impact of such a multi-faceted conceptualization for research in business relationships.
Practical implications – Marketing researchers often neglect the fact that relationships between
organizations are based on mutual interests, and attempt to stretch the concept of trust towards
inter-organizational relationships without the necessary theoretical scrutiny.
Originality/value – Applying the concept of trust to personal relationships and reliance to
inter-organizational relationships, the paper introduces a complementary, rational standard that
contributes to the calculability in exchange relationships.

Introduction
Trust is perceived in the marketing literature as a significant, if not pivotal, aspect of
business relationships (Anderson and Weitz, 1989; Ganesan, 1994; Moorman et al.,
1992, 1993). Since Morgan and Hunt’s (1994) commitment and trust theory, trust has
become one of the most central aspects of business-to-business marketing. It has been
conceptualized in the marketing literature in two different ways:
(1) as a constituent component of relationship quality (Dwyer et al., 1987); and
(2) as a necessary requirement and determinant of sound business relationships
(Håkansson et al., 2004).

Hence, existing marketing literature emphasizes trust as a fundamental concept
characterising most inter-personal and inter-organizational relationships. Therefore,
trust-based relationships build one of the most obvious characteristics of the conditio
humanae (Elster, 2000). Yet in business-to-business marketing, trust is still a concept
that is in need of clarification and theoretical scrutiny. The domain and limitations of

<-----Page 1----->trust in business relationships need to be defined and scrupulously analysed. There are
three reasons that necessitate such theoretical scrutiny:
(1) Although the meaning of trust is intuitively understood, researchers from
different backgrounds ascribe divergent meanings to it. Existing definitions of
trust (Deutsch, 1960; Dwyer et al., 1987; Anderson and Weitz, 1989) pool
heterogeneous conceptual elements together and usually do not consider other
alternative possibilities such as confidence intervals, systems, or familiarity
(Parsons, 1951; Luhmann, 1979; Smith, 2001; Jalava, 2003; Marsh and Dibben,
2005).
(2) Trust is an anthropocentric notion, and as such inextricably linked to human
beliefs, sentiments, or intentionality (Blau, 1964; Pruitt, 1981; Rotter, 1967;
Fukuyama, 1995; Solomon and Flores, 2001). It may be possible to have trust in
an organization; however, trust by an organization appears to be nonsensical
(Simmel, 1950; Möllering et al., 2004. As such trust is more applicable to
inter-personal relationships than business relationships (Parsons, 1951; Hardin,
1991).
(3) Applying the notion of trust to business-to-business relationships seems
problematic. Relationships between organizations are invariably based on
considerations of mutual interest and risk assessment (Sebenius, 1992),
resulting in certain levels of confidence regarding the viability of the business
relationship. In risk-laden business-to-business relationships, the establishment
of accountabilities through explicit performance standards and monitoring may
be in conflict with interpersonal trust (Smith, 2001; Marsh and Dibben, 2005).
For this reason, long-term business relationships that are not based on trust can
exist; and have previously been theoretically described (Lambe et al., 2000).
These business relationships, while characterized by collaboration and
interdependence, function despite there being a lack of trust.
We posit that business relationships must be conceptualized by understanding both
inter-personal and inter-organizational relationships. Consider, for example, the
business relationship between manufacturer Alpha and retailer Beta. Alpha’s key
account manager is responsible for customer Beta. The key account manager develops
inter-personal relationships with Beta’s business managers and simultaneously he
represents Alpha’s business interests. Alpha’s key account manager co-operates with
Beta’s business managers and establishes an inter-organizational exchange between
manufacturer Alpha and retailer Beta which is often complex, ongoing and objectified.
However, Alpha’s key account manager is also engaged in social and subjective
inter-personal relationships with Beta’s business managers. Consequently, the
relationship is an amalgamation of strong and weak ties that are embedded in each
other (Granovetter, 1973, 1985). This relationship structure is further complicated by
the fact that business-to-business exchanges may involve several offerings, electronic
data interchange or supply structures, invoicing and accounting systems, and also
legal business contracts.
We argue that in such business relationships the concept of trust needs to be
supplemented by an additional standard that contributes to both the theoretical
conceptualisation and managerial calculability and certainty of business-to-business
exchanges. First, we apply the construct of trust to “inter-personal” aspects of

Trust and
reliance

1017

interactions evidenced, for example, by the ongoing negotiation between companies. It
is thus possible that one may trust the key account manager of an exchange partner,
but this does not necessarily imply that one can equally trust the company that he
represents. Business relationships are often characterized by a stratified and
contradictory web of inter-personal trust relationships between employees of
interacting organizations. Second, while trust cannot be reified at the organizational
level, the rational construct of reliance can be successfully applied to business
relationships (Fuller and Perdue, 1936, 1937; Atiyah, 1979). This is characterized by an
objectified rationality that minimizes the risk of exchange relationships and delivers a
legitimate right to the companies involved. However, we do not argue that the
construct of reliance covers all the inter-organizational aspects that are not explained
by trust. As such, we argue that reliance is one possible complementary construct to
trust that covers additional rational elements of inter-organizational relationships.
This paper deals with trust and reliance in a business-to-business marketing
context, and thereby extends our conceptual understanding of trust in business
relationships. We therefore limit our conceptual considerations specifically to aspects
relating to business-to-business marketing. Our unit of analysis is not at the level of the
individual manager or a single organization, but the business relationship itself. The
structure of the paper is as follows: in the next section we discuss the emotive standard
of trust, and then move on to present the rational standard of reliance. Identifying gaps
in the existing body of marketing theory, we propose a new framework of trust and
reliance that characterizes business relationships, and then discuss implications for
marketing; and also offer a series of propositions as suggestions for further research.
The emotive concept of trust
Trust has been embraced in business-to-business marketing as a fundamental
cornerstone of co-operation (Dwyer et al., 1987; Håkansson et al., 2004). Assuming that
there is an interest between two parties for an exchange to take place, there is a basis for
co-operation and collaboration as a precursor to a relationship (Ford et al., 2003).
Co-operation is not defined as an object-centred activity, but rather as
collaborator-centred interactions based on a perceived compatibility of goals, aims and
values. Supporters of the interaction approach (Ford, 1980; Håkansson, 1982; Turnbull
et al., 1996) have analysed in fine detail dyadic exchange relationships, and introduced
the concept of atmosphere to capture the subtle idea of trust in a business relationship.
The view of markets as interconnected networks of co-operative exchange relationships,
developed by the network approach to business-to-business marketing (Ford, 1990;
Axelsson, 1992; Johanson and Mattsson, 1992; Easton and Håkansson, 1996) emphasized
the existence of heterogeneity. As in Alderson’s (1957) general theory of marketing,
competition is lessened by complementarities or interdependencies between sellers and
co-operation between buyers and sellers (Mattsson, 1987). Building on Fiske’s (1990)
relational forms, Sheppard and Sherman (1998) conceptualize the grammars of trust in
relationships as four distinct and ordered forms:
(1) shallow dependence;
(2) shallow interdependence;
(3) deep dependence; and
(4) deep interdependence.

<-----Page 3----->Wicks et al. (1999) develop a concept of “optimal trust” in relationships. Morgan and
Hunt’s (1994) commitment and trust theory re-enforces the use of inter-personal
conceptualisations of trust (Mayer et al., 1995). For example, trust may provide the
buyer with the confidence of a satisfying exchange relationship (Hawes et al., 1989) and
in the field of supply chains, trust could lead to improved responsiveness (Handfield
and Bechtel, 2002). Consequently, business managers have been regarded as initiators
of trust in exchange relationships, and research has focused on the identification of
factors that encourage or constrain managerial trustworthy behaviour (Whitener et al.,
1998; Jeffries and Reed, 2000). Mutual trust is therefore often perceived as being the
social capital of a relationship (Möllering et al., 2004).
Notwithstanding the significance of trust in business relationships, the domain and
limitations of trust are two issues that remain unresolved. First, the domain of trust is
rarely specified and its conceptual dimensions are used with imprecision and
ambiguity (Barber, 1983; Solomon and Flores, 2001). This may be attributable to the
fact that trust is, indeed, a “central, superficially obvious but essentially complex
process” (Blois, 1999, p. 197). Conceptually, trust is embodied in the dimensions of
belief, expectation, willingness and confidence. Most studies on trust agree that trust is
a “psychological state” (Rousseau et al., 1998, p. 398) associated with beliefs, attitude,
or sentiments concerning the likelihood that the actions or outcomes of another party
will be acceptable (Luhmann, 1979; Barber, 1983; Lewis and Weigert, 1985; Kramer and
Tyler, 1996; Jalava, 2003) or that they will serve the actors’ interests (Deutsch, 1960;
Fukuyama, 1995). For Smith (2001), for example, trust concerns the inherent
“uncertainty about outcomes, am ambiguity of objective information and exercise of
discretion about action” (Marsh and Dibben, 2005, p. 29). Trust is thus “an internal
attribution, a moral exercise of free will that assumes most significance in situations
where there is a lack of regulation or means of coercion” (Marsh and Dibben, 2005,
p. 29). Whitener et al. (1998) emphasize three significant facets of trust in exchange
relationships:
(1) trust in another party is considered as belief or sentiment that the other party
will act benevolently;
(2) one cannot enforce the other party to fulfil its obligations; and
(3) trust involves a degree of dependency.
It was therefore argued that trust is linked with the acceptance of “risks associated
with the type and depth of the interdependence inherent in a given relationship”
(Sheppard and Sherman, 1998, p. 423).
Second, the limitations of trust need to be addressed. Since organizations are
deprived of emotions, trust at the inter-organizational level remains purely cognitive
(McAllister, 1995). Conduct qua persona is restrained and led by organizational roles
(Ring and Van de Ven, 1992). This means that personal loyalty may deviate from
organizational interest. However, if the origin of trust lies in individuals, we may posit
that individuals in an organization may share an orientation towards another
organization, which is quite different from claiming that organizations trust each other.
It is individuals, as members of organizations, rather than the organizations
themselves, who trust (Zaheer et al., 1998).
There is often an inherent error to attribute individual motivations and behaviours to
organizations and thus to commit a “cross-level fallacy” (Rousseau et al., 1998) which can

reliance

1019

result in spurious reification of social constructs. The frequent lack of clarity about the
unit of analysis may lead to unintended anthropomorphising of organizations and
business relationships. The use of anthropocentric and behavioural conceptualisations
contributes to a normative view of trust and to a perceived dichotomy between trust and
distrust in relationships (Sitkin and Roth, 1993). Trust is regarded as “good” and distrust
“bad” (Lewicki et al., 1998). Transaction-cost approaches to business relationships
(Williamson, 1975), for example, look at trust as a condition for reduced opportunism
among contracting parties, which results in lower transaction cost. Similarly, trust is
regarded as a possible cause of high impact and satisfaction (Michell et al., 1998), or a
necessary condition for successful business-to-business negotiations (Lewicki et al.,
2003), and within the Industrial Marketing and Purchasing (IMP) Group, trust is seen as
a good ingredient for co-operation, with empirical research focused on understanding its
creation and development (Young and Wilkinson, 1988; Ford et al., 2003).
Moving beyond the perceived dichotomy of trust and distrust, Smith (2001) draws a
clear distinction between “trust” and “confidence”. In comparison to trust, the notion of
confidence as an alternate possibility “concerns the establishment of explicitly
predictable outcomes, in which information is objective, standardised and scientific
and there is little opportunity [. . .] to exercise discretion about action” (Marsh and
Dibben, 2005, p. 29). The active search and establishment of “confidence intervals”
(Smith, 2001), through a periodic monitoring of performance may, however, be
indicative of the existence of distrust in business relationships. The concept of
“confidence” is hence potentially self-contradictory as it is a “clearly different
interpretation of what is meant by confidence” (Marsh and Dibben, 2005, p. 29).
Nonetheless, the concept of confidence substantiates the need for resolving the issue of
poor specification of the domain of trust as well as its inherent limitations; it reminds
us that organizations do evaluate the relationships they seek to engage in via a form of
risk analysis, and reinforces the need for an incremental, rational standard for
institutionalized rules of business conduct.
The rational standard of reliance
In this section, we juxtapose this emotive aspect of trust in a business relationship with
another facet, that of “reliance”. We choose “reliance” as one possible complementary
construct to trust in order to stress the diametrically opposed characteristics of a
non-person based, rational standard within inter-organizational relationships. This
implies that trust and reliance are independent characteristics of inter-organisational
relationships.
Business relationships presuppose the existence of complementarity in resources,
activities and information (Ford et al., 2003). Complementarity among organizations
can lead to inter-organizational exchange, but this has its price: specifically, reliance on
other organizations. Procter & Gamble relies on the capacity of suppliers of raw
materials, and the retailer Tesco relies on Procter & Gamble’s capacity to deliver
consumer goods at specified times to its supermarkets. When British Airways signs a
contract with Airbus for the purchase of 300 new airplanes, British Airways relies on
Airbus that the airplanes are delivered on time and to a specified quality, and Airbus
relies on British Airways that invoices will be paid according to agreed terms and
conditions. Cunningham (1993) argued that the reliance of company R upon company C
is directly proportional to company R’s investment in goals mediated by company C,

<-----Page 5----->and is inversely proportional for company R to the availability of those goals outside
the R-C business relationship. The customer’s goals mediated by the supplier might
include low cost, flexible credits, technical advice or access to new technology. An
exchange between organizations implies the existence of consensus among parties
(Buckley, 2005), which may be manifested by letters, phone calls or even contracts. The
rational standard of reliance is therefore a construct that accords organizations a
remedy for detrimental reliance against non-performing organizations (Buckley, 2005;
Cohen and McKendrick, 2005). Such mechanisms will be in place regardless of any
trust that is shown by members of the organization.
In this way the rational standard of reliance is a key dimension in
business-to-business agreements, and its derivation as a prime concern deserves
some further discussion. Business-to-business agreements are mutual promises that
attain moral, social, as well as legal force (Fried, 1981). First, agreements among parties
establish a relationship based on recognition and respect among those who decided to
engage (Markovits, 2004). The ontological foundation of each business relationship lies
in the basic principle of “consent-based exchange” (Buckley, 2005). The principle of
“consent-based exchange” treats contracting parties as actors that bring to the
exchange certain entitlements and they manifest their consent to the transfer of these
entitlements (Barnett, 1986; Biggart and Delbridge, 2004).
Second, the expectations of the contracting parties as expressed or implied in an
objective manifestation of agreement are legally protected (Steyn, 1997).
Manifestations “circumscribe a valuation of conduct” (Collins, 1999, p. 21) and give
legal effect to business relationships (Cohen and McKendrick, 2005). Companies that
breach their agreements are obliged to hand over the monetary equivalent of the
promised performance. The usual method of enforcing business-to-business
agreements is to exercise the right for compensation for losses caused by reliance on
an agreement. The reason for this reliance-based liability (Atiyah, 1979) is the
establishment of institutional rules that encourage inter-organizational reliance and
thus promote and facilitate inter-organizational exchange. The law tries to prevent
losses caused by reliance and discourage breaches of business agreements (Fuller and
Perdue, 1936, 1937). Moreover, organizations are less likely to violate a negotiated
agreement if the penalty for doing so is the payment of damages (Shapiro et al., 1992).
Despite the distinct significance of the concept of reliance in business-to-business
exchanges, there is a remarkable absence of marketing research on the subject. The
main reason for this lack of relevant research is that the generic and all-encompassing
use of the term trust has obscured the particularities and importance of reliance. Often
the terms “trust” and “reliance” are used interchangeably by marketing scholars
(Ganesan, 1994; Moorman et al., 1992, 1993; Schurr and Ozanne, 1985). For example,
trust is described as an assured reliance on some person or thing in risky situations
(Moorman et al., 1992; Frankel, 1977). For this reason, we need to discuss the difference
between trust and reliance.
Differentiating trust and reliance in business relationships
One of the first serious attempts to distinguish between trust and reliance was
undertaken by Hardin (1991). Looking at the essential difference between “trusting
persons” and “trusting institutions”, he describes trust as an inherently moral quality.
Hence “trustworthiness” is ascribed to a reciprocity that is motivated by character or

Trust and
reliance

1021

<-----Page 6----->EJM

1022

morality rather than by interest. Reference to trust is relevant when it comes to
trustworthiness, and speaking of reliance is justified when reciprocity is grounded in
interest. Das and Teng (1998) attempt to capture similar distinctions in their discussion
of trust and control in strategic alliances, and Hagen and Choe (1998) discuss the role of
institutional sanctions in trust-induced relationships. Another attempt to differentiate
between trust and reliance issues in business relationships was undertaken by Blois
(1999). Evaluating the current lack of conceptual clarity, he explains that there is a
difference between trusting someone and “relying on somebody to do something”
(Blois, 1999, p. 199). Drawing on Baier’s (1986) and Misztal’s (1996) work, Blois (1999)
demonstrates the distinction between the two concepts through the analytical
characteristics of “search”, “experience” and “credence”. Reliance does not involve an
emotive element; it involves a rational standard that circumscribes institutionalized
rules of doing business. Reliance in business relationships does not depend on a stated
commitment but is linked to the notions of “reasonable expectations” (Steyn, 1997),
“positive outcome” (Anderson and Narus, 1990), and “proven capability” (Blois, 1999).
Hence the rational standard of reliance differs from the notion of “organizational trust”
(Barber, 1983; Granovetter, 1985; Mayer et al., 1995), “impersonal trust” or “system
trust” which is the trust that individuals place in systems and institutions or the
individual’s trust emanating from structural arrangements (Noteboom and Six, 2003).
Contemporary studies attempted to stretch the concept of trust from inter-personal
towards inter-organizational relationships (Zucker, 1986; Das and Teng, 2001). But one
might challenge whether it is appropriate to apply the concept of trust to
inter-organizational relationships (Anderson and Narus, 1990; Ring and Van de Ven,
1992; Zaheer and Venkatraman, 1995). Certainly, the existence of various forms of
inter-organizational co-operation such as alliances, strategic partnerships between
companies, business-to-business negotiation, as well as inter-firm contracts, make the
concept appealing, and there are calls for an extension of the model of trust to both a
group and an organizational level of analysis. It is argued, for example, that exchanges
between organizations also include exchanges between individuals or groups of
individuals (Barney and Hansen, 1994) and that people may develop a trust in
organizations (Morgan and Hunt, 1994). Research in the areas of trust and commitment
in strategic alliances, however, suggests the existence of a “structural binding” based
on economic, strategic and organizational links, as well as “social bonding”, which
involves affective and personal relationships (Rodriguez and Wilson, 2002). An
unambiguous “conceptual clarity” would consequently require a clear distinction
between the two forms of bonding. We therefore follow Noteboom and Six (2003) who,
recognizing the cross-level controversy, posit that it is important to distinguish
between personal trust and impersonal trust. For the former, trust is based on the
person-to-person interaction, and is unique to each relationship. For impersonal trust,
trust is based on the position (i.e. job title) within the organization, not the individual
(Morris and Moberg, 1994). Furthermore, we build on Zaheer et al.’s (1998) endeavours
to solve the inherent cross-level fallacy, by proposing a clear differentiation between
“inter-personal trust” and “inter-organizational trust”. The former refers to “the extent
of a[n] [. . .] agent’s trust in her counterpart in the partner’s organization” (Zaheer et al.,
1998, p. 142). In other words, inter-personal trust is the trust placed by the individual in
his or her individual opposite member, while inter-organizational trust is seen as “the

<-----Page 7----->extent of trust placed in the partner organization by the members of a focal
organization (Zaheer et al., 1998, p. 142).
Towards a framework of trust and reliance in business relationships
The relevant theoretical inputs from the two perspectives of “trust” and “reliance” are
now used as conceptual dimensions in our attempt to move towards a framework of
trust and reliance in business relationships (see Table I). Trust and reliance operate at
different levels. Trust constitutes an emotive state (Simmel, 1950; Möllering, 2001) that
operates at an inter-personal level, while reliance sets a rational standard that operates
at the inter-organizational level. By committing a cross-level fallacy the two concepts
have become an integral part of very different relational contexts (Williamson, 1985;
Lewicki et al., 2003). Trust is based on sentiments and behaviour, whereas reliance
manifests itself in agreements and institutionalized forms of business interaction.
Commitment on an inter-personal level can be juxtaposed with reasonable expectations
on an inter-organizational level. Whilst trust is associated with the acceptance of
dependency and risk, reliance introduces an institutionalized standard to reduce risks.
Consequently, penalty-based sanctions that are enforceable exist in reliance structures,
while on the other hand trust-based relationships do not have such rigorous
mechanisms attached.
Recognition of the difference between the inter-personal and inter-organizational
levels constitutes a significant departure. Nevertheless, there is a need for three further
conceptual developments of business relationships. First, there is a need to recognize
that trust and reliance in business relationships rest on different conceptual bases
(Blois, 1999). Second, we need to avoid the use of the words “trust” and “reliance” as
synonymous marketing terms (Ganesan, 1994; Moorman et al., 1992). Third, we need to
develop an integrative model of the multiplicity of trust and reliance dimensions in
order to understand more fully the complexity of business relationships. Therefore, we
posit that business relationships can be characterized by two dimensions that hitherto
have been hidden behind the ecumenical construct of trust. First, business
relationships depend on a variety of important interactions based on inter-personal
trust (Håkansson and Ford, 2002). Second, business relationships depend on the
independent standard of inter-organizational reliance. Both are independent
constructs. In contrast to the simplistic trust-mistrust concept of business

relationships, we thus propose a conceptual framework that integrates inter-personal
trust and inter-organizational reliance, and which captures four differing types of
business relationships. As shown in Figure 1, we label these as being a “fragile
relationship”, “expedient relationship”, “stable relationship” or “personal relationship”.
A “fragile” business relationship is characterized by low inter-personal trust and
low inter-organizational reliance. We term this relationship “fragile” as there is no
“anchor” for the perpetuation of this relationship. It is tentative, and can easily be
disrupted. An “expedient” relationship builds upon high levels of inter-organizational
reliance between companies despite the low level or absence of inter-personal trust
between individual members. Conversely, a business relationship may rest on a high
inter-personal trust despite the absence or the low level of inter-organizational reliance.
This may rest on just a few or, in an extreme case, just one dyadic “personal”
relationship built on high levels of trust (e.g. between business managers) which
provides the “logic” for the continuation of the relationship. In comparison, a “stable”
relationship is built on both inter-personal trust and inter-organizational reliance, and
therefore has manifold “anchor points”.
Discussion and implications
By defining and analysing carefully the domain and limitations of the emotive
paradigm of “trust” and supplementing it with the rational standard of “reliance” in
business relationships, we propose a framework that is applicable to
business-to-business marketing. The theoretical framework informs better the
cross-level fallacy between different levels of analysis and escapes the existing
dichotomy of “trust” and “mistrust” in business relationships, especially as part of the
implied correlation of these with relationship quality (Morgan and Hunt, 1994).
Examining business relationships by the use of intellectual lenses of trust and reliance,
we formulate three applicable theoretical propositions for further analysis. These
propositions merit further research as they represent new perspectives on

Figure 1.

<-----Page 9----->inter-organizational relationships. They also provide an alternative hypothesis that
partly contradicts existing literature in the area of inter-organizational relationships.
We thus state:
P1.

Inter-personal trust is a relevant but not in itself sufficient condition for the
development of sustainable business relationships.

It appears that inter-personal trust alone is an insufficient condition for the
development of stable business relationships because it fails to capture the underlying
interests and objectives of organizations. Consider the well-known case of Baird v.
Marks and Spencer (Mellahi et al., 2002; Blois, 2003; Harrison, 2004). Following their
declared business objective to restructure their sourcing policies and improve
profitability, Marks and Spencer informed their supplier Baird that its current orders
due for delivery would be the last, and that the business relationship would terminate
at that point. Subsequently, supplier Baird, who hitherto trusted Marks and Spencer,
sued their customer to obtain compensation for the cost of closing several production
sites and for providing redundancy payments. In this case, pre-existing inter-personal
trust, built over a 30-year relationship, was not by itself sufficient to sustain the
relationship in the face of changing business objectives and interests. The trust issue in
this case is whether Baird would renew or renegotiate a new relationship with Marks
and Spencer for purely business reasons. For Baird, a renewal or renegotiation is most
likely if they could either arrange a “watertight” contract or if they had a sufficiently
diverse portfolio of clients to be able to risk the future loss of Marks and Spencer. If
trust is broken or lost, then it is useful to consider the existence of the constituent parts
of a relationship without trust. Therefore, we posit that business relationships can be
developed despite the lack of inter-personal trust, purely based on reliance. This is
related in our second proposition, which deals with a hitherto neglected group of
inter-organizational relationships, i.e. expedient ones:
P2.

Trust and
reliance

Reliance is a necessary and sufficient condition for the development of
expedient business relationships.

Expedient relationships demonstrate a high degree of symbiotic interdependence and
co-operation without depending on inter-personal trust. They are also referred to in the
literature as “interimistic” relationships (Lambe et al., 2000) or symbiotic arrangements
(Schanze, 1998). This distinct class of expedient business relationships requires the
creation of reliance through the existence of certain conditions, such as business
objectives, contractual documents, absence of control via equity investment,
conceptual links expressed in brands or design, relationship specific investments, as
well as monitoring and sanctioning of contractual behaviour (Schanze, 1998). For
example, the development of the Euro-fighter with cooperating cross-border firms is
based on the building of reliance through contractual arrangements that are driven by
governments who award contracts rather than direct trust between the various
participants. Similarly, Sony excelled in consumer electronics by introducing a
worldwide series of highly innovative products at competitive prices. Retailers
co-operated with Sony despite the lack of inter-personal trust because they “relied” on
the company’s proven capacity to continuously introduce innovative products which
were demanded by consumers. The existence of expedient relationships calls for a

Manifestations of consent contribute to an increased reliance in business
relationships.

Manifestations of consent such as contracts (Barnett, 1986; Markovits, 2004),
framework contracts or umbrella agreements (Collins, 1999; Mouzas, 2006) may
provide a rational platform for the achievement of reliance in business relationships.
They directly affect the characteristics of inter-organisational relationships and, while
trust may or may not be a further outcome of their existence, increase the reliance of
the exchange partners on each other and the relationship itself. Companies may also
use more informal manifestations, such as letters, e-mails, minutes or personal
interactions (Macauley, 1963; Roxenhall and Ghauri, 2004). Business relationships
undeniably include personal interactions such as regular or periodic negotiations or
business reviews. Personal interactions are valuable in creating inter-personal trust;
one of the benefits of creating trust in a relationship is, for example, the reduced need
for watertight contractual provisions. The increasing complexity of
inter-organizational exchange relationships, however, makes the manifestation of
business agreements indispensable. For example, the result of the annual negotiation
between manufacturers and retailers includes listings of multiple brands and
stock-keeping units, complex systems of trade allowances, prices and promotions at
the point of sale. In such situations, the consent for these complex exchanges is
manifested as an umbrella agreement between companies. Manifestations are also
necessary for providing evidence for possible reliance losses and measuring the
monetary value of damages (Cohen and McKendrick, 2005).
The above theoretical propositions deviate from existing constructs of “mistrust”,
“impersonal trust” and “organizational trust” and invite reflection on the domain and
limitations of trust. They also draw attention to the contemporary forms of
institutionalized and depersonalized “trust production” (Luhmann, 1979; Zucker, 1986).
Consider the function of auditing firms that periodically review the accounts of a
company’s marketing spending, the work of quality management people who
systematically review marketing processes and certify them according to a set of
standards or the stratified process of business-to-business contracting. The present
study on trust and reliance in business relationships demonstrates that these practices
move beyond the inter-personal sphere and institutionalize the production of
inter-organizational reliance. Inter-organizational reliance is not institutionalized
because of the lack of “trust” or the existence of “mistrust”; inter-organizational
reliance is institutionalized in order to promote certainty and calculability in business
relationships. Looking at the conceptual link between trust and reliance, further
research may explore the mechanisms of producing certainty and calculability in
business relationships.
Developing the research agenda
An agenda for further research in business-to-business marketing needs to include an
investigation of how organizations deal with the inherent uncertainty in the particular
context of business relationships, and how organizations develop and ensure the
calculability and predictability of their business-to-business exchanges. The notion of

<-----Page 11----->trust has been a central construct in business-to-business marketing, particularly in
theories that describe and explain the quality of relationships (Dwyer et al., 1987),
business-to-business co-operation (Young and Wilkinson, 1988; Håkansson et al., 2004),
relational contracting (Jeffries and Reed, 2000; Blois, 2003) and the creation of
trustworthy managerial behaviour (Whitener et al., 1998). What deserves more
attention is the investigation of two research problems. First, further investigation is
needed to define rational standards of reliance in business-to-business marketing in
order to counterbalance the existing conceptual focus on inter-personal trust. Second,
research is needed on the empirical link between trust and reliance in business
relationships.
Let us discuss just two resultant research questions, starting first with reliance in
business-to-business marketing. Since the “production” of reliance becomes
institutionalized and depersonalized, research could be directed at how organizations
ensure the achievement of inter-organizational reliance by negotiating, drafting and
monitoring their business-to-business agreements. New forms of relational contracting
(Bazerman and Gillespie, 1999) as well as “implicit” dimensions of discrete, relational
and network contracts (Campbell et al., 2003) may motivate organizations to perform at
or above contractually agreed levels, but we still know very little about the trust and
reliance implications of these contracting forms. Can organizations codify the process
of generating reliance? What is the role of external organizations such as auditing
firms or quality assurance companies? The second research problem is concerned with
the investigation of the link between trust and reliance in business relationships. This
could be done by operationalizing inter-organizational reliance via the construct of
“confidence intervals” as proposed by Smith (2001) and Marsh and Dibben (2005). Such
an approach would provide a dynamic way of understanding the construct of reliance,
which could also be directly linked to managerial actions as well as to contractual
decisions. Does inter-organizational reliance create inter-personal trust? What are the
mechanisms to move beyond personal trust? An answer to these research questions
might be given by investigating the manifestations of managerial cognition. Further
research in this area could provide an answer to the link between “emotions” and
“rationale”, and “commitment” and “proven capacity” and in doing so would enrich our
understanding of business relationships.
Conclusion
While trust has received significant research attention in business-to-business
marketing, far less attention has been paid to the rational standard of reliance and the
inherent link between trust and reliance in business relationships. The present article
has demonstrated that trust in business-to-business marketing is a multifaceted
construct that needs conceptual clarification. As an emotive paradigm it is applicable
to inter-personal relationships. Business relationships, however, comprise
inter-personal and inter-organizational relationships, and therefore this paper
proposes a conceptual framework that adds a rational standard applicable to
inter-organizational relationships, namely that of reliance. We show that through the
introduction of this additional dimension we overcome the cross-level fallacy
hampering research on business relationships. Furthermore, we posit future research
directions that should exploit this multi-faceted construct, linking it with the new
concept of “interimistic” or “expedient” relationships, and so enrich our understanding

of business relationships in general. An understanding of how trust and reliance
impact on each other provides a new theoretical basis that contributes to analytical
clarity and subsequently better managerial recommendations.
