Explaining Alliance Partner
Selection: Fit, Trust and
Strategic Expediency
Paul E. Bierly III and Scott Gallagher

How does a firm select an alliance partner? The decision-making process associated with
selecting an alliance partner is complex and challenging, especially when one considers the
high rate of alliance failure. When managers have access to all relevant information and are
not under time constraints, then they can use a rational, analytical process to evaluate
strategic fit among alternatives. However, this becomes much more difficult when there is
inadequate information. One response is to rely more on trust among individuals and
between firms. We summarise the advantages of relying on trust, but also illustrate how
relying too much on either individual or firm-level trust can be problematic.
Another response is to rely on and develop strategic expediency. This often involves
the use of non-rational decision-making components, and places primary importance on
decision speed rather than comparison of alternative solutions. We identify several techniques that individual managers can use to improve their strategic expediency. We also
provide recommendations to enhance firm-level strategic expediency by developing
a template focusing on formalised criteria for alliance partners.

Introduction
Firms need various resources and capabilities in order to compete with each other effectively. These
resources and capabilities can be (a) acquired, (b) developed internally, or (c) obtained via an ongoing cooperative relationship with another firm through the use of a strategic alliance. The use of
strategic alliances has increased sharply over the last decade and they are particularly effective in
helping a firm maintain a superior competitive position in dynamic environments.1 Alliances allow
firms to focus on those tasks that they do well e frequently called core competencies e and rely on
partners in other areas. Alliances also can improve a firm’s strategic flexibility, since the firm commits fewer resources to each of the different technologies and activities. Moreover, strategic

strategic alliances can provide firms with new sources of competitive
advantage, such as access to new markets and risk reduction
However, many strategic alliances are considered failures. While these failures certainly have
many potential causes, some of them are undoubtedly due to the partner selection process. Developing a better understanding of the partner selection process and providing recommendations to
assist managers may go a long way in reducing this failure rate. In this paper, we critique two established justifications and explanations of the partner selection process, strategic fit and trust, and
discuss the importance of another capability, strategic expediency.
Following the strategic fit premise, partner selection basically consists of choosing to ally with
someone who has the resources you need and whom you can induce, via your own stock of resources,
to collaborate with you. Ideally, the complementarities of both firms’ resources and capabilities produce synergies for both firms. A strategic fit approach generally follows a rational decision-making
process where the firm systematically evaluates different alternatives and chooses an optimal solution.
However, as uncertainty increases, forcing managers to make decisions based on incomplete information, and time pressures intensify, then the partner selection process becomes more complex
and requires other capabilities of the firm making the selection (as shown in Table 1). Firms that
have full information but are forced to make decisions quickly (Number 1 in Table 1) will make
better partner selections if they can efficiently transfer and evaluate information internally. Firms
that lack sufficient information to make selection decisions but do not face time pressures (Number
4) will make better selection decisions if they can develop effective search techniques. When firms
must make rapid decisions with limited information (Number 2), they must rely on trust or strategic expediency.
The role of trust in alliance partner selection has been identified by others as an effective control
mechanism under conditions of uncertainty. This natural inclination to handle conditions of uncertainty by using perceptions of others’ trustworthiness may facilitate the decision-making process,
but it also introduces several threatening issues. Additionally, there are problems with the trust explanation as it has been advanced in the academic literature, including poor measurement of trust
as a variable in empirical studies, and a lack of understanding as to why and where trust resides
within an organisation. A multi-level analysis of trust, which is rarely done, is required to differentiate between interpersonal trust and firm-level trust.
We argue that strategic fit and trust alone do not adequately explain the partner selection process.
Specifically, the importance of time as a strategic variable in forming alliances is not sufficiently
addressed by either concept. We introduce the concept of strategic expediency to fill this gap in
the literature. Strategic expediency is defined as the capability to make rapid, high-quality decisions
within a simplified, bounded framework. Strategic expediency often involves the use of ‘nonrational’ decision-making components, and places primary importance on decision speed rather
than the development of alternative solutions to compare.

<-----Page 2----->Purpose of article
There are three core objectives of this article. First, we develop a basic understanding of how firms
select an alliance partner. Specifically, we develop an understanding how strategic fit, trust and strategic expediency influence a firm’s alliance partner selection, as illustrated in Figure 1. We argue
that strategic fit is certainly a necessary but not always a sufficient reason for partner selection.
We discuss how trust becomes an important factor when there is uncertainty, but we also critique
the way others have over-simplified this complex construct. We further explain that certain industry settings force firms to make decisions rapidly, requiring them to excel in strategic expediency.
Second, we identify common problems that result because of the complexity of the partner selection
decision process. Third, we give recommendations to managers that may help them make better
decisions concerning partners in the future. A summary of these common problems and recommendations is provided in Table 2. We conclude by reiterating some suggestions for managers
and identifying some issues for further consideration by scholars.

Strategic fit
Strategic fit is one of the most common and rational explanations for the way in which the strategic
and resource needs of alliance partners are met. Strategic fit is a source of inducements to collaborate through alliances. These inducements may take two general forms. First, an alliance may provide a firm with access to resources that are not available within the firm. Resources may take the
form of capital, technology, capabilities or firm-specific assets, and are frequently key or critical success factors in an industry. Alliances may also have strategic considerations, as they can help firms
manage their resource dependence on other firms or maintain competitive positioning in their industry. Second, firms may elect to form alliances to gain quick access to new geographic or product
markets. This has led to several significant insights such as the use of alliances for risk-sharing, to
gain access to cutting-edge scientific research, and to tap strategically into country-specific

Problems

Recommendations

1. Lack of accurate understanding of each firm’s resources,
alliance synergies and integration costs. (strategic fit)

1a. Enhance information management by the
effective use of IT and involvement of the
right people in the decision-making process.
1b. Critically evaluate difficulties in obtaining
expected synergies, and anticipate realistic
administrative costs.
2. Don’t allow trust to overshadow key strategic
fit issues; use a devil’s advocate to challenge
assumptions.
3. Step back e ask why you trust a potential
partner and ensure there are no ‘hidden’
biases.
4a. Acknowledge the importance of intuition
and imagery and embrace their use.
4b. Differentiate between intuition and emotion.
4c. Provide constructive feedback on decisions
based on intuition.
5. Develop alliance partner selection template
to guide decision-makers to focus on critical
issues for the firm.

2. Trust is given too much emphasis during partner selection,
hiding other ‘real’ problems. (trust)
3. The perceived trust level of a partner is biased by trust
antecedents that are not indicators of the partner
firm’s behaviour. (trust)
4. It is difficult for managers to make rapid, effective
decisions concerning alliance partner selection when they
only have access to a limited amount of information.

knowledge and capabilities. It is not our intent to make a significant contribution to the considerable literature on fit’s role in partner selection, which includes a recent article in LRP that specifically discusses the importance and challenges of managing fit in alliances.2 Instead, our focus in
this area is to articulate the fundamental problem associated with strategic fit and to provide specific recommendations on how to overcome this challenge.
While it is the firms that possess (or do not possess) fit, it is the managers within them who must
assess it. Of course, in an ideal setting where managers have access to all information required, understand the information and have plenty of time to make decisions (see Number 3 in Table 1),
they can follow a rational, systematic decision-making process in choosing an alliance partner.
Such a process presumes (a) a clearly defined purpose/goal of the alliance, (b) all potential partners
are identifiable, and (c) information is available to the decision-maker about each alternative,
enabling a thorough evaluation of each potential partner. In addition, the available information
enables better monitoring of the alliance and enforcement of its terms. In this favourable decision-making environment, the decision-maker strives to maximise one of the dimensions of strategic fit described above by choosing the best-qualified partner. The core problem associated with
strategic fit arises when the managers making the decision about alliance partner selection are not
provided with information that should be available to them, concerning each partner’s resources,
synergies between the firms and costs associated with integration of their resources. This problem
arises if (a) information within the organisation is not effectively transferred to the top managers
(Number 1 in Table 1) due to communication inefficiencies or biased reporting by individuals with
different perspectives and goals, or (b) members of the organisation fail to search for external information that may be readily available (Number 4).
Problem 1: The manager(s) making the partner selection decision does not have an accurate understanding of (a) his/her firm’s resources, (b) potential partner(s) resources, (c) the synergistic
benefits of the integration of the two firms’ resources, and/or (d) the costs involved.

<-----Page 4----->An example of an alliance that failed because of a misunderstanding of strategic fit was a joint
venture between Coca-Cola and Groupe Danone. In 2002, Groupe Danone formed an alliance
with Coca-Cola to produce and distribute Evian, to offset declines in sales of its flagship Evian water
in the $3.5 billion and rapidly growing US bottled water market. The alliance was designed to help
give Evian a more organised distribution network and greater marketing muscle in fighting lower
priced brands of water, including Coca-Cola’s Dasani brand. Strategic fit appeared excellent, as
Coca-Cola Enterprises, a subsidiary of Coke, already distributed Evian in 60 per cent of the US
and Evian, as a top tier brand, was viewed as a good complement to Coke’s Dasani brand. Ironically, the view that Coke might undermine Evian in favour of its own brand was addressed by the
agreement, which promised ‘.better marketing support and greater assurance that Coke’s bottlers
will promote Evian.’3 However, despite these assurances and the perceived synergies, two years
later Coca-Cola bought out Groupe Danone’s stake, unwinding a joint venture that did not live
up to the expectations of either company. Apparently, the perceived strategic benefit of having
two tiers of a well-understood commodity product like water was not realistic. Consumers knew
the products were essentially similar and were unwilling to pay more for a brand positioned differently. Thus, this is a good example of managers not having an accurate understanding of the
synergistic benefits of an alliance.
Recommendations to prevent or solve Problem 1 come from the vast body of literature on
knowledge management and the management of information systems (MIS).4 Common recommendations discussed in detail by others include:
1. Installing an effective IT system to collect, integrate and disseminate information. Almost every
firm that excels at using strategic alliances to support its competitive advantage, such as Cisco,
Intel and Toyota, has an effective system to funnel critical information to decision-makers.
2. Ensuring decision makers use the IT systems and other resources available to them.
3. Involving all key organisational members in the decision-making process, which will ensure different perspectives and interpretations of information, and facilitate implementation.
4. Creating a knowledge-sharing culture, where the hoarding of information for political advantage
is not tolerated.
5. Challenging overly optimistic assumptions about the alliance, particularly concerning the ability
to achieve synergy and the likelihood of significant administrative costs. Unrealised synergies and
unexpected administrative costs are probably the main reasons why alliances justified on the
basis of strategic fit are unsuccessful.

Trust
We define trust as the mutual confidence that no party to an exchange will exploit another’s
vulnerabilities, because opportunistic behaviour would violate values, principles and standards of
behaviour that have been internalised by parties to an exchange.5 Trust between the organisational
partners has been empirically demonstrated to be important for alliance formation.6 Trust can be
a substitute for formal control mechanisms, reduce transactions costs, facilitate dispute resolution,
and allow more flexibility in an alliance. Therefore, when trust among partners is high, partners
have more confidence in each other and the probability of opportunism decreases. A reputation
for being trustworthy can be a competitive advantage for a firm and may facilitate openness by partners in subsequent alliances. In this paper, we focus on trust independent of the existence of social
and economic governance mechanisms e what has been referred to as strong-form trust and
unconditional trust.

138

Explaining Alliance Partner Selection

<-----Page 5----->When the partner selection decision is made under conditions of limited information, perceived
trust of potential partners becomes an important issue. Under these conditions, strategic fit is necessary, but not sufficient. The uncertainty associated with limited information creates opportunities
for partners to act in an opportunistic and unfair manner, since written contracts and control
mechanisms are less effective under conditions of uncertainty. Trust at either the individual or
the firm level reduces the risks of opportunism. Thus, partner selection decisions under conditions
of limited information and high uncertainty require both strategic fit and trust among partners.
Partner selection decisions based on more certain conditions have less opportunity for unfair behaviour and don’t necessarily require partner trust, only conditions of strategic fit. Alliances may
be formed with partners that are not trusted, if formal contracts can be comprehensive and appropriate controls are in place.
Unfortunately, trust is a vague construct that is difficult to observe and measure. For example,
many academic researchers have used prior ties as a way to operationalise trust. Yet relatively
few alliances (14 per cent) are formed between firms who have prior ties; moreover, prior ties could
sow distrust instead of trust.7 While using prior ties may be a legitimate empirical compromise,
such ties can also be explained by other partner selection issues, such as power, search costs, inertia
and path dependence. Furthermore, prior ties could easily be a reason why firms do not ally further,
either because they exhaust opportunities to further leverage each other’s resources, or because one
firm distrusts the other after it becomes familiar with it. For example, eBay recently spurned longtime partner Google because of Google’s increased offerings of payment services and product listings that compete with eBay, and entered into an alliance with Google’s rival Yahoo for graphical
advertising in the US. However, three months later eBay has again allied with Google for the exact
same service, placement of graphical advertisements, outside of the US. This vacillation suggests
that evolving strategic fit concerns drive alliance selection more than trust between the two firms.

while the alliance is between organisations, it is consummated by
individuals whose individual trustworthiness is influenced by their
association with their firm
Prior research on the drivers of trust
Trust is a multi-level construct that has been analysed at both the firm and individual levels of analysis. Applying the trust literature to strategic alliances is difficult, because while the alliance is
between organisations, it is consummated by individuals whose individual trustworthiness is influenced by their association with their firm. Table 3 summarises the diverse prior research for antecedents to trust, organised by source and level of trust. Characteristics of the trustor (eg propensity
to trust), the trustee (eg reputation) and the relationship are outlined. These antecedents can be
categorised into the following four broad categories.
1. Social networks.8 The social networks of firms and the individuals within firms guide the perceptions of trust between potential alliance partners. These relationships provide information about
potential partners that enable a more thorough evaluation of strategic fit and increase confidence in
their future behaviour. These social networks facilitate communication, provide social norms to
guide behaviour, and provide opportunities for institutionally based trust commonalties to be recognised. Opportunistic behaviour is minimised because the repercussions of such behaviour would
also affect numerous other relationships. In addition to direct prior ties between firms and individuals of different firms (eg top managers, researchers), common social network links, such as common alliance partners, suppliers, customers and consultants, also influence the development of
trust. These complex social networks of firms may be large, stable, industrialised conglomerates,
such as a keiretsu in Japan or a chaebol in South Korea, or smaller and more fluid networks,

2. Cultural and organisational similarity.9 A firm, and its top management team, will have more
trust and confidence in another firm if it feels comfortable and is not threatened by the way the
other firm conducts business. Tacit understanding is facilitated by having similar cultures, similar
control systems, and similar accounting and human resource practices. Greater tacit understanding

<-----Page 7----->helps firm managers understand and feel more comfortable with their partner firm’s operations.
Understanding and familiarity help promote trust. The firm will have more confidence in its ability
to predict the behaviour of its partner and understand its routinised regimes if they are more similar. In the same way, two firms that are of similar size are more likely to trust each other because
there is less threat of the larger firm using its power to take advantage of the smaller partner.
Additionally, firms from the same regional cluster or alliance network are more likely to trust
each other, partly because they are more likely to have similar cultures, but also because firms
within social networks tend to be more cooperative and less likely to display opportunistic behaviour. Of course, culturally dissimilar firms may still form alliances, one example being Microsoft
and Apple Computer, but cultural and organisational similarity facilitates trust.
3. Reputation.10 A firm’s reputation is a socially constructed concept and is the outcome of the
process of legitimisation. Firm legitimacy can be created by both external sources of endorsement,
such as business press articles, and by internal characteristics and qualifications of the firm management. Firms develop a general reputation e which influences trust - based on their past actions
that demonstrate their ability, integrity and openness. Top management’s experience, education,
professional credentials, integrity and past citizenship behaviour also legitimise the firm and provide confidence to outsiders.
In general, a firm’s reputation will influence the degree to which it is trusted in two ways. First,
a stronger reputation and higher legitimacy will increase trust because others will know more about
the firm and there will be less uncertainty. Individuals from this firm will be viewed as more stable
and perceived transaction costs will be lower. Second, the more positive the reputation, the more likely
it is to increase trust. Clearly, if a firm has a reputation as being a fair and considerate partner, its managers will be trusted more than managers of firms that have a reputation for taking advantage of their
partners. It is therefore advantageous for them to develop a reputation of being a good partner, and
opportunistic behaviour in one alliance would reduce their other partners’ trust in them.
4. Propensity to trust.11 The degree of trust a firm has in its partner is not only based on the partner’s characteristics but also on the trustor’s propensity to trust. Not to delve too deeply into psychology, an individual’s propensity to trust and distrust others largely depends on the individual’s early life
experiences. How people are treated at an early age by their parents, friends and other influential people can create lifelong barriers to trusting others that are difficult to break down. Rotter developed
a widely used measure of individuals’ willingness to trust others to support this dispositional theory
of trust, treating propensity to trust in a similar way to personality traits.12 An individual’s propensity
to trust strongly influences trust during an initial meeting, but is less important over time as the
individual learns more about others through experience. According to McKnight, Cummings and
Chervany, disposition to trust is based not only on an individual’s willingness to trust others, which
they call faith in humanity, but also in the individual’s ‘trusting stance.’13 An individual with high
‘trusting stance’ believes that it is usually best to trust others, regardless of their history, because
this behaviour will influence others’ future actions. Thus, starting a relationship trusting a partner
will lead to more trustworthy behaviour by a self-fulfilling prophecy.

a firm will have a higher propensity initially to trust its partner if it has
an organisational culture that promotes and rewards trustworthiness
as a natural way of doing business
Organisations, not just individuals, also have differing propensities to trust. Certainly, the results of
prior partnerships will influence a firm’s willingness to trust a new partner. A firm that was exploited in
the past by a partner it trusted will be less trusting of a future partner. A firm’s national culture will also
affect its propensity to trust others. For example, Japan is a more trust-based society, where there is
Long Range Planning, vol 40

2007

141

<-----Page 8----->more collective responsibility and a longer-term orientation. In such a setting, a Japanese firm is more
likely initially to trust a partner in the same society, even if it knows little about them. Interestingly,
Japanese firms’ propensity to trust often does not extend to firms outside their country.
Additionally, a firm will have a higher propensity initially to trust its partner if it has an organisational culture that promotes and rewards trustworthiness as a natural way of doing business. Individuals working in an organisational culture where they trust each other will also have a higher
propensity to trust others outside the organisation, which will lay the foundation for the firm as
a whole initially to trust its alliance partner.
Problems with trust
As discussed above, trust can effectively complement strategic fit during partner selection in the
presence of uncertainty. Partners that trust each other can reduce the risks of opportunism. However, trust can also be used inappropriately during the decision-making process. Too much emphasis may be placed on the trustworthiness of a partner, to the extent that important issues concerning
strategic fit are not properly analysed. Because the partners trust each other, major problems such as
conflicting organisational cultures may be ‘swept under the rug’ to be dealt with later. In some extreme cases, trust may be ‘the tail that wags the dog.’ Two firms, or two individuals in the two firms
may trust and respect each other so much that they decide to form an alliance before a rationale for
strategic fit is developed; the rationale comes later to validate the alliance. But often the rationale for
strategic fit is forced, not thoroughly analysed, and the alliance falls apart.
An example of this phenomenon is the joint venture between General Electric and Cisco e GE
Cisco Industrial Networks. The impetus of this alliance was the personal relationship between Jack
Welch, then CEO of GE, and John Chambers, CEO of Cisco. The two avid golfers periodically met
on the links, and the conversation occasionally drifted toward how the two companies should work
together, without identifying any specific course of strategic fit beyond the fact that they both had
strong brands. In this situation, trust between the two companies was very strong because of the
social connectedness of the two CEOs and the impeccable reputations of the two firms. Eventually,
Welch asked GE managers to come up with ideas how GE and Cisco could work together. A midlevel manager, Jeff Pompeo (whom we interviewed for this paper), championed the idea of a GECisco joint venture to sell ethernet-based products and services for manufacturing environments.
However, after the initial agreement between the two companies was announced in 2000, the formation of the joint venture took a long time, partly because this type of deal did not fit the template
for due diligence used by Cisco in other alliances and partly because of Cisco’s reluctance to assign
quality employees to the project. The alliance subsequently floundered as manufacturers were more
reluctant to shift from their current proprietary network systems to the more open ethernet-based
systems that the alliance advocated. This resistance was further exacerbated by the downturn in US
manufacturing in late 2001. Industry analysts claimed that a major cause of the problems was that
the two companies had divergent goals associated with the project.14
Problem 2: Trust is given too much emphasis during partner selection, hiding other
‘real’ problems.
To avoid this type of problem, the recommendation is for managers to ensure that the strategic fit
of the firms is strong, particularly when the trust level of the partner is very high and may overshadow key issues. The firm may choose a specific individual to play the role of devil’s advocate,
to challenge the pervasive admiration of a specific potential partner. The managers should ensure
that trust is used as a response to uncertainty, not as an excuse to avoid or delay the analysis of
specific problems that should be part of the decision-making process. Cisco’s alliance partner selection process involved formal processes to follow due diligence and evaluate strategic fit. The ‘red
flags’ that were raised forced mid-level managers to evaluate the benefits of the alliance objectively,
and temporarily blocked alliance formation. However, these signals were eventually disregarded,
mainly because the mid-level managers were acutely aware of Jack Welch’s personal feelings toward
John Chambers and Cisco.
142

Explaining Alliance Partner Selection

<-----Page 9----->the perception of trust by the key decision-makers may not be
consistent with the partner’s past and future behaviour
Another problem with relying on trust is that the perception of trust by the key decision-makers
may not be consistent with the partner’s past and future behaviour. As we discussed above, there are
many antecedents to trust, at both the firm and the individual level. Some of these antecedents are
excellent predictors of behaviour, but others are not. Specifically, the following are examples of
antecedents that may give firms a false sense of trust about a partner.
1. Trust based on relationships of individuals: An individual in one firm may know another
individual in a potential partner firm well and assume the other firm is trustworthy. Their personal
relationship may be sound and the two may trust each other. But does knowing an individual in
a firm is trustworthy indicate that the firm itself will not act opportunistically during the partnership? The less involvement the individual in the partner firm has with its strategic decision-making
team and directly with the alliance, the less assurance there is that the partner firm will behave in
a trustworthy manner.
2. Trustor’s (over-) propensity to trust: The propensity of the individual decision-maker or the
firm to trust may be high, due to past experiences. However, if attributes of the trustor are strongly
influencing trust in a partner, independent of reputation and past behaviour of the partner, then
that trust in the partner may be inappropriate. The firm may enter into an alliance fraught with
environmental uncertainty, with a partner it should not have trusted.
3. Cultural similarity: Firms are more likely to trust other firms that are culturally similar and
individuals are more likely to trust other individuals who are culturally similar. But is this appropriate, or a form of prejudice? Even though cultural similarity may make communication easier and
may facilitate the two firms working together, it does not necessarily provide an accurate indication
of whether the partner will act opportunistically given the chance to do so. The general belief that
firms more like us are more honourable and firms not like us are less honourable is certainly problematic and will unfairly bias the partner selection process. Also, cultural similarity of partners may
limit learning opportunities, since the firm will be exposed to fewer new ideas.
Problem 3: The perceived trust level of a partner is biased by trust antecedents that are not
accurate indicators of the partner firm’s behaviour.
The solution to this problem appears straightforward. Decision-makers need to understand what
factors influence trust and be able to evaluate why they do or do not trust potential partners.
Are their own biases influencing the decision? Simply being aware of potential biases may help
managers focus more tightly on factors that are truly indicative of partner firm behaviour.

Strategic expediency
Despite the importance of strategic fit and trust in alliance partner selection, these two constructs
alone do not adequately describe the partner selection process. Neither construct appropriately
accounts for the role of time e the external time constraints associated with many industry environments and the ability of managers to make high-quality, effective partner selection decisions
under these time pressures. We refer to this capability as ‘strategic expediency’ and in the following
sections we will explain how strategic expediency affects alliance partner selection. As indicated in
Figure 1, strategic expediency will affect partner selection most when the external time constraints
are most intense, such as in hypercompetitive industries.

<-----Page 10----->strategic expediency is based on issues surrounding pre-emption. To the extent that firms are reluctant
to ally with firms who already have alliances with their competitors, mostly due to increased risk of
opportunism, path dependency becomes an important consideration for alliance formation. For example, in the global auto industry firms have formed alliance clusters, but there are relatively few cases
of overlap between them. Alliance partners may be pre-empted, with firms moving later operating at
a disadvantage compared to those that move earlier. Thus, the quantity of alliances in an industry will
create pressure for firms to form alliances quickly with desirable or potentially desirable partners.
This pre-emption is especially important when the industry setting creates institutional pressures
for firms to form alliances to enhance legitimacy. For example, a resource or capability that can be
obtained by an alliance may become a necessary prerequisite for firms to be considered legitimate
members of that industry. A variety of stakeholders may exert this pressure, including institutional
shareholders, customers, suppliers, governments, and the press.

the quantity of alliances in an industry will create pressure for firms to
form alliances quickly with desirable or potentially desirable partners
In general, as more firms in an industry become involved in alliances, managers may feel compelled to enter into alliances as well, in order to minimise future constraints on partner selection.
An excellent example of this issue is occurring right now in China. Many firms, especially those in
Europe and the United States, are feeling intense competitive pressure from shareholders to enter
the Chinese market, which frequently requires them to enter into a joint venture arrangement with
a Chinese firm. Cross border alliances have been common: for example retailer Tesco invested $260
million in the Ting Cao hypermarket chain, and Japanese firms Asahi Breweries and Itochu bought
50 per cent of the Chinese beverage firm Tingyi Holding. This type of aggressive activity highlights
the problems of constraints on partner selection e since there is a limited number of high-quality
firms that would make enviable partners, firms need to select a partner quickly or else risk being
shut out of the opportunity to choose one at all. The possibility of strategic fit with a potential partner diminishes after that firm forms an alliance with one of your rivals.
Another source of the need for strategic expediency arises because in many industries there is
relatively more emphasis on speed and rapid decision-making. Some industries experience periods
of rapid technology transfer across national and organisational boundaries, increasing their pace of
competitive dynamics. Numerous popular publications, such as Fast Company, have perpetuated
the popular (American) cliché ‘time is money’ by enhancing the perception of time and swift action
as important resources for firms. Scholarly research has documented top management teams explicitly being less concerned with always being correct and more concerned with being able to move
quickly.15 In a way, this is the institutionalisation of Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) CEO Percy
Barnevik’s famous ‘7-3 formula‘ that it is better to act quickly and only be right 70 per cent of
the time, than to wait and try to be right 100 per cent of the time. This faster pace of business
has increased the importance of time as a strategic resource, especially in rapidly moving hightechnology industries. Additionally, a study recently published in LRP examined success factors
of strategic alliances and ranked ‘awareness of time requirements’ and ‘speedy implementation
and fast results’ highly; in one instance these attributes outranked ‘trust’.16

Explaining Alliance Partner Selection

<-----Page 11----->Choosing strategic partners in faster and more dynamic environments requires managers to
make decisions quickly, possibly at the expense of making accurate decisions since they are often
without adequate information. It is not a coincidence that the rapidly changing, high-technology
industries, such as biotechnology, semiconductors and software, that value time as a strategic
resource, are also the industries where alliances occur most frequently. Alliances are very effective
in increasing flexibility and helping firms respond quickly to external opportunities and threats.
Clearly, the more dynamic and uncertain the industry setting, the greater the need for strategic
expediency will be when managers are attempting to select an alliance partner.
However, strategic expediency is a capability that is elusive for many, because most managers do
not appreciate the importance of using non-rational decision-making techniques when there is not
enough information and time available to follow a rational decision-making process. The need for
strategic expediency creates individual problems for the specific managers forced to make the partner selection decision, and problems for the firm in making strategic expediency an organisationwide capability.
Problem 4: It is difficult for managers to make rapid, effective decisions concerning alliance
partner selection when they only have access to a limited amount of information.
Problem 5: The strong strategic expediency capabilities of individual managers are usually not
transferred throughout the firm. Firms fail to facilitate the rapid and accurate examination
and evaluation of alliance partners.
Increasing individual and firm strategic expediency
Consistent with our multi-level approach, we identify ways for both individual managers and firms
to improve their strategic expediency. As we noted earlier, in most industry settings, top managers
must make rapid decisions within a bounded framework. Therefore, we base our thinking about
how managers and their organisations may increase strategic expediency on a broad array of theoretical foundations, including satisficing, bounded rationality, image theory and intuition. In addition, managers’ perceptions of information have been shown frequently to be flawed and subject
to influence by third parties acting as provocateurs, legitimisers or experts.17 These challenges are
even more pronounced in hypercompetitive industries.
1. Individuals’ strategic expediency. When executives do not have time fully to analyse their
environment, their own firm’s capabilities and potential partners’ abilities, what do they do? The
value of time and the costs and difficulty of searching for an optimum solution were first described
by March and Simon as bounded rationality and satisficing.18 When making complex, non-routine
decisions, managers tend to simplify the process by limiting their search for alternatives to wellknown options. They do not necessarily search for the optimal solution, but instead conclude
the decision-making process after a satisfactory solution is found.
But this leaves open an important question: for alliance partner selection, what exactly might this
satisfactory solution look like? Image theory can be used to describe decision-making in a way that
is consistent with information constraints and facilitates strategic expediency.19 Image theory posits
that decision-makers utilise broad conceptualisations of their values, desired future states and strategic challenges in judging alternatives. Managers develop an image of what they want the results of
the alliance to be for their firm. The conceptualisations and applications of these images are a logical
response to the accuracy versus cognitive effort dichotomy that underlies decision-making in the
presence of opportunity costs and uncertainty. These broad images are substitutes for pure rational
decision-making, yet help decision-makers constructively direct their organisation. They provide
a general guide on what is desirable rather than a detailed map. Their use helps explain why and
how managers often make effective decisions for their organisations, despite often having very
poor perceptions of seemingly relevant considerations.
An example of firms using image theory to expedite the alliance selection process, but also an example of a major pitfall, is the alliance between Toys R Us and Amazon.com, which recently ended
through litigation. Court documents show that the parties appeared to have an excellent strategic fit.

<-----Page 12----->Amazon had the technical web skills to help Toys R Us avoid the $100 million investment needed for
order fulfillment. In 1999 Amazon had sold $65 million in toys on its own, but it lacked Toys R Us’s
expertise of the toy industry. Amazon was particularly weak in understanding the industry’s harsh
inventory requirements, and had to write down $39 million of toy inventory in 1999. Furthermore
the parties started with a considerable amount of trust; witnesses citing the people involved as
‘delightful and bright’ and testified in the early years that they ‘never once needed to refer to the contract.’ However, this alliance had to be negotiated and implemented quickly in order to meet the
Christmas 2000 demand. Discussions started at the Chicago O’Hare airport in May resulted in
a signed agreement by August 9th, and Toys R Us had fully migrated to Amazon by September.
Both Toys R Us and Amazon used an image of their ideal future position to enable rapid agreement
and implementation of the alliance. However, they had different visions of what it meant to be the
‘best’ toy store. Amazon envisioned leading the industry by having as many products as possible
available, ie ‘a selection competitive advantage’; while Toys R Us envisioned always having the
most popular toys available and in stock for customers, ie ‘an availability competitive advantage.’
The seeds of the failure of their alliance lay in the fact that Amazon’s efforts to fulfill its vision conflicted with the exclusivity Toys R Us had for selling toys on Amazon. Thus, in this case the use of
image theory helped expedite the alliance selection and implementation process, but also contributed to its failure because the firms never compared their images and realised the conflict.
Amazon and Toys R Us might have been helped by an appreciation of a concept about individual
decision-making that has recently resurfaced e the value of intuition. Chester Barnard, back in
1938, observed that many decisions by executives did not follow a rational, analytic process, but
instead relied on intuition and judgment through a ‘non-rational’ decision-making process.20 Intuition is important when time pressures do not allow decisions to be made through a systematic,
analytic process. However, it is important to differentiate between intuition and emotion. Intuition
draws on the executives’ experience, training and prior learning, by rapidly applying ‘chunks’ or
patterns of information stored in memory to a specific situation. Intuition produces rapid solutions
using recognition cues based on professional judgment. On the other hand, decisions based on
emotion can be considered ‘irrational’ in the sense that they are based not on knowledge accrued
through experience, but on an individual’s current feelings and biases. Skilled managers making
decisions based on intuition are surprisingly effective, but decisions based on emotion are usually
poor decisions.21
Herbert Simon effectively illustrated the effectiveness of intuition in decision-making by analysing the behaviour of chess grandmasters.22 These experts can play as many as 50 games simultaneously, taking only seconds to decide each move, and maintain a high level of play. They do not
have time to carefully analyse each move. Instead, they use their experience to rapidly evaluate patterns and clusters of pieces on the board. Their almost automatic decisions concerning moves are
based on cues of opportunism and dangers associated with the different patterns. They are not consciously evaluating alternatives, but relying on their intuition, to such an extent that they cannot
articulate how they make decisions. Additionally, chess masters have amazing recall of pieces after
glancing at a board during a normal game. But if pieces are randomly placed on a board, their recall
is no better than that of a novice; their intuition does not help them because there are no meaningful patterns among the pieces.

Skilled managers making decisions based on intuition are surprisingly
effective, but decisions based on emotion are usually poor decisions
We are not advocating that managers should forego a formal analysis of the potential alliance
partners and rely only on intuition. Formal analyses should be performed as data and time permit.
However, intuition can be a powerful tool to supplement the rational decision-making process.
146

Explaining Alliance Partner Selection

<-----Page 13----->Managers can improve rapid decision-making, and strategic expediency, by better utilising intuition
in the following ways. First, they can acknowledge the importance of intuition in decision-making
and embrace its use when it is appropriate. A common problem is the postponement of a decision
because a formal, rational analysis cannot be conducted that ‘justifies’ the decision. Some organisational cultures may place an unwarranted negative stigma on intuition. Second, managers should
have a clear understanding of when their decision involves intuition, which is based on their
own training and experience and not simply on broader emotion. Traditional decision-making
aids, such as having someone play the role of devil’s advocate, may assist in determining whether
the intuitive decision is appropriate. Third, managers should provide constructive feedback to
decision-makers using intuition, and ensure they get feedback on their own decisions, so that
they can all better learn from an honest interpretation of their actions. Feedback will also help improve confidence in the managers who are hesitant to rely on intuition. Fourth, managers should
practise integrating intuition and the use of imagery. Sadler-Smith & Shefy and Hogarth have
argued that imagery can improve intuition because executives have problems putting many insights
into words; a visual image can be used to express a richer, more tacit understanding of relationships
and concepts.23
2. Firms’ strategic expediency. How can an organisation develop better strategic expediency
capabilities? The firm integrates the views of its individual managers to make a firm-level decision,
while also providing a backdrop of policies and procedures to help guide managerial actions. So
firms develop strategic expediency in two ways: by having policies and procedures in place that
facilitate quick decision-making by their managers, and by providing their managers with opportunities to practise their decision-making skills.
Firms use their policies, procedures and organisational culture to facilitate the evaluation of potential partners by creating what has been called categorisation schemas. The categorisation schema
is important because it provides the foundation for the image created by the firm’s managers about
their desired future state for their organization, and it is something that can be formally structured
at the firm level. Therefore, categorisation schemas embody a broad range of variables to help managers make sense of other firms, other managers in those firms, and the value of allying with them.
These schemas can serve as the basis for decision frames about alliances and partnering. How decisions are framed has been shown to be an important variable for both individuals and firms,
thereby enhancing a firm’s ability to develop strategic expediency.24
For example, consider a firm’s schema for evaluating the benefit of being an early mover. The importance of entry order has been academically modeled using the considerations that drive a first mover:
the benefits of pre-empting assets, creating switching costs to dissuade consumers from moving to a rival’s product, and gaining reputational advantages offset against the risks of failure, free-riders and
inertia. The firm’s categorisation schema will influence the relative positions of these considerations,
or the decision to use them at all. For example, a firm that has been a successful early mover in the
past may decide this is always a good thing to do, regardless of what academic theory suggests.

firms that have a prior history and cultural similarities can be evaluated
faster (for good or ill) than those that do not
Partner selection will depend in part on how quickly the firm can assess its pool of partners,
based on its schema. Thus, in addition to strategic fit considerations, partner selection will be influenced by how quickly another firm can be identified as acceptable. For example, firms that have
a prior history and cultural similarities can be evaluated faster (for good or ill) than those that
do not. When a prospective partner firm is unfamiliar and the cost of obtaining information about
its technical and organisational capabilities is high, it is less likely it will be chosen as a partner for
strategic fit or trust reasons. In these cases, time pressure will play a greater role.
Long Range Planning, vol 40

147

<-----Page 14----->Categorisation schemas influence strategic expediency, because information that is not known
about a potential partner is assumed based on the categorisation schema used by the decisionmaker. However, rather than being based on trustworthiness, the categorisation schema related
to strategic expediency centres on the firms’ competence, effectiveness and ability to implement
the actions the alliance will undertake (a concept that could be called ‘swift competence’).
Since the firm must move from a range of individual opinions and assessments to one firm-level
decision, the metaphor of a collective mind of the firm may be helpful. One of the most important
ways to improve the decisions of a collective mind is to improve heedfulness - defined as acting
carefully, purposefully and attentively.25 One of the best ways to improve heedfulness at the organisational level is to help structure the views and opinions of its members along similar relevant criteria. Therefore, the careful consideration and development of a consistent template, essentially an
intended categorisation schema, for evaluating alliance partners may be a useful way for firms to
help guide their managers’ thinking - thereby increasing their strategic expediency. Developing
an intended categorisation schema in advance is helpful because it can be done so in a systematic
manner without the pressure that usually surrounds alliance decisions. In addition, early development allows for time for debate and dissent that otherwise might not occur. For example, Warren
Buffett provides Berkshire Hathaway’s managers with a very clear template that outlines criteria to
be used when deciding to invest in another firm. He also displays the template and gives examples
of how it is used in their annual report to help explain their strategic decision-making to stockholders. Using this template has enabled Berkshire Hathaway to acquire other companies that fit
his ‘acquisition criteria’ very quickly - sometimes after only a few brief phone calls and faxes.
Another successful use of a systematic template for evaluating alliance partners is employed by
the US firm Cisco.26 During the late 1990s networking technology was advancing rapidly, frequently
doubling in capacity every six months. Therefore, time was a critical strategic variable. Not surprisingly, Cisco articulated our idea of having a general image of its future, following not merely an ‘if
the customer wants it, we’ll get it’ strategy but a ‘we’ll get it quickly’ strategy. While acquisitions
were frequently their preferred method for acquiring technology, alliance partnerships were also
important. Cisco established a 134-person strategic alliances group to co-ordinate critical alliances
across its production, distribution and service functions. Lauded during the internet ‘bubble’ in the
United States, this firm systematically refined its alliance search and screening process in order to
remain ahead of its market rivals. Cisco developed clear criteria for due diligence of alliances that
helped it quickly evaluate potential alliance partners. The broad guidelines for alliances included
making sure the partnership had a customer focus, was of significant size (over US$500 million
in revenue within three years), and moving into a new area to ensure minimal product service overlap. These criteria were consistent with Cisco’s efforts to stay ahead of the fast-moving market while
being able to allow the ‘customer to choose’ from an array of providers of networking equipment.
During the 1990s, Cisco formed alliances with Hewlett-Packard (to incorporate Cisco routers into
HP hubs), a series of alliances with IBM (to utilise IBM’s networking hardware and support) and an
equity purchase in Cascade (to increase their line of internet switches), as well as marketing agreements with MCI, NEC, Northern Telecom, Madge Networks, and eventually even Microsoft and
Intel. These alliances are consistent with our model, in that while strategic fit was present, the timing of the decision was also influenced by strategic expediency driven by the fast-moving market
where Cisco maintained a general image of how it wanted to compete.
Developing such a template for alliances is consistent with the insight that a dedicated alliance
function can help firms generate and evaluate alliance opportunities. Empirical evidence indicates
that firms that have more alliances and dedicate executives specifically to monitoring and developing alliances reap higher financial rewards.27 The development of a template thus becomes an
effective way of developing strategic expediency across the organisation. Learning from the successful decisions of individual managers, possibly based on intuition and difficult for others to understand, can be more easily transferred throughout the organisation. Individual managers can use the
template as a guide to frame and establish boundaries for their partner selection decisions, and still
rely heavily on their intuition in choosing a specific partner.

Explaining Alliance Partner Selection

<-----Page 15----->Firms can also develop strategic expediency as an organisational capability in two other ways.
First, the organisation can ensure that constant constructive feedback is received on decisions
made using intuition, so that an honest appreciation of their consequences can be gained. Chess
players get instant, honest feedback as they take or lose pieces and win or lose games. Managers
should ensure similar feedback is received by developing appropriate systems, such as the documentation of prior alliance experiences. Feedback will also help improve confidence in the managers
who are hesitant to rely on intuition. It may also be possible to ‘practise’ decisions, by keeping
council with those who have made similar ones in the past and with whom one can be candid about
mistakes as well as successes. This is an area where consultants, former board members and retired
members of the top management team can be especially helpful.

received on decisions made using intuition, so that an honest
appreciation of their consequences can be gained
Second, if the firm is forming a strategic alliance with a partner in an industry where its managers
lack the experience and understanding needed to use intuition effectively, then the managers involved in the alliance partner decision may need assistance from outsiders who are experts in
this area. This will provide more information about the industry, which will help to better evaluate
strategic fit, but will also help the decision-makers get a ‘feel’ for the industry. Google’s series of
partnerships with media and entertainment companies over the past several years provides an
example. Throughout 2004 and 2005, Google’s relationships with media and entertainment companies floundered as Google maintained different views concerning copyright laws. However, in
2006 Google started the policy of hiring executives from the specific media and entertainment
industries it targeted for alliances, and used these executives to guide them through the partner
selection and negotiation processes. The results have been impressive, as evidenced by Google
CEO Eric Schmidt claiming now ‘we can approach them (the media and entertainment firms) in
a way that we can actually do business together and not screw things up.’ More potential partners
now want to ally with Google. A CBS executive stated that before Google ‘didn’t show proper
respect for us as potential partners,’ but added that now ‘we’re quite happy with them. They
have more people who have taken more time to understand the business of their partners.’28

Conclusion
This article has articulated how a multiple level of analysis approach to understanding strategic fit
and trust, coupled with a new appreciation for time as embodied in the concept of strategic expediency, can better inform the alliance partner selection process. First, we explained how strategic fit
is a very important issue, but that fit alone cannot be used to explain the alliance selection process
in many situations. Second, we discussed how trust becomes more critical as uncertainty increases,
but that the concept of trust, as previously modeled theoretically and applied, has serious limitations. Third, we described how challenges of time create distinct pressures on executives to act expeditiously and rely more on intuition, rather than simply following a rational decision-making
process. We introduced the concept of strategic expediency as an important organisational capability for success in such high-velocity industries.
We believe that scholars have over-focused on trust as an explanation for alliance partner selection. Many of the limitations of measuring trust by using prior ties have been identified by others.
We are more concerned with two key theoretical limitations of using trust to explain alliance partner selection, and one resulting implication. The first issue is the bilateral nature of trust. Trust is an
interactive process between both a trustee and a trustor that arises out of interaction and manifests
Long Range Planning, vol 40

<-----Page 16----->itself as knowledge. Second, the issue of whereabouts trust resides in the organisation is also important. Who is the relevant ‘trustor’? This could play a very important role in industries such as biotechnology, where the large number of alliances suggests alliance partner selection decisions extend
to multiple levels of the organisation, not just the top management team. Finally, there is a great
risk in using trust as a residual to explain outcomes in the alliance partner selection process. We
argue that the construct of strategic expediency demonstrates that there is a wide range of additional considerations entering the alliance partner selection decision besides strategic fit and trust.
The concept of strategic expediency improves our understanding of the partner selection process
by giving a more central role to the pressures of time. Strategy scholars frequently note the pressures
of the environment in driving organisational change and alliances as a way to grapple with that
change. The construct of strategic expediency is a way to acknowledge time’s important role in
the partner selection process, on a par with resource endowments (ie strategic fit) and trust.
Strategic expediency also fits in well with some calls for organisations to shift to more sense-andrespond type strategic frameworks.29 Furthermore, an appreciation of strategic expediency may
help firms move past the desire to over-analyse a decision that cannot be understood in a rational
way, and more towards thinking about how best to implement that strategic decision.

The concept of strategic expediency improves our understanding of the
partner selection process by giving a more central role to the pressures
of time
We worry that a lot of academic writing is not applicable to the obvious reality of many executives’ lives. Awareness and appreciation of the use of intuition on a daily basis by executives is a classic example. As well as improving partner selection, recognising the role of intuition may actually
help managers to make the alliance itself more successful. Why? Since managers are expected to act
rationally, they are compelled to devise and use strategic fit explanations for their alliance partner
choice to internal and external stakeholders. However, if in reality there were little strategic fit and
the real driver was strategic expediency, then these higher and misguided expectations for the alliance would result in greater subsequent disappointment and an increased chance that the alliance
would ‘fail.’ We hope that helping managers to recognise explicitly the limits of strategic fit imposed by time will offset this problem with expectations. While not a central focus of our paper,
we would expect similar results for merger and acquisition activity by firms.
We think the concept of strategic expediency is also an important issue as far as the implementation of alliances is concerned. A lot of attention is paid to partner selection, but many more challenges lie in subsequently implementing alliances. Recognition of the role of strategic expediency
might help shift attention from partner selection and justification to a realistic appraisal of what
is needed in order to make the alliance successful. This increased focus on strategy implementation
has attracted attention in the popular press with books such as Execution by Larry Bossidy, Ram
Charan and Charles Burck. It was also succinctly stated by the CEO of General Motors, who stated,
when discussing the termination of the alliance with Fiat: ‘To be honest, when you do deals, you
don’t do the deal you want to, you do the deal you can do.’30
Finally, strategic expediency may provide insights to managers grappling with rapid change in
their industries. As is the case with most strategic decisions, there are tradeoffs associated with
not making decisions until all available information is obtained so that all of the different alternatives can be thoroughly analysed. Managers feel more comfortable making decisions when they
think they have all available information in front of them so that they can systematically make a
rational decision. However, attention is increasingly focusing on more dynamic approaches to
decision-making. Perhaps partially motivated by the discussion of real options, in rapidly moving
150

Explaining Alliance Partner Selection

<-----Page 17----->industries it may be much more beneficial to consider a wide range of options in general terms
rather than a smaller number of options in specific detail. This is very consistent with both our strategic expediency construct and the importance of intuition at the individual level for partner
selection.
Thus, rapid decisions concerning alliance partners, based on strategic expediency and a broader
view of trust, can yield superior results. However, acknowledging the role of strategic expediency
and the complexity of trust is not the same as excusing rash behaviour by ignoring strategic fit. Strategic expediency and trust have a critical role in the partner selection process, and recognising their
roles can improve partner selection decisions, and possibly alliance performance - as long as an
appreciation for strategic fit is maintained.
