NOTE

LEARNINGFROM BUSINESSFAILURE:
PROPOSITIONSOF GRIEFRECOVERYFOR
THESELF-EMPLOYED
DEAN A. SHEPHERD
University of Colorado at Boulder
In this paper I use the psychological literature on grief to explore the emotion of
business failure, suggesting that the loss of a business from failure can cause the
self-employed to feel grief--a negative emotional response interfering with the ability
to learn from the events surrounding that loss. I discuss how a dual process of grief
recovery maximizes the learning from business failure.

Businesses fail. In 2001, 12,457 U.S. businesses
ceased operations, only to have their assets liquidated and the proceeds remitted to creditors
(chapter 7 bankruptcy). This statistic understates the number of business failures because
it fails to account for those businesses sold or
merged with another firm to avoid bankruptcy.
Business failure, then, occurs when a fall in revenues and/or a rise in expenses are of such a
magnitude that the firm becomes insolvent and
is unable to attract new debt or equity funding;
consequently, it cannot continue to operate under the current ownership and management.
Although the literature offers a number
of causes of business failure (e.g., Cooper,
Gimeno-Gascon, & Woo, 1994; Romanelli, 1989;
Shepherd, Douglas, & Shanley, 2000), perhaps
the most common is insufficient experience. It
appears that entrepreneurs with more experience possess the knowledge to perform the roles
and tasks necessary for success more effectively
(Chandler & Hanks, 1998; Gimeno, Folta, Cooper,
& Woo, 1997; Stuart & Abetti, 1990). Although
reports vary, one study suggests that 51 percent
of all entrepreneurs in the United States have
previous owner-manager
experience (Schollhammer, 1991). Regardless of whether this previous experience involved success(es) and/or
failure(s), researchers argue that the entrepre-

neurs' knowledge is enhanced through the feedback obtained from the experience (e.g., Minniti
& Bygrave, 2001).
McGrath (1999) argues that the benefits of failure have not been given sufficient attention. She
proposes that, by seeking success and avoiding
failure, firms introduce errors that can not only
inhibit learning and interpretation processes
but also make failure more likely or expensive
than necessary. Using real options reasoning,
McGrath (1999) proposes that there are benefits
to be gained from the pursuit of high-variance
opportunities, even if that pursuit increases the
potential for failure. This entrepreneurial process of hypothesis testing generates improvements in technologies and increases economic
resilience (Hayek, 1945).
Although' McGrath focuses on the failure of
projects within a firm, it appears that the process of learning from business failure also benefits society, through the application of that
knowledge to subsequent businesses. In fact,
entrepreneurship scholars are consistent with
scholars regarding the
many organizational
benefits of learning from failure (e.g., Maidique
& Zirger, 1984; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Starkey,
1998). For example, Sitkin (1992) argues that failure is more important than success for learning.
A limitation of this literature, however, is that
the process of learning from failure is not clearly
explained or understood (Cannon & Edmonson,
2001).
To gain a deeper understanding of learning
from failure, I focus on those individuals who
are owner-managers
of businesses-namely,

which,
turn, generates a negapersonal
tive emotional response.' Such negative emotions may impact the ability to learn from an
event (Isen & Baron, 1991), especially when the
circumstances surrounding the event are ambiguous (Kumar, 1997). It appears that, to gain a
deeper understanding of learning from failure,
we need to explore the role of negative emotions.
Organizational researchers have investigated
the negative emotions arising from a mismatch
between the organization's current performance
and aspiration and how this impacts learning
and/or adaptation (Dutton, 1988; Dutton & Ashford, 1993; Dutton & Duncan, 1987; Ocasio, 1997).2
In particular, researchers have begun to focus
on the psychological processes involved with
organizations in decline (Huy, 1999).3On the one
hand, organizational learning theorists suggest
that negative emotions stimulate search processes,
learning, and adaptation
(Cyert &
March, 1963; Kiesler & Sproull, 1982; Lant &
Mezias, 1992; Lant, Milliken, & Batra, 1992; Morrison & Robinson, 1997). On the other hand,
threat rigidity theorists suggest that organizational decline inhibits cognitive processes, restricts decision making, and limits the number
of options considered, which inhibits organizational change and/or adaptation
(Barker &
Mone, 1998; D'Aunno & Sutton, 1992; Ocasio,
1995; Staw, Sandelands, & Dutton, 1981; Sutton &

II define emotions here as the personal displays of affected (or "moved")or "agitated"states (Fineman, 1996:546).
An emotional response to an event involves feelings, moods,
emotions, and sympathetic nervous system activity that people have experienced in relation to an event and subsequently associate with it (Eagly & Chaiken, 1998:272).
2 Emotions can also influence group cohesion, commitment, and performance (Kelly & Barsade, 2001).
3 Organizational researchers have acknowledged the
emotions of employees during the process of an organization's death and how best to manage these emotions (Harris
& Sutton, 1986;Sutton, 1987)-for example, the benefits of
parting ceremonies that evoke emotions and enhance the
realization that the organization has died (Harris& Sutton,

1986).

negative emotions can be both beneficial and
detrimental to learning.

by acknowledging that the loss of

new ideas to organizational research on emotions by explaining the problems associated
with a certain type of learning-learning
from
failure-and
how learning can be enhanced by
a process of grief recovery. Specifically, I focus
on information about why a business fails, how
grief interferes with the processing of this information, and how the process of grief recovery
can reduce emotional interference and thereby
enhance an individual's ability to learn from
business failure.

THESELF-EMPLOYED
AND GRIEF
There appears to be an emotional relationship
between the self-employed and their business. For
example, the motivation for managing one's own
business is not simply personal profit; it also includes loyalty to a product, loyalty to a market and
customers, personal growth, and the need to prove
oneself (Bruno, McQuarrie, & Torgrimson, 1992).
Cova and Svanfeldt propose, similarly, that entrepreneurs "create a product that flows from their
own internal desires and needs. They create primarily to express subjective conceptions of
beauty, emotion, or some aesthetic ideal" (1993:
297). For members of a family business, the firm
may not only be a source of income but also a
context for family activity and the embodiment of
family pride and identity (Meyer & Zucker, 1989:
78). All of this suggests that the loss of a business
is likely to generate a negative emotional reis, grief.4

Archer (1999) argues that even though we normally think of grief in the context of the death of
a loved one, a broadly similar reaction can occur
when a close relationship is ended through separation or when a person is forced to give up
some aspect of life deemed to be important.
When our family business died, my father exhibited a number of worrying emotions. There
were numbness and disbelief that this business
he had created twenty odd years ago was no
longer "alive." There was some anger toward
the economy, competitors, and debtors. A stronger emotion than anger was that of guilt and
self-blame: he felt guilty that he had caused the
failure of the business, that it could no longer be
passed on to my brother, and that, as a result, he
had failed not only as a businessperson but also
as a father. These feelings caused him distress
and anxiety. He felt the situation was hopeless and became withdrawn and, at times,
depressed.
These are all symptoms of grief (Bonanno &
Keltner, 1997; Janoff-Bulman, 1992; Klass, 1988;
Middleton, Burnett, Raphael, & Martinek, 1997;
Parkes, 1988; Shuchter, 1986; Williams & Moris,
1996). Therefore, I argue that it is typical for the
self-employed to feel grief, which is a negative
emotional response to the loss of a business
(adapted from Fulton & Metress, 1995, and Kastenbaum, 1995) capable of triggering behavioral,
and physiological
experiential,
symptoms
(Gross, 1998).
My research relies, in part, on the literature on
grief over the loss of a loved one. Even though
the loss of a loved one and the loss of a business
may both generate grief, I do not want my approach to diminish the feelings involved with
losing a loved one. Obviously, there are different levels of grief, and those who have lost a
loved one are likely to grieve differently from
those who have lost a business. For example,
learning from the loss of a loved one is likely to
be highly philosophical
and existential,
whereas learning from the loss of a business is
more practical and constructive. Therefore, I acknowledge that care must be taken in generalizing results of grief studies from one context to
another.
Additionally, just as the grief of losing a loved
one is deeply personal, individuals who have
lost a business most likely will differ from one
another in their level of grief. Explaining why
there are differences in the level of grief over the

April

loss of a business is beyond the scope of this
article; rather, my focus is to understand the
relationship among grief, recovery from grief,
and the ability of the self-employed to learn
from the loss of their business. Accordingly, I
now turn attention to exploring the relationship
between grief and learning.

LEARNINGFROMBUSINESSLOSS
People learn using the outcome of action
(feedback) to revise their belief systems (Huy,
1999; Kim, 1993; Weick, 1979). For the selfemployed, learning from business failure occurs
when they can use the information available
about why the business failed (feedback information) to revise their existing knowledge of
how to manage their own business effectively
is, to revise
(self-employment knowledge)-that
about
the
assumptions
consequences of previous assessments, decisions, actions, and inactions. For example, Ravi Kalakota has learned a
number of lessons from the loss of his business,
Hsupply.com, such as don't let venture capitalists hijack your vision, don't burn through capital rapidly to achieve short-term growth, and
don't underestimate the speed others will imitate your products and services (Gilbert, 2000).
The entrepreneurship literature suggests that
there is an opportunity for the self-employed to
process feedback information into self-employment knowledge, yet in this literature authors
have not sufficiently considered the role of grief
in this learning process.5
Grief is a negative emotional response, and
negative emotions have been found to interfere
with individuals' allocation of attention in the
processing of information (Mogg, Mathews, Bird,
& MacGregor-Morris, 1990; Wells & Matthews,
1994). Such interference negatively impacts individuals' ability to learn from a negative event
(Bower, 1992). For example, emotional events receive higher priority in processing information
than those that are neutral (Ellis, Detterman,
Runcie, McCarver, & Craig, 1971; cf. Ellis & Ash-

5 The amount of feedback information "available" to be
learned may vary, independent of the level of grief-for
example, there is more to be learned when the actions or
inactions of the self-employed individual caused the loss of
the business than when an external, improbable event
caused the loss of the business (e.g., an earthquake or a
terrorist attack).

brook, 1989). This can cause individuals to terminate prematurely a replay in working memthe
ory of the last few items preceding
emotional event (Bower, 1992). For the selfemployed, this could mean focusing attention on
the day that the business closed (i.e., dwelling
on announcements to employees, buyers, and
suppliers, as well as handing over the office
keys to a liquidator), rather than allocating sufficient attention on feedback information, such
as previous actions and/or inactions that caused
the deterioration in business performance and,
ultimately, the loss of the business.
The amount of feedback information available also appears to impact the degree to which
grief interferes with the learning process. Although more feedback information provides a
greater opportunity to learn more from the experience, individuals' cognitive limits can represent a barrier to learning (Levitt & March, 1988;
Nystrom & Starbuck, 1984; Slovic, Fischhoff, &
Lichtenstein,
1977). Because situations that
place greater demands on attention and information processing have been found to cause
individuals to be more prone to emotional interference (Mathews, May, Mogg, & Eysenck, 1990;
Wells & Matthews, 1994), the greater strain on
individuals'
of information from
processing
more feedback information may also make the

individuals more prone to the negative impact
of grief on learning. The above observation suggests that the level of grief moderates the relationship between feedback information and the
amount of self-employment knowledge learned
from the loss of the business. The nature of this
relationship is illustrated in Figure 1 and stated
here.
Proposition 1: Individuals with high
levels of grief learn less from information about the loss of a business than
individuals with low levels of grief,
and grief's interference with learning
is greater at high levels of information
than at low levels of information.

GRIEFRECOVERYPROCESS
An individual has recovered from grief when
thoughts about the events surrounding and
leading up to the loss of the business no longer
generate a negative emotional response. Those
who feel grief over the loss of a business will
eventually recover from grief or will suffer
chronic grief that requires professional psychological assistance (which is beyond the scope of
this article). In the literature on grief over the
loss of a loved one, there are two primary de-

scriptions of the process of recovering from grief,
classifiable as either loss oriented or restoration
oriented. I first introduce these and then adapt
them to grief over the loss of a business.
Loss Orientation
Loss orientation refers to working through and
processing some aspect of the loss experience
(Stroebe & Schut, 1999) and then, as a result of
this process, breaking emotional bonds to the
object lost (Archer, 1999). Typical of the lossoriented approach to grief over the loss of a
loved one, Malkinson states, "Grieving is crucial, necessary, and unavoidable for successful
adaptation" (1996: 155). This process of constructing a series of accounts about the loss gradually
provides the loss with meaning and eventually
produces a changed viewpoint of the self and
the world (Archer, 1999). Changing the way an
event is interpreted can allow an individual to
regulate emotions so that thoughts of the event
no longer generate negative emotions (Gross,
1999).
Self-employed individuals with a loss orientation might seek out friends, family, or psychologists to talk about their grief. They also might
focus their thoughts on the time spent in creating and nurturing the business and may ruminate about the circumstances and events surrounding the loss of the business. It appears that
such thoughts could evoke a sense of yearning
for the way things used to be or foster a sense of
relief that the events surrounding the loss (e.g.,
arguing with creditors; explaining to employees, family, and friends the business has failed)
are finally over. These feelings of relief and pain
wax and wane over time, although Stroebe and
Schut (1999) propose that, in the early periods of
grief over the loss of a loved one, painful memories are likely to dominate.
A number of scholars have raised a note of
caution about whether "grief work" is essential
for recovering from grief (Bonanno & Keltner,
1997; Prigerson et al., 1996; Stroebe & Schut, 1999;
Wortman & Silver, 1989, 1992). Confronting the
loss appears insufficient to explain the grief recovery process: "Those who show the most evidence of working through the loss are those who
ultimately have the most difficulty in resolving
what has happened" (Wortman & Silver, 1987:
207). It appears that confronting the loss can
make negative thoughts and memories more ac-

April

cessible and salient, and thereby slow the recovery process (Lyubomirsky & Nolen-Hoeksema, 1995; Nolen-Hoeksema, McBride, & Larson,
1997).
Suppression of feelings of loss and getting on
with one's life also appears to be an approach to
grief recovery. This alternative approach is referred to as restoration orientation.
Restoration Orientation
Restoration orientation is based on both
avoidance and a proactiveness toward secondary sources of stress arising from the loss of the
business. For avoidance, it is possible that the
can distract themselves
from
self-employed
thinking about the loss of the business to speed
recovery from grief. For example, Cuisner, Janssen, Graauw, Bakker, and Hoogduin (1996) found
that both a subsequent pregnancy and the birth
of a new baby generated lower levels of grief
over the loss of a baby. New relationships enable individuals to distract themselves from
loss-related thoughts, which allows for the gradual fading of memories associated with the loss.
Remarriage after the death of a spouse is another example of an action that can lead to
speedier recovery (Shuchter, 1986). This might be
because the new marriage replaces many of the
features of the married state that are particularly missed; in essence, this highlights the distinction between the loss of a role and the loss of
an individual. For the self-employed, founding a
new business might enhance recovery from
grief over the loss of a previous business (although there is the possibility that the same
mistakes will be replicated because these individuals have not sufficiently learned from the
loss).
As stated above, a restoration orientation is
not simply about avoidance; it also concerns the
way that a person attends to other aspects of his
or her life (e.g., coping with daily life, learning
new tasks). It refers to being proactive toward
secondary sources of stress, instead of being
concerned with the loss itself. Such activities
enable individuals to distract themselves from
thinking about the loss while simultaneously
maintaining essential activities necessary for
restructuring aspects of their lives (Archer, 1999).
This may apply to the self-employed,
for
whom the loss of the business itself generates a
negative emotional response, while causing the

<-----Page 6----->2003

Shepherd

loss of income, social status, and perceptions of
self. For example, a self-employed individual
must reorganize his or her life to cope without
the business. It might be necessary to apply for
jobs, join the unemployment queue, and/or sell
the house and move to a less expensive neighborhood (requiring the children to change
schools). There might also be other stressors,
such as responding to the questions "What do
you do for a living?" or "How is your business
going?" In addressing these secondary sources of
stress, the self-employed are able to reduce the
negative emotions associated with thoughts of the
events surrounding the loss of the business.
A Dual Process of Grief Recovery
Which process of grief recovery is the most
effective? Stroebe and Schut (1999) have argued
that recovery from grief over the loss of a loved
one is not an "either/or" choice between the two
orientations. Both loss-oriented and restorationoriented coping styles are likely to involve different costs. A loss orientation involves confronand mentally
tation, which is physically
exhausting, whereas a restoration orientation
involves suppression, which requires mental effort and presents potentially averse consequences for one's health (Archer, 1999). Oscillation between the two models of coping behavior
provides a central regulating mechanism, enabling the person to obtain the benefits of each
and to minimize the costs of maintaining one for
too long; this dual process speeds the recovery
process (cf. Stroebe & Schut, 1999). Speeding the
recovery process is important, because it more
quickly reduces the emotional interference with
learning. However, the benefits of this dual process might be greater than simply speed.
Weick's (1990) investigation of the Tenerife air
disaster provides an illustration of how negative emotions can both enable and inhibit adaptation. Weick argues that psychological stress (a
result of negative emotion) triggers the autonomic nervous system, which can have a positive effect on adaptation, because it alerts people to the importance of the event, and they
therefore allocate attention to processing information about the event (Weick, 1990; cf. Fineman, 1996; Frank, 1993; Hirshleifer, 1993; De
Sousa, 1987);but if diagnosis and coping are not
swift, arousal from the negative emotion begins
to register in the consciousness and to consume

scarce information processing capacity, which
decreases cognitive efficiency (Weick, 1990; cf.
Argyris, 1990; Elster, 1999; Staw et al., 1981). A
process that uses negative emotions to focus an
individual's attention on the event, while simultaneously not allowing that focus to become
cognitively inefficient, could enhance learning
from failure.
A dual process of grief recovery provides a
regulating mechanism for an individual's grief
such that it may lead to both a quicker recovery
from grief and, at a given level of grief, a more
efficient processing of information about the
loss of a business. Both enhance an individual's
ability to learn from the loss. For example, starting with a loss orientation gives an individual
the ability to focus first on aspects of the loss
experience and to begin processing information
about the business loss, as well as breaking the
emotional bonds to the business. When the individual's attention begins to shift focus, from
the event to aspects of the grief itself, then learning is likely reduced by emotional interference,
and the individual should switch to a restoration orientation.
Switching to a restoration orientation encourages the individual to think about other aspects
of his or her life. It also breaks the cycle of
continually thinking about the symptoms of
grief, which can increase feelings of grief
(Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991). A restoration orientation also provides the opportunity to address
secondary causes of stress, which may reduce
the emotional significance of the loss of the
business.
When information processing capacity is no
longer focused on the symptoms associated with
grief, the individual can shift back to a loss
orientation and use his or her information processing capacity to generate further meaning
from the loss experience and also to reduce further the emotional significance of the loss. Oscillation
should continue
until the selfemployed individual has recovered from grief.
Proposition 2: Grief over the loss of a
business is reduced by a loss orientation or a restoration orientation.
Proposition 3: A dual process of grief
recovery reduces grief more quickly
than the exclusive use of either orientation. A speedier recovery allows

Proposition 4: At a given level of grief
over the loss of a business, a dual process of grief recovery enhances an individual's ability to learn more from
information about the loss of the business than the exclusive use of either
orientation.

DISCUSSIONAND CONCLUSION
Although grief over the death of a loved one is
different from grief over the loss of a business,
the concepts of grief and grief recovery offer a
useful framework for understanding the reactions of self-employed individuals to business
failure. The negative emotional response to the
loss of a business represents grief that, while
present, will diminish individuals' ability to
learn from the events surrounding the loss, especially when there is considerable feedback
information. I have proposed that a dual process
of grief recovery, one that involves oscillating
between a loss and a restoration orientation,
provides the speediest path to grief recovery.
Recovery from grief allows learning to take
place without interference from strong emotions.
But even in the presence of grief, this dual process regulates information processing to minimize emotional interference, and thereby enhances learning from the loss of a business.
Research on grief has the potential to help
scholars in a number of ways. First, entrepreneurship researchers have acknowledged the
importance of learning from failure. I argue here
that, for the self-employed, learning is not automatic or instantaneous and is dependent upon,
in part, their grief and grief recovery process.
Second, Baron (1998) has argued that entrepreneurship is a context that generates considerable emotions. With few exceptions (e.g., feelings of regret [Baron, 2000]), entrepreneurship
scholars have not given sufficient attention to
the role of emotions. Based on the emotions literature, I have proposed that the negative emotional response from the loss of a business
(grief) interferes with the ability to learn from
the experience. A dual process of grief recovery
can minimize this emotional interference, and
recovery from grief removes it completely.

Finally, organizational scholars have investigated the role of negative emotions in the ability
of organizations to learn and adapt, especially
when the organization is in decline. But this
research has rarely extended beyond the life of
the organization and has, therefore, relatively
ignored the death of the organization, the negative emotion arising from that death, and the
ability of an individual to learn from this organizational failure." I have investigated here the
emotional
negative
response
by the selfemployed to the death of their organization and
provided some insight into the role of grief recovery in the learning of new self-employment
knowledge, which can be applied to a new organization to increase its chance of success.

grief felt by
the self-employed during organizational decline
and by continuing to measure individuals' levels of grief immediately after an organization's
death (and periodically thereafter; e.g., every
three months), scholars could empirically test
the model proposed here. Operationalization of
grief and recovery from grief should begin with
existing valid measures.
For example, there are a number of measures
of grief, including the Texas Revised Inventory
of Grief (TRIG; Faschingbauer, 1981), the Grief
Experience Inventory (GEI; Sanders, Mauger, &
Strong, 1985), and the Inventory of Traumatic
Grief (ITG; Prigerson et al., 1997). In particular,
Hogan, Greenfield, and Schmidt (2001) empirithe Hogan Grief Reaction
cally developed
Checklist (HGRC) from data collected on bereaved adults who had recently had a loved one
die. Their analysis revealed six factors of the
grieving process: despair, panic behavior,
blame and anger, detachment, disorganization,

6 A possible exception is research on employees' emotion
surrounding the death of an organization (Harris & Sutton,
1986;Sutton, 1987),although this research focuses on how
management can best manage these emotions to ensure a
realization that the organization has died. Here I have focused on the self-employed and the process of learning from
failure.

<-----Page 8----->2003

Shepherd

and personal growth.' These measures were
found to be reliable and valid. HGRC represents
a basis for a measure of grief for the selfemployed over the loss of a business.
There are also existing measures from the
grief literature that could be used to indicate the
use of a loss and/or a restoration orientation. For
a loss orientation researchers could use NolenHoeksema's Response Styles Questionnaire
(Nolen-Hoeksema & Morrow, 1991), and for a restoration orientation researchers could use existing measures of repressive tendencies (Weinberger, Schwartz, & Davidson, 1979) and/or
clinicians' expert judgments (e.g., Shedler, Mayman, & Manis, 1993).
Another key construct of the model is learning.
Learning could be measured in terms of an increased understanding
of why the business
failed, in an effort to prevent repeating the same
mistakes. This could be captured by self-reports
immediately after the death of the business, during the grief recovery process, and once an individual has recovered from grief. These selfreports could then be compared to those of
experts and stakeholders, such as customers,
venture capitalists,
and suppliers. Learning
could also be measured in terms of improvements in decision quality-for example, by asking the self-employed (at the times suggested

comparing those decisions with experts to measure decision quality and improvement.
Loss of a business, learning, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. For the learning to be useful, it must be applied to another business. However, the loss of a business likely lowers an
individual's entrepreneurial self-efficacy and,
therefore, the motivation to be self-employed
again. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy refers to the
strength of a person's belief that he or she is
capable of successfully performing the various
roles and tasks of entrepreneurship, and it influences the choice of whether to engage in an
entrepreneurial career (Boyd & Vozikis, 1994;
Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998). The psychology
literature on the loss of a loved one suggests
that learning reestablishes

sumptions by offering an explanation for why
the loss occurred and, in doing so, helps individuals to establish a new set of assumptions
about themselves (Parkes, 1975). In future research scholars should investigate the relationships between the loss of a business and entrepreneurial self-efficacy, as well as between
learning (during, and as a result of, the grief
selfrecovery process) and entrepreneurial
efficacy.
Conclusion: Implications for the Self-Employed

and Their Family and Friends
Bill Lewis represents an example of someone
who has experienced grief and recovered from
it. He had founded eight businesses and been
through two bankruptcies when he was interviewed by Inc. Magazine. He stated:
[The business is] a child .... [Losing the business]
was devastating .... The things that were going
on in my life-I'd lost my company, lost my home,
lost everything. I couldn't handle it.... There was
a time... when I sat in my office and cried, and
then put a gun to my head.... When I finally got
over all that [pain and anger associated with the
loss of the business] was when I quit blaming
other people.... It was my fault because I didn't
plan far enough ahead. It was stupid as hell of
me to sit there exposed like that. ... Listen, this
lesson was extremely expensive. I paid dearly,
my family paid dearly.... Yeah, I learned a
lot .... I'd be an incredible CEO for some company. I'm the best (quoted in Richman, 1990).
The grief recovery process for the selfemployed presented here has a number of practical implications. First, the knowledge that the
feelings and reactions the individual is experiencing are normal for someone dealing with
such a loss may help to reduce feelings of
shame and embarrassment. This, in turn, might
encourage the self-employed to articulate their
feelings of grief, possibly speeding the recovery
process. Second, there are psychological and
physiological outcomes caused by the feelings
of loss associated with grief. Realizing that
these are "symptoms" of grief can reduce secondary sources of stress and also may assist
with the choice of treatment. Third, there is a
process of recovery from grief that offers the
self-employed some comfort that the feelings of
and so forth that
loss, sadness, helplessness,
now
feel
will
they
eventually diminish. Fourth,
the recovery and learning process can be en-

hanced by some degree of oscillation between a
loss and a restoration orientation. Finally, recovery from grief offers the opportunity to increases one's knowledge for self-employment.
This provides benefits to the individual and to
society.
