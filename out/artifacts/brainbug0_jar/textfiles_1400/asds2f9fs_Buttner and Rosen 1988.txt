SUMMARY

Chapel Hill

Much anecdotal evidence suggests that women, compared to similarly
situated men, have great difJiculty securing financing for entrepreneurial
endeavors. In addition, a mounting body of evidence illustrates how women
in managerial roles are perceived in terms of sex stereotypes rather than
in terms of their accomplishments. The present study extends this line of
research to investigate whether female entrepreneurs are also viewed in

terms of sex stereotypes.
One hundred and six bank loan officers evaluated either men, women, or successful entrepreneurs
on scales assessing nine attributes of successful entrepreneurs. 2 The nine entrepreneurial qualities
were leadership, autonomy, propensity to take risks, readiness for change, endurance, lack of emotionalism, low need for support, low conformity, and persuasiveness. It was hypothesized that sex
stereotypes injuenced perceptions that women, compared to men, did not possess the characteristics
necessary for successful entrepreneurship.
Results confirmed the hypothesis that characteristics attributed to successful entrepreneurs were
more commonly ascribed to men than to women. On the dimensions of leadership, autonomy, risk
taking, readiness for change, endurance, lack of emotionalism and low need for support, bank loan
ofJicers rated women as significantly less like successful entrepreneurs compared to men. While gender
differences on the remaining three dimensions failed to reach statistical significance, women were
never rated as closer to successful entrepreneurs than were men. These results are consistent with
anecdotal evidence of the d@culties female entrepreneurs encounter in securing working capital. The

results are also consistent with past research examining commonly held sex stereotypes of male and
female managers and executives.
Thesejndings
raise questions regarding the degree to which loan oficers are influenced by sex
stereotypes in considering loan applications from male and female aspiring entrepreneurs. From a
bank’s perspective, it may be important to train loan ojicers to avoid falling back on sex stereotypes
in evaluating proposals for new businesses. Similarly, it may be important to alertfemale entrepreneurs
to the need to dispel traditional sex stereotypes in the context of loan application interviews.

INTRODUCTION
New ventures have had a substantial impact on the economy. Since 1960, the number of
new incorporations has more than tripled, and 80% of the new jobs created in the United
States were in companies less than four years old (Malabre 1980). About one third of new
businesses were formed by women (Humphreys and McClung 198 1). Between 197 1 and
1977, the number of self-employed women increased nearly 25% (Humphreys and McClung
1981), and between 1980 and 198.5, the number of self-employed women increased from
2.1 million to 2.6 million (Taylor 1986).
The success of any new business depends initially on the entrepreneur’s
ability to
obtain support and assistance from bankers, venture capitalists, suppliers, consultants, and
customers (Aldrich and Zimmer 1985). Evidence suggests that women have more difficulty
than men in gaining access to the support network necessary to successfully launch a new
venture. In Hisrich and O’Brien’s (1982) study, for example, women reported that they had
difficulty obtaining capital and dealing with lawyers, accountants, suppliers, and customers.
One explanation offered by female entrepreneurs for their difficulty in gaining access
to support networks is that they are victims of sex discrimination.
Twenty seven percent of
the women cited in a study by Humphreys and McClung cited discrimination
as a major or
moderate obstacle in starting and operating their own business. In Hisrich and O’Brien’s
(1982) study of female entrepreneurs,
feelings of discrimination
were illustrated by one
respondent’s comment that “banks give the impression that women should not be operating
a business. Therefore they give us the run around.” Another respondent complained that she
had to “furnish 100% collateral for a working capital loan, which the bank would not have
required from a man with (her) experience” (Hisrich and O’Brien 1982).
To the extent that key members of the business community view women as lacking
the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs, they may, indeed, make it more difficult for
women than men to succeed in new ventures. Before we can know the validity of this
explanation for female entrepreneurs’ venture-starting
difficulties, however, two questions
must be answered: First, what are the characteristics deemed necessary for entrepreneurial
success; and secondly, how positively are such characteristics associated with the stereotypical characteristics of women versus men?

CHARACTERISTICS

OF ENTREPRENEURS

Hornaday and Bunker (1970) found that entrepreneurs see themselves as high in energy
level, initiative, and self-reliance. Comparing scores of entrepreneurs and men in general
on the Edwards Personal Preference Inventory and the Gordon Survey of Interpersonal
Values, Homaday and Aboud (1971) reported that entrepreneurs scored significantly higher
on scales reflecting independence
and leadership effectiveness and significantly lower on
need for support. An investigation by Mescon and Montanari (198 1) concluded that compared

<-----Page 2----->BANK LOAN OFFICERS’

251

to managers, entrepreneurs have a higher level of endurance and are capable of greater
sustained effort. Finally, recent work by Sexton and Bowman-Upton
(1985, 1986) showed
that on several personality inventories, entrepreneurs scored higher than managers on energy
level, risk taking, social adroitness, autonomy, and change. Entrepreneurs scored lower on
conformity, interpersonal affect, and succorance.
In summary, entrepreneurs have been found to possess a set of leadership skills and
attributes that include an ability to inspire others, autonomy, and a high level of endurance.
Entrepreneurs demonstrate a propensity to take risks and are ready for change. Entrepreneurs
also possess social skills such as persuasiveness,
low need for support, low conformity, and
lack of emotionalism.

ENTREPRENEURIAL

ATTRIBUTES

AND SEX STEREOTYPES

The issue of women’s perceived fitness for entrepreneurial roles parallels quite closely the
issue of women’s perceived fitness for managerial and professional roles. Research by Schein
(1973, 1975) examined the degree to which commonly held stereotypes of males and females
overlapped with perceptions of what attributes are necessary for managerial success. Schein
had groups of male and female managers rate men in general, women in general, or successful
managers, on 92 items describing personality characteristics,
attitudes, and temperament.
She found that successful managers were perceived to have characteristics more commonly
associated with men than with women. Do sex stereotypical perceptions of females as unfit
for managerial roles also apply to the perceived fitness of women aspiring to entrepreneurial
roles?

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY
Key members of entrepreneurs’ support networks are bank loan officers. Bruno and Tyebjee
(1985) reported that entrepreneurs cited banks as a major source of funding second only to
venture capitalists. Accordingly, it is particularly important to examine loan officers’ perceptions of sex stereotypes and characteristics considered to be important for entrepreneurial
success. Building on Schein’s earlier work (1973, 1975), we hypothesized that bank loan
officers perceive men to be more like successful entrepreneurs than women.

METHOD
Sample
The sample consisted of 60 male and 46 female loan officers at a medium-sized southeastern
banking institution. Labor force statistics show that 63% of loan officers in the U.S. are
male (Mellor 1984). Therefore, the gender composition of our sample appears to be fairly
representative of male and female loan officers nationally.

questionnaire.
Instructions indicated that the researchers were interested in learning how
individuals form impressions of others. Respondents did not know that other versions of the
questionnaire existed. Respondents were asked to complete the questionnaire and return it
in a post-paid self-addressed return envelope. One hundred six usable questionnaires
were
returned, resulting in a 75% response rate.

Measurement Instrument
The attributes identified in previous research to be characteristic of successful entrepreneurs
constituted the nine dimensions used in this study (Homaday and Aboud 1971; Homaday
and Bunker 1970; Mescon and Montanari 1981; Sexton and Bowman 1985; Sexton and
Bowman-Upton
1986). These dimensions are: leadership, autonomy, moderate risk taking,
readiness for change, endurance, lack of emotionalism, low conformity, low need for support,
and persuasiveness.
Items for each dimension were developed directly from descriptions of
the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs used by Sexton and Bowman-Upton
(1986).
The items included in each dimension were:

The final questionnaire consisted of 44 items. Thirty four items assessed perceptions
of entrepreneurial
characteristics.
Ten filler items describing other unrelated personality
attributes were interspersed throughout the questionnaire to avoid sensitizing respondents to
the objectives of the investigation.
Each loan officer rated either men in general, women in general, or successful entrepreneurs, according to how characteristic each item was of that group. Respondents assigned
a rating to each item in each dimension from 1 for “not characteristic” to 6 for “characteristic.”
To help the loan officers make their evaluations, the instructions suggested that they imagine
that they were about to meet a man, a woman, or a successful entrepreneur for the first time
and to evaluate each item based on their expectations prior to the meeting.

RESULTS
The reliability of the questionnaire instrument was assessed to determine internal consistency.
The alpha coefficient of the rating scales was 0.76, indicating an acceptable degree of
reliability.

LOAN OFFICERS’

PERCEPTIONS

253

Loan officers evaluated one of three groups-men,
women, or successful entrepreneurs-along
nine dimensions of entrepreneurship.
items describing characteristics of each
dimension were added and averaged to obtain an overall dimension score for each of the
personality dimensions for men, women, and successful entrepreneurs.
Analysis of variance procedures were used to examine the data for differences in
ratings by loan officers across the dimensions for men, women and successful entrepreneurs.
Significant differences between the groups were then evaluated using t-test procedures.

Men, Women and Successful Entrepreneurs
Comparisons
of evaluations of successful entrepreneurs,
men, and women on dimensions previously found to be associated with entrepreneurial
success are shown in Table 1
and are illustrated in Figure 1.
We hypothesized that men would be perceived to have more of the characteristics of
successful entrepreneurs than would women. The pattern of means shown in Table 1 strongly
supports our hypothesis for six of the nine dimensions. Men, compared to women, were
consistently seen as closer to successful entrepreneurs on leadership, autonomy, risk taking
propensity, readiness for change, endurance, and low need for support. With the exception
of autonomy, successful entrepreneurs were evaluated significantly higher than males on
each of these dimensions. On each of these six dimensions women were evaluated significantly lower than men. Figure 1 vividly illustrates that women were seen as much less likely
than men to possess characteristics attributed to successful entrepreneurs on these six dimensions.
Previous research indicated that entrepreneurial success was associated with a degree
of interpersonal detachment. Ratings on the dimension, lack of emotionalism, indicated that
men were rated as least emotional. Men were rated as significantly less emotional than were
successful entrepreneurs. Women were rated as significantly more emotional than both men
and successful entrepreneurs. The pattern of ratings on the lack of emotionalism dimension
varies somewhat from the patterns of ratings on the first six dimensions. While men were
seen as particularly low in emotionalism,
entrepreneurs were viewed as somewhat more
emotional. Consistent with previous research findings on sex stereotypes (Schein 1973,
1975), women were perceived to be very emotional.
On the eighth dimension, lack of conformity, significant differences were again obtained in evaluations of successful entrepreneurs, men, and women. Men and women were
seen as significantly higher on conformity than were successful entrepreneurs.
Men were
seen as lower than women on this dimension. However, while the pattern of mean evaluations
was in the predicted direction for lack of conformity, significant differences were not found
for evaluations of men and women.
On the final dimension,
persuasiveness,
no significant differences were found for
evaluations of successful entrepreneurs, men, and women. Again the mean ratings were in
the predicted direction, but the actual differences between the groups were very small.
Clearly, successful entrepreneurs
are seen as possessing a unique combination
of
characteristics, skills, and personality attributes not commonly found in the general population. As illustrated in Figure 1, men are seen as possessing most of these skills to a greater
extent than women.

Gender of the Loan Otlicer
Previous studies have assessed the influence of the sex of the respondent on perceptions of
the characteristics of men and women. Schein’s (1973, 1975) findings suggested that sex

stereotypes are widely held. Both male and female managers saw women as unfit to hold
managerial positions. In the present study, responses of male and female loan officers were
compared to determine if they held similar views about personality characteristics of men,
women, and successful entrepreneurs. There were no significant differences in mean ratings
of men as a function of respondent sex. Male and female respondents differed in their
evaluation of women on four dimensions as Table 2 shows.
Female loan officers rated women significantly higher on leadership, autonony, and
endurance than did the male loan officers. The female respondents also evaluated women
in general as significantly lower on need for support than did the men in the sample. In
evaluating successful entrepreneurs,
the only dimension on which male and female respondents differed was leadership. Female loan officers perceived successful entrepreneurs to be
stronger on leadership (mean = 5.23) than did the male loan officers (mean = 4.87; t = 2.14,
p < .02).

DISCUSSION
The findings strongly confirmed the hypothesis that women are seen as less entrepreneurial
than men. Specifically, along the dimensions of leadership, autonomy, risk taking, readiness
for change, endurance,
lack of emotionalism,
and low need for support, women were
perceived to be significantly less like successful entrepreneurs than were men. Men and
women were both rated lower than successful entrepreneurs
on the lack of conformity
dimension. Men, women, and successful entrepreneurs were not seen as significantly different in persuasiveness. Across all nine dimensions, women were never rated as significantly
closer to successful entrepreneurs than were men.
Schein (1973, 1975) showed that women were perceived to be lacking characteristics,
attitudes, and temperament necessary for management positions. The present research extends
Schein’s earlier work to examine the relationship between characteristics attributed to men
and women and those attributed to successful entrepreneurs. Consistent with Schein’s findings
that women were not seen as well suited for managerial roles, this study also found that
women were perceived to lack the characteristics necessary for successful entrepreneurship.
A number of studies (Deaux and Taynor 1973; Dipboye, ANey, and Terpstra 1977;
Rosen and Jerdee 1974, 1974a, 1975; Shaw 1972; Terborg and Ilgen 1975) have shown that

<-----Page 8----->BANK LOAN OFFICERS’

PERCEPTIONS

257

sex stereotypes depicting females as lacking managerial characteristics adversely influenced
female managers with respect to employment, job assignment, promotion, development,
and performance evaluation. These stereotypes likely hinder women’s progress and advancement in organizations.
The results of this study raise the question of whether loan officers would be influenced
by these stereotypes and would treat loan applications from male entrepreneurs more favorably than from female entrepreneurs. To the extent that loan officers are influenced by
perceptions that women are not suited for entrepreneurship,
then females could be at a
particular disadvantage in raising capital, a major obstacle for aspiring female entrepreneurs.
Our findings are consistent with anecdotal evidence that female entrepreneurs have more
difficulty than men in raising venture capital (Hisrich and O’Brien 1982; Humphries and
McClung 198 1).
We chose to examine the perceptions of bank loan officers because of the critical role
that they play in launching new ventures. Note, however, that compared to female loan
officers, male loan officers perceived a larger gap between the attributes of successful
entrepreneurs and the attributes of women. This suggests that aspiring female entrepreneurs
might receive more favorable treatment from female loan officers. Additional research is
needed to further investigate this possibility.
Aldrich and Zimmer (1985) have proposed that entrepreneurship be viewed in a social
context. Entrepreneurial
success depends on the effectiveness of the entrepreneur’s social
network, including relationships with bankers, customers, suppliers and others in a position
to influence the development of the new venture. Our findings suggest that it may be harder
for women than men to cultivate one linkage in these networks because of stereotypes that
women are lacking characteristics necessary to become successful entrepreneurs. Additional
research should focus on the perceptions of other members of the entrepreneur’s support
network. To the extent that women have greater difficulty in establishing linkages in these
social networks, the likelihood of the success of female-owned businesses may be seriously
diminished.
An important extension of the present research is to assess the consequences of sex
stereotypes on the willingness of network members to assist and support male and female
entrepreneurs.
For example, members of the business community could be presented with
identical information regarding the development of a proposed new venture, attributed to a
male entrepreneur in one experimental condition and to a female entrepreneur in a second
condition. Comparisons would reveal willingness of network members to provide various
levels of advice, support, and assistance to entrepreneurs of both sexes. This research question
is currently under investigation by the authors
Our research findings suggest that, compared to men, women are seen as less likely
to possess the necessary attributes for successful entrepreneurship.
Assuming that forewarned
is forearmed, it is important to alert aspiring female entrepreneurs to the kinds of skepticism
and resistance that they might encounter. Perhaps in the context of workshops for aspiring
female entrepreneurs, sex stereotypes could be explored and strategies for overcoming bias
could be addressed. When dealing with loan officers, for example, aspiring female entrepreneurs could come ready to dispel stereotypes with examples demonstrating their capacity
for acting independently and their willingness to take business risks.
Small business is a vital force in the U.S. economy. The number of women going
into business for themselves is rising rapidly. The success and growth of female owned
businesses could have a positive impact on employment and income at a time when many
large businesses are suffering slow growth. Identifying and eliminating obstacles to success
