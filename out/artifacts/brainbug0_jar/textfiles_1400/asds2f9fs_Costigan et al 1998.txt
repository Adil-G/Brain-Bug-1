We propose the following:
Hypothesis3: Focal employee'saffect-based
and cognitive-based trustof his or her supervisorwill be positivelyassociated with
this employee's personal initiativeto improveprofessionally.

To providea different
hierarchical
perspectiveon the focal employee's
risktaking,motivation,and assertiveness in thepresentstudy,threesetsof
ratingson the focal employee's behaviorin each area (i.e., supervisory
ratings,co-worker'sratings,and selfratings)are used as a comparison.A
focalemployee'sself-rating
is used to
assess his or her professionaldevelopmentbehaviorsince itmayonlybe

Institutional
Trust
Fox (1974) referredto an institutionaltrustwhichis employeetrustof
the organization'sCEO and top management. Little empirical research
has apparentlybeen conductedin the
area of institutionalor top management trust(McCauley and Kuhnert,
1992). Scott (1980) found that trust
of top managementwas relatedto the
perceivedvalue of a management-byobjective program. Institutionalor
top managementtrustis more impersonal (i.e., less dyadic) unless the orsmallnumganizationhas a relatively
ber ofemployeesor one is positioned
near the top of the organization'shierarchy.Employees monitororganizational processes to decide whether
to trusttop management(Carnevale,
1988). Trust of the CEO and top
managementis usuallybased less on
directobservationbut more on decision outcomes made by top managers. That is, this trustis determined

than by the personal characteristics

foundthatsystem-wide

Hypothesis4: Focal employee'strustof top

Driscoll (1978) found thattrustin
top managementis closelyassociated
with overall job satisfaction.McCauley and Kuhnert (1992) speculated thatemployeetrustof top management should be associated with
other organizationalattachmentvariables, such as organizational commitment. Organizational commitment refers to the employee's
attitudetowardcontinued participation in his or her organization.Mowday (1981) presented another perspective to organizational commitment by assessing each employee'sdesireand intentto leave the

Focal employeeswere also asked to
evaluate their own behavior in four
areas: motivation,risk taking,assertiveness,and personal initiativefor
professionaldevelopment. The first
three behaviorswere included, with
minor changes in wording,in both
thesupervisor'sand co-worker'squestionnaires.That is, both the supervisor and co-worker
were asked to evaluate the focalemployee'sbehaviorin
each of these areas. The behavior,
"Personal initiativefor professional
development,"was not included in
thesupervisor'sand co-worker'squestionnaires because this behavioral
itemmightonlybe knownby the focal employee whereas the other behaviorsin thisstudyshould be more
observable to others. All behavioral
items but one were specially developed forthisstudy.The assertiveness
item (i.e., "(S)he volunteershis/her
work-related
viewswithoutwaitingto
be asked") was developed by Fandt
(1994). A five-pointLikertscale format (1 = "stronglyagree," ...
,5
= "strongly
disagree") was used as
anchorsin the previouslymentioned
trustscales and performancescales.
See Table 1 for the wordingof each
behavior.
An improvisedversionof Cook and
Wall's (1980) six-itemscale was used
to assessthe focal employee'strustof
his or her organization's CEO and
top management. Cook and Wall's
(1980) scale showed high internal
consistency(Cronbach's alpha = .92)
in Clegg and Wall's (1981) study.Our
revision of their scale entailed the
substitutionof "CEO and top management" for the word "management" to reduce the ambiguityin
these items. Thus, six items (e.g.,
"The CEO and the top management
of my organization are sincere in
their attemptto meet the workers'

311

point of view") were utilizedto measure top management trust.A fivepoint Likert scale format (1 =
. . . , 5 =
"strongly agree,"
"stronglydisagree") was used to anchor all of the itemsin thisscale.
We developed an item which assesses the focal employee's perception of the organization's reward
practices.This itemis: "The company
has a historyof rewardinghigh performingemployees." The same fivepoint Likertscale formatwas used to
anchor this item. Mowday's (1981)
two items (e.g., "All thingsconsidered, I would like to finda comparable job in another organization as
soon as possible") wereused to assess
each focal employee's desire to voluntarilyleave the organization.After
findingan acceptablelevelofinternal
consistencyfor these items (Cronbach's alpha = .78), a composite
mean served as an intent-to-leave
measure.
Results
The only demographic variable
found to correlatewiththe focal employee's affect-basedand cognitivebased trustof the supervisorwas this
employee'stenurein the currentposition (p < .05). That is, the longer
one is in thejob, the higherthe level
ofdyadictrustofone's supervisor.No
such relationshipwas found between
the focalemployee'strustof co-workers and tenure in the currentposition.The resultsalso showedthatthe
other demographic variables were
unrelatedto dyadictrust.Specifically,
the focal employee's gender, tenure
in the organization,and managerial
status (i.e., managerial position versus non-managerialposition) were
not correlatedwith this employee's
trustof the supervisorand co-work-

one's managercan be expectedto increase as they forge a relationship
over the years.
Our resultsindicatea linkbetween
affect-basedtrustin work relationships and employee behavior (e.g.,
risktaking,motivation,assertiveness,
and personal initiativeto improve
professionally).The connection between affect-basedtrustand motivation is consistently
strongacross raters (i.e., self,co-worker,supervisor).
However,theexactnatureof thekind

It may behoove organizationsto

Team building,survivaltraining,and
similarprogramsseem to be aimed
towardimprovinginterpersonalrelationshipsbetween a relativelylarge
number of participants.It may at
timesmake sense to narrowthe focus
of these kinds of interventionsand
center more on dyadic relationships
in organizations.While interventions
focused on dyadsmay produce positivejolts in affect-basedtrust,developing and sustainingthis trustover
time should be their goal. Caution
maybe necessarywhen tryingto develop affect-basedtrustin relationships involvingmembers of the opposite sex. Problemswithworkplace
romances as well as sexual harassment are well publicized. Continued
effortsto educate employees in the
area of diversity
topicsand sexual harassment law is encouraged, espeintervenciallywhen trust-enhancing
tions are attempted. In short, the
costs and benefitsof such interventionsshould be closelymonitored.

Finally,a few words follow about
the limitationsof thisresearcheffort.
First,we draw the readers' attention
to the fact that our relativelysmall

Generalizabilityof our findingswill

emphasize thatthisis a correlational

Consideringthe strengthof the correlations found in our study,however, futureresearch should investigate theserelationshipsfroma causal

may also produce valuable insights
into theirdynamicsand interplay.
