Editorial
Qualitative research and computing: methodological
issues and practices in using QSR NVivo and NUD*IST
COLM CROWLEY, ROM HARRÉ and CLARE TAGG

Software for qualitative research has now existed for just over two decades.
However, the research community often continues to be sharply divided
about its use, with, on the one hand, those who believe qualitative software
is an anathema and on the other, its enthusiastic champions. On the
electronic discussion lists such as QUALRS_L, QUAL-SOFTWARE and
QSR-FORUM, polarized opinions for or against can be so robustly
expressed that the more subtle impacts of specialist software for qualitative
research can be obscured.
A number of key concerns centre on the loss of data, at the extreme by
turning words into numbers. These concerns are about both the losses
involved in putting data into the computer and about the abstraction that
occurs once the data are in the computer. Data loss is not unique to
qualitative software (it routinely occurs when tapes are transcribed or field
notes are typed, for example) but some software, by only accepting plain
text, can certainly cause further loss: for example underlining, italics, bold
or those comments in red ink are not available. Other software, however,
accepts rich text, thereby supporting such distinctions in writing, just as
contemporary word processing software does. One of the characteristics of
qualitative research is the abstraction of ideas from data, but the question is
whether qualitative software is merely assisting in this process, or if it is
somehow actually driving the abstraction in unintended ways. The answer
is, it depends upon the user, but software can both assist with and enrich
the abstraction. Computers can count very easily so it can be tempting to
substitute numbers for words, but whether this is undertaken depends on
the user not the software. Moreover, use of software opens up the
opportunities for mixed methods.
There are those, particularly in disciplines where qualitative research is
in its infancy, who espouse the view that use of software makes research
more reliable or robust. This depends upon how the software is used,
although it could be argued that (any) use of such software makes analysis
more visible, thereby enhancing transparency, and so the quality of
evidence and argument might be more easily judged. This is another
example of a deeper issue: is the software just a tool or does it in some way
drive the research? In this matter we would argue for the middle ground.

EDITORIAL

The user is obviously in control of current qualitative software, as existing
packages do not contain elements of artificial intelligence1—they do not
even go as far as the kind of auto-correction that occurs in word-processing
packages such as Word.2 However, use of the software in different ways
will undoubtedly shape the analysis process. For example, the order in
which coded text is presented for inspection may well impact on the
researcher’s perceptions.
Concerns about the effects of technology on practice are not new and
often lead to polarized debates between those for and against a technology.
In the case of qualitative research and computing, the debate has also
polarized around comparisons of different types of software and whether
specific software favours or precludes particular research methods. While
specific capabilities of software can either enhance or limit particular
research activities undertaken with it, the leading qualitative analysis
packages now provide a range of general-purpose techniques that may be
used in a variety of ways to support different research approaches.
Consequent challenges for users include determining how best to use the
capabilities of the software to further their research goals, and being aware
of and reflecting on the impact of their use of software.
To address these challenges, a series of interdisciplinary conferences on
qualitative research and computing has been convened at the Institute of
Education, University of London since 1999.3 This special issue brings
together key papers from the last two conferences.
The aim of the conferences has been to bring together researchers
conducting qualitative projects or teaching with the NUD*IST software
developed by Qualitative Solutions and Research (QSR).4 The conferences
have provided an opportunity to discuss methodology, share experience,
develop research strategies, to report and critique the software’s use in
projects (and its effects on methods), consider teaching and supervision
issues and to debate and drive future directions.
The conferences (and consequently this special issue) have been
explicitly restricted to issues and research emanating from the use of the
NUD*IST range of software (at first N3 and N4, but more recently NVivo,
N5 and N6) for the following reasons. By nominating a particular range of
software, papers have been able to assume shared background knowledge
rather than having to set out how the software package works. The time and
repetition saved have meant that descriptions of software use have focused
on its more unusual applications and on the connection with method. This
focus on specific software has thus led to debate that is more about impact
on method than about which software, if any, to use. The arguments
presented in the papers are thus often relevant to computer-assisted
analysis of qualitative data whichever package is being used.
QSR software is generally regarded as being one of the more
sophisticated qualitative analysis packages (Weitzman and Miles 1995)
and is well used world-wide. There are now two distinct QSR software
packages (N6 and NVivo) but as explained in the first paper in this issue,
these have developed from one root and use the same underlying concepts.
The software provides facilities for data management, for coding and
retrieving text, and for theory testing. The software is open-ended so that it

may be used in many different ways. In the same way that a wordprocessing package does not dictate whether you write a novel or a sermon,
QSR software does not determine nor constitute a method despite some
literature that links the software to grounded theory. However, like most of
the qualitative analysis software that facilitates ‘code and retrieve’, it does
provide particular support for the many methods that require the
development of an organizing system (Tesch 1990).
Both QSR software packages use the document and node as central
organizing concepts. The document either contains some data in textual
form or represents some external data (e.g. a book, video, audio tape or still
image). In NVivo, inserting hyperlinks makes it easier and faster to ‘jump’
to external data. Nodes represent ideas and may, if a coding approach to
analysis is being used, be linked to marked up passages in documents.
Nodes may be organized into hierarchical trees. There is sometimes a deep
misgiving that the Node Tree structuring facility equates to a correspondingly hierarchic (and perhaps, equally worryingly, ‘fixed’) conceptualization, however inappropriate it might be to the investigation in hand. Others
fear that, while it might not necessarily impose a hierarchic approach to
substantive conceptualization, the concrete representation of the Tree
system (perhaps ‘bushes’ would seem less authoritarian?) might lead less
independent-minded users to reflect it unquestioningly in their conceptualization. This can lead to a deterrent ‘Down with all this sort of thing!’
position on software use, when it has not been understood that the Tree
structure is simply an organizing system in the software that enables more
efficient interrogation of its databases; it can be restructured very simply at
any time and it can also be completely ignored and not used.
In our role as guest editors of this issue of the journal, we bring to bear
a variety of experience with qualitative software, straddling a spectrum
from using, teaching and supervising its use in research of different
traditions, to software development. Myths about qualitative software
abound—typically among research students at the outset of their
methodology training, but they are not unheard of among experienced
supervisors and directors of large-scale funded research. For example, the
misconception that the software does something (a notion of some
automated process of analysis) is not uncommon. The question of who is
in charge, the software or the researcher, is tellingly reflected in enquiries
such as ‘Will it let me. . . ?’ It is sometimes forgotten by those new to
qualitative software that any lack in its ability to do something in particular
certainly does not preclude them from including such strategies in their
research. It is always possible to leave the software to one side and use other
means as well—to get out of the car and perhaps walk, cycle or a take a boat
for parts of the journey, as it were. It must be emphasized that, although
the limitations it imposes continue to decrease, the researcher is not a
hostage to qualitative software
Questions such as ‘Will the software save me time?’ and ‘Is it worth the
effort of learning to use it?’ are inevitably the crux of the matter for
prospective users. To address such issues users need to be informed enough
about the general considerations to be able to apply them to their particular
situations. It is not the remit of the articles in this special issue to dispel

basic misconceptions or to provide an introduction for the uninitiated.
That is more appropriately the province of instructional texts and two such
books relating to NVivo are reviewed. In contrast to the reference manuals
produced by software developers, this literature aims to address the
progressively developing questions and needs of those embarking on
research with the software. Reflecting the varying backgrounds of new
users, such books either assume an existing knowledge of qualitative
methodology or aim to provide an introduction to methodology in
conjunction with support in mastering the use of the software to serve
the preferred methodology. In view of the call from the Economic and
Social Research Council5 for the inclusion of instruction on qualitative
software in postgraduate methodology training (ESRC 2001) the new
literature will be a welcome resource.
However, some questions do not readily find space for discussion in
introductory texts, and so it is on the more searching questions and
specialized issues that we focus in this special issue of the journal. The
articles are concerned with methodological and practical implications of
using QSR software. The more technical among them presuppose a
background knowledge of the software (we hope that users of other
qualitative software packages will nevertheless find aspects of the
discussion relevant, technical differences notwithstanding). However, the
first article by Tom Richards provides a definitive account of the
development of NUD*IST. The increasing power of personal computers
has been exploited by the developers to both overcome the limitations of
earlier versions in replicating manual methods and to extend the techniques
available to qualitative researchers. Tom Richards shows how new facilities
have been added to the software both in response to researcher demand and
at the instigation of the developers, suggesting a push-pull relationship
between computerization and the development of method.
The symbiotic relationship between the software and the researcher is a
thread picked up by the next article. Linda Gilbert draws material from a
detailed study of qualitative researchers experienced in using both manual
techniques of analysis and NUD*IST. She thoroughly explores the debate
surrounding the potential restrictions on ‘closeness to data’ imposed by the
use of software and identifies three levels of ‘distance’. These findings have
implications for teaching and evaluating research using qualitative software
but they also show how the maturation of the NUD*IST software brings
considerations of closeness and distance into sharper focus.
The question of how computerization may have encouraged greater
collaboration between qualitative and quantitative researchers (noted by
Tom Richards) is extended in Pat Bazeley’s article. In it she describes, by
tracing the evolution of a mixed-methods project, how succeeding versions
of the software have increasingly facilitated the integration of qualitative
and quantitative analysis. She concludes that without developments in
qualitative software it would have been virtually impossible to integrate
textual and statistical analysis while retaining the richness of the data.
In the next article, Michael Rich and Jennifer Patashnick similarly
conclude that their use of the software ‘significantly enhanced our ability to
analyse’. They discuss a diary project involving very large quantities of

video, which was at first analysed manually. Their rationale for choosing to
adopt NVivo for the analysis, in spite of some compromises having to be
made as a result of using it, will be of interest to those faced with similar
challenges. It also illustrates how functions in the software have been used
to meet the particular requirements of the research project.
Neither NVivo nor N6 enable multiple researchers to work on a data set
simultaneously (although colleagues can of course take turns on the
computer); however, as Clare Tagg outlines in an article on working
practice, separate work by researchers can be ‘merged’ using ancillary
software. Four strategies are presented for using merge procedures
effectively in team research.
Lyn Richards, in her article, argues that the methodological and
practical implications of using qualitative software that are highlighted in
this special issue are seldom discussed in the literature. She explores
possible reasons for the paucity of debate about the effects of computing on
qualitative methods, and outlines the potentially serious consequences for
research.
We would like to thank the editors of the International Journal of Social
Research Methodology for devoting a special issue to selected papers from
the Strategies in Qualitative Research conference; our thanks go also to
Silvana di Gregorio and Ann Lewins for editorial advice and moral support
given as members of the Strategies in Qualitative Research conference
committee; and to the panel of referees for the special issue who generously
gave their time. We hope that this collection of articles will serve to
stimulate further debate.
