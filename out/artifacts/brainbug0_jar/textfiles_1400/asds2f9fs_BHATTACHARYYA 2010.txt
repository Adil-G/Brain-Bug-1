The Networking Entrepreneur
ARUN BHATTACHARYYA
The amalgamation of entrepreneurship and networking has been a topic of interest
for researchers, who have tried to find linkages between the two. However, creation
of network is only the beginning and to be effective, the entrepreneur must use it
optimally. The case is about an entrepreneur who believed that to create and grow
an enterprise, networking is the key. Starting on a modest note, he used both formal
and informal networks to diversify his business.

It was 7.30 pm on an unusually warm October (2007) evening in Sikar,
a district in the state of Rajasthan, India. Diwali (the Festival of Lights),
an Indian festival celebrated especially by the North Indians, was just
about a month away and the retail hardware store of Mahendra Sharma,
located on Station Road, was packed with customers buying items to
spruce up their homes. While the customers were being attended to by the
store personnel, Mahendra was busy sipping tea from a paper cup along
with some people, and engaged in what seemed like light banter, with
them. One of them spoke out, ‘Sharma Ji,1 you are a migrant to Rajasthan
and especially to this town. What do you think has been the secret of your
success here?’ Prompt came the reply, ‘My network, my marketing sense
and of course a little bit of luck.’
The First Generation
It all started with Bajrang Lal Sharma, a tall lanky man with granite-sharp
countenance, who literally shaped the entrepreneurial trail, if one may call
it, of the Sharmas. Born in Rangpur (now in Bangladesh), in an orthodox

Brahmin joint family, young Bajrang was forced to migrate into India after
the partition in 1947. The family settled in Cooch Bihar, a sleepy town in
the Northern part of the state of West Bengal, and his father had to start
everything afresh. However, he did not want his son’s education to suffer
and Bajrang was enrolled in a primary school there. But headstrong that
he was, Bajrang did not like the idea of his father working for a living
and paying for his education. He left studies and took up a job in a renowned business family in those times. Meticulous in work, Bajrang
easily earned the respect of his employers. Never short on self-motivation,
Bajrang did not need any prompting whatsoever to try something new
at his workplace. May be this characteristic of his, his continuous fight
against the status quo, was inherited by his son, Mahendra.
Sensing more opportunities, he migrated to Bankura, another district in
West Bengal after a few years. Here, he worked for a tobacco merchant.
One day his employer, impressed by his work, casually remarked, ‘I think
Bajrang, you should be running your own business.’ Bajrang needed no
other cue. Determined to prove himself, the quest to be ‘on my own’
started. The first generation entrepreneur scanned various business options,
the suitability of locations, looked for the right environment and finally
started with trading and distribution of tobacco in Bankura.
He created a name for himself and, as time wore on, his product portfolio swelled with the inclusion of foodstuffs like grams, chana and pulses;
staples that were loved by Bengalis. Bajrang, the young entrepreneur
was truly and firmly on track and nothing could deter him, not even the
occasional paucity of funds.
Bajrang was not the socialising type, and partying was a taboo with
the womenfolk being thought to be best as homemakers and not much
more. He considered himself as a self-made man and really had a strong
belief in his own capabilities. This was reinforced by constant updating
of knowledge and skills through reading (he regularly read The Statesman
and The Anand Bazaar Patrika, the two top newspapers of West Bengal)
and learning the new ‘tricks of the trade’. Although loved by one and all
because of his benevolent nature, Bajrang was very assertive and his views
prevailed, whether at home or at work place. Remarked Anu Sharma,
Bajrang’s grand daughter, her eyes twinkling behind her spectacles ‘Dada2
Ji was really a man everybody respected. He was very affectionate with
children, especially me and had a profound influence on everyone he
dealt with.’

The Business Environment
However, not everything was right as far as the external environment
was concerned. The Naxalite3 movement was rearing its head in West
Bengal and ‘outsiders’ were feeling unsafe. Increasingly, the locals were
demanding that the land was rightfully theirs and no ‘foreigners’ should
be allowed to encroach on their sovereignty. Bajrang was concerned about
the plight of his family and decided to shift business outside West Bengal.
Safety was at the top of his mind and so he chose Sikar, which was bereft
of any such security concerns, as his second entrepreneurial destination
(he had some relatives settled there).
Tobacco was not a viable business proposition in Sikar and Bajrang had
to look for a different line of business. Sikar was the district headquarters
and in its development stage. After discussing with friends and relatives,
he weighed several options and using his business acumen to good effect,
finally decided that trading in hardware would be the right choice. Thus
‘Mahendra Kumar Rajendra Prasad’,a retail hardware store was formed
by Bajrang in partnership with one of his closest friends.4
The Next Generation Emerges
This is the background in which Mahendra was born. Bajrang had five
children, two daughters (who have since been married) and three sons,
Mahendra being the second. Schooling for Mahendra was in Bankura.
He was an intelligent student, an avid reader and always had the urge to
update his knowledge. His classmates used to consider him intelligent and
frequently went to him for advice. Mahendra had just started his graduation
studies when Bajrang decided to move to Sikar.
Due to his father’s movements, young Mahendra had to change school
thrice, and the transitions were not smooth. Bajrang, broad minded that
he was, did not want any brakes to be put on his children’s education,
come what may. After passing out from school, Mahendra enrolled in the
science stream of a local college in Sikar, but the young fellow had other
ideas and changed his stream to commerce and graduated from Pillani
(a district near to Sikar, known for its educational institutions). He completed his Masters in Commerce in 1983.

The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 3----->212 / Arun Bhattacharyya

Mahendra had been a voracious reader, right from his school days.
From George Bernard Shaw to Sarat Chandra Chatterjee to Bimal Mitra
to Leo Tolstoy, he not only read them all, but also internalised them to
good effect. Even lately, the same invigorating spirit tended to woo one
and all and people, young and old, appreciated Mahendra for his ideas
and advice. The accumulation and disbursement of learning from the
study of such rich literature continued unabated even when he was at
his workplace and you could find wide eyed admirers lapping it all up.
One of his friends in fact remarked that Mahendra should have been in
academics and not business. ‘It is still not too late. He is only 45 years of
age,’ he said tongue-in-cheek.
Mahendra differed from his father in many ways. Though orthodox
to a certain extent, he was much more liberal than his father and always
thought that male and female members should be treated at par. In fact,
Anu recalled that he liked his daughters very much and wanted to be
with them whenever time permitted. Even when Anu was pursuing her
MBA degree from a university located near to Sikar, he wanted her to be
with him during weekends and have discussions on various topics be it
literature, politics, management or social sciences. ‘However, most of the
time due to study pressures, I was unable to go’, sighed Anu. A follower
of a renowned Indian spiritual leader, Ravi Shankar, he believed in the
right to equality, which he sadly felt that the Indian society was yet to
internalise fully. He did not believe in modernity per se; ‘one should focus
on being progressive in order to forge ahead’, spoke Mahendra with full
conviction.
Although Mahendra was not directly involved in the business idea
selection, he did contribute in bringing in information through the informal network that he had created. The networking abilities had enabled
Mahendra to leverage market information and transform the once fledgling
enterprise into what it was now.
The Network Perspective
Networks are called a set of high trust relationships that either directly or
indirectly link together everyone in a social group (Carson & Gilmore,
2000). Formal definition of the network perspective says that entrepreneurship is ‘embedded in networks of continuing social relations. The origins of
this perspective (Birley, 1985), which investigates how social connections
The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 4----->The Networking Entrepreneur / 213

between entrepreneurs and their environment affect entrepreneurship,
revealed that informal sources such as family and friends played a larger
role than formal sources such as banks, business centres and lawyers in
the process of mobilising resources.
It is often argued that entrepreneurs must network in order to survive
(Huggins, 2000). Within complex networks of relationships, entrepreneurship is facilitated or constrained by linkages between aspiring entrepreneurs,
resources and opportunities (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986). Social networks
made up of family, friends, acquaintances, customers, suppliers, and so on,
were found to play a central role in helping entrepreneurs identify opportunities and mobilise resources for their firms. Networks, involving
organised systems of relationships between entrepreneurs and the outside
world, are particularly valuable to the small business sector (Donckels
& Johan, 1997).
Networks have also been defined as a set of nodes of persons and
organisations, ‘linked by a set of social relationships…, and an orientation
towards mutual gain’ (Cooper, 2002). The emphasis is on reciprocal,
preferential and mutually supportive actions, characterised by complex,
multidimensional and durable relationships (Carr, 2000).
Mahendra was totally different from his father as far as networking
and creating relationships was concerned. While Bajrang, as has been
mentioned earlier, was a bit of a social recluse, Mahendra went all out to
woo people, not only for personal gains, but just for interacting with them.
In fact, he learnt many languages and was able to speak fluently in English,
Hindi, Bengali and Urdu, among others. He even wanted to learn South
Indian languages, especially Tamil. One could find novels by eminent
authors of yore at his workplace and he never missed an opportunity to go
through them, whenever time permitted. This habit of his, in conjunction
with his people-centric approach, had contributed a lot in the growth of
his enterprise, and had earned him affection and love from one and all, be
it customers, employees, acquaintances or family members. In fact, one
would find lots of people coming to his workplace for advice or just to talk
on some topics, and Mahendra was all ears to them. Anu affectionately
recalled that elders used to call her father a politician.
Although networks are important in any successful entrepreneurial
venture, just having a good network is unlikely to ensure success. Entrepreneurs must be adept at managing effectively the networks of ‘know-who’
in order to build strong, independent relationships and being a sound ‘fixer’
The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 5----->214 / Arun Bhattacharyya

capable of putting together ‘packages’ of resources in order to achieve
(Gartner, 1990; Long, 1983). Mahendra enthusiastically acknowledged the
importance of personal contact network in the success of his enterprise.
He seemed to know almost everyone in Sikar and Jaipur (the capital city
of Rajasthan, a two hour drive from Sikar). So ardent was his pursuit for
information that he never missed an opportunity to dwell on a wide repertoire of subjects and tried to garner information from all ‘you-knowwho’s’. Anu fondly remembered how, in his spare time, he even ‘read’
railway and bus timetables so as to familiarise with the various routes and
places. ‘If you want to visit any place and are in a quandary as to the best
itinerary, you would be well advised to contact my father,’ she laughed.
This habit of his had helped Mahendra in his networking abilities.
Network relationships include feelings of gratitude, reciprocity, respect,
and friendship and being embedded in a network promulgates mutual
knowledge and recognition (Bourdieu, 1985). Networks connect the
entrepreneur with opportunities critical to a firm’s success and provide support, credibility, and contact for entrepreneurs. Individuals who are ‘well
connected’, that is, who have numerous social and professional relationships, will experience more success in starting new ventures, given the
existence of a rich network. Mahendra had formed networks with plumbers, masons, carpenters, painters and other artisans, so as to provide value
added services to his customers, whenever they asked for such support
services. He did not restrict it to his workplace only, but carried it over
to his village also. If the people of the village faced any problem (once,
it was getting electricity) they looked to this man as a saviour, and more
times than none, Mahendra would use his network (in the right places,
including government personnel) to set things right. He wanted the society
at large to prosper and did whatever he could for them.
Mahendra’s entrepreneurial journey is a live example of the network
perspective and he attributed his success to ‘networks, networks and
networks—within the family and outside it.’
Focusing on the Entrepreneur
Mahendra was a family man by all means. Married in 1984, immediately
after completing his Masters, he eventually became the father of three
children, Anu, Chandni (who aspired to go into medicine) and Rahul (who
was in school and aspired to become an engineer). He was more like a
The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 6----->The Networking Entrepreneur / 215

friend to them, never imposing anything but listening and learning from
their acquired knowledge and experiences. This thirst to seek knowledge
and information from all concerned had enabled him to bridge that gap
between his own education and the present day development in concerned
fields. He was a great motivator and was, in fact, a role model for his
younger daughter, Chandni. His wife also had been a source of strength
for him in this aspect. He was proud of his children and wishes them
to pursue carriers of their choice, of course within the societal norms.
Mahendra believed that this unity, within the members of the Sharma
family (he called it a legacy), had been the greatest strength that had driven
business and other activities.
The Sharma Family Tree is shown in Figure 1.
Innovation had been the hallmark of Mahendra. He was hardly ever
satisfied with the status quo and always wanted to bring in ‘newness’ to
every aspect of life he was involved in, be it business or agriculture. The

<-----Page 7----->216 / Arun Bhattacharyya

Sharmas owned a plot of agricultural land near Sikar and Mahendra also
looked after it. Surprisingly, he had found an able ally in Rahul, who was
excited about farming.
Innovations in the form of using newer variety of seeds or newer
methods of cultivation (using vermiculture, for example) came at regular
intervals. At work, he tried out newer methods and avenues to do things.
Narendra, his younger brother helped him in generating ideas for his
business and Mahendra acknowledged and admired his brother’s intelligence and said ‘he is simply brilliant.’
Routine work, especially accounts, however, bored this man and all
accounting work would be in shambles earlier. Normally, we are made
to believe that entrepreneurs of small and medium scale enterprises tend
to look after their own accounts. But Mahendra was not motivated enough to
go into all the ledger work and keep the balance sheets intact. Though he
had later kept an accountant and has computeried accounts to a great extent,
he was averse to this dreary work and got chided by his elders for the
nonchalance. Daily and routine operational management was not for this
man; ‘Maybe Anu will handle it for me some day,’ mused Mahendra.
Had he faced any adversity during his business career? The tall wellbuilt personality, chewing on ‘pan masala’ screwed up his eyes as if trying
to remember. ‘Not as far as I can remember. The amalgamation of my
father’s fine business acumen, the support of my brothers and the bond
that holds our family together, has ensured that our enterprise did not run
into rough weather. ‘We are thankful to The Lord for this’, proclaimed
Mahendra humbly with a smile. As always, he belittled his own effort in
nurturing the enterprise, which he had seen grow before his very eyes.
Mahendra was a calculated risk taker and did not plunge headlong into a
business prospect with whatever information was available, but only after
ascertaining its growth prospects. He was ranked as the number two dealer
of Nerolac Paints in Sikar district in a short span of time.
Working the Talk: Marketing and Entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurial marketing has been most frequently associated with marketing activities in companies that are small and resource constrained,
and, therefore, must rely on creative marketing tactics that make heavy
use of social networks (Morris, Schindehutte & LaForge, 2002). Casson
(1982) calls the entrepreneur the market maker, who coordinates market
The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 8----->The Networking Entrepreneur / 217

activities and who ‘…. specialises in taking judgmental decisions about,
the coordination of scarce resources.’ A different set of four Ps—person,
process, purpose and practices—have been offered as a better frame for
understanding marketing in entrepreneurial firms (Zontanos & Anderson,
2004). From the perspective of ‘person’ (the first P) we find that marketing
had been one of Mahendra’s strengths, and he always tried to establish
and promote contacts through his networking abilities. This came to him
naturally and was not an entirely planned ‘process’, although he believed,
and which is corroborated by Anu, that networking was the process by
which his business grew faster, from where he had commenced his journey
to the position that he was in today.
Starting with distribution and retailing of hardware goods, he had
diversified to sanitary ware, then to paints and then to plywood (Figure 2).
Even talking of hardware, he had added a large number of items in the
product portfolio including screws and pipes among others.

The Diversification of Businesses

The interface between networks in entrepreneurship and networks in
relationship marketing involves an emphasis on mutual interest and trust
with the customer being the central focus (Schindehutte et al., 2000). Profit
was not the primary ‘purpose’ of Mahendra’s foray into entrepreneurship; it
was more of social oriented. For him the product was not the material goods
The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 9----->218 / Arun Bhattacharyya

that customers bought from his store, but the entire service associated
with it. He believed in creating relationships, which is foundational to
entrepreneurial practice and has found favour in formal marketing theory.
This is clear from the statement he made, when asked about it. ‘I want my
customers to get everything under one roof. Why should they run from
pillar to post to build a house of their dreams?’
Mahendra believed that people were the real assets of his business and
hence should be well taken care of. This also brings to the forefront the
‘practices’ aspect of entrepreneurial marketing, by which he intended to
provide customers the best solutions at one location—be it the best brand
of decorative paints or painters to paint one’s home. All transactions were
ethical and employees were instructed to be fair not only with customers
but also among themselves. Successful entrepreneurship is not just about
having a good network, but how entrepreneurs put it to use. They have
to scan the information coming in, identify opportunities and then look
for any resources that are beyond their control. Mahendra never allowed
opportunities to pass by.
Let us take the example of his foray into plywood. Anu’s uncle was
building a house and required about half a truckload of plywood for
interior works. He consulted Mahendra as to the source of good quality
plywood. Realising the potential of the business prospect (half a truck
load of plywood for a single house!), he decided to add plywood into
his product portfolio. Later, he kept three brands of plywood to cater to
the upper, middle and lower middle class of customers. When queried
about not focusing on only the upper and upper middle class, Mahendra
remarked, ‘Sikar is not a place where you can find high profile customers.
For sustenance, I need to cater to the lower segments as well. This class
of customers will bring me my revenues, my cash flows.’
Futurities
For the moment, Mahendra was satisfied with his progress. But soon
he would like to foray into trading of iron and steel and cement. ‘I have
located a space for keeping stock of both items. But I will have to make
arrangements for making it suitable for storing. I am also looking for
reliable suppliers’.
Sharma’s business diversifications and plans for the future are shown
in Figure 2.
The Journal of Entrepreneurship, 19, 2 (2010): 209–221

<-----Page 10----->The Networking Entrepreneur / 219

What does he think about the future of his children?
I will not force them to be come into my business. They are free to
pursue their own life. My elder daughter wants to be a corporate executive; my younger daughter wants to be a doctor; my son, well, he is
too young to decide now. Let’s see what happens.
Says Mahendra. So what would happen to succession, the enterprise
he had created? Mahendra only nods his head and looks towards the sky,
as if for a divine intervention. Only time will tell.
Teaching Note
The case study demonstrates how an entrepreneur’s networks are parsed
into the day-to-day activities of entrepreneurship and thereby uncover
the foundations of their success. The case offers a unique opportunity to
examine a networking entrepreneur, who used both formal and informal
networks to diversify his business. The most salient aspect of his success
is his effective leverage of his personal contact network coupled with
exceptional communicative skills for influencing it.
Course: The case should be used for discussing the role of network
creation and its usage by an entrepreneur in the success of an enterprise.
The case is for discussions with management and entrepreneurship students
at postgraduate level.
Assignment Questions
1. How important is networking in entrepreneurship?
2. Comment on the opportunity identification process of Mahendra?
Would you have done something differently?
3. Shouldn’t Mahendra also motivate his children to be entrepreneurs,
instead of allowing them to choose their careers?
Additional Analytic Points

The case should be taken up after giving basic lessons of entrepreneurship to students. It is ideally suited for advance courses in
entrepreneurship in the final year of the management courses.
If the students are given an input from literature on the characteristics
of entrepreneurs, it would be helpful during case discussions. Also,
to maximise the utility of the case, the students should be asked to
relate the case with other similar failures and analyse the common
points.
The case can be used in combination with other cases to understand
issues such as importance of social capital, marketing strategies,
especially the application of the four Ps.

Research Basis
The case has been formulated through a series of interviews and discussions with the entrepreneur and his eldest daughter after fixing appointments. The interviews were carried over a period of about three
months (September to November, 2007). The initial draft was made ready
in January 2008, after which it underwent revisions after discussions in
class settings and further discussion with the entrepreneur. However, the
entrepreneur did not want to divulge any financial information although
requests were made to him in this regard.
