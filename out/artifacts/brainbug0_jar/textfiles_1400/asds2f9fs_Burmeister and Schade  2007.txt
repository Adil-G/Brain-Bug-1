to status quo bias

Abstract
Entrepreneurship research has demonstrated that entrepreneurs are more susceptible to certain
cognitive biases than are selected other individuals. We investigate whether this finding holds for the
status quo bias not yet investigated in the entrepreneurship literature. The status quo bias is defined
as the tendency to select a previously chosen alternative disproportionately often. We compare
entrepreneurs’ decisions with those of students and bankers in an experimental study. We find that
entrepreneurs are as affected by the status quo as students but less affected than bankers. Accounting
for differences in experience and types of decision scenarios, we have indirect evidence for a
consistency of entrepreneurs’ decisions with what would be expected from a stereotypical
Schumpeterian entrepreneur: being more open to new options than other individuals are. However,
since entrepreneurs are frequently influenced by the status quo, we discuss the pros and cons of such
behavior.

1. Executive summary
Studies on decision making have repeatedly demonstrated that entrepreneurs make
extensive use of simplifying heuristics and thus often exhibit cognitive biases. Two of
these studies have shown that entrepreneurs are more affected by certain cognitive

biases than other individuals (Busenitz and Barney, 1997; Parlich and Bagby, 1995).
The findings are consistent with econometric studies demonstrating that entrepreneurship is an investment inferior to capital market investments if one only looks at
monetary revenues and risks (Moskowitz and Vissing-Jørgensen, 2002; Hamilton,
2000).
The objective of our study is to examine whether the empirical finding that
entrepreneurs are more biased than other individuals is generally valid. In fact, we
purposely look for counterevidence. Entrepreneurs are often associated with the
Schumpeterian innovator implying an openness to new options. Therefore, the wellknown status quo bias, i.e. an individual’s tendency to repeat a previous choice, is a
promising candidate to falsify the statement that entrepreneurs are more biased than
others.
In order to measure the strength of a status quo bias in entrepreneurs’ decision
making and to compare it with the behavior of non-entrepreneurs, we conducted two
experimental studies. Altogether, the comparison groups consisted of 427 students and
135 bankers specialized in start-up financing; 240 entrepreneurs participated in our
experiments. We controlled for differences in experience by confronting individuals
with both business and consumer contexts. In their decisions, participants had to
make decisions in scenarios such as buying a digital camera, purchasing an MP3
player, renting new office space, determining the margin in a tender offer, buying
business software, and deciding on which new market to enter. Different respondents
across all groups of individuals faced different versions of the above scenarios.
Whereas the basic features of the scenario descriptions were kept identical, different
options were presented as the status quo, except for the neutral version where no
status quo existed.
Regarding the different scenarios, a status quo bias was very frequently observed
across all groups in the tender scenario and with purchasing a digital camera. With the
remaining scenarios, the status quo bias was only observed sometimes. The overall
frequency of occurrence of the status quo bias is consistent with previous findings by
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988). However, the status quo bias appeared to be
stronger in consumer than business scenarios. Overall, entrepreneurs are as biased as
students but less biased than bankers.
Based on the literature on experience effects, we argue that more experience will
most probably lead to a higher susceptibility to the status quo bias because thoughts
may become increasingly channeled by past experience (Shepherd et al., 2003). Given
the significantly higher level of experience that entrepreneurs have compared to
bankers in business contexts in our samples, the dtieT between bankers and
entrepreneurs observed in our business scenarios seems to indicate a higher basic
affectedness by the status quo of bankers. This result is underlined by the decisions in
the consumer scenarios where differences in experience should not exist and bankers
are more biased than entrepreneurs. Thus, we have indirect evidence for the fact that
entrepreneurs have more similarities with the stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneur
than bankers.
Our findings imply that a general rule such as bentrepreneurs are more biased than
othersQ may not hold. Instead, our study generated evidence that group differences

<-----Page 2----->342

depend on the investigated bias. This opens the field for future research on differences
between entrepreneurs and others regarding the affectedness with all those cognitive
biases judged as important for decision situations typically faced by entrepreneurs.
Further studies may also want to more explicitly control for differences in experience
with business decisions by, e.g., comparing nascent entrepreneurs or those who just
started their business with non-experienced bankers. They should also compare
entrepreneurs’ affectedness in biases in different countries. Finally, entrepreneurship
researchers may want to analyze the empirical relevance of other characteristics that are
ascribed to the stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneur such as making decisions in
an intuitive manner.
The lessons to be learnt for entrepreneurs depend on the decision situation in
focus. With decisions where economic consequences do not differ much between the
options, keeping the status quo might not hurt much and could also be time-efficient.
On the contrary, even if this is sometimes difficult to accomplish, entrepreneurs
should try to steer against their tendency of keeping a status quo where changes in
competition or demand, new production technologies, product innovations, etc., are
concerned.

2. Introduction
bThe essence of the entrepreneur’s function lies in the identification and
implementation of new opportunities. . . . [For example, the] . . . production and
implementation of new products or new product qualities . . . [and the] . . .
development of new markets.Q1 Joseph Schumpeter (1928, p. 483).
According to Joseph Schumpeter (1928), entrepreneurs are revolutionary individuals
that are responsible for the implementation of innovations in our society. They are the
active element that combines present resources in a new manner; they have the abilities
to discover new opportunities and to break through routines. Many politicians,
researchers, and practitioners share this view of the entrepreneur. However, does it
reflect reality? In general, individuals are known to be strongly biased by the status
quo, but keeping or repeating previous decisions is a behavior not to be expected of a
stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneur. The research question that necessarily arises
is whether entrepreneurs are as susceptible to the status quo bias as other individuals.
If this were the case, such a tendency would hamper the speed of adopting innovations
by entrepreneurs. Answering this question is exciting because for those types of
simplifying heuristics and resulting cognitive biases that have been investigated in
entrepreneurship research,2 it has been demonstrated that entrepreneurs make extensive

A seminal analysis of heuristics was presented by Tversky and Kahneman (1974) where heuristics are defined
as simplifying rules of thumb leading to cognitive biases. Forbes (2005) defines cognitive biases as thought
processes that involve erroneous inferences or assumptions.

use of heuristics, and that they are heavily biased or more biased than others. We are
interested in whether this is a general tendency or whether the status quo bias is an
exception where entrepreneurs are less biased than others.
A number of studies from entrepreneurship research have direct relevance to our
work. Manimala (1992) demonstrated the extensive use of heuristics by entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs also have been shown to exhibit an overconfidence bias (Olson,
1986; Forbes, 2005; Koellinger et al., 2005) and to be overly optimistic about their
own chances of success (Cooper et al., 1988). Busenitz and Lau (1996) summarize
all types of cognitive biases exhibited by entrepreneurs as bentrepreneurial cognition.Q
A closely related stream of entrepreneurship research compares the behavior of
entrepreneurs and others (Kaish and Gilad, 1991; Parlich and Bagby, 1995; Busenitz
and Barney, 1997). Only two of these studies compare the affectedness by biases and
the use of heuristics. Parlich and Bagby (1995) use entrepreneurs and nonentrepreneurs such as bankers, managers, and venture capitalists as comparison
groups. They showed that entrepreneurs have the tendency to interpret equivocal
business scenarios more optimistically than others do. In their seminal study,
Busenitz and Barney (1997) demonstrated that entrepreneurs are more overconfident
and use the representativeness bias more frequently than do managers in large
organizations. While some heuristics and cognitive biases have been studied in the
entrepreneurship literature, we are not aware of any contribution concerning the
status quo bias.
Hence, our contribution may be summarized as follows. We fill a gap in the
entrepreneurship literature by conducting two experimental3 studies on the status quo
bias. The susceptibility to the status quo bias is compared between entrepreneurs,
students, and bankers. By comparing consumer with business scenarios, we
investigate whether scenario-specific factors play a role. The article is organized as
follows. The next section summarizes the literature on the status quo bias. In the
subsequent section, we describe the experimental design and the course of our two
studies. Thereafter, we statistically analyze the results of the experiments. We
continue with a discussion of our empirical findings and their implications for the
decision making of entrepreneurs. Our article concludes with a section on limitations
and future research.

3. Literature on the status quo bias
The status quo bias has received attention from economic psychology, marketing,
and public health literature. This bias describes a behavioral tendency to decide for a
status quo option disproportionately often (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). Instead
of considering all available information in the decision making process, people tend to

3
Our studies are experimental regarding the manipulations of the status quo bias. According to the
classification proposed by Campbell and Stanley (1963), however, our studies are also quasi-experimental
because individuals are not randomly assigned to groups but purposely selected based on their occupation.

<-----Page 4----->344

rely on what they have chosen before, on what represents the current state, or even
what someone else has chosen for them and consequently is the status quo. To our
knowledge, Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) were the first economists to use an
experimental setup in order to test students for a status quo bias occurring in a
variety of decision scenarios. They showed a significant status quo bias in 31 out of
54 cases.
The status quo bias is not an isolated phenomenon but related to other solid effects
known from behavioral economics: the endowment effect (Thaler, 1980) or the finding
that willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a good is systematically lower than willingness-toaccept (WTA) for the same good possessed by an individual (so-called WTP–WTA
disparity) (Kahneman et al., 1991). Status quo bias, endowment effect, and WTP–WTA
disparity are consistent with reference dependence together with loss aversion according to
prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991).
A status quo bias has been demonstrated in experiments as well as in field studies.
Porter and McIntyre (1984) found a status quo bias when investigating why pregnant
women prefer the care they receive compared to other methods of care. The researchers
argued that patients assume that whatever service was offered had been carefully
considered by experts and was therefore likely to be the best for them. In other words,
bwhat is must be best.Q In their paper, Porter and McIntyre (1984) conclude that such a
behavior results in aversion to innovations. Roca et al. (2005) recently demonstrated the
ubiquity and strength of the status quo bias in an experimental study. They showed that
the status quo bias might even reduce most individuals’ aversion to ambiguity when the
ambiguous option is the status quo.
Furthermore, when discussing the external validity of their experimental work,
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) report on real-market examples for status quo biased
decisions such as those on health plans and retirement funds. Hartman et al. (1991) studied
the decision behavior of electric power consumers and found them to be status quo biased.
Johnson et al. (1993) experimentally supported the expected influence of status quo
manipulations on the choice of an insurance policy. They also report on an interesting
blegislative framing manipulationQ that took place with automobile insurance in the two
U.S. states New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The choice of an insurance policy appeared to
be heavily dependent on what used to be the legislative status quo, even after the law was
changed. A status quo bias is also observed with organ donation. Here, the legislative
conditions in a country are crucial for the willingness to donate. The willingness is low
when individuals need to agree with organ donation explicitly (this is the case in the U.S.,
Germany, Japan, etc.) and it is high when individuals need to refuse the donation of their
organs contrary to the legislative default (such legislation is existing in Italy, Austria,
Poland, etc.). Given all this evidence, Kahneman et al. (1991, p. 25) state that b(. . .) we
have become convinced that (. . .) status quo bias (. . .) [is] both robust and important.Q4
4
In Burmeister and Schade (2005), we argue that there are two conflicting forces resulting in behavioral effects
on one dimension. These are the following two disproportional tendencies to deviate from or keep a previous
decision: variety seeking and status quo bias. However, for decision scenarios invoking a rather cognitive decision
process, we expect and find a dominance of the status quo bias. We consider the decisions underlying our current
contribution as cognitive and therefore appropriate for a test of a status quo bias.

4. Experimental design
In order to measure the strength of the status quo bias in entrepreneurs’
and others’ decisions, we conducted two experimental studies that are jointly
analyzed below. In the first study, we analyzed differences between entrepreneurs’ decisions and students’ decisions. The student respondents stem from the
fields of business and economics as well as the humanities and social sciences.
Taking into account that different decision behaviors may result from differences in experience and knowledge, we conducted a second study. In this
study, we investigated bankers responsible for start-up financing and entrepreneurs, since both groups of individuals should have similar experiences and
knowledge. In our samples, however, with a mean of approximately 22 years,
entrepreneurs had on average more job experience than bankers did (17 years).
This difference is statistically significant (Mann–Whitney Test: p b .01). We refer
to the different subject pools as groups. When analyzing gender differences
within the group of entrepreneurs, male and female entrepreneurs are referred to
as subgroups.
In study 1, the status quo bias was investigated in six decision scenarios
(buying a digital camera, purchasing an MP3 player, renting new office space,
determining the margin in a tender offer, buying business software, and deciding
on which new market to enter). To reduce the time needed to answer the questionnaire, only three scenarios (determining the margin in a tender offer, buying a digital camera, and deciding on which new market to enter) were used in
study 2.
With each scenario, the status quo was experimentally manipulated via a
between-subject design. Different respondents across all groups of individuals faced
different versions of the scenarios, i.e., experimental treatments. With each
scenario, in the neutral treatments individuals had to choose from three options,
ball on an equal footingQ (Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). In the three status
quo treatments for each scenario, each option occupied the position of the status
quo once. The basic features of a scenario were kept identical across all treatments. After randomly receiving a neutral or one of the three status quo
treatments, each individual made one choice per scenario. No individual dealt
with different treatments from the same scenario. In other words, we tested four
different treatments of a decision scenario between subjects: three status quo
treatments and one neutral, each assigning a different option or none to the status
quo position.
Across the four treatments of a decision scenario, a particular option occupied three
possible positions: as a neutral (NEUT) option (in one treatment), as the status quo (SQ)
option (in one treatment), or as an alternative to the status quo (ASQ) option (in two
treatments). With our experimental design, we followed the lead of the work of
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988). An example for a neutral and one of the status quo
treatments can be found below for the tender offer scenario. For other scenarios, the
respective neutral treatment and one example of a status quo treatment are included in
Appendix B.

Determining the margin in a tender offer (neutral version)
An international research center has presented the contract for setting up its technical
equipment for tender. As an entrepreneur, you would like to take part in the
tendering procedure. Therefore, you would like to hand in an offer. The committee
responsible for awarding the contracts will favor the company with the most
attractive offer. Completing the order (if you get it) will cost your company 100,000
EUR. You are aware that there are numerous competitors who will hand in offers for
the same project. From your experiences with other tendering procedures you can
derive probabilities for you to be awarded the contract. Which offer are you going to
make?
5 You submit a proposal at a price of 115,000 EUR. The chances that you will be
awarded the contract are around 70%.
5 You submit a proposal at a price of 120,000 EUR. The chances that you will be
awarded the contract are around 60%.
5 You submit a proposal at a price of 125,000 EUR. The chances that you will be
awarded the contract are around 50%.
The treatment where 115,000 EUR was the status quo, differs from the neutral
treatment by the sentence printed in bold fonts. Note that this sentence was not printed in
bold fonts in the original scenario description.
Determining the margin in a tender offer (status quo treatment: 15%)
An international research center has presented the contract for setting up its
technical equipment for tender. As an entrepreneur, you would like to take part in
the tendering procedure. Therefore, you would like to hand in an offer. The
committee responsible for awarding the contracts will favor the company with the
most attractive offer. Completing the order (if you get it) will cost your company
100,000 EUR. You are aware that there are numerous competitors who will hand in
offers for this same project. From your experiences with other tendering procedures
you can derive probabilities for you to be awarded the contract. For former offers
you always calculated a margin of 15 % above your cost. Which offer will you
make?
5 You submit a proposal at a price of 115,000 EUR. The chances that you will be
awarded the contract are around 70%.
5 You submit a proposal at a price of 120,000 EUR. The chances that you will be
awarded the contract are around 60%.
5 You submit a proposal at a price of 125,000 EUR. The chances that you will be
awarded the contract are around 50%.
Altogether, we employed a 4  6 experimental design, with four indicating the number
of between–subjects treatments and six representing the number of within–subjects

instead of six decision scenarios. Table 1 depicts our experimental design and the
respective number of usable responses (non-usable responses are referred to as missing

5. Results
5.1. Sample and overview
We compare the behavior of three groups of individuals: 427 students, 240
entrepreneurs (124 from study 1 and 116 from study 2), and 135 bankers. The student
sample consists of 297 business and economics students attending an undergraduate
marketing course and 130 students in a basic statistical methods course obligatory for
students of the humanities and social sciences. All students attended courses at HumboldtUniversität zu Berlin. Entrepreneurs are located in all parts of Germany but with a local
focus on the region Berlin/Brandenburg. They stem from a variety of industries such as
medicine, biotechnology, and business services. Bank employees are specialized in
entrepreneurial finance and all banks are located in Berlin. To accommodate
entrepreneurs’ and bankers’ busy time schedule, they were allowed to answer our
questionnaire in their preferred manner (personal interview, via email, or via fax).
Although we conducted the two studies sequentially, we analyze and present the results
jointly. We merged the data for the three scenarios that were included in both studies
(digital camera, tender offer, and market entry).
The presentation of the findings is structured in the following way: First, basic
distribution information is provided and analyzed via Chi-squared statistics. Second, we
compare the affectedness of different groups by the status quo bias with different choices
via binary logistic regressions including interaction effects. Finally, we use the aggregated

distribution information to calculate ANOVAs for main effects and interaction effects over
all groups and scenarios.
5.2. Basic frequencies
To verify a status quo bias, we compare the frequency of choice of a status quo
option with (1) the frequency of choice of this option in the neutral version (NEUT) and
(2) with the option’s frequency when it is an alternative to the status quo (ASQ).
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) only used the second comparison. We complement
their procedure with the first. Since for each option, two comparisons are carried out
(SQ vs. ASQ and SQ vs. NEUT) and individuals faced three options for each decision
scenario, this procedure results in six Pearson’s Chi-squared values for each decision
scenario. The one-sided significance levels5 indicate whether an option’s relative
frequency is higher when it is the status quo option rather than (1) appearing in the
neutral treatment (first Chi-squared measure) or (2) when it is an alternative to the status
quo (second Chi-squared measure).
Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the frequencies and asymptotic significance levels of the Chisquared statistics for students, entrepreneurs, and bankers. Tables for the subgroups of
female and male entrepreneurs can be found in Appendix A. In Table 2, the relative
frequencies for the students are presented. For example, the option b115,000 EURQ in the

A one-sided test is appropriate since the hypothesis is directional: An option is selected more frequently if it is
the status quo. The few differences with a reversed direction are tested two-sided.

tender scenario is chosen by 65% of the students when it is the status quo option. In the
neutral version of this scenario, the option is only chosen by 60% of the respondents.
Although the relative frequency in the neutral treatment is lower than in the status quo
treatment, the difference is not statistically significant ( p = .25). However, when
comparing the relative frequency that b115,000 EURQ will be chosen between the
treatment where b115,000 EURQ is the status quo and the treatments where it is an
alternative to the status quo (42%), the difference becomes significant ( p b .01).
The significance levels for the differences between SQ and ASQ frequencies are
reported in Tables 2, 3 and 4. With six scenarios and three options in each, we look at

18 comparisons for the students and entrepreneurs. With three scenarios and three
options in each, we carry out 9 comparisons for bankers and the two subgroups of male
and female entrepreneurs.6 We find that students are significantly biased toward the status
quo in 10 out of 18 cases. Entrepreneurs also exhibit a status quo bias in 10 out of 18
cases. Similarly, bankers fall prey to this bias in 4 out of 9 cases. Analyzing male and
female entrepreneurs separately (see Tables A1 and A2 in Appendix A), we find that males
are more biased toward the status quo (6 out of 9 cases) than their female peers (2 out of 9
cases). The significance levels for the comparisons between SQ and NEUT frequencies
can be found in the last column of Tables 2, 3 and 4 as well as in Tables A1 and A2 in
Appendix A, respectively. The SQ-NEUT comparisons exhibit the same basic structure of
findings as the SQ-ASQ comparisons. However, for entrepreneurs, students, and the
subgroup of male entrepreneurs, less differences are significant, for bankers and female
entrepreneurs the number of significant differences is the same.
5.3. Pairwise group comparisons
The separate analysis of status quo effects with different scenarios, options, and groups
provided detailed information on the degree of affectedness of different groups in different
scenarios and also on the ubiquity of the status quo bias. However, an answer to the
research question whether entrepreneurs are more biased than others requires a look at
interaction effects between group and treatment in logistic regressions.
For each scenario and option, we therefore compare the affectedness of (sub-)groups by
the status quo pairwise, i.e., entrepreneurs vs. students, entrepreneurs vs. bankers, and
male entrepreneurs vs. female entrepreneurs. For each comparison, we carried out a binary
logistic regression. We concentrate on the SQ-ASQ comparison, leaving out subjects in the
NEUT treatment since the SQ-ASQ results appeared to be stronger and easier to interpret
than the SQ-NEUT comparisons. Specifically, we defined for each individual choice
whether it was the bstatus quo optionQ or one of the bother optionsQ. This forms the binary
dependent variable in the regression model. Group, treatment, and interaction between
group and treatment enter the model as independent variables. The interaction effect is
decisive for the group comparisons aimed at in this article. Since we are interested in
comparing the decisions of entrepreneurs with the behavior of students and of bankers, we
disregard the comparison between students and bankers.
For each scenario, Table 5 displays the exponential regression parameters for the main effect
of the treatment variable, the interaction effect between treatment and group, and the
corresponding significance levels.7 For example, for the first tender offer analysis, an
exponential coefficient of 3.28 for the main effect of the treatment implies that students
and entrepreneurs decide for the b115,000 EURQ option 3.28 times more often than for
b120,000 EURQ or b125,000 EURQ when b115,000 EURQ is the status quo. Please be
reminded that respondents in the NEUT treatment are excluded. The parameter 3.28 is
highly significant ( p b .01). The cell below shows the more important regression parameter
6

Concentrating on three scenarios enabled us to compare male and female entrepreneurs based on both studies.
Although the group variable entered the analysis as a main effect, the results are not important for our research
question and thus not reported. This information is available from the authors upon request.

Analysis of variance with difference between aggregated relative frequency of SQ and ASQ as dependent and

of the interaction effect. An exponential coefficient of .79 implies that students chose
b115,000 EURQ relatively less frequently than entrepreneurs when b115,000 EURQ rather
than b120,000 EURQ or b125,000 EURQ is the status quo. This means that entrepreneurs
exhibit a stronger status quo bias, here. However, the subtle difference in groups’
affectedness is not large enough; in this case the interaction effect between group and
treatment is not significant ( p = .56).
According to Table 5, the main effects of the treatment variables confirm the results
from the frequency distributions in Section 5.2 and confirms the ubiquity of the status quo
bias. Table 5 reports on seven statistically significant interaction parameters but only the
comparison between entrepreneurs and bankers delivers a consistent picture. With the
digital camera scenario, all three significant cases demonstrate that entrepreneurs are less
status quo biased than bankers: The significant exponential interaction parameters are all
smaller than one. Comparing students with entrepreneurs results in two significant
interaction parameters, however, that point in two different directions. The same occurs
when comparing male and female entrepreneurs. Hence, no clear differences in
affectedness by the status quo can be derived from the latter two comparisons.
5.4. Aggregate analyses
The statistical analyses that are reported in the two previous subsections (Sections 5.2
and 5.3) provided information separately for scenarios and options. To get information on
the overall affectedness of the different groups of individuals, we also carried out an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the aggregated distribution data. This procedure
measures the influence of the two factors: group and scenario, on a (now) metricdependent variable. Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) have used a similar procedure.
However, unlike these authors, we define the dependent variable as the difference between
the frequency of an option when it is the status quo and when it is an alternative to the
status quo (SQ-ASQ; we leave out choices in the neutral treatments).8 Table 6 shows the
8
Using the difference between the SQ and NEUT frequencies of an option as the dependent variable in an
ANOVA did not lead to any straightforward findings. Therefore they will not be dealt with in this article but are
available from the authors upon request.

Bonferroni’s post-hoc test for the ANOVA reported in Table 6 (controlling for multiple pairwise comparisons).

total affectedness by the status quo of entrepreneurs, students, and bankers based on an
ANOVA with groups and scenarios as independent variables. The analysis of variance
(ANOVA) confirms a significant scenario effect ( p b .01) and a significant interaction
effect between group and scenario ( p b .01). The interaction effect indicates that groups
are affected by the status quo to a different extent in different scenarios. The main
effect indicates that the relative affectedness differs between scenarios. With .69, the
corrected R 2 value is very high.9 Bonferroni’s post-hoc tests verify the significance of
pairwise group comparisons regarding the affectedness by the status quo.10 Table 7
reports on group differences based on status quo effects in all scenarios and basically
confirms the tendencies from the two previous analyses. Whereas students do not differ
from the other groups, entrepreneurs are less affected by the status quo than bankers
( p = .05).
Analyzing consumer decisions separately, both main effects, scenario ( p = .03) and
group ( p = .04), become significant. The post-hoc test reveals that entrepreneurs differ
from bankers ( p b .01). Again, bankers exhibit a stronger status quo bias than
entrepreneurs.11 Considering only business decisions, the main effect of the scenario
variable ( p = .01) and the interaction effect between scenario and group ( p = .04) are
statistically significant. The latter indicates the large difference of relative affectedness by
status quo effects of different groups in different scenarios. However, there is no
statistically significant general difference in affectedness between groups.
Comparing the affectedness by the status quo between male and female
entrepreneurs for all those scenarios where we have data from studies 1 and 2
(tender, digital camera, and market entry), we find that the interaction effect between
group and scenario becomes statistically significant ( p = .02). However, there is no
general difference in the affectedness by the status quo between male and female
entrepreneurs.

The large R 2 value partially results from the aggregation of data eliminating errors and idiosyncrasies in
individuals’ decision making.
10
The Bonferroni test is a post-hoc test that corrects for multiple pairwise comparisons.
11
Also, the difference between bankers and students is statistically significant ( p = .01). Bankers are more
biased than students.

6. Discussion and implications
Entrepreneurs are less biased toward the status quo than bankers and they do not
differ significantly from students. A separate look at business and consumer scenarios
reveals that the difference between entrepreneurs and bankers stems from decisions in
the consumer scenarios. How can these findings be interpreted and what are the answers
to our two research questions on the general affectedness of entrepreneurs by biases and
the similarities of entrepreneurs with stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneurs?
The key to interpreting our findings are the effects of experience. According to
Shepherd et al.’s (2003) study and extensive literature overview, bexperience is a twoedged swordQ (p. 382). More specifically and expanding on Shepherd et al.’s (2003)
argument, one should discriminate between two opposed effects of experience. The
obvious effect of experience is increased knowledge. An individual accumulates
knowledge via repeated decision making in related contexts and develops a field of
expertise. The other effect of experience is described by Shepherd et al. (2003, p. 383) in
the following way: Experienced individuals’ bthoughts may tend to become increasingly
channeled by their past experience.Q This tendency would imply that the more experienced
a decision maker is, the more influenced she is by the status quo.
From our perspective, the effect of experience on the status quo bias is unidirectional.
When the status quo bias is defined and investigated in the standard setup as in Samuelson
and Zeckhauser’s (1988) and in our study, there is no room for a systematic effect of
increased knowledge. Contrary to the decision scenarios analyzed by Shepherd et al.
(2003) where knowledge is central for the measured performance of venture capitalists,
choices of certain options may not be ranked according to performance in any of our
scenarios. Since there is no dbetterT or dworseT due to more or less knowledge, choices
only reflect individuals’ preferences. But if experience has a channeling effect on
thoughts, the decision makers’ flexibility may drop and the resulting variability of choices
should narrow down. Hence, experience should increase individuals’ susceptibility to the
status quo bias.
Given the above thoughts and the observed differences in job experience between
entrepreneurs and bankers (In our sample, entrepreneurs had more job experience on
average than bankers), the fact that bankers are as biased as entrepreneurs in the business
scenarios can be interpreted in favor of the existence of a Schumpeterian entrepreneur. In
other words, if entrepreneurs were as dinexperiencedT as bankers, the affectedness by the
status quo bias may have been smaller with entrepreneurs. This argument is underlined by
the results in the consumer scenarios. These scenarios were added to the experimental
design to eliminate potential effects of differences in job experience. In the consumer
scenarios, the bankers were significantly more affected by the status quo than
entrepreneurs. Hence, we have evidence that entrepreneurs are generally less affected
by the status quo than bankers, i.e., entrepreneurs are more dSchumpeterianT. The fact that
entrepreneurs are only as biased as students, the latter probably being less or at most
equally experienced in all kinds of analyzed decisions (perhaps with the exception of the
MP3 player more used among students than entrepreneurs and bankers), strengthens this
interpretation. Finally, our findings definitely do not support a general rule such as
bentrepreneurs are more biased than others.Q

Entrepreneurs are not more biased than students and bankers, but many of their choices
are still heavily affected by the status quo. What can entrepreneurs learn from this? Is this
dgoodT or dbadT? Are they supposed to steer against the status quo bias – assuming that this
is always feasible – and if yes, in all or only in selected situations? The answer depends on
how they judge the pros and cons discussed in the following. We start with general
thoughts on heuristics, we will then consider general pros and cons of the use of heuristics
in entrepreneurs’ decision making, and we continue with a discussion of specific
advantages and disadvantages of dperpetuating the existingT – a figural description of a
hypothetical heuristic that would lead to a status quo bias.12
Individuals use simple heuristics or rules of thumb that are typically adapted to their
environment (e.g. Kleinmuntz, 1985; Simon, 1990; Gigerenzer and Goldstein, 1996;
Goldstein and Gigerenzer, 1999; Todd, 1999; Dudey and Todd, 2001; Lévesque and
Schade, 2005). Dudey and Todd (2001) refer to so-called ecological rationality as the
bdecision mechanisms that are matched (that is, adapted) to the particular structure of
information in the environments in which they are appliedQ (p. 197). These researchers
demonstrate that heuristics can be quite useful, given the bounded rationality of real
decision makers. Heuristics typically require little information and minimal cognitive
effort. This view on heuristics is in contrast with Tversky and Kahneman (1974) who
rather concentrate on the mistakes individuals make when applying simple heuristics.
Forbes’ (2005) analysis of the use of heuristic and biases is in line with the ecological
rationality hypothesis outlined above. According to Forbes (2005), entrepreneurs use
heuristics and biases as a response to certain environmental conditions that are associated
with forming a venture such as information overload, high uncertainty, and high time
pressure. In their study on entrepreneurs’ and managers’ decision making, Busenitz and
Barney (1997, p. 12) also argue that the use of heuristics can lead bto acceptable solutions to
problems for individuals in an effective and efficient manner.Q However, in a similar way as
Tversky and Kahneman (1974) argue for the use of heuristics in general, researchers in
entrepreneurship and management also acknowledge that cognitive biases may result in less
rational and thus less comprehensive decision making (Barnes, 1984). According to Smith et
al. (1988), such a less comprehensive decision making lowers a venture’s performance.
Given this controversial perspective on heuristics and biases, what are the specific
advantages and disadvantages of decisions that dperpetuate the existingT and imply a status
quo bias? Sometimes, keeping the status quo may be the key to success for an entrepreneur.
An example is an individual who buys and manages an old winery and keeps the old
fashioned but high-quality production method for red wine. Maintaining the status quo can
result in significant time savings; time that would otherwise be needed for the decision
process, e.g., for searching information on new options. This tradeoff may be acceptable for
less important decisions – where the economic consequences of different options do not
differ much. For risk-averse decision makers, keeping the status quo may also be
12
To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no explicit description of heuristics leading to a status quo
bias in the literature. Reference dependence together with loss aversion according to prospect theory (Kahneman
and Tversky, 1979) may lead, for instance, to a status quo bias but may not be considered a straightforward
heuristic. On the other hand, loss aversion causes many kinds of biases such as extremeness aversion (Simonson
and Tversky, 1992; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991) or the endowment effect (Thaler, 1980).

advantageous if uncertainty about the potential gains and losses associated with the nonstatus quo options is substantial. Disadvantages of keeping the status quo are foregoing
potential benefits to change. Examples comprise no reaction – in terms of strategy
adjustments – to changes in competition and demand structure, not adopting a new
production technology, not firing an old employee and hiring a new, not starting a business
relationship with a new supplier, and not eliminating an old product and introducing a new
one.

7. Limitations and future research
A potential limitation of this study is that the experiment was about hypothetical
decisions, i.e., the decisions had no (monetary) consequences. In the terminology of
experimental economics (e.g., Smith, 1976), our experiment was not incentive compatible.
Four aspects were relevant for our decision against an incentive-compatible experiment: (1)
Incentive-compatible experimentation may be viewed as more or less important, depending
on the type of research question (Schade, 2005). An example for a set of research questions
where incentive-compatible experimentation is especially important is strategic interaction
(competition, coordination, etc.). However, in the simple selection tasks that respondents
faced in our study, we felt that incentive compatibility would not have changed much. (2) If
non-student decision makers are to be investigated in an experimental study such as
entrepreneurs and bankers, the small monetary incentives an experimenter can afford are
typically not exciting enough for these individuals. A hypothetical decision may then
sometimes be taken more seriously. (3) Our study replicated and modified the study of
Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) with the intention to be close enough to be comparable.
These authors also conducted non-incentive-compatible questionnaire experiments. (4) We
wanted to deal with realistic decision scenarios. All our scenarios are difficult to implement
in an incentive-compatible experiment. Even so, incentive-compatible experimentation on
the status quo bias is a promising avenue for future research that, however, involves the
following two main challenges: (a) overcoming the difficulties of implementing such
experiments with non-student samples and (b) manipulating the status quo with real objects
or within real business decisions.
Whereas previous studies have shown that entrepreneurs are more biased than others
are, i.e., for overconfidence, overoptimism, and representativeness biases, our study has
demonstrated the contrary for the status quo bias. Hence, group differences seem to be
dependent of the bias in focus. The respective previous studies as well as ours led to
knowledge about specific biases. In future research, comparisons between groups of
individuals have to be carried out systematically for each cognitive bias judged as being of
sufficient importance for entrepreneurship.
Another limitation of many previous as well as the current study is that the effect of
individuals’ experience on affectedness by biases has not systematically been studied.
Future experiments may thus want to control more explicitly differences in experience
with business decisions by, e.g., comparing start-up entrepreneurs without prior job
experience with non-experienced bankers as well as with experienced entrepreneurs and
experienced bankers.

Our study only analyzed one plausible characteristic of the decision making of a
stereotypical Schumpeterian entrepreneur, openness to new options. Other characteristics
of decision making consistent with the picture of the Schumpeterian entrepreneur such as
reluctance to invest too much cognitive effort into a highly rational decision should be
analyzed and compared between different groups of individuals in future research.
Our findings are based on a sample of German entrepreneurs, bankers, and students.
Although we feel that the basic comparisons would also hold with, e.g., the respective U.S.
groups, the relevance of country differences may not be underestimated. The Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) data reveal striking country differences not only in the
general level of entrepreneurial activity but also regarding the level of the drivers of
entrepreneurial motivation such as overconfidence (Koellinger et al., 2005). A natural step
to extend studies of the latter type and to, at the same time, build up on the approach
suggested in our current contribution is to design and carry out cross-country experimental
comparisons of entrepreneurs’ and others’ decision making.

B.7. Business software (neutral treatment)
Imagine yourself being the owner and manager of Berlin Ltd. which has a market share
of 10% with its innovative product. Since Berlin Ltd is not able to meet all the demand for
this innovative product, and because it is difficult to quickly acquire more personnel, you
have decided to optimize the company’s internal workflows. Therefore, you need a
business software solution. After some market research you consider three software
solutions. Switching from your old software to any of the new solutions implies switching
costs which are the same for all three solutions: A, B and C. Which of the following
software packages would you purchase?
5 You decide in favor of software A. It is relatively expensive but very flexible and will
also meet future requirements.
5 You decide in favor of software B. It has a medium price and wholly meets all present
requirements.
5 You decide in favor of software C. It has a relatively low price and meets most present
requirements but with a few acceptable flaws.
B.8. Business software (SQ treatment: Software B)
Imagine yourself being the owner and manager of Berlin Ltd. which has a market share
of 10% with its innovative product. Since Berlin Ltd is not able to meet all the demand for
this innovative product, and because it is difficult to quickly acquire more personnel, you
have decided to optimize the company’s internal workflows. Therefore, you need a
business software solution. After some market research you consider three software
solutions. Your company is currently using an older version of software package B, which
does not comply with the present requirements anymore. Switching from your old
software to any of the new solutions implies switching costs which are the same for three
all solutions: A, B, and C. Which of the following software packages would you purchase?
5 You decide in favor of software A. It is relatively expensive but very flexible and will
also meet future requirements.
5 You decide in favor of software B. It has a medium price and wholly meets all present
requirements.
