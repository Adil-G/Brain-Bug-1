Principal–Agent Relationship

The principal–agent problem is often illustrated by the relationship between owners and
managers in modern corporations. Our experimental study considers the problem where the
owner has to motivate the manager by an employment contract serving the owner’s interest.
The contract specifies a salary and a share of the firm’s profit which depends on the
manager’s effort and stochastic market events. The owner can only infer the firm’s
profitability from the dividend payments. The owner may terminate or change the incentive
contract in later periods. The experiment relies on a parameter specification for which risk
neutral participants would cooperate efficiently, i.e. the owner should design a contract
rendering full effort as optimal. However, we observe contracts for which full effort is not
optimal and effort choices which are not optimal. We observe trust and reciprocity as
important features of behavior which evolve over a multiperiod principal – agent relationship,
but do not carry over to the next game with a new partner. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION
The standard example of a principal – agent problem is the separation of ownership and control in
modern corporations. A large literature on managerial capitalism has been concerned with that
issue.1 It is argued that managers in corporations
with highly dispersed ownership have more discretion in pursuing their own interest even if it
conflicts with that of the owners. In this situation,
incentive contracts can be designed by the owners
to motivate managers appropriately.2 Empirical
studies show that financial incentives are the dominant element in management contracts.3 Although agency theory suggests to relate incentive
pay to firm performance or owners’ wealth, there
is no agreement among empirical studies about
the pay-performance relationship. This leads
Jensen and Murphy (1990) to the conclusion that
‘. . . the lack of strong pay-for-performance incentives for CEOs (chief executive officers) indicated
by our evidence is puzzling’.4

Experimental studies may help to solve this
puzzle.5 In our experiment participants are confronted with a dynamic principal–agent situation.
It exhibits features of realistic principal–agent
problems like multiple periods, stochastic outcomes, imperfect monitoring, contract design, linear reward schemes and downward rigidity of
work contracts. Furthermore, the principal decides on how long the partnership lasts and the
agent knows more about the state of the enterprise than the principal.
The game has multiple equilibria, but we will
nevertheless outline a benchmark solution. We
will compare the experimental behavior with this
solution, since this gives us some guidance for
evaluating results. However, the experiment is not
designed as a test of game theory. Our main
motivation is to provide empirical facts showing
how financial incentives, exclusively considered by
most (normative) theoretical studies of principal–
agent problems, have to compete with intrinsic
motivations, both of the principal and his agent,
as well as with social norms. We will see that the
players’ trust and reciprocity may be even more
important than relying on incentive compatibility.

That trust and reciprocity are important behavioral patterns under certain circumstances was
also found in a related experimental study by
Fehr et al. (1997). In this experiment principals
simultaneously offer employment contracts, for at
most one worker, specifying a wage, a required
effort level and a fine which has to be paid if the
agent is found (by chance) to be shirking, i.e. not
meeting the required effort level. In a stochastically determined order workers can select a contract where there are fewer firms than workers.
The worker then chooses his effort level which,
finally, is monitored randomly.6
In our present study pairs of players interacted
for several periods before they were matched with
new partners. This allows for reputation formation and in some sense for building up a corporate
identity. Furthermore, the principal has almost no
direct means to monitor the agent. Thus, our
study sheds light on the dynamics of trust and
reciprocity within relationships and across relationships, which was not investigated by Fehr et
al. (1997). The impact of reciprocity on behavior
in principal–agent games is also investigated by
Fehr and Gächter (1997), who focus on the difference between one-sided and two-sided reciprocity.
Although our experimental game can be varied
by changing parameters like the stochastic production function, the cost function of the agent
and the time horizon, in this study we varied only
the initial value of the firm which is known to the
agent but not to the principal. By distinguishing a
high and a low value, where the a priori probabilities are common knowledge, the agent with the
high value has the opportunity to hide low efforts.
Furthermore, principal and agent have conflicting
interests in the firm’s value. While the principal
wants to preserve it, since he receives its final
value when the game ends, the agent wants to use
it for dividend payments, in case he participates in
these payments via a profit share.
In the section ‘Experimental Design’ we describe the experiment in detail. Some behavioral
hypotheses are discussed in the section ‘Trust and
Reciprocity’. The section ‘Game Theoretical
Analysis’ presents the theoretical results for the
case in which both parties are guided only by
monetary incentives and are risk neutral. In the
section ‘The Raw Data and Some Stylized Facts’
we present the raw data and some stylized facts,

and in the section ‘Analysis of Effort Decisions’
we analyse the agents’ effort decisions in detail.
The last section contains a summary.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The participants were divided into two groups of
players and seated in two separate lecture halls:
rooms A and B. Each B(oss) player took the role
of the principal within a principal–agent game
and was paired with an A(gent) player. After
being seated participants received a letter of welcome which also assigned them their code number. Then we distributed written instructions7
which informed both players about the rules of
the game and that they would interact for at most
six periods t= 1, 2, . . . , 6.
In period 1 player B, the principal, has to
decide about the linear payment scheme (F1, 61),
the work contract he is offering to player A, the
agent. The component F1 (in general, Ft ) is a fixed
wage which A receives in period 1 (period t). It
does not depend at all on what happens in t. The
component 61 (6t ) is a profit share (a share by
which player B participates in the dividend payment Pt in t). In t= 1 player B must offer at least
one contract (F1, 61) with 05 F1 5 4 and

and can offer at most three contracts of which
one has to be accepted by player A. In later
periods B can increase Ft and/or 6t, but he cannot
reduce either one. Thus, in all periods (Ft, 6t ) must
satisfy the following restrictions:
0 5 Ft 5 4Ft ] Ft − 1
and

When A decides which work contract to accept
he does not know yet the initial value of the firm
(W1). However, it is commonly known that W1 is
low (W1 = 3) or high (W1 = 12) with probability
1/2 respectively.8 After A’s choice among the offered work contracts, he (but not player B) gets to
know the actual value of W1.
A now chooses his effort level at {0, 1, 2, 3}
which causes cost

on A’s side.9 Then the current market state at is
determined randomly — with at  {1, 2, 3} and
probability {at }= 1/3, respectively. The result of
the chance move is only disclosed to A. Player A’s
chosen effort together with the stochastic market
state determine the firm’s return Et with Et =atat.
The firm’s profit in t is Gt =Et −Ft. Finally, A
decides about the dividend payment (Pt ). In all
periods Pt must satisfy the following restrictions:
05Pt 5 Wt + Gt if Wt +Gt \0
and
Pt = 0 otherwise,
where Wt is the firm value at the beginning of t
with W1 determined as above and
Wt = Wt − 1 + Gt − 1 −Pt − 1

Öt \ 1.

Thus, the agent is free to choose anything between no dividend payment at all or, at the other
extreme, running down the firm value all at once.
The firm value can actually become negative since
Gt can be negative in the case of a positive fixed
wage. But, nonetheless the game continues in such
a case. More importantly, notice that player B
neither observes the initial firm value, A’s effort
nor the market state. He only observes Pt and in
general this allows only imperfect inferences
about Wt as well as at.
At the end of each period both players can
compute their period t incomes which are A
t =
Ft +6tPt − K(at ) for player A and Bt =(1 −6t )Pt
for player B. At the beginning of the next period
(t + 1) player B decides whether or not to increase
the fixed wage or the profit share or both. Either
way player A has to take (Ft + 1, 6t + 1) as it is. He
chooses his effort at + 1 and the game proceeds in
the manner described above. Finally, there is a
termination rule which allows player B, at the
start of periods 4, 5, and 6, to end the game. If he
doesn’t terminate the game it ends after period 6,
i.e. at the beginning of period 7.
Player A’s total income is the sum of his period
incomes. Player B gets in addition to the sum of
his period incomes the end value (liquidation
value) of the firm. This is W7 if the game ends
after period 6 or W4, W5, or W6 otherwise. This
completes the description of the game.
Subjects played the game twice against changing opponents, but keeping their role. We had 64

participants who were students of economics or
business administration (undergraduates and
graduates). Thus, we collected 32 plays (one for
each principal–agent pair) on each trial. Four
subjects, two principals and two agents, formed a
matching group, i.e. in the repetition they were
cross-matched within their respective group.
Thus, the 32 observations of the second trial are
not independent. Part of the statistical analysis
below will therefore be based on the 16 matching
groups.
All monetary values were denoted in so-called
‘ECU’ (Experimental Currency Unit). The value
of one ECU was 0.50 DM in game 1 and 1.00
DM in game 2. The experiment took about 3 h.
Average earnings per subject were about 24.50
DM, about US$16 at the time of the experiment
(June 1995) for the two games and included a 5.00
DM show-up fee. In the case of efficient game
playing the expected average earnings were 48.50
DM per subject, which is also the outcome according to the game theoretic solution (see below). While mean payments per hour were
relatively low, they were substantially different
between subjects ranging from about 3.10 DM up
to 48.60 DM. Given this and the potential gains
in case of efficient (equilibrium) play, we consider
payment as salient.
After reading the instructions to the game, subjects had to fill out a short questionnaire10 which
asked for a few personal characteristics (such as
nationality, sex, and student year) and, more importantly, contained some control questions to
check whether subjects understood the rules of the
game.

TRUST AND RECIPROCITY
In economics one traditionally assumes rationality
and material objectives of the interacting parties.
In our experiment all material aspects are captured by monetary incentives. Some implications
of rationality based on these monetary incentives
will be derived in the next section. Before doing so
we want to develop two alternative motives that
may guide subjects’ behavior: ‘trust’ and ‘reciprocity’. Both may generate behavior that is
inconsistent with the implications of rationality
and purely monetary motivation.
As demonstrated rather generally by ultimatum
bargaining experiments (see, for a survey, Roth,
Manage. Decis. Econ. 19: 327–341 (1998)

<-----Page 3----->330

W. GU8 TH ET AL.

1995), and more specifically by studies of employment relationship (see Fehr et al., 1997), human
decision makers are inclined to respond in kind.
They will invest considerable amounts of money
in order to punish behavior that may be termed
‘greedy’, or they reward favorable acts.11 For the
experiment at hand this could occur when a generous contract, offered by the principal, is rewarded by the agent via a considerable work
effort.
Responding in kind has been phrased ‘reciprocity’ (see Young, 1986, for an early reference).
Reciprocity as such means that someone’s behavior is reciprocated later on by somebody else. So,
reciprocity typically relies on sequential interactive decision processes.12 Usually there is a party
moving second which can be said ‘to reciprocate’
by responding in kind. On the other hand, the
party moving first can be said ‘to trust’ in the
other’s reciprocity, when choosing an action that
makes sense only when it is reciprocated. An
illustrative example for trust and reciprocity is the
experiment by Berg et al. (1995), which, however,
offers extremely high incentives for cooperation
(the invested amount is tripled).
In our experiment trust is related to the principal offering a fixed wage. More specifically, a
higher fixed wage is considered a stronger signal
of trust. One might argue that even offering a
high profit share could be termed trust. However,
we think that the most salient way to express trust
is to offer a high fixed wage and no profit share.
Furthermore, we do not yet propose trust and
reciprocity as sharp theoretical constructs that
produce unique predictions for a given game.
Rather we propose them as useful labels for observable behavior that carry some intuition. Also,
we like to contrast these motives and the associated behavior with the implications of rationality
and pure monetary motivation, so that our interpretation seems useful.
In the econometric analysis below, reciprocity
will be measured by the responsiveness of the
agent’s work effort to the size of the fixed wage.
We argue that on the basis of rationality and
purely monetary incentives there should be no
significant influence, while this is called for by
reciprocity.
Trust and reciprocity pose some interesting
questions for principal – agent theory.13 Specifically, an essential problem is whether these two
motives can be more important for determining
© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

behavior than marginal monetary incentives on
which normative principal–agent theory is based
(see e.g. Hart and Holmström, 1987).

GAME THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
The game is a dynamic game with incomplete
information. It exhibits hidden information and
hidden actions and it has multiple equilibria. In
principle we could apply refinements14 of the equilibrium concept or the theory of equilibrium selection15 to narrow down the set of equilibria or even
propose a unique strategy profile as the solution
to this game. But, looking at the data (see below)
we found a great diversity of plays. Thus, any
unique prediction will necessarily fail. Instead we
will discuss reasonable considerations for the
players’ choices and characterize a simple equilibrium solution, assuming risk neutral players
who are only interested in their own monetary
wealth. We will refer to this as the benchmark
solution of the game. We will also describe several
quite different game paths which are consistent
with equilibrium behavior to indicate the manifold of equilibria in this game. Although we will
later compare observable behavior with the solution outlined here, the experiment is not designed
as a test of game theory, but rather to develop a
positive theory of behavior in principal–agent
relationships based on experimentally observed
data.
Let us first investigate which dividend payment
Pt in the interval 05 Pt 5 Wt + Gt a rational
agent (player A) will select. Clearly, A has no
interest in preserving or even increasing the future
value Wt + 1, at least for t= 6. He should therefore
choose P6 = W6 + G6 if this is positive and P6 = 0
otherwise. In earlier periods tB 6 a non-maximal
Pt could be justified since it might cause improved
future contracts (Ft, 6t ) or since one may expect a
higher dividend share in the future. This, however, does not happen according to the game
theoretic solution. Thus, along the solution path
P*t = Wt + Gt

Öt= 1, . . . , 6.

(1)

When the agent determines his effort at it seems
obvious that his choice depends on the contract
(Ft, 6t ) he faces. Since marginal cost of effort are
1/2 and the expected productivity is 2, a risk
neutral agent chooses at = 3 if 6t ] 3/10 and at = 0
if 6t 5 2/10. Thus, given Ft and 6t the agent’s best
reply behavior ât (Ft, 6t ) can be characterized as

(2)

Given (2) the principal can induce maximal
effort by an appropriate choice of 6t. Therefore in
the following we will refer to 6t ]0.3 as an incentive compatibility constraint. Nevertheless, an
agent might choose at =3 although 6t 52/10, if he
expects 6t ] 3/10 for some period t\ t. In other
words, 6t = 3/10 is sufficient, but not necessary for
incentive compatibility in the long run. Notice
that ât does not vary in the fixed wage component
Ft. Paying a fixed wage will not increase effort in
the short run. Moreover, incentives can eventually
be reduced in the long run. This is possible since
a fixed wage reduces the firm value Wt. Over time
Wt may become negative such that dividend payments and thereby the agent’s work incentives are
reduced.

Paying a positive fixed wage or raising the
profit share would cause additional cost on the
principal’s side, but would not increase the agent’s
effort. Reducing 6t results in zero effort according
to (2). Given that (2) holds, if the principal
chooses 6t B 3/10 at all, he should set 6t = 0.
Shares 6t =2/10 or 6t =1/10 are clearly suboptimal. Thus, it needs to be checked only whether
6t =0 could increase the principal’s profit. Additionally, it remains to be shown that the principal
is not interested in early termination of the game
along the solution path.
Before we do this we will specify a complete
strategy profile. Notice that (1), (3), (4) and (5)
together with

determine a unique path of play which will be the
path of play of our proposed solution. To show
that this is an equilibrium path we need to specify
supporting behavior at unreached information
sets.
Suppose that at all unreached information sets

Öt= 2, . . . , 6.

To check that the proposed strategy profile is
indeed an equilibrium one might simply work
again through our discussion of (1) to (5). It
remains to be shown that 6t = 0 and early termination are unprofitable for the principal. If 6t = 3/
10 the agent chooses at = 3 thereby generating an
expected profit in period t of 6 ECU. Thus, the
principal gets
(1−6t )E{at }at =

(9)

each period such that 6t = 0 would reduce his
profit. Moreover this implies that he should not
terminate the game. Termination is possible in
periods 4 to 6. In such a case the principal receives the current firm value Wt which is zero at
the time according to Equation (1), and gives up
positive future profits given by Equation (9).
We will refer to this equilibrium as the benchmark solution. It has a stationary equilibrium
path, incentive compatibility is satisfied in each
period and maximal effort is chosen always. Thus,
the solution is quite simple and efficient. Notice
further that according to the solution, dividend
payments may be shifted to earlier or later periods
without affecting players’ payoffs. To render the
solution behavior more stable one could rely on
marginal impatience assuring that dividends will
be paid as early as possible.
There are other equilibria, e.g. equilibria with
less than maximal dividend payments and 6t B 3/
10 in early periods. Suppose Pt = 0 and 6t B 3/10
in the first two periods and other than that everything is the same as in the benchmark solution. In
this case it is still optimal for the agent to choose
maximal effort in the first two periods. He simply
carries the profits over to the third period and
Manage. Decis. Econ. 19: 327–341 (1998)

<-----Page 5----->332

pays them out then. It is also possible to construct
equilibria in which the principal pays a fixed wage
in addition to a profit share.
In general, it is not obvious which equilibria or
equilibrium paths are eliminated by certain refinements. The game has rather many information
sets and taking care of all contingencies is tedious.
However, one can easily see that paying a fixed
wage is excluded by the notion of perfect equilibrium.16 In every completely mixed strategy profile the behavior at every information set
potentially matters. The agent’s choice of work
effort cannot rationally be conditioned on receiving a fixed wage. Thus, any equilibrium of the
perturbed game prescribes not to pay a fixed
wage, which establishes the result. Put differently,
paying a fixed wage can only be sequentially
rational at information sets that are reached with
zero probability.
Another aspect one might take into account are
the players’ attitudes towards risk. So far we
assumed risk neutrality for both players. Allowing
for different risk attitudes gives more leeway for
behavior that can be regarded consistent with
game theoretic equlibrium concepts. In the experiment, of course, we could have applied the binary
lottery technique, i.e. paying subjects in lottery
tickets, in order to implement risk neutrality.
However, we did not want to overburden our
participants by introducing another stochastic
event. Besides there is evidence that the binary
lottery technique may be ineffective in inducing
optimal decision behavior.17

THE RAW DATA AND SOME STYLIZED
FACTS
The experimental game underlying our study constitutes a rather rich decision environment. It
generated the following data:

that exhibits features of realistic principal–agent
problems like multiple periods, stochastic outcomes, imperfect monitoring, contract design and
downward rigidity of work contracts. These features make the relation between work contracts
and work efforts as studied by principal–agent
theory less obvious for experimental subjects.
While we think it is important to study experimental behavior in complex games this creates
some difficulties for the statistical analysis. Within
a rich environment many factors might influence
behavior. Thus, when we try to discover the influence of one factor we need to control for the
influence of others. We do this in detail when
applying regression analyses to explain the agents’
effort choices.
The analysis of the principals’ decisions is less
thorough. How he adapts the contract conditional
on his experience within the repeated game seems
an interesting but complicated task. Especially,
here, principals could not reduce any component
of the contract18, and in addition they were allowed to terminate the game in some periods.
Nevertheless, at first, we will briefly describe
the raw data for all decisions and characterize
some observable features as stylized facts. Most of
these facts rely on mean data and simple descriptive statistics, but some are behavioral hypotheses
for which we provide test statistics. Thereafter we
will turn to the analysis of effort decisions.
Initial Contract Offers
Eighty-one percent of principals in the first game
and 75% in the second game offered their agent
more than one contract. The number of offers is
significantly reduced in game 2 (p=0.059,
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test, onetailed). More than 90% of principals offered positive fixed wages, i.e. among the contracts offered
by each single principal at least one exhibited a
positive fixed wage. The average offered fixed
wage is significantly lower in game 2 (p=0.023,
Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks Test, onetailed).
All principals, with one exception in game 2,
offered a positive profit share. Game 2 contracts
were not significantly different from game 1 decisions. However, the fraction of offered contracts
that satisfy incentive compatibility as implied by
Equation (2) is smaller in game 2 than in game 1.
These observations are summarized as:

Stylized Fact 1 Contrary to the theoretical analysis, initially offered contracts exhibit substantial
fixed wages and non-incenti6e compatible profit
shares. This holds e6en for experienced subjects, but
experience reduces the number of offers and the
a6erage fixed wage.
Choices among Initial Offers and Self-Selection
Among those agents who received more than one
contract offer (F1, 61) 19% decided for the contract with the highest profit share. All others,
given they had a choice, went for the highest fixed
wage. One can interpret this observation as selfselection by agents. Agents who intend to choose
low effort levels obviously prefer a higher F1. For
this reason one should expect agents who gave up
some fixed wage for a higher profit share to
choose higher effort levels. This is actually the
case in period 1 (p =0.006, Mann-Whitney U
Test, one-tailed). We did not check this for later
periods since the effect of self-selection could be
confounded with other influences.

That experimental subjects hesitate to fully exploit
their strategic advantage is known from other
studies (see the survey of Roth, 1995). However,
looking closer at the data we found that in game
1 (game 2) out of 15 (14) agents who reached
period 6 only 2 (1) left a positive firm value. All
others brought it down to zero or had already run
it down earlier.
If the initial firm value is high the agent might
signal this—at least imperfectly—to the principal
by choosing rather high dividend payments.19 But
instead average dividend payments are moderate
and a more detailed look at the individual data
reveals that signalling in this sense hardly occurred. These observations support:

Only about half of the plays lasted six periods. All
others were terminated earlier by the principals.
Table 3 presents the relative frequencies for termination, conditional on reaching periods 4 to 6. It
exhibits a quite sharp increase at the end of both
games. Intuitively one might conjecture that the
principal’s decision to terminate the game depends somehow on the dividend payments, since
these are the agent’s actions which he can observe.
To see whether zero dividends result more likely
in termination than positive dividend we computed these conditional probabilities.
In game 1 the probability for termination in t
after Pt = 0 was 23%, while it was 18% after
Pt \ 0. In game 2 the probability for termination
in t after Pt = 0 was 41%, while it was only 12%
after Pt \ 0. This supports:

we see a lot of intermediate choices.

AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF A DYNAMIC PRINCIPAL – AGENT RELATIONSHIP

Stylized Fact 6 Principals regarded zero di6idend
payments as a negati6e signal and thus, more likely
terminated the game after Pt =0 than after Pt \ 0.

ANALYSIS OF EFFORT DECISIONS
As indicated above in a more detailed analysis we
want to address the following questions:
1. What determines the agent’s effort or, con6ersely, induces more shirking?
2. What is the relation between effort and profit
share as well as between effort and fixed wage?
From a normative point of view contracts
should be incentive compatible in order to induce
maximal efforts. More specifically, the agent’s
choice of work effort would solely depend on his
profit share. However, relying on empirical evidence the principal might pay a fixed wage and
might hope that the agent will honor this trust,
i.e. reciprocate the principal’s favorable action by
choosing a high effort level. Thus, we explore
whether experimental behavior relies more on incentive compatibility or more on trust in reciprocity and the corresponding reaction by agents.
That observed behavior does not literally correspond to the normative predictions became already clear by looking at the raw data. We
observed positive fixed wages, non-incentive-compatible profit shares and intermediate effort decisions. Another simple test of principal – agent
theory is to check whether chosen efforts were
zero when the profit share was below 0.3 and
whether efforts were maximal otherwise. In game
1 (game 2) conditional on receiving a profit share
below 0.3 only 17% (24%) of agents chose zero
effort. Conditional on a higher profit share only
44% (39%) chose maximal effort. Taken together
about two thirds of all effort decisions in both
games are inconsistent with incentive compatibility (and risk neutrality). However, these observations could have been generated by relying on
trust and reciprocity.
Facing the great diversity of subjects’ behavior
no simple explanation seems adequate, and thus,
we ran regression analyses to control for the
influence of several factors.
Data Aggregation
Running regressions bears some problems here
since each agent decided upon his effort level up

to six times within one game. Since the subjects
played two games within the session this means
that we collected up to 12 effort decisions of a
single agent. In statistic terms this is ‘repeated
measurement’ and in regression analysis it might
result in correlated error terms. Another problem
is that four subjects—two principals and two
agents—formed a matching group such that their
strategic interaction could result in correlated error terms as well. To deal with the problem of
strategic interaction we aggregated the data of all
individuals within each matching group for each
half of the two games. For all variables we computed separately for each matching group the
means for:

4 data’.

Thus, instead of 328 individual decisions (32
agents times 12 decisions minus 56 missing observations due to early termination) we analyse 16
time series of length 4, i.e. 64 observations. Each
time series is comprised of the mean data of one
matching group. Thus, it is independent of each
other time series which implies that there is no
problem of strategic interaction anymore. What is
left is the problem of repeated measurement and
this has to be taken care of by an appropriate
econometric method for statistical analyses that
combine time series and cross-sectional data.

Model 1 cannot be estimated in the current
version, since it is not identified due to linear
dependence among the dummy variables and the
unit vector (which is implicitly contained in the
model to estimate the global constant term). We
follow the usual procedure of omitting enough
variables to get identification. The regression result is displayed in Table 4.20 The model is highly
significant and explains a considerable part of the
variance.
The agent’s choice of work effort increases with
the profit share as well as with the fixed wage.
Both correlations are positive and significant.
Thus, increasing the fixed wage by 1.00 DM,
increases effort by 0.58 units (on average). Ac© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

adj. R 2: 0.62
Probability\F: 0.000

cordingly, a 0.1 increase in profit share rises effort
by about 0.26 units (on average).
To measure the influence of time we chose
dummy variables instead of a single time variable.
This allows for more general time effects and
indeed the influence of time is not monotonic.
Effort decreased from phase 1, the reference category, to phase 2 and from phase 3 to phase 4, but
not from phase 2 to phase 3. Effort decreased in
the course of playing a game, but not across
games. Reasons for this time pattern could be a
termination effect or some kind of learning or
experience effect. That efforts are higher in the
beginning of a game than in the end can be
explained by an agent’s initial, but false expectation that the profit share rises during the game.
Agents who received a low initial firm value,
W1 = 3, chose lower efforts21 than agents receiving a high initial firm value, W1 = 12. There seem
to be two reasonable explanations for this fact. A
simple one is purely psychological—namely that
getting a low firm value causes frustration and
lethargy. A second and more subtle economic
reason is that a low initial firm value is run down
faster than a high one with the consequence that
Wt − Ft becomes negative. If this is the case, part
of the profit in t cannot be used for dividend
payments (see the section ‘Trust and Reciprocity’). Actually, if the deficit is very large, profits
cannot be used for dividend payments at all.
Thus, the agent’s expected gains from working,
i.e. his work incentives, are reduced. Of course,

according to the benchmark case this will never
occur. But if it happens (and it did in the experiment) a rational agent would reduce his effort.
The dummy variables for the matching groups
were included to account for repeated measurement. Their joint inclusion improves the coefficient of determination R 2 by 25%, and the
improvement is highly significant according to a
partial F-Test (p=0.003). This shows that it was
important to take care of repeated measurement.
We do not want to interpret these variables further than this and therefore refrained from reporting their coefficients and test statistics (six
coefficients are statistically significant).
Of course, we tried to include other regressors
like the market state. But they showed no significant influence.
Overall the regression model explains the data
reasonably well. The influences of profit share
and fixed wage are both positive, i.e. they are
qualitatively of the type one would expect from a
normative respectively behavioristic perspective.
However, it was not clear whether both will
prove to be substantial and statistically significant. The influence of time indicates dynamic
aspects of behavior that we want to discuss in
more detail.

Model 2
It is quite plausible that behavior changes
slightly, due to learning during the course of the
experiment. Learning could be different when responding to the profit share than when reacting
to the fixed wage. Thus, it appears questionable
whether phase t constants are adequate to measure learning effects. As an alternative we estimated the following model:

with all variables and the coefficients b0, gj, vj
and mj as in model 1 and where the coefficients
d1j and d2j measure, respectively, the influence of
profit share in phase j and the influence of fixed
wage in phase j.
The regression result is displayed in Table 5.22
The model is highly significant and explains a
considerable part of the variance. The difference
from model 1 is that now the influence of fixed
wage and profit share are allowed to vary across
time. Notice, that, for example, the variable

‘profit share in t=3’, which is displayed in Table
5, corresponds to the term D time
jit 6it, for j= 3, in
the above equation (model 2). Thus, the variable
‘profit share in t= 3’ exhibits the actual profit
share value for phase 3 observations and is coded
as zero for observations other than those of phase
3.23
In modelling the influence of time (via fixed
wages and profit shares) we chose again a dummy
variable specification to allow for more general
time effects. While in model 1 both the profit
share as well as the fixed wage exhibited statistically significant influences, model 2 splits these
influences into phasewise effects resulting in a
number of insignificant regressors. However,
looking at the coefficients and their t-values
shows striking regularities — qualitatively as well
as quantitatively. First of all, the influences are
qualitatively the same as expected and already
confirmed by model 1. The influences of profit
share and fixed wage are positive in all phases
while a low initial firm value affects work effort
negatively.
The importance of the profit share is monotonically increasing over time. While it is negligible in
size and statistically insignificant especially in the
first two phases (in game 1) it is substantial and
significant in the end. The phase 4 coefficient of
6.41 implies that an increase of 0.1 in the profit
share increases the agent’s effort by 0.64 units on
average. Taking together the result of regression 1
and the regular pattern of the profit share influence we draw the following conclusion:
Conclusion 1 The agent’s choice of work effort is
positi6ely influenced by work contracts which offer
higher profit shares. This correlation gets stronger
o6er time indicating that agents might e6entually
learn incenti6e compatibility o6er time.
The influence of fixed wages is substantial and
significant from the start — although it is insignificant in phase 3. From the perspective of the
principal this means that paying higher fixed
wages is a reliable way to induce higher efforts
which needs no learning. The fixed wage influence
increases, but not in each phase. It decreases from
the end of game 1 to the beginning of game 2
(from phase 2 to phase 3). This suggests that the
agent’s responses to fixed wages have a dynamic
aspect which is relationship-specific. The princi© 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

pals’ trust, signalled via a positive fixed wage, is
reciprocated by the agent via high efforts. This
positive reciprocity is stronger in the long run
than in the short run, but it is not carried over
from one relationship to the next. It has to be
built up afresh when one confronts a new partner.
One might argue that there is some carry-over
effect since the influence of fixed wages is slightly
stronger at the beginning of game 2 than in the
beginning of game 1, but one should not interpret
our regression results too boldly. After all not all
of the coefficients are significantly different from
zero. Also, the differences between the coefficients
are mostly not significant24 (what can easily be
checked by comparing the differences and the
standard errors of the coefficients).
Taking together the results of regression 1 and
the regularities of the fixed wage influence we
further conclude:
Conclusion 2 The agent’s choice of work effort is
positi6ely influenced by work contracts which offer
higher fixed wages. This correlation is already
strong at the start of the game.
Conclusion 3 Trust (measured by the size of the
fixed wage) and reciprocity (measured by the responsi6eness of work effort on the size of the fixed
wage) exhibit dynamic aspects which are relationship-specific. Reciprocity gets stronger in the
course of a game, but is not carried o6er across
games (with a new partner).
By now, and with regard to the first question
posed above, we found a reasonably good explanation for the agents’ effort decisions. Regarding
the second question we found that both higher
profit shares as well as higher fixed wages increase
agents’ efforts.



But does either or both increase the principal’s
profits?
Will the principal prefer to rely on incentive
compatibility than on trust and reciprocity?

More specifically let us examine whether it
would be more profitable for the principal to
increase the fixed wage rather than the profit
share given that the agent’s reaction is as suggested by our regression results and assuming
average behavior. Let 6̄t and P( t represent means
of profit share and dividend payment in phase t.
Manage. Decis. Econ. 19: 327–341 (1998)

<-----Page 12----->AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF A DYNAMIC PRINCIPAL – AGENT RELATIONSHIP

Thus, the principal’s average income P( Bt (not
including the liquidation value) is given by
P( Bt  (1− 6̄t )P( t
Following regression model 2, changes in fixed
wage DFt or profit share D6t result in changes of
effort Dat and accordingly in changes of return
DEt and the firm’s profit DGt. Compared to P( Bt
the principal’s income induced by a change of the
work contract P( Bt (D) can be written as
P( Bt (D) (1− 6̄t − D6t )(P( t +DGt )
with DGt =DEt −DFt. A contract change is profitable if P( Bt (D) − P( Bt ]0 which is equivalent to
(1− 6̄t −D6t )DGt −D6tP( t ]0.

(10)

Now we will check whether it is profitable to
induce a small increase in effort of, for example,
Dat = 0.1 units leading to an expected increase in
return of DEt =0.2 DM. According to regression
model 2 this can be achieved by the following
contract changes:

so that the above inequality just requires 0.2]
DFt. Thus, on average, inducing an increase in
effort via the fixed wage would have been profitable in t= 2 and t= 4, but not in the early
phases of each game (t=1 and t= 3). For D6t \ 0
and DFt = 0 the corresponding condition is

P( t + 0.2
So, to induce a small effort increase via the profit
share causes a very substantial loss in game 1
(t= 1, t= 2), but is profitable in game 2 (t=3,
t=4).
Thus, if the agent is inexperienced (game 1), the
principal should rather rely on trust and reciprocity than on incentive compatibility. Inducing more
effort via a higher profit share reduces his profit
substantially. With experience (game 2) a profit
share policy seems on average more profitable.

SUMMARY
While principal–agent theory is exclusively built
on incentives, actual behavior is sometimes better
explained by trust on the side of principals and
reciprocity on the side of agents. Incentive compatibility has to be learnt whereas trust and reciprocity is readily available even for
inexperienced participants. Within an ongoing relationship trust and reciprocity get more important over time, but the experience of this kind of
mutual cooperation is not carried over to another
relationship with a new partner. Rather it has to
be built up afresh. Expressed differently, the dynamic aspects of trust and reciprocity are stronger
within relationships than across. Within our experimental framework neither the process of
learning incentive compatibility nor the dynamics
of trust and reciprocity can be regarded as settled.
This certainly needs further investigation.
After all, we found that laboratory behavior
within this quite complex game follows systematic
patterns that are based on a few concepts. While
some of these findings may seem natural from a
psychologic point of view, they appear puzzling
from a purely economic perspective (focussing
only on monetary incentives). It would certainly
be premature to discuss their implications for

principal–agent relationships in real life. But nevertheless our evidence indicates that even when
the principal can hardly monitor the agent’s performance, behavior is not purely opportunistic in
an economic sense. Since principals may quite
often encounter situations where they must trust
their agents, this is surely good news.

20. One might wonder whether linear regression analysis is adequate here. Individual effort is a discrete
variable that can take on only four values, which
could result in a lot of boundary observations.
However, first one should note that we aggregated
six individual effort decisions (two player by three
periods). Thus, mean effort can take on 19 different
values and we observe only six (out of 64)
boundary observations. Second, looking at the
residuals convinced us that the linear regression
model does reasonably well.
21. The problem of how to measure the treatment
effect correctly, as it is discussed in Königstein
(1997), does not arise here, since the dummies for
the matching groups are non-nested within the
treatment dummies. For some groups the initial
firm value was low in game 1, but high in game 2,
and vice versa.
22. Again, we removed enough variables from the
model to get identification.
23. As in model 1 we included matching group dummies (results are not reported) to control for repeated measurement. Again, as a group they
substantially improved the model fit (by 22%) and
the change in R 2 was highly significant (p= 0.005,
partial F-test, one-tailed).
24. This problem also arises in the discussion of how
the influences of profit shares 6t changes over time.
