Who Are the Alumni Donors?
Giving by Two Generations
of Alumni from Selective
Colleges
Charles T. Clotfelter
Using data on former students of fourteen private colleges and
universities, this paper examines patterns of alumni giving. The
data are taken from the College and Beyond survey, which covers individuals who entered the institutions in the fall of 1951,
1976, and 1989. Contributions by these former students to these
colleges and universities tend to be quite concentrated, with half
of all donations being given by the most generous 1 percent of
the sample. A higher level of contribution is associated with
higher income, with having participated in extracurricular
activities in college, with having had a mentor in college, and
with the degree of satisfaction in one’s undergraduate experience.
The projected donations for the most generous of these alumni
over the course of a lifetime are quite high, with totals for the
1951 cohort exceeding those from the 1976 cohort.

by alumni are a significant source of revenue for private colleges and universities, and their importance promises
to grow in the future. In 1997–98, alumni contributed
$3.3 billion to 658 private institutions, representing 7.9 percent of
their educational and general expenditures (Morgan, 1999). In the
wake of a sustained bull market in stocks, some recent university

capital campaigns have easily surpassed their ambitious goals. As
market forces cause tuition increases in private institutions to
moderate—which they appear to be doing—income from donations
seems likely to assume an increasingly important role in total
revenue.
Yet some close observers have raised a cautionary flag about the
prospects of sustained growth from this source. One fear is that
much of the generosity of the current cohort of givers is unique to
this generation, that it will be lost when that cohort passes from the
scene. In examining the rate of volunteering, for example, Goss
(1999) finds that the generation now in its retirement years has
volunteered at a pace unlikely to be matched by subsequent
generations. Another fear arises from the increasingly meritocratic
admissions policy of the most prestigious colleges and universities,
whereby the sons and daughters of the social elite increasingly
are passed over in favor of applicants with stronger academic credentials. Since the latter tend to come from less wealthy families than
the former, this new type of student may give less as an alum
than the previous generations of alumni did. This reasoning lies
behind speculation by Willemain, Goyal, Van Deven, and Thukral
(1994) about what they view as the “democratization” of admissions
at Princeton during the 1920s. They argue that changes in admissions practices there reduced the prevalence of students from
wealthy families, resulting in a decline in the average gift size.
Neither of these fears is inconsistent with previous research on
alumni giving, but there is little other work addressing them. More
generally, previous studies of alumni giving have not had the luxury
of detailed personal information about individual donors at a set of
institutions. (For previous statistical analyses of alumni giving, see,
for example, Grant and Lindauer, 1986; Leslie and Ramey, 1988;
Lindahl and Winship, 1992; and Willemain, Goyal, Van Deven, and
Thukral, 1994. For treatment of the normative issues surrounding
how many resources to devote to raising funds from alumni, see
Rooney, 1999).
Using data on alumni from fourteen selective private colleges
and universities, this paper has a threefold purpose. First, it
describes some interesting aspects of alumni giving, including
constancy, concentration, and pattern over time. Second, it
compares the level of giving by alumni from two generations,
noting the inherent difficulties in such a comparison. Third, it
examines how this giving varies according to other variables. The
first section of this article describes the data used and how they
trace changes in the type of student who attends these selective
institutions. The second section presents information on some of
the most striking patterns of alumni contributions made evident in
this data set. The third section compares the amount given by
alumni in the two oldest cohorts. The last section is a summary
and conclusion.

The Sample Institutions and Their Changing
Student Bodies
The data used for this study are based on the College and Beyond survey, which assembled information for three cohorts of individuals
who enrolled in a sample of thirty-four colleges and universities in
1951, 1976, and 1989. (See Bowen and Bok, 1998, Appendix A, for
a description of the survey.) These individuals were surveyed in 1995
and 1996 and were asked questions covering both their college experience and aspects of their current situation. For each former student,
the information collected in the survey questionnaire was joined with
student records maintained by the institutions, including such items
as courses taken, extracurricular activities, and honors received.
Although not all of the individuals in the resulting sample graduated
from these same colleges and universities, the vast majority did, so
they are referred to throughout the paper as alumni. For a subset of
fourteen of these institutions (all of them private), additional data
were collected from the institution’s own administrative files on each
person’s contributions for a number of years. These fourteen private
colleges and universities constitute the sample for this study.
As has been noted elsewhere, admissions policies at elite private
colleges have changed markedly since World War II, resulting in a
decline in the prevalence of children of privilege (Lemann, 1999).
The data in the current sample are an illuminating reflection of this
change. Table 1 presents average values for the sampled alumni from
all fourteen institutions for which data were available for all three
cohorts. To neutralize the effect of change in relative sample size, the

Note: Calculations for each measure are based on institutions with data for all three
cohorts. The values for 1976 are unweighted means calculated for all individuals in the
institutions applying to each measure. The means for the other two years weight individual observations so as to give each institution the same weight as its actual share in
1976. Where Nk76 is the number of alumni of institution k in 1976 and N76 is the total
sample size in that year, its alumni for year t is weighted by (Nk76/N76)/(Nkt /Nt).

figures are weighted so as to give each institution the same weight in
each year.
The table reveals some significant changes over this period.
Reflecting the trend toward coeducation in undergraduate schools
and colleges, the proportion of males in the sample fell from 72 percent in 1951 to 52 percent in 1976. Equally striking is the effect of
opening admissions to racial and ethnic minority groups, which led
to a decline in the percentage of whites from 98 to 89 percent, a trend
that continued past 1976. In the only trend that was not monotonic
over the period, the percentage of students from public high schools
rose between 1951 and 1976 and then fell again. A similar increase
and decline in the public school percentage was observed among
freshmen at all private universities and private nonsectarian colleges
between 1966 and 1993 (Clotfelter, 1999).
Students in the sample institutions were more likely over time to
have parents who graduated from college, reflecting a societal advance
in educational attainment. More striking than this change is improvement in the measured academic quality of students and the broadening geographical appeal of these institutions. Between 1951 and 1976,
the average high school rank for these freshmen rose from the 77th
to the 91st percentile, and the average SAT score increased by a
remarkable 129 points, with the improvement in both measures continuing to 1989. (See Bowen and Bok, 1998, for a similar comparison
of average SAT scores at four institutions for the three cohorts.)
Both of these trends are consistent with the findings of Cook and
Frank (1993) and Hoxby and Terry (1998), who show that top students have become more concentrated in a relatively small number
of elite institutions. The proportion who attended college in their
home state or a bordering state dropped between 1976 and 1989,
reflecting the increasing national character of the elite higher education market, a development analyzed by Hoxby (1997). In short, the
enrollment patterns in this group of private colleges and universities
did indeed shift over this period. Because most of the 1989 cohort
had only just graduated when the survey was conducted and therefore would have had little opportunity to establish giving patterns,
this cohort is omitted from the remainder of the analysis. The sample is further limited by the availability of data. Three institutions provided no data on the 1951 cohort. The resulting data set includes a
total of 2,910 individuals for the 1951 cohort and 7,995 for the 1976
cohort. In addition, the number of years of giving data covered differs
from institution to institution.1 Most of the institutions offered giving data at a minimum for all of the years from 1991 to 1995.

Giving by Two Cohorts of Alumni: How Much
Did They Give?
A natural first question to ask about alumni giving is, simply,
How much did they give? Information on giving was collected for
four categories: athletics, financial aid, other restricted purposes, and

<-----Page 4----->WHO ARE

THE

unrestricted. Table 2 shows, by cohort, both the percentage of those
who made a contribution in each category and the average amount
for those who did so. It is clear that relatively few alumni placed any
restriction on their gifts, as shown by the low percentages for the
three specified categories. Among those who contributed for those
restricted purposes, however, the average gift was in most cases
higher than the average for all contributions. Those in the 1951
cohort gave at a higher rate than those in the 1976 cohort; although
half of the older cohort made gifts in 1995, only about 32 percent of
the younger cohort did. Among those who made donations, the average gift from the 1951 cohort was also much higher ($1,506), more
than twice as high on average as that from the younger cohort
($681). Reflecting the degree to which the mean value is influenced
by a relatively small number of big gifts, the median giving for those
who gave in 1995 was $155 for the 1951 cohort and $98 for the 1976
cohort. Taking into account both the rate of giving and the average
donation for those who did make gifts, the average donation for all
alumni was $751 in the 1951 cohort, compared to only $216 in the
1976 cohort, almost a 3.5:1 ratio.
Published data on aggregate donations are not broken down by
age; however, they can be used as a rough check of the magnitude of
the average level of donation, and these figures are in fact similar.
Averages based on alumni of all ages in thirteen of the fourteen institutions covered in the College and Beyond sample reveal that 41 percent of alumni in a liberal arts college and 31 percent of those in a
private university made a donation in 1995, with average gifts for
those who gave of $834 and $1,267, respectively (Morgan, 1996).
Quite clearly, the alumni from the 1951 cohort gave at a much
higher level on average than the younger cohort did. This disparity
by itself does not indicate, however, that the older alumni were more
“generous.” When comparing the behavior of the 1951 and 1976
cohorts, it must be remembered that any observed difference in
behavior could be the result of one or more of four effects: composition, cohort, life cycle, or income. First, the observed difference in

behavior between the cohorts could be due to the kind of change
in the composition of the student body—in terms of gender, geography, race, and economic status—that is evident in Table 1. It is
possible, as Willemain, Goyal, Van Deven, and Thukral (1994) argue
for the case of Princeton, that “democratization” of admissions, that
is, reduction in the share of students from wealthy families, leads to
reduced donations from younger cohorts.
Second, differences between classes separated by as much as two
and a half decades might easily be due to a “cohort effect,” one that is
generationwide. In the present case, the effect might be present
because the members of the 1951 and 1976 cohorts are literally members of different generations—one that experienced World War II, the
other the end of the Vietnam War, as teenagers. Such contrasts in historical period envelope differences in life experience of many dimensions, so that the contrast between the generations’ worldviews cannot
be captured adequately with any set of objectively measured variables.
A third possible reason for observed differences is life-cycle
effects, those arising from age alone. At the time this survey was
taken, the 1951 and 1976 cohorts were, naturally, at different points
in their lives. Those in the cohort entering school in 1951 would
have been sixty-two years old and would normally have celebrated
their fortieth reunion in 1995. Those in the 1976 cohort would have
been only thirty-seven and celebrating their fifteenth reunion year.
As documented by many econometric studies of charitable giving,
contributions tend to rise with age, independent of income. Auten
and Joulfaian (1996), for example, present regression estimates
implying that contributions in the fifty-five-to-sixty-four age bracket
exceeded those in the under-forty-five bracket by a ratio of 2.4:1.2
The fourth reason we might expect the older cohort of alumni to
give more is perhaps the most obvious: their income is likely to be
higher. Every empirical study of charitable giving confirms the existence of a strong positive income effect on charitable giving. Before
analyzing these four effects in detail, we must acknowledge an additional factor that probably influences the level of alumni giving
and that could explain part of the observed difference between cohorts.
This is the fundraising effort expended by the school. Although there
is little statistical research on this effect, it seems reasonable that these
efforts do influence the number of donors and the average gift size.
One yardstick for assessing the 3.5:1 ratio of giving between the
1951 and 1976 cohorts documented in Table 2 is Grant and Lindauer’s study (1986) of alumnae contributions to Wellesley, which
analyzed average donations for sixty graduating classes. Because
their data were essentially a snapshot of giving by a number of
classes, one would expect the differences they observed to be a combination of cohort, life-cycle, and income effects. Their estimated
regression for average donations suggests that sixty-two-year-old
alumnae on average gave roughly three times as much as thirtyseven year olds, slightly less than the gap evident in the College and
Beyond data.

<-----Page 6----->WHO ARE

THE

ALUMNI DONORS?

Considering that the observed differences between 1951 and
1976 cohorts may contain income and life-cycle effects as well as a
cohort effect, it is by no means obvious that one of these cohorts is
any more generous than the other. Although there is every reason to
think that changing admissions criteria over time have altered the
mix of students who attend these selective institutions, these data,
as rich as they might appear, cannot isolate a measurable cohort
effect.
One logical extension of viewing alumni giving over the life cycle
is to ask how much giving adds up to over a lifetime. Since one oftcited motivation for alumni giving is a desire to “pay back” the institution (see, for example, Leslie and Ramey, 1988), it would be
interesting to know the total value of a person’s lifetime contributions. Indeed, this is a question of considerable practical importance
to university administrators in their long-range financial planning.
The current data afford a window (of at least a few years out) of
something like five decades of postgraduate life to observe a person’s
contributions. Using an assumed age-giving profile in which giving
rises until about age seventy, I used the observations obtained from
the College and Beyond data to infer estimates of lifetime giving. For
each person, the present value of this lifetime giving was calculated,
as of age twenty-two. For those alumni who made no donations during the period of coverage, lifetime giving was assumed to be zero.
More details about this calculation are given in a companion research
note in this article.
Table 3 shows the resulting distribution of putative lifetime giving by these alumni. The top portion of the table shows that 30 percent of the 1951 cohort and 42 percent of the 1976 cohort were
projected to make no gifts over their lifetime, based on their failure
to make any donation during the sample period. At the other end
of the distribution, some 4 percent and 1 percent of the alumni,
respectively, were projected to give more than $50,000 over the
course of their lives. Average lifetime giving was projected to be
almost $12,000 for the members of the 1951 cohort, compared to
about $7,700 for the 1976 cohort, or about 1.56 times higher for
the former. Because of the large number of alumni who are projected to give nothing over their lifetime, the median values for
putative lifetime giving are small, $771 for the 1951 cohort and
$294 for the 1976 cohort. In judging these figures, one should recall
that these calculations assume a person’s donations increase over
his or her lifetime in a way that is determined by an estimated
equation (Grant and Lindauer, 1986). If a higher growth rate
were assumed, the 1.56 ratio would decline, and vice versa. In any
case, however, the most important implication of the calculation is
that only a minority of alumni give a substantial amount over their
lifetime.
One yardstick by which these projected quantities can be judged
is the tuition level that existed when the alumni entered college. Over
a lifetime, how many alumni will donate enough, for example, to pay

for one year’s worth of tuition, at the level they knew it when they
were in college? If ever there were a moving target, this would be it.
Still, it seems a particularly apt amount for comparison. Among
the fourteen institutions in the current sample, the average tuition in
1951 was a paltry $3,350 in 1997 dollars, but by 1976 it was $10,677
(Lovejoy’s College Guide . . ., 1952; Cass and Birnbaum, 1977).
Comparing those figures to the distribution of projected contributions
considerably widens the difference between the cohorts. Whereas
28 percent of the 1951 cohort are projected to contribute at least one
year’s tuition amount, only about 7 percent of the 1976 cohort are.

Patterns of Alumni Giving
Because they contain both yearly data on giving and detailed survey
information, the College and Beyond data offer an unusual opportunity to document several interesting features of alumni giving. For

<-----Page 8----->WHO ARE

example, any director of development or alumni affairs is keenly aware
that alumni differ in the regularity of their giving, ranging from the
dependable annual giver to the “never-ever.” The panel nature of
this data set shows a clear picture of how alumni differ in this regard.
Table 4 divides the present sample according to the number of years
they made contributions during the 1991–1995 period. It shows that
most alumni fall into one of the two extreme groups. An impressive
27.5 percent of those in the 1951 cohort made contributions in each
of the five years, while about half that percentage showed the same
level of constancy among the younger cohort. At the other end of the
spectrum, more than a third of the 1951 cohort and more than half of
the 1976 cohort made no contributions at all during this period. Least
common among both cohorts were those who made gifts in only a few
years. A pattern that one might expect to observe would be giving in
only one year, that being the reunion year. Although these data suggest
such a pattern, the effect does not appear to be large. The percentage
of alumni who gave in only one of the five reunion years was 8 and
11 percent, respectively. As shown in Table 5, although the percentage

of giving among both cohorts was indeed highest in 1995 (corresponding to the reunion year for those in both cohorts who finished
college in four years), the difference seems surprisingly small. The
more important effect of the reunion year appears to be in the amount
given. As Table 5 indicates, the average amount given during 1995
was well above the five-year average for each cohort, although in
neither case was 1995 the highest, a finding similar to that of
Willemain, Goyal, Van Deven, and Thukral’s study of Princeton alumni
giving (1994).
One other noteworthy feature of giving that leaps out from the
data (and one that is surely not lost on development officers) is its
high degree of concentration, a feature noted in previous research,
such as Lindahl and Winship (1992). Table 6 shows the percentage
of total contributions that donors made during the 1991–1995
period, ranked by size of gift. It is evident that the bottom 40 percent
of both cohorts gave virtually nothing over this period. The next
40 percent gave a relatively small fraction of the total, leaving the
bulk of the giving for the most generous fifth of alumni. In fact, half
of the dollars given by the 1951 cohort were donated by just 1 percent of its members; for the 1976 cohort the top 1 percent gave
65 percent. Considerable concentration exists even among those who
donate something. In this group, the top 20 percent contributed
90 percent of all gifts in the 1951 cohort and 88 percent in the 1976
cohort, showing that alumni giving is somewhat more concentrated
than the benchmark given by the 80/20 rule in marketing—also
known as Pareto’s law, or the “law of the heavy half” (Buell, 1986),
which states that the most active 20 percent of consumers normally
account for 80 percent of total spending on a commodity. It is no
wonder that development officers devote a disproportionate share of
their attention to a relative handful of alumni donors.

THE

ALUMNI DONORS?

What kind of alumni contribute, and contribute the most? To
give a sense of this, Table 7 shows how the giving rate and average
size of donation, both defined for the five-year period 1991–1995,
differ according to a number of personal characteristics. For the
entire sample, 63 percent of the 1951 cohort made at least one contribution in the period, compared to 48 percent for the 1976 cohort,
percentages that can also be inferred from Table 4. Average giving
over the entire period for those who made any donation—in contrast
to 1995 giving only, as in Table 2—was $899 and $270, respectively.
By gender, although men and women were about as likely to make
any gift, the average size from male donors was over twice as large as
that for women.
This disparity apparently has been a concern at previously allmale institutions that became co-ed. Giving patterns also differed markedly with income level, with those in the top income class
being much more likely to give than those below and having a considerably higher average as well. Political philosophy, on the other
hand, shows no systematic relationship to giving. Alumni who once
had a leadership position in an extracurricular activity gave more
than those who did not. Those who remembered someone who took
a special interest in them during college were also more likely to give,
and to give more. Having graduated from the institution where they
first enrolled was strongly related to giving. Legacies (those with a
relative who previously attended the institution) tended to make
larger gifts, and they were slightly more likely than other alumni to
give at all. Regarding the type of high school attended, there is no
clear effect discernible from these averages. SAT score shows little
relation to giving among the 1951 cohort, for those who reported
such a score. For the 1976 cohort, however, SAT score was positively
related to the propensity to give and the average level among
donors. Those who had received honors, including Phi Beta Kappa,
gave more.
The next three items in Table 7 reflect answers to attitudinal
questions. The first among these reveals that an overwhelming majority of respondents were “very satisfied” with their undergraduate
institution (though the percentage was lower for the younger
cohort). Not surprisingly, those who reported being satisfied were
more active contributors than those who were not. Similarly, those
who were dissatisfied with various specific aspects were less likely to
give, or give a lot.
The last three items refer to characteristics of the institution
rather than the respondents. Those who entered a liberal arts college
were more likely to give than those who enrolled in a university, but
average giving for those making a contribution was higher among
college alumni only for the 1951 cohort. When institutions were
divided by tuition level, there was no systematic pattern for giving,
but there does seem to be a relationship to the institution’s degree of
selectivity in admissions for 1976. For that cohort, the alumni from

Notes: (a) Based on the survey question “While you were an undergraduate, did anyone associated with your school, other than fellow students, take a special interest in you or
your work—that is, was there someone you could turn to for advice or for general support or encouragement?” (Bowen and Bok, 1998, p. 319, question A11).
(b) Respondents were asked, “Please indicate how much emphasis you believe your undergraduate school currently places on” a number of aspects, ranking each from “a great
deal” (5) to “very little/none” (1). Then, for the same list, they were asked how much their institution should emphasize each aspect. A respondent was deemed to be dissatisfied with
the institution with respect to an aspect if the difference between these two rankings was 2 or more, in either direction. The first measure applies this dissatisfaction criterion to either
faculty research or undergraduate teaching. The second applies if the criterion is met for any one of another seven aspects: a broad liberal arts education, intercollegiate athletics,
extracurricular activity other than intercollegiate athletics, commitment to intellectual freedom, a racially or ethnically diverse student body, quality of residential life, and alumni
or alumnae concerns.
(c) Information on the institution’s tuition, contemporaneous to each cohort, was obtained from college guides and summarized in three categorical dichotomous variables
for each year. For the 1951 cohort, these were based on tuition figures reported in Lovejoy’s College Guide 1953–54 (1952). The first was assigned the value of 1 for institutions
with reported tuition of $700 or more per year, the second for $550–699, and the third for less than $550. The number of institutions in these categories was three, five, and six,
respectively. For the 1976 cohort, these dichotomous variables indicating tuition level were based on tuition figures reported in Cass and Birnbaum (1977). The first variable was
assigned the value of 1 for institutions with reported tuition and fees of $4,200 for more, the second for $3,600–4,199, and the third for less than $3,600.

the most selective institutions were most likely to give, and those
givers had the highest average giving.
It is instructive to examine the interaction between two of the
strongest factors noted in Table 7: income and satisfaction with
the undergraduate institution. Income, of course, has been shown in
previous work on charitable giving to be highly correlated with total
contribution. It simply seems intuitive that expressed satisfaction
should also be important. Table 8 presents average giving by income
class and degree of satisfaction with the undergraduate college where
the respondent first enrolled. Almost without exception, in both
cohorts, giving rises with income. It is also generally higher within
the broad income classes for those who said they were “very satisfied,” with the difference being statistically significant overall and in
three of the four income classes for each cohort.
In light of the disproportionate share of total giving made by
the largest donors, it is especially interesting to focus on the biggest
givers. Table 9 compares the top 1 percent of givers to the entire
sample, for each cohort. Not surprisingly, those who contributed
the most tended to have the highest incomes, with 97 percent making $100,000 or more. Perhaps correspondingly, they tended also to
be conservative on economic issues. They also were more likely
to be a leader in a volunteer activity, particularly so with alumni
activities. Corresponding to the tabulations already shown, the big
givers were more likely than average to have had someone who
advised them in college, somewhat more likely to have been satisfied with their undergraduate experience, and much more likely to

least to those who feared that increasing emphasis on academic
record at the expense of family connections would undermine
alumni giving, is that the top givers in both cohorts had higherthan-average SAT scores. All of these differences are statistically
significant.

Conclusion
Using a rich data set on two age cohorts of former students from
fourteen selective private colleges and universities, this paper examines patterns of alumni donations. The data come from the College
and Beyond study, which combines survey data with information

133

<-----Page 15----->134

C L O T F E LT E R

from the institutions’ own records for two cohorts of former students.
The data offer an unusual amount of information describing each former student’s past association with his or her undergraduate college.
Reflecting a rising emphasis on meritocratic criteria for admission to the nation’s most selective colleges and universities, the composition of these fourteen institutions did change perceptibly over
the period from 1951 to 1989. The schools became less male, more
nonwhite, and less regional, and they enrolled an increasing share of
academically high-achieving students. But comparisons of giving
between 1951 and 1976 cohorts do not yield any clear reason to
worry that these changes reduce the level of alumni giving to such
institutions.
Although the act of donating is relatively common among these
alumni, the paper reveals that alumni giving is extremely concentrated, with more than half of all donations being given by just 1 percent of all alumni. A surprisingly high proportion of the alumni of
these private institutions contribute annually. Based on the amount
they contributed over the period of observation, some of these
alumni are projected to give a substantial amount over their lifetime.
Of all the variables associated with alumni giving highlighted in
this paper, perhaps the two most emphatic effects are those of income
and satisfaction. Income, of course, has long been found to be highly
correlated to charitable giving. In light of the tendency for more affluent donors to favor higher education as an object of their generosity,
this strong correlation should come as no surprise; nor should the
effect of expressed satisfaction. Although no similar history of studies documenting the relationship exists, it should be emphasized that
this connection has received virtually no statistical support in the literature on charitable giving. (For a detailed analysis of the effect of
satisfaction on alumni giving, see Clotfelter, 2000.)
In considering what, if anything, these statistical findings imply
for colleges and universities, it is well to begin by noting that increasing the level of alumni donations is not, nor should it be, the primary
aim of any institution. A means to achieving ultimate goals, probably; an indirect measure of success, perhaps; but not an ultimate
objective. That said, the bulk of donations come from a relatively
small number of alumni. Of course, beyond the obvious step of
focusing on alumni in high-income zip codes, the process of identifying and cultivating them is quite another matter, which is why
sophisticated development offices exist in every thriving private college and university and many public ones as well. Within the age
groups containing most of today’s potential big donors, little can be
done to change a central determinant of alumni giving: feelings of
satisfaction about the undergraduate experience of decades ago. For
such current prospects, the only option besides being courted by
development officers that is likely to have an impact in the short run
is a policy likely to arouse dissatisfaction, such as a perceived shift
in emphasis from teaching to research, or away from sports. Such

<-----Page 16----->WHO ARE

tradeoffs are necessarily part of every president’s ongoing calculus.
In contrast to immediate tradeoffs, the paper’s most important implications relate to long-run effects. Among them is the likelihood that
improvement in teaching and advising has a beneficial effect on eventual alumni giving. Although greatly attenuated by time, the benefit
should still offer some comfort to an institution seeking, regardless
of the reason, to improve undergraduate education.

Research Note: Calculation of Putative
Lifetime Donations
In this article, I present calculations to approximate the present value
of individuals’ alumni giving over their lifetime, based on limited
information on giving. This research note presents a description of
the underlying calculations.
To infer the value of an individual’s lifetime contributions, I
assume that the donations made during the years of observation are
representative of the individual’s lifetime giving. If the individual
makes no gifts during the observation period, I assume he or she
never gives. For all other individuals, I make the assumption that
everyone’s lifetime pattern of giving has the same shape, differing
proportionally only in amount. The assumed age-giving profile is
based on an estimated relationship for a private women’s college on
giving per living graduate by year (Grant and Lindauer, 1986, p. 132):
ln ga  1.231  0.205 R*  0.072 (a  21)  0.00051 (a  21)2
where ga is donations in 1967 dollars, R* is a dummy variable indicating reunion years (every fifth year from age twenty-six to seventysix), and a is age. Because it is based on data, collected at one time,
on average giving by class, the estimated age-giving profile necessarily conflates life-cycle, cohort, and income effects. According to this
function, the real value of alumni giving rises through life, slowing
gradually, reaching a peak around age seventy; it features spikes at
five-year intervals corresponding with reunion years. Between the
ages of thirty-seven and sixty-two, it implies an annual growth rate
in giving of 4.4 percent. To correct this equation for expected mortality, each future year’s fitted value for donations is multiplied by the
probability of survival to the corresponding age, where separate mortality figures are employed for men and women and for members of
the 1951 and 1976 cohorts. That is, for members of the 1951 cohort,
who are observed in the data at age sixty-two, each year beginning
with age sixty-three is multiplied by the probability of surviving to
that age, having survived to sixty-two. For members of the 1976
cohort, adjustments for mortality begin with age thirty-eight, the first
year after they are observed in the survey.
Calculating an individual’s putative lifetime alumni giving follows a five-step procedure. In the first step, the equation and mortality tables already described are used to calculate the expected

present value of donations, stated in 1997 constant dollars, evaluated
at age twenty-two. Call this the present value Vk where k indexes two
cohorts, each with two genders.
Steps two through four are applied separately to each individual
in the sample. For each individual i, we have observations on giving
for years a1 to a2, denoted gia1  gia2. In step two, the present value
of this giving, calculated at age twenty-two in 1997 dollars, is calculated. In step three, a second present value is calculated for the same
ages, but now using the estimated giving from the estimated equation above, gia1  gia2.
In step four, the ratio between these two present values is
computed:
Xi  PV(gia1  gia2)PV(gia1  gia2)
If the individual makes no contributions during the years covered by the data, Xi  0.
In the final step, the present value of the individual’s lifetime
giving is estimated to be
Vi  Xi Vk
If, for example, the present value of a man’s giving over the span
of ages from fifty-six to sixty-two is 85 percent of the present value of
predicted giving for ages fifty-six to sixty-two, then the present value
of his expected lifetime giving is taken to be 85 percent of the ageand gender-appropriate Vk calculated from the estimated equation.

Notes
1. An important practical question that arose in using the data on
alumni giving presented by institutions was how to determine
whether the absence of recorded giving by an individual reflected no
contributions by the individual or merely lack of data on giving.
Institutions were asked to indicate for each individual whether giving data were available; conversations with those who provided and
collected the data suggested that this indicator was not reliable.

Instead, the assumption was made that missing data would indicate
true zero giving except in cases in which the institution offered no
giving data for any donors, as was the case with three institutions for
all of the 1951 cohort and several other institutions for some years
and cohorts.
2. The ratio 2:4:1 is based on logarithmic coefficients of .399
and .474 in equation (1) (Auten and Joulfaian, 1996, Table 2), where
sixty-five and over is the omitted age category. For a review of estimated age effects in studies of charitable giving, see Clotfelter (1985).
Since they rely on cross-section differences, however, these estimated
effects could include both generational effects as well as pure lifecycle effects.
