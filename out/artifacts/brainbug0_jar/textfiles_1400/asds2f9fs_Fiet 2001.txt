This is the second article in a set of two in this issue that deals with challenges
in entrepreneurship education related to theory building and pedagogy. The
first article argued that educators must increase the theoretical content in their
courses if they hope to develop in students the cognitive skills to make better
entrepreneurial decisions. This second article discusses a strategy for teaching entrepreneurship theory.
The difficulty with teaching theory to entrepreneurship students is that they are likely to complain
that “theory is boring! Lectures are boring! School is boring!” All three of these—theory, lecture, and
school can also be irrelevant. We as teachers can also be boring and irrelevant! Students may not understand that learning theory can be highly interesting. Unfortunately, the process used to teach theory could
be boring.
We become boring as teachers when our classroom style becomes predictable because students are
never surprised. We become irrelevant as teachers when we fail to apply theory as a tool to answer student
questions. Good theory can always pass the test of applicability. If we fail to teach our students how to
apply it in surprising ways, it is we who are at fault, not the theory.
An effective strategy for teaching theory to students must be approved by them and monitored by
teachers to be effective. If our purpose is to assist students to become skilled in theory-based competencies,
the most effective method is to establish a student-approved system for class meetings that requires students to practice specific skills. Obtaining student approval is important because almost any system will
work better if students feel good about it. In other words, students acquire competencies through their
practice with theory-based activities.
A theory-based activity approach is based on the assumption that to the extent that a teacher is the
initiator of knowledge transfer, students tend to practice less and acquire fewer competencies. This occurs
because it is the teacher who is the most engaged, not the students, which is the reverse of what is optimal.
One way to evaluate our involvement in the classroom is to ask ourselves if our goal is to have
students leaving class talking about how great we are as a teacher, rather than about how wonderful it
would be to be an entrepreneur. If our students leave talking about being entrepreneurs instead of about
us, we have probably figured out how to involve them in activities that help them to develop personal competencies.

The teacher’s primary role is to achieve student approval of the learning contract and to identify
the theory-based competencies to be mastered. The question for educators faced with ensuring student
mastery is not, “What an I going to teach today?” but “What am I going to have my students do today?”
The teacher’s task can be made easier by delegating part of the responsibility for the second question
to students. Delegation of learning activities to students can introduce more variety and surprises into
the classroom, each of which can aleviate boredom. It also provides teachers an opportunity to work more
closely with students as they attempt to understand theory in anticipation of their classroom assignment to
lead the learning activity.
The remainder of this article discusses how to implement a theory-based activity approach, obstacles
to its success and advantages of its use. The greatest advantage of its use is that students will be learning
theory that can improve their odds of being successful as entrepreneurs. Of course their success depends
upon us as scholars having gone before them and discovered the rules (theory) according to which events
occur (c.f., Whitehead, 1917).  2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION
The United States is entering an important new era of entrepreneurship, which has increased student interest in the field. A surprising demand for information about how
to launch a business has resulted in an explosive growth in the number of classes and
programs. In 1971, there were only 16 colleges and universities teaching entrepreneurship. Today, there are over 800 colleges and universities with entrepreneurship classes,
programs, and initiatives. This new interest is more than just a fad and accurately reflects
an emerging economic environment created by a confluence of changes in the corporate
world, new technology and emerging world markets (Venkatraman 1996). As educators, we will undoubtedly have increased opportunities to influence aspiring entrepreneurs, as well as positively impact economic development, but are we ready to meet
the challenge?
A 1994 national Gallup poll showed that 70% of high school students want to start
their own companies some time in the future. At the same time, it indicated that colleges
and universities throughout the United States have reported tremendous growth in their
students’ interest in learning about entrepreneurship and ultimately becoming entrepreneurs. For example, Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Business reported
that a record 45% of incoming first-year students in 1996 expressed an interest in entrepreneurship as a major. This percentage compared with 30% in 1995, 12% in 1994 and
7% in 1993.
Another example comes from data provided by Stanford University’s Career Center. Whereas a 3% to 4% of the country’s population actually starts a business annually,
it reported that the percentage of its MBAs starting businesses immediately after graduating increased from 3% in 1994 to 10% in 1995.
In addition, approximately 40% of Harvard’s current class of graduating MBA students is planning to pursue a career in the venture capital industry (Bygrave 1997). This
desire to work at evaluating prospective deals contrasts with previous MBA classes at
Harvard that aspired to landing top paying jobs on Wall Street. Increasing numbers of
current students desire to participate in the birthing process of new ventures (Bygrave
1997). However, students are not the only ones interested in associating themselves with
entrepreneurship programs.
Donors from many quarters demonstrate their willingness to financially support
the establishment of entrepreneurship centers and underwrite endowed faculty posi-

tions (c.f., E-Web site at St. Louis University). We also see more student participating
in business plan competitions nationwide and greater interest from foundations that are
willing to help make entrepreneurial education available to ever widening audiences.
Deans and department heads also see the need to ensure that their units keep pace
with this gathering wave of interest in entrepreneurial education. Their interest is partially in response to indications from the American Assembly of College Schools of
Business (AACSB) that entrepreneurship will play a future role in the accreditation
of academic programs. The AACSB recently concluded a gathering for member institutions titled, “AACSB Workshop on Business Schools and Entrepreneurship.” One
noteworthy aspect of the workshop was that the invitation to attend was extended to
entire faculty teams from participating institutions, not just to individual entrepreneurship educators. Its stated purpose was to provide programmatic guidance on how to
integrate entrepreneurship into their missions and programs.
Lastly, during November 1996, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, seven of the top business schools in the country convened a meeting of their deputy deans and heads of their
entrepreneurship programs. Their purpose was to discuss how they ought to respond
collectively and individually to the new market for entrepreneurship education (Low
1997). Although these institutional leaders espoused different approaches for responding to the increased interest in entrepreneurship instruction at their institutions,
they were all paying close attention to it.
Can there be any question about the importance and timeliness of the topic of entrepreneurship education? As Jerry Brown, a former California governor stated when
approached by the legislature to increase funding for education, “I am in favor of education, but education for what?” The answer to his question as it relates to entrepreneurial
education ought to be education using theory-based activities to teach entrepreneurial competencies.
This is the second article in a two-paper set. The first article proposed that our
classrooms should be a world of ideas in which students learn theories that teach them
what they ought to do to succeed. The first article argued that without theory, we really
do not have very much to teach students because we do not know how to teach students
to be lucky or intuitive, which actually may be the objective of some courses. In addition,
the first article argued that it would be better if our classrooms were not places where
we merely exposed our students to atheoretical descriptions of what entrepreneurs actually
do. These arguments were based on an analysis of 18 different entrepreneurship courses,
which covered 116 different topics.
This second article begins by exploring another aspect of the relationship between
theory and the content of our courses. It argues that as entrepreneurship educators we
must link theory with classroom teaching if we are to succeed in honing student competencies to make judgments about the consequences of present decisions.1 Next, it examines pedagogical problems associated with teaching theory-based concepts. Third, it introduces a strategy for developing theory-based activities for teaching entrepreneurial
competencies. It concludes by providing examples of successful activities for teaching
theoretical concepts.

Entrepreneurship as a field is in the process of creating a body of theory-based knowledge. Much of
it is the product of the diverse backgrounds of those who are attracted to the field from other disciplines.

THE LINK BETWEEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP
RESEARCH AND TEACHING
In 1974, I graduated from the first Masters level program in entrepreneurship. Our curriculum consisted largely of listening to very successful entrepreneurs recount how they
had launched their ventures. It was enjoyable, motivational, and very entertaining—
what some might refer to today as “edutainment.” However, by the end of the semester
I was beginning to ask what I had learned. I can only identify a few lessons that actually
could help me to start a business.
After graduate school, I started six different businesses in which I achieved varying
degrees of success. To my surprise, there was little from my previous entrepreneurship
courses that could help me to explain these different outcomes. Of greater concern to
me now is that I am not certain how what I learned would help me to improve my future
changes of success.
In recent years, however business schools have required that all functional disciplines make the transition to theory-grounded, research-based scholarship (c.f., Barney
1997, p. vi.). As scholars we are obligated to teach theory because it is closer to the
truth than observation alone. Truth is knowledge of things as they are, things as they
were and things as they shall be. The truth about the future is the type of truth that is
most interesting to entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are interested in the future because
they frequently must make irreversible commitments of resources with only the hope
of future returns. Descriptions of how things are or were will not necessarily assist entrepreneurs to predict how things will be in the future. Theory is used to explain what is
not obvious through observation.2 Entrepreneurship theory is a set of empirical generalizations about the world, economy, and how entrepreneurs should behave that allows
for the prediction of true outcomes. Scholars should teach theory to aspiring entrepreneurs because nothing is more practical for them than understanding the consequences
of committing resources to launch a venture.
During the time since my MBA studies, researchers have enriched our understanding of entrepreneurial outcomes and provided powerful frameworks to interpret what
entrepreneurs should do, as well as predict their success.3 Although most entrepreneurship theory does not have a distinctive origin in entrepreneurship, it nevertheless helps
us to understand better how we create wealth. For example, agency theory (i.e., Eisenhardt 1989; Fama and Jensen 1983; Jensen 1994; Jensen and Meckling 1976), procedural
justice theory (i.e., Lind, Kulik, Ambrose and de Vera Park 1993; Fiet, Busenitz, Moesel,
and Barney 1997) and transaction cost economics (i.e., Williamson 1979; 1985) help us
to understand how entrepreneurs without resources can marshal the means to launch
an entirely new business; informational economics theory (i.e., Fiet 1996; Gifford 1992,
in press; Hayak 1945) and decision making (i.e., Bateman and Zeithaml 1989; Busenitz
and Barney 1997; Hitt and Tyler 1991) help us to understand why some entrepreneurs
are able to recognize an economically lucrative opportunity that others miss; industrial
organization economics (i.e., Barney and Ouchi, Porter 1985), game theory, and competitive dynamics (i.e., Barney 1997; Cheng 1997; Grimm, C. M., and Smith 1997; Nielsen
1988) provide insights into why some industries are simply more attractive than others;
the resource based theory of the firm (i.e., Barney 1997; Wernerfeldt 1984) helps us to
2

these frameworks.

understand the sustainability of competitive advantage; Austrian economics (i.e., Jacobson 1992; Kirzner 1985; Schumpeter 1936) and the theories of hypercompetition (i.e.,
D’Aveni 1994) and the new competitive landscape (i.e., Bettis and Hitt 1995) help us
to understand the necessity of continually reinventing a company’s offerings if it hopes
to avoid obsolescence and oblivion. These theories, among others, provide cogent intellectual premises that students can use to analyze complex scenarios.4 Most of these areas
of inquiry were either not developed until recently or were not applied to the study
of entrepreneurs.5
Despite how far we have come in our understanding of entrepreneurs, there is still
much that we do not know about them. Furthermore, if we are to improve the substance
of what we teach to entrepreneurship students, in my view, we need to do two things.
First, entrepreneurship scholars must pursue theory-driven research agendas. Second,
entrepreneurship teachers must ensure their students understand that there are various
theoretical explanations of the differences in entrepreneurial outcomes.6

The Importance of Theory-Driven Research Agendas
Colin Camerer (1985) observed that many research findings tend to “accumulate rather
than cumulate.” This accumulation of inconsequential facts occurs because too much
research is exploratory rather than confirmatory. Many of us have tended to report interesting bits of data without answering the “so what” question, which is—“Why should
we care about this new bit of data?” The difference between data and information is
that information signals the observer that a response from the observer is appropriate,
whereas data must be interpreted and is often interpreted differently by those who receive it. Too much of our research provides us with data only and fails to answer the
“so what” question. The inevitable result is that it makes little or no theoretical contribution to what we know about entrepreneurs. We should not be satisfied with this type
of research because “. . . it is insufficient to transmit and apply present knowledge. It
is the function of higher education to advance the state of knowledge as well” (Barney 1997).
If our research is to pass the “so what” test, it should satisfy two criteria. First, much
more of it should be theory-driven rather than descriptive, because after all, we have
been reporting descriptive research findings for most of the last 25 years. This descriptive
research has done little to help us predict entrepreneurial outcomes. Second, we should
4
A related issue is that many researchers who do test theory-driven questions use single, rather than
multiple perspectives do so, which may limit their fields of vision. They may in fact subject their work to
academic autobiography. (Refer to previous article (Part I) for a discussion of academic autobiography).
Some researchers justify single perspective approaches based on the internal consistency of their arguments.
However, these approaches are not necessarily contradictory, could in fact be complementary, and could lead
us to a more sophisticated level of understanding (c.f., Fiet, Busenitz, Moesel and Barney 1997). A worthwhile
discussion would be to examine the merits of multidisciplinary approaches to doing research. Unfortunately,
this important topic is beyond the scope of this paper.
5
As mentioned in the first article, there is some debate about whether each of these areas of inquiry
has actually matured into a full-fledged theory. Because they originate from different disciplines, it is more
difficult to arrive at a consensus about what constitutes a theory. This paper uses a Daftian approach that
assumes that theory is nothing more than telling a story about how certain factors may influence future events.
6
This paper makes a distinction between entrepreneurial theories and the indicated competencies for
starting a business. In most cases, students can assume the major responsibility for learning these theories from
assigned readings before they come to class. Class time is used better for the application of these theories to
specific problems faced by entrepreneurs. Ideally, these applications would be activity-based exercises.

<-----Page 5----->106

integrate research findings and theory in a way that can be understood and applied
by students.

The Role of Theory in an Entrepreneurship Course
As Bill Bygrave (1993), the Director of Entrepreneurial Studies at Babson College,
noted, “there are two ways to ruin an entrepreneurship course. The first way is to have
it consist entirely of the practical application and analysis of cases. (A course consisting
only of practical applications and cases provides us with no basis for assisting students
to act on the basis of their decisions). The second way is to have it be entirely theory”.
(A course consisting only of theory could be an arid wasteland where only the most
intellectually curious students would succeed. Most of the rest of the students would
become bored and would be unlikely to develop understanding of the concepts.)
Clearly, Kuhn (1970) was correct when he noted, “there really isn’t anything quite as
practical as a good theory.” Ideally, good theory will help us to make predictions about
the consequences of our decisions. A good course requires the practical application of
theory to “immediate events” and we must take some responsibility for its application
(Whitehead 1917).

PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TEACHING
THEORETICAL CONCEPTS
“Theory is boring! Lectures are boring! School is boring!” All three of these—theory,
lecture, and school can also be irrelevant. We as teachers can also be boring and irrelevant!7 Students may not understand that learning theory can be highly interesting. Unfortunately, the process used to teach theory can be boring.
We become boring when our classroom style becomes predictable. Predictability
means that our students are never surprised. When we use approaches that are predictable, students become bored. Some negative consequences that can result are students
who daydream, students who are uncooperative, and students who substitute previously
learned skills for those that they were supposed to have learned in class. They did not
learn the new concept because they were too bored to listen when it was introduced.
Taken to the extreme, individual boredom can translate into collective boredom that can
even infect us as teachers.
We become irrelevant as teachers when we fail to apply theory as a tool to answer
student questions. This can occur in three ways. First, when we are teaching weak theory
that was not generated in the search for practical solutions to entrepreneurial problems.
Second, when we resort solely to recounting war stories and anecdotes that lack generalizability. Students can discern between education and entertainment.8 The former exposes them to principles that enable them to make predictions about the consequences
of their decisions. The second way provides short-term satisfaction through its entertain7
A potentially challenging issue for entrepreneurship educators is that students know that most entrepreneurs have succeeded without formal training in entrepreneurship. So not only do we have to avoid being
boring—we have to convince them that we can provide them with tools and information that will increase
their prospects of success as entrepreneurs.
8
Examples such as case studies, guest speakers, and discussion of daily events can be used to illustrate
theory, but over-reliance on them without exploring their theoretical context is inappropriate because alone
they lack generalizability.

<-----Page 6----->ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATORS

107

ment component, but students can discern the difference. The third way that teachers
can become irrelevant is when they fail to apply theory to resolve situations that students
can reasonably expect to encounter in their own careers. Thus, good theory can always
pass the test of applicability. If we fail to teach our students how to apply it, it is we who
are at fault, not the theory.
Many of our textbooks contribute to the boredom problem because they consist
largely of tautological discussions of the functional areas of business—mostly reworked
discussions of introductory courses that lack an independent justification for their importance. Where is the theory in these treatments? What do these books contribute
that will help aspirants to recognize the future ramifications of their entrepreneurial
decisions. These approaches contain few surprises for students. So not only are these
functional level treatments repetitious, they are also common and unremarkable. Because functional material tends to change very slowly, professors can make it appear
even more common by lecturing from old notes. Even instructors who are assigned the
responsibility of teaching these concepts can find it difficult to maintain their excitement
about them. They, too, can become bored—bored with the material and bored with
students who are bored with the material.

A STRATEGY FOR TEACHING THEORY-BASED
ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES
An effective strategy for teaching theory-based entrepreneurial competencies must be
approved by students and monitored by teachers to be effective. An entrepreneurial
competency consists of a combination of skills, knowledge and resources that distinguish
an entrepreneur from his or her competitors. Entrepreneurs largely acquire competencies on an individual basis. For student-entrepreneurs to master a competency in the
classroom, they must be fully engaged in activities that will teach it to them. Thus, both
students and teachers have a role in the acquisition of competencies.

A Student-Approved System
If our strategy as entrepreneurship educators is to assist students to become skilled in
theory-based competencies, the most effective method is to establish a student-approved
system for class meetings that requires students to practice specific skills until they become
competencies. The acquisition of relevant competencies will enable us as educators to
effectively respond to our students when they ask the “so what” question.
Obtaining approval from students for our teaching approach is important because
almost any system of learning will work better if the students feel good about it and
are committed to it.9 In contrast, if students have reservations about the appropriateness
or fairness of the approach, even the most thoroughly reasoned and well-intended approach will not work as well as it could. Consequently, one of the most important class
sessions is the one where we initially gauge the extent of student acceptance of the ap9
There is much that can be learned from the Hawthorne studies about participants feeling good about
group processes. Although the Hawthorne studies did not examine student subjects, these studies suggest
that teachers should be sensitive to achieving the proper atmosphere in class as a part of achieving their learning objectives.

<-----Page 7----->108

proach.10 If we do not secure student acceptance, our approach will fail in the sense
that students will be less willing to take responsibility for their own learning. On the
surface, it may appear that they are complying with classroom requirements. However,
during class their reservations are likely to distract them from concentrating on the key
concepts under discussion. Away from class they will not be thinking about how they
can use them to launch their own venture. If we substitute fear tactics for student approval, we will probably secure compliance. However, over the long-term, when students have a choice about whether to consider starting their own businesses, they may be
inclined to avoid it based on the unpleasantness of their earlier entrepreneurship class.
This approach is also based on the assumption that to the extent that a teacher is
the initiator of knowledge transfer, students tend to practice less and acquire fewer competencies. This occurs because it is the teacher who is the most engaged, not the students,
which is the reverse of what is optimal. The students are the ones who are most in need
of learning. Worse, as argued previously, students often become bored with predictable
class routines in which they play a limited role, which further inhibits their learning and
mastery of skills.11
One way to evaluate our involvement in the classroom is to ask ourselves if our goal
is to have students leaving class talking about how great we are as a teacher, rather than
about how wonderful it would be to be an entrepreneur. If our students leave talking
about being entrepreneurs instead of about us, we have probably figured out how to
involve them in activities that help them to develop personal competencies.

The Teacher’s Role
The teacher’s primary role is to achieve student approval of the learning contract and
to identify the competencies to be mastered.12 Thus, the question for educators faced
with ensuring student mastery of competencies is not, “What am I going to teach today?”13 but “What am I going to have my students do today?” Moreover, the question
10
The most memorable session for gaining approval of my activity-based approach happened by accident before I knew of its effectiveness. I had been using a lecture-based approach laced with a voluminous
number of overheads. I had just completed a contract for producing overheads for a textbook. As I walked
confidently to the first class with my folder of 25 overheads, the following question occurred to me: “If I were
a student, would I want to see any of these overheads?” The answer that came to me was a resounding “No!”
So when I arrived at class, I handed the folder of overheads to a student on the first row, and asked him to
describe its content to the class. He said that it contained “a bunch of overheads.” I then mentioned to the
class that I had a similar folder of overheads for every session scheduled during that semester. They were
quite surprised when I asked them, “How many of you want to see them?” The hisses and boos were so loud
that it took a while to hear their collective pleas for mercy. “Anything, but the overheads”—that part was
unanimous. I said that I would make a deal with them that they would not have to see the overheads if everyone
of them agreed to become involved in class activities. All of this was spontaneous, and the most successful
teaching experience that I had ever had. I have never gone back to a lecture-based approach.
11
It is certainly true that any material could be taught in a boring predictable fashion, so this particular
argument is not about course content; it is about how to make the teaching of entrepreneurship concepts
and competencies more inviting to students.
12
The contract is a two-way street, and the teacher must be willing to more than meet the students’
commitments. On the instructor’s side, the professional nature of the contract and its surrounding relationship
will be shown by: (1) careful and complete preparation for the classroom experience (2) concern and devotion
to the students in all dealings, including those in the classroom and in the office, and (3) striving to make
the course a satisfying developmental experience. By and large, the more the teacher does, the more the
students will do” (Harvard Business School Publishing, 1994).
13
Some advocates of active learning approaches from educational psychology argue that a more relevant
question is, “What should students learn through self-discovery today” (Miles 1997). It is true that much
learning is self-discovery. I prefer the emphasis on “doing,” however, because it provides teachers with an

<-----Page 8----->ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATORS

109

of “What am I going to have my students do today” can be delegated to students and
there are some advantages to doing so if the instructor will set boundaries within which
student activities may be selected. Delegating responsibility for the selection of specific
learning activities to students can introduce more variety and surprises into the classroom,
each of which can alleviate boredom.
At the beginning of each class, the teacher or assigned students introduce the concept
to be mastered and the associated learning activities. These activities should be extensions
of previously assigned reading material that provides the theoretical basis for the competency to be mastered. During the activities that follow it is imperative that students understand that the activity is only one application of the underlying theoretical concept from
the assigned readings. The theoretical application can also be productively related to
why some entrepreneurs succeed and others fail. It is not necessary to review assigned
reading materials in class unless they are widely misunderstood. Normally the theoretical
issues can be exposed as students engage in the assigned activities.
The responsibility for deciding which activities are most appropriate for teaching
a competency may be assigned to groups of students, to a single student, or it may be
retained by the instructor.14 The activities should be ones that assist students to understand and apply underlying course concepts. A common characteristic of each of these
activities is that they must involve every student. This enables students to receive immediate feedback from those in the class. In this setting, the teacher may move around
the classroom as a coach, rather than an evaluator of student performance.
During student-led activities, the teacher participates by initiating discussion and facilitating learning by individual students as they participate in the activities. Teachers
should also feel free to participate in the activities. Judgment about the appropriateness
of teacher participation is required, however, when the activities become competitions
among student teams. Sometimes teacher participation stimulates the competition, and
at other times, particularly if the opposition feels overwhelmed, competition is diminished.
Often the most stimulating activities are those that arouse competitive discussion
among students about the appropriateness of different analyses. The discussion of these
analyses frequently becomes very animated, but seldom becomes rancorous because
students have previously accepted the format for the class and realize that they will have
their turn to “win” with their particular activity, if they choose.
Appendix 1 contains an example of an activity that was designed by a student to
teach his classmates about agency theory. It is a negotiation exercise intended to illustrate some of the difficulties in marshalling resources to launch/acquire a new venture.
Appendix 2 contains an example of an activity that can be used to illustrate how biases
can intercede to change the predictions of the theory of rational expectations and marobservable way of gauging student learning outcomes. It is very challenging to gauge student learning without
observable outcomes.
14
If the instructor decides to delegate the selection of learning activities to students, it is normally beneficial to have them explain the activity to the instructor before class. By checking with them prior to class,
the instructor can be assured that they will effectively facilitate the achievement of the learning objectives
by class members. An advantage of using students to organize the activities it that they often develop unique
approaches, which are fun for students, and introduce more variety into the classroom. Nevertheless, delegating to students will fail to achieve its learning objectives if the instructor views it as a way of avoiding work.
The instructor continues to have responsibility for what occurs in class. In some ways, delegating to students
requires more work because it requires more out-of-class preparation by the instructor than simply delivering
a lecture or organizing the learning activity by him or herself.

<-----Page 9----->110

ket efficiency. This particular activity is also an effective method for interrupting the
boredom of a class routine.

ADVANTAGES OF THEORY-BASED ACTIVITIES
There are several advantages of using theory-based activities. For example, they avoid
boredom by inviting student-generated surprises to play a role in the learning environment. It is also easier to enlist the entire class as mentors in a theory-based learning
approach, which facilitates class-wide learning. In addition, if the learning activities are
part of a clearly outlined set of procedures for succeeding as an entrepreneur, focusing
on specific skills avoids students asking the “so what” question, which is primarily an
issue of relevance. Using theory-based activities positions the instructor as a coach and
mentor rather than a lecturer who delivers information from a textbook or a lesson in a
boring predictable manner. Finally, using theory-based activities can potentially involve
every student in the learning process.

OBSTACLES TO USING THEORY-BASED ACTIVITIES
Switching from a traditional lecture format to theory-based activities can be quite difficult, especially for someone who enjoys exercising professorial control. We feel responsible for what our students learn and we want to control how the learning occurs. We
may secretly harbor fears that the students will learn less and that we will be responsible
for allowing that to occur.15 When we feel this way we forget that we are deluding ourselves if we believe that we can control everything that our students think or learn. We
forget that most of what captures the attention of our students during class is controlled
by the students themselves, and not by us, which is the reason that it is fundamentally
important for our students to accept the change.
The loss of predictability during class can be threatening to professors who would
prefer to control more closely the process themselves. Surprisingly, it can be threatening
to students also because they think that the evaluation of their work and learning could
be adversely affected by their perception of less classroom structure.16 Many of these
students expect us to tell them what is most important to learn. What they do not realize
is that we are freer to do so without structure because we can intervene at any time.
Because this is a legitimate student concern, it is critical at the end of class that we summarize what has been learned. In essence, we have to answer the “so what” question
for them. If we ritualistically tell students what they have learned at the end of class,
they will soon relax and join with us in the fun of learning that precedes our summary.
15
My limited experience refutes concerns that students will learn less. Using examinations of comparable difficulty, my average scores increased by 20% by switching to theory-based activities. This improvement
has remained stable since making the change. My teacher evaluation scores have improved by more than
20% on a 5-point scale. Not only are my students learning more, but also think that I am doing a better job
by allowing them to become active participants.
16
A theory-based activity approach follows a clear pedagogical structure and the more alert students
who have understood the theory presented in their readings will perceive it without resistance. Most students
who have had difficulty with the theory will probably understand it during class as it is applied in specific
activities. Once this latter group understands the theory, it will probably also see the structure. At the end
of each class, the instructor summarizes the concepts that have been taught and applied in class. At that point,
the majority of students who have not learned the theory through classroom activities should understand
them. Those who are still unclear about what has been taught should be invited to visit privately with
the instructor.

Suppose that a student were making an oral presentation of her understanding of
a concept that she misconstrued. Under a more rigid system, courtesy could dictate that
the instructor either not provide feedback during the presentation or at least wait until
after the student had finished. However, using a theory-based activity format, an instructor can explain to students that acceptable classroom protocol is a free wheeling exchange of ideas that does not allow for “a wait until you are finished” protocol. Instead,
class members and the instructor may interject questions that are directed at both the
class and the presenter. For example, any listener might say, “Class, given Sally’s argument, what conditions would have to hold for her to be correct?” Also, the listener might
follow up with, “What evidence is there for Sally’s conditions?” Finally, the listener
might add, “What alternative conditions might also explain her conclusions?” Such a
series of questions could expose her logic, which could normally be true, so long as we
understand her conditions and evidence.
Another obstacle to the use of theory-based activities is that it seemingly requires
preparation for multiple class scenarios. The fallacy in this concern is that it presupposes
that all preparation for these scenarios occurs shortly before class. This fallacy is well
illustrated by the critic who claimed that, “The secret to good teaching is to act as if
you have known all your life the things that you have prepared just before class.” Fortunately, we are not restricted in the learning that we can bring to class. In fact, we can
use prior experiences to develop theory-based activities to teach more effectively.
Lastly, instructors who use theory-based activities quickly learn that it requires a
major time commitment when done correctly with few institutional rewards. Thus, we
often find that instructors rely more upon passive lecture approaches because they can
be accomplished within acceptable evaluative tolerances, particularly when the institution is dependent upon grants to support its research agendas.

THE DISCOVERY OF THEORY-BASED ACTIVITIES
Specific theory-based activities are usually discovered one at a time through the process
of trying things. Some will work and others will be less successful, but the process will
never be boring. The most effective activities for teaching theory are related to specific
people, places, timing, relationships, and special circumstances (c.f., Hayek 1945). These
activities often have ephemeral results, because otherwise, as students, we would expect
them and be less surprised. Someone has referred to them as “silver bullets.” When
the class seems to be getting bored, he fires a “silver bullet” to liven things up. Sharon
Gifford at Rutgers University refers to “lobbing grenades” to shake things up. The most
effective teachers are able to shake things up in their own way by making students do
things that generate surprising, theory-based results. The most stimulating classes are
those in which the members of the class are constantly on the alert for a “silver bullet”
or are ducking a “grenade.”
Compiling a list of theory-based activities may not be effective because as the activities become known to students, they may cease to be surprising.17 This may not be a
short-range problem, but repetition of the same techniques can become as well known
to students as our test banks, if we use them. When the activities cease to be surprising
17
I have had some success collaborating with colleagues at the Rensselear retreat to compile a list of
theory-based activities. However, I am expecting to rotate the use of these activities to keep them out of
student circulation and to maintain their freshness.

to students, they no longer say, “ah ha.” Losing the “ah ha” factor also means that an
activity has lost most of its pedagogical benefits. Worse, if the list became well known,
it could become trivialized and an obstacle to learning.
If we cannot think of one theory-based activity, we may want to do the following:
Assign a group of students the responsibility to present a particular theory-based topic.
Explain to them that they can present it any way that they wish except that originality
will be rewarded and boredom will be penalized. Plead with them not to bore the class.
In this way, we share the responsibility for creating the activity with our students. We
do not have to worry that our students will not be able to create an interesting activity
because we can and should review their activities with them before class. Our students
may develop many ideas, from TV game shows, to invited role-playing, to in-class calisthenics. I suspect that our own enjoyment of teaching and learning will increase as we
participate more in the process.

APPENDIX 1 A Student-Designed Theory-Based Activity
Theoretical Applications
As suggested by agency theory, this activity illustrates the difficulties that entrepreneurs may encounter
as they attempt to marshal resources. Agency theory suggests that they must provide incentives to entice
a resource supplier because he or she has separate and possibly divergent interests from those of
the entrepreneur.
Practical Application
Structuring the deal.

Instructions for Instructor
This exercise works well as a contest between competing teams of sellers and buyers. Several teams
can negotiate simultaneously until all pairs of teams have struck a deal or agreed that they are too far
apart to eventually agree. A short recap of the process of negotiation in each pair provides an instructive
and often entertaining way to conclude the session, which can take 30 to 45 minutes.
Instructions for Seller
You are in the ski and sports equipment manufacturing business. You want to retire. You decide to
sell your business and all its assets and head to Bermuda to wear flowered shirts and sit on the beach
all day drinking non-alcoholic beverages.
Current balance sheet:
Assets
Accounts receivable
Inventory
Equipment
Building

$1,000,000
2,500,000
500,000
$1,000,000

Liabilities
Accounts payable

$2,000,000

You have had another offer for $6,000,000, but the buyers have questionable backgrounds and you are
not sure if you want to entrust your business to them.
Negotiate!
(The other group has received slightly different information. That is, they do not know everything
you know.)

Instructions to Buyer
You really want this ski and sports equipment manufacturing business! This business is a great set up.
It is already established with steady sales and a good customer base. You have had a chance to examine
all the records with the help of your trusted, long-time CPA friend and you are both positive that there
are no discrepancies in the records.
Current balance sheet:
Assets
Accounts receivable
Inventory
Equipment
Building

$1,000,000
$2,500,000
$500,000
$1,000,000

Liabilities
Accounts payable
Estimates by an independent appraiser
Book value of company
Present value of estimated cash
Flows for next 5 years

$2,000,000
$3,000,000
$11,500,000

You have a $4 million line of credit with your local bank, which must be paid back at 20 percent within
one year unless you can renegotiate it. You also have a rich uncle with $1 million to invest (he trusts
your judgement). In addition, you have inherited $2 million. The amount to be paid and the terms of
the deal (how the purchase price will be paid) need to be negotiated.
How much are you willing to pay for this business?
You should now negotiate with the seller to buy the business. Start dealing?
(The other group has received slightly different information. That is, they do not know everything that
you know.)

APPENDIX 2 An Instructor-Designed Theory-Based Activity
Theoretical Application
Biases can predispose us to view the world in a certain way, which could be contrary to the theory of
rational expectations and market efficiency.
Learning Objective
To help students realize that critically evaluating their conclusions as entrepreneurs and in life is not
a process that should come naturally to most of them.
Related Objective
I ask students which is more important to them as aspiring entrepreneurs, theory or understanding real
situations that entrepreneurs face. I try to help them to realize that theory helps them to make predictions
and that the best theory is based on real situations facing entrepreneurs, so the question really presents
a false dichotomy. In addition, I note that if they answered, “real situations facing entrepreneurs,” that
that itself is a theory about the value of theory. I suggest to them that although they may have a negative
view of theory, one of the objectives of the course is to show them how theory can be useful in making
predictions using incomplete information.

(185):1124–1131.
Instructions for Instructor
I emphasize to my students that all theory is a simplification of reality. However, we assume that it can
be useful, if properly applied, to assist us in making predictions about the future. The proper application
of theory depends upon not violating the assumptions of the theory. Because no theory is without flaws,
I attempt to expose them to as many theoretical perspectives as possible during my courses. Meanwhile,
I explain to them that they can determine themselves if they are properly applying theory to their personal
circumstances by using three criteria: (1) Upon what assumption(s) does this conclusion depend?, (2)
What evidence is there for the assumption?, and (3) What alternative assumptions could also explain
their conclusion? If a real situation only satisfies some of a theory’s assumptions, the students must
develop a modified version of the theory that does coincide with reality.
Because the world is complex, and because we often are influenced by our habits, we fail to apply these
three tests. Thus, we often fail to properly apply theory to improve our decision making, if we apply
it at all. To demonstrate that we make many decisions without thinking, I have the students engage in
the following activity.

APPENDIX 2 Continued
Instructor-Led Activity
Steps:
1. Request that everyone stand and separate themselves as much as they can from their neighbors
(so that they do not collide with each other).
2. I then ask everyone to imitate what I am doing by raising their hands to about shoulder
level and wiggling their fingers.
3. I next ask them to follow me by quickly clasping their hands with their fingers interlaced.
Afterward, I ask them to note which thumb is on top of their clasped hands.
4. We repeat steps two and three twice more, each time noting which thumb was on top after
clasping their hands.
5. In nearly all cases, students will observe that the same thumb was on top each of the three times.
6. Next, I ask the students to begin flapping their arms like a bird. This will cause some giggling,
but maintain your composure and insist that everyone follow your lead. (I have done these
exercises with undergraduates, graduates, executive education students, and community luminaries—each time enjoying very good success).
7. At the count of three, ask everyone to fold very quickly their arms and to note which arm
was on top.
8. Repeat step #7.
9. Again, ask everyone to repeat step #7, but this time trying to change the arm that was on
top. They will find this very awkward to do, however some will succeed through the force
of will and concentration.
10. Ask them if they realize why it was difficult to change the arm that was on top or why it
was the same thumb that was on top after each round.
11. I tell them that I do not know about their thumbs, but that they have been folding their
arms in the same way for a very long time. Then I ask them if they know for how long. The
answer is since before they were born. Sonograms of babies in the womb show them crossing
their arms in the same way as they do later in life. This suggests that some of the things we
do, we do without consciously thinking of them.
