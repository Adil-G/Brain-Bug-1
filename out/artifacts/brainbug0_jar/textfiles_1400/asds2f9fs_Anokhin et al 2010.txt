Entrepreneurs respond to opportunities that come in two basic forms: innovation and arbitrage.
This article presents a technique called the minimum performance inefficiency (MPI)
estimation method that could be used to estimate arbitrage opportunities. The technique has
several advantages over the conceptually similar data envelopment analysis (DEA) and
other techniques. The authors validate the technique with a well-known data set and illustrate
its use based on secondary data from the publishing industry.

T

he notion of opportunities is central to entrepreneurship research (Shane & Venkataraman,
2000). Entrepreneurs do not operate in a vacuum to create wealth but respond to
opportunities that come in two basic forms, innovation and arbitrage. Innovative
(Schumpeterian) opportunities mainly relate to creating new combinations of goods
and services, raw materials, and production methods (also known as ends, means, and
means-ends frameworks1) that result in more efficiently using certain resources. Compared
to existing uses of these resources, the benefits of pursuing new combinations outweigh the
costs (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Schumpeter, 1934). This new efficiency is then converted
into economic benefits that the creative entrepreneur appropriates as entrepreneurial rents
(Alvarez & Barney, 2004). Arbitrage (Kirznerian) opportunities, in contrast, exist because
markets are inefficient and do not adjust instantaneously to changing realities (Kirzner,
2008). As a result, resources are often priced differently in different markets, and those who
notice discrepancies can promptly exploit them. Thus, while innovative entrepreneurs
generate profit through new resource combinations, alert arbitrageurs profit by removing
market inefficiencies. Although the benefits of pursuing arbitrage opportunities are finite,
the risks involved are typically lower. As a result, many entrepreneurs concentrate on
arbitrage opportunities rather than on attempting to innovate (Rivkin, 2001).
The entrepreneurship literature conceptually recognizes both innovative (sometimes
explicitly called entrepreneurial) and arbitrage (sometimes called optimizing or trivial)

opportunities. Yet, research to date has not offered an acceptable operationalization of arbitrage opportunities and has instead focused on Schumpeterian innovation. Currently, there is
no established way to assess the number of arbitrage opportunities a company might exploit
within a certain industry.
Conceptually, such operationalization should solve two problems. First, it should identify the technological frontier by locating benchmark firms and modeling their efficiency.
Second, it should quantify discrepancies between the firms’ resource allocation and the
benchmark. Interestingly, a group of techniques exists that are uniquely qualified for this
task. Although the management and innovation literatures have used these techniques in the
past (Dutta, Narasimhan, & Rajiv, 2005; Thursby & Thursby, 2002), they have never been
employed to quantify arbitrage opportunities. We believe that using these techniques will
be of significant value to the field of entrepreneurship.
In this article, we outline the basic approaches that could be used for this task and review
previously used techniques found in extant research. Importantly, we explicate the features
of the most widely used techniques that render them less desirable for quantifying arbitrage
opportunities. We also suggest an alternative technique—minimum performance inefficiency
(MPI)—that resolves the challenges inherent to other approaches. We demonstrate the use
and benefits of MPI using a previously validated data set with known properties and illustrate
its application using secondary data on the publishing industry from 1998 to 2003. Although
our technique allows analysis of opportunities at multiple levels, we focus on the industry level.

Identifying and Measuring Arbitrage Opportunities
From Innovative to Arbitrage Opportunities
Industries differ with respect to the amount of entrepreneurial activity they generate and
sustain. Because entrepreneurship implies the nexus of entrepreneurs and opportunities
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), it is reasonable to assume that the number of opportunities
to which entrepreneurs respond differs among industries. Extant research has acknowledged
this reality and has developed accepted means to measure the innovative opportunities
available in different industries. These measures include perceived opportunities for product innovation, technological innovation, R&D spending, industry technological breakthroughs (Zahra, 1996), and average industry R&D divided by average industry sales
(Tihanyi, Johnson, Hoskisson, & Hitt, 2003).
Innovation, however, is not always necessary for entrepreneurial rents to exist. Because
markets are imperfect and resource owners have bounded rationality, certain changes may
render existing resource pricing ineffective. Such changes may be attributed to general
forces or external events—such as military conflicts, political instability, or changes in consumer tastes—but may also reflect recent discovery or creation of hitherto unknown products, markets, or other advances within a particular industry (Kirzner, 2008). Regardless, in
many industries opportunities can be found due to already existing but as yet widely unnoticed changes that may be exploited by alert arbitrageurs.
To benefit from arbitrage opportunities, entrepreneurs must employ their resources in a
manner similar to the most successful companies in their industry.2 Often, significant

improvements in deploying resources efficiently could result from a novel means-ends
framework discovered by an original innovator (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003), which alert arbitrageurs could imitate.3 Even a relatively insignificant innovation in a low-tech industry
such as residential landscaping may disturb market balance and generate opportunities for
rent extraction by imitators. For example, a small start-up company called ChemLawn of
Troy, Ohio (now known as TruGreen) pioneered a novel concept of liquid lawn care in
1968. It had discovered a cost-efficient way to uniformly apply fertilizer to customers’
lawns. By acquiring the basic ingredients of commercial lawn food, mixing them, and
applying the mixture for customers in a novel way, ChemLawn turned into a powerful competitor for sellers of higher priced, premixed products produced by companies such as O.M.
Scott and Ortho. This innovation has led to enormous company growth (ChemLawn’s sales
exceeded U.S.$300 million in 1985) but also opened arbitrage opportunities for lawn care
businesses who later imitated the concept of liquid lawn care (Nayak & Ketteringham,
1986). Rivkin (2001) provides another illustration of this concept by discussing White Castle and its imitators.

On Quantifying Opportunities
With this article, we suggest a group of models that are uniquely appropriate for quantifying arbitrage opportunities. The models define the technological frontier in the industry
and then measure how far inefficient firms are from the frontier. Arbitrage opportunities
imply optimization under already existing (but not yet necessarily standard) means-ends
frameworks. Therefore, to evaluate the magnitude of arbitrage opportunities available to
a firm, one needs to assess the effectiveness with which the firm combines its resources
against a benchmark. In this case, the benchmark is the industry’s leaders—that is, those
who are best at combining resources (inputs) to produce certain outputs. This distance from
the industry’s best-known way to combine resources thus represents (or should be proportional to or at least monotonically related to) the room available for optimization. For this
method to be effective, narrowly defined industry membership is important for several reasons. First, a narrow definition ensures that inputs and outputs are comparable across different firms. Second, narrowly defining the industry is important because similar
resources (e.g., human or technological resources) may yield dramatically different returns
in different industries (e.g., biotechnology vs. residential landscaping).
For firms that define the industry’s best technologies, arbitrage opportunities would only
be available if a general change—such as consumer preferences—occurs. Without this kind
of change, there is no better use for resources that firms could possibly imitate to earn higher
entrepreneurial profit. Less efficient firms, however, can imitate their industry’s leaders;
innovation is neither the only nor the best way for them to improve efficiency. Imitation
allows less efficient firms to learn from industry leaders and move closer to the frontier
without facing the uncertainty associated with innovation. Thus, such companies will be
motivated to imitate (move toward the frontier) until they reach the level of efficiency similar to that of industry leaders. Because innovation never stops, this process never concludes. An industry’s technological frontier becomes somewhat of a horizon for
inefficient firms, because the frontier continues to move away as firms approach it.

Review and Critique of Existing Techniques
Techniques capable of measuring arbitrage opportunities are collectively known as
‘‘efficiency evaluation techniques.’’ According to Färe, Grosskopf, and Russell (1998),
these techniques can be classified into four main categories: (a) parametric deterministic
(Aigner-Chu); (b) parametric stochastic (stochastic frontier estimation or SFE); (c) nonparametric deterministic (data envelopment analysis or DEA); and (d) nonparametric stochastic techniques (stochastic DEA or SDEA). Aigner-Chu models (Aigner, Lovel, &
Schmidt, 1976; Førsund, Lovell, & Schmidt, 1980) constitute a class of frontier estimation
models that have maximum likelihood properties when specific distribution assumptions
govern the errors. This class has not been used widely because such distribution assumptions are rarely found to hold. SDEA involves a number of judgmentally assigned parameters. As such, it may be regarded as a kind of exploratory tool. Of the remaining
approaches, DEA is the most commonly used, followed by SFE. Accordingly, we consider
DEA and SFE in more detail, with particular attention to the underlying logic of DEA as the
most popular approach to evaluating efficiency.
DEA models (see e.g., Charnes, Cooper, Lewin, & Seiford, 1994, for detail and mathematical formulation) arose from studying the efficiency of so-called input-output units such as
firms that combine their resources (inputs) to produce different outputs. For simplicity in this
article, we consider labor and capital as the two input variables and sales as the only output
variable. DEA models are based on ratios of weighted sums of outputs and inputs. Output
weights are analogous to prices, whereas input weights are similar to costs. Thus, in essence,
the DEA measure resembles a ratio of output value to input value. Importantly, the DEA
approach is firm-specific: it finds weight values that maximize each firm’s efficiency ratio,
regardless of whether those weights (prices) are consistent with or favorable to other firms.
In reality, however, prices are often set for the entire industry by market mechanisms such
that even somewhat heterogeneous resources such as skilled labor are priced homogenously.
Thus, the fact that DEA permits each firm to have its own set of input costs and output prices
rather than consensus (market-based) weights is problematic and artificially inflates many
firms’ efficiencies. It follows that a firm may be declared fully efficient using its own DEA
weights but not be fully efficient using the weights of another firm. This problem may be
viewed as a kind of rubber yardstick or as Troutt, Ehie, and Brandyberry (2007) termed it,
the ‘‘everything is beautiful in its own way’’ problem of DEA.4
Another view of this issue uses a second interpretation of the DEA weights as quantities
that describe the tangent lines to the efficient frontier. Figure 1 illustrates a case of four efficient firms on a frontier. Weights that make firms A and B efficient determine the line segment passing through points A and B and hence the tangent line of which this segment is a
portion. We can see that firms C and D would not be efficient using this tangent line. In
short, the DEA model appears too generous in allowing each firm to select favorable
weights rather than applying consensus weights equitably to all firms in the industry (such
as industry-specific labor costs).
SFE, as discussed in Banker, Datar, and Rajan (1987), assumes a parametric frontier and
models data observations as departures or errors from the frontier, similar to errors from a
regression function. Because errors in SFE are combinations of a firm’s inefficiency and a
general random disturbance, however, the choice of numerous distributional assumptions

for each of the two error components is very difficult and leads to specification problems.
This may necessitate very large data sets to accurately estimate the parameters.

Using MPI Estimation to Gauge Arbitrage Opportunities
Suggested Approach: MPI Estimation
With the foregoing DEA background, we can now describe this article’s proposed
models. As with DEA, these models begin with ratios of weighted sums of outputs and

<-----Page 6----->60 Organizational Research Methods

inputs. Thus, for the MPI formulation, the ratio of the weighted sum of outputs to the
weighted sum of inputs is considered for each firm. Weights are not free to vary from unit
(e.g., firms, entrepreneurs) to unit as in DEA, however. Instead, the MPI model seeks consensus weights so that all units are held to the same standard of efficiency score calculation.
To determine such consensus weight sets, two considerations are used. First, we assume
that there is an acceptable set of most appropriate weights for inputs and outputs that should
apply to all firms. Specifically, such weights should be those prices and costs that managers
would judge appropriate in a relevant market for outputs and inputs.
Second, a principle is needed to estimate appropriate common weights. We use the MPI
principle. This approach has been developed in Troutt (1995) and Troutt, Gribbin, Shanker,
and Zhang (2000) and is discussed further in Troutt, Pang, and Hou (2004). It is reasoned
that in trying to exploit arbitrage opportunities, each firm wishes to minimize inefficiency.
Thus, on average, all firms attempt to minimize individual inefficiencies in their actions and
decisions. It therefore follows that an industry’s firms as a group attempt to minimize their
average, or equivalently, their total inefficiency. We therefore estimate the weights as those
that minimize the total performance inefficiencies (MPI) of the firms. Alternatively, we
could use the maximum performance efficiency (MPE) formulation, where we estimate the
weights as those that maximize total of the firm efficiencies.
The choice of whether to use the MPE or MPI formulation can be based on computational convenience with respect to the numbers of inputs and outputs, as will be seen in our
application to the illustrative data below. The case of one output, as in our data illustration,
lends itself to MPI and simplifies the calculations. In the MPI case, constraints similar to
those in DEA are used, namely (a) the ratio for each firm will be less than or equal to unity,
and (b) all weights are nonnegative. In terms of the Färe et al. (1998) classification scheme,
MPI may be regarded as deterministic because separate frontier error and inefficiency error
distributions are not required to be assumed. Furthermore, the MPI method is essentially a
parametric method because the input weights of the model determine a linear frontier.
To summarize, the MPI formulation solves a mathematical programming problem that
minimizes the sum of inefficiency ratios (weighted sums of inputs divided by weighted
sums of outputs) subject to the constraints that inefficiency ratios are greater than or equal
to unity for all firms.

Comparison With DEA
DEA uses a maximum objective for each firm’s efficiency ratio (or minimum for inefficiency formulations) as a mathematical way to determine the frontier. This is not the same
as assuming that all firms seek to maximize their performance based on consensus weights,
as with the MPI approach. This has been called the performance improvement motive (Troutt
et al., 2004). The maximization or minimization operations of DEA are motivated by geometric relationships in finding the tangents to the efficient frontiers. In contrast, in the MPI
approach the minimization operations arise as attempts to reproduce firms’ and their managers’ presumed behavior. Consider the performances of the firms that are not on the frontier in
Figure 1 (arbitrageurs). There is a clear indication in this case that most firms are clustering
near the frontier in the direction of the indicated tangent. We interpret this to suggest that

<-----Page 7----->Anokhin et al. / Measuring Arbitrage Opportunities

61

consensus is indicated by emphasizing that particular direction of approach to the frontier. As
noted, performance improvements are reflected in entrepreneurial profits. DEA and other
technical efficiency methods, however, do not necessarily make such an assumption. This
assumption, however, is implicit in our conceptual development.
Figure 1 also suggests that the MPI method gives maximal performance to fewer firms
than does DEA. That is, fewer firms will be considered fully efficient. This is a result of
using consensus weights for all firms. A firm declared efficient in the MPI approach will
also be DEA efficient. However, the opposite does not hold: many DEA-efficient firms will
fail to be MPI efficient. By declaring those firms efficient, DEA fails to indicate arbitrage
opportunities that are, in fact, present for them. Thus, the MPI method may be considered a
more stringent efficiency measure than DEA. This may enhance researchers’ ability to
reveal arbitrage opportunities where methods such as DEA would identify none.5

Validating MPI Compared to DEA
This more stringent nature of the MPI model is further illustrated with Table 1, which is
based on the well-known test data set proposed by Sherman (1981) and discussed in Bowlin,
Charnes, Cooper, and Sherman (1985). This data set gives the inputs and outputs of a set of
15 hypothetical hospitals, each having three inputs and three outputs. Sherman constructed
the data set so that hospitals H1–H7 were intended to be fully efficient, whereas hospitals
H8–H15 had inefficiencies of various degrees.6
Comparing the efficiency scores computed by the general MPI model with the efficiency
scores obtained by the DEA model suggests that the MPI estimates are superior to those
based on DEA. As shown, hospitals H10, H11, H13, and H15 were found to be relatively
inefficient by the MPI model. Only hospital H15 was found to be relatively inefficient by
DEA, however. We regard this as indicating that DEA is not sufficiently sensitive to measure efficiency differences. In contrast, the MPI technique is more sensitive to the presence
of inefficiency than is DEA; in other words, it is more difficult to be efficient under the MPI
approach than the DEA approach. It can also be seen that the MPI method yielded fewer
hospitals misclassified as efficient. In particular, MPI produced four misclassified hospitals,
whereas DEA yielded seven.

Illustration With Actual Data
Finally, to illustrate the use of the MPI estimation technique to measure arbitrage opportunities, we refer to secondary data from 1998–2003 related to the publishing industry
(including newspaper, periodical, book, directory and mailing list, and other publishers
[NAICS codes 51111, 51112, 51113, 51114, and 51119]). Using the Microsoft Excelbased MPI-solver we developed, we calculated the MPI estimates. This tool is available
to researchers at http://mis.kent.edu/Members/abrandyb/mpi/mpi-template.
For each firm, we used Compustat to obtain data on total assets, number of employees, and
sales. Total assets and number of employees were used as model inputs and sales were used as
the model output.7 After removing firms with missing values for any of the variables in any

given year, we retained information on 38 firms. Because publishing is a highly concentrated
industry, we believe that our sample is representative of the prevailing practices in the industry.
Table 2 lists our arbitrage opportunities estimates (AOEs)—the inefficiency measure—
for the industry firms. Estimates of 1.000 indicate perfect efficiency (relative to the firms
used in the computations) and associated lack of arbitrage opportunities. For such firms,
only innovative opportunities could be used to further increase efficiency when combining
these inputs to produce this output, unless an external change occurs that necessitates repricing of the resources that the firms use or their products. AOEs above 1.000 indicate
imperfect efficiency and presence of arbitrage opportunities.
As shown in Table 2, two firms are considered efficient in every year, and we see a gradual change in the firms that determine the industry frontier from year to year. One of the
firms (Reader’s Digest) was at the industry forefront 4 of the 5 years. Two firms (News
Communications and Track Data Corp.) were each defining the frontier during a threeyear period. Finally, one firm (Thomas Nelson Inc.) was the industry’s benchmark for
2 of the 6 years. If our earlier conjectures are correct, these firms should turn primarily
to innovation rather than arbitrage opportunities to pursue entrepreneurial rents, while for
their less efficient counterparts, arbitrage would suffice.

Conclusions
Our study’s contribution need to be viewed in light of its limitations. The chief challenge
of our approach is its implicit assumption of comparability of production functions used by

the firms. If the production functions that firms use are drastically different, their resources
may also differ such that our consensus weights condition may lose its importance. If this is
the case, standard DEA-based models may become an alternative in that they provide for
firm-specific resource costs and output prices. This may be particularly true when opportunities are assessed in a cross-country and not within-industry context, and countries rather
than firms become a unit of analysis. Furthermore, the problem of a market’s homogenous

pricing of heterogeneous resources always exists. Resources employed by competitor firms
with nearly identical products (e.g., Pepsi and Coke) are not truly identical even though
such identity is implicitly assumed when resource prices are taken into consideration for
estimating the frontier. This clearly may become a limitation. Future research should
explore the boundary conditions for applying these techniques in the context of arbitrage
opportunities.
Despite this limitation, one very practical use of the estimates of opportunities obtained
from efficiency evaluation techniques is that they can be used in a second-stage regression
analysis as either independent or dependent variables (Färe et al., 1998). For example, arbitrage opportunities may be considered an alternative driver of entrepreneurial behavior and
strategic choices in addition to innovative opportunities. Similarly, inefficiency scores
might be of interest as dependent variables in models predicting factors that account for persisting or declining arbitrage opportunities over time. In fact, the surprising persistence of
arbitrage opportunities available for the firms in our sample, despite the fact that such
opportunities are obviously short-lived, may suggest path dependencies. This certainly calls
for empirical investigation.
Although exploiting innovative and arbitrage opportunities is key to understanding entrepreneurial dynamics, current entrepreneurship research has not yet provided universally
accepted operationalizations of arbitrage opportunities. This article presents a technique
that may be used for this purpose. The technique calculates arbitrage opportunities by quantifying the possibilities a firm has to improve the efficiency with which it combines
resources to an optimal level under the current means-ends framework. We believe this
technique is an important contribution to entrepreneurship research and hope that it will
encourage empirical studies that consider opportunities in their entirety.

Notes
1. In the entrepreneurship literature, ‘‘new ends’’ refers to new products and services (e.g., the introduction
of Crocs shoes in 2002); ‘‘new means’’ refers to new inputs used to make known and widespread products and
services (e.g., formulation of new water-borne coatings and other materials that are nonpolluting and nontoxic to
be used by paint companies); and ‘‘new means-ends frameworks’’ refers to new methods of production (e.g., a
recent discovery by UCLA researchers of a new method to produce biofuels that could lead to mass production
of these biofuels).
2. Although Kirzner (1997, 2008) concentrates on how much money current arbitrageurs have earned, we
focus on how much money could have been earned by would-be arbitrageurs. Hence, our attention is on arbitrage opportunities and not de facto arbitrage. We also extend the framework to collective entrepreneurs (firms)
and not just individuals.
3. Although this is not a concern in low-tech industries or industries with a weak appropriability regime, in
high-tech industries with a tight appropriability regime, it may not be possible to perfectly imitate the benchmarked company’s innovation. Thus, even though arbitrage opportunities may be present in the latter industries,
they may not be available for immediate exploitation. Perhaps future research will explore whether arbitrage
opportunities are more persistent in such industries.
4. Under DEA, firms not on the frontier will be inefficient for any set of weights.
5. A mathematical explanation of the differences between the methods is available upon request.
6. Sherman (1981) contains detailed information on how the inefficiencies were modeled.
7. The technique allows for multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Our example is simplified; the purpose is
to illustrate using the technique. Our estimates of arbitrage opportunities may change if other factors are

considered inputs or outputs. Furthermore, we believe that selecting inputs and outputs should be dictated by the
theory used to derive hypothesized relationships.
