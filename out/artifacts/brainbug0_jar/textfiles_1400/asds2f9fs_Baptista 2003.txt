and Innovation Diffusion

ABSTRACT
There is a considerable body of evidence to demonstrate that the diffusion of new technologies is spatially
variable. If firms rely on each other to learn about new technology, the diffusion process is punctuated by
cognitive externalities, allowing for an easier spread of usage and improvements. The present paper argues
that externalities promoting the adoption of new technology are stronger at the regional level and depend
positively on the proximity of early users. The results of the empirical work presented verify the importance
of geography and inter-firm networking in the process of knowledge transfer and diffusion, suggesting new
approaches to technology transfer and technology policy.  2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

1. Introduction
Technological diffusion, like any other socio-economic phenomenon, occurs simultaneously in time and space. It has been argued that the diffusion of innovations is
truly geographic in scope. An important part of the pioneering work on diffusion theory
was geographic [1].
A considerable body of evidence within the field of economics demonstrates that
the adoption of new technologies varies geographically. Alderman and Davies [2] found
that there are significant regional variations in the rates of diffusion of key manufacturing
technologies and that these variations may be partly, but by no means entirely, accounted
for by regional differences in industrial structure and establishment size distributions.
Such results confirm earlier results reached by Thwaites [3].
It is at the diffusion stage that the greatest impact of the process of technological
change upon economic growth is seen to occur [4]. If any region lags behind in the
production or adoption of new technology, it may face industrial decline. This has
obvious consequences on public policy at the industry and regional levels.
The present paper argues that the diffusion of new technological processes may
occur faster in geographical areas where the density of sources of knowledge about
such technologies is higher. The geographical clustering of innovators and early adopters
of new technology both stimulates and facilitates imitation and improvement [5]. An

empirical model of diffusion is used to examine the effect of the regional density of
early adopters on the diffusion of a specific technology.
Section 2 of the paper discusses the theoretical background to the arguments
presented. Section 3 introduces an empirical model of diffusion. Section 4 presents data
from the technology adoption survey conducted in 1981 by the University of Newcastle’s
Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies (CURDS). Section 5 focuses on
estimation and results. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.

2. Background
Economists have been interested in understanding the determinants of technology
diffusion across firms and industries. Early work on diffusion theory tended to concentrate upon epidemic—or learning—effects by which potential adopters procure new
technology upon receiving information of its existence [6]. In contrast, more recent
theoretical approaches to the subject have emphasised the explicit treatment of a firm’s
decision to (or not to) adopt a new technology. Different potential adopters should
have different preferred adoption dates.
2.1. LEARNING EFFECTS, FIRM NETWORKING AND DIFFUSION

A significant part of the modern work on diffusion theory has its origin in the
epidemic approach to the diffusion phenomenon. This approach was based on theories
modelling the spread of diseases; Griliches [7] and Mansfield [6] were the forerunners
in this approach. These models regard diffusion as resulting from the spread of information. In their simplest form, it is assumed that:
1. A potential user will adopt the technology upon learning of its existence.
2. Information on the existence of the technology is spread by direct contact
between a potential user and a user.
The epidemic effects approach to diffusion is based on the existence of uncertainty
regarding both the characteristics of the innovation (which is overcome as more firms
adopt it, thereby spreading information), and the total number of potential adopters.
It is possible to find a bridge between this seminal approach and more recent works
focusing on the importance of firm networking, spillovers, and knowledge sharing.
The adoption process consists of several stages; adoption is not a simple function
of knowledge, but also requires evaluation and trial. Much of the information necessary
to support the diffusion of an innovation flows through personal contacts [8]. Networks
of interpersonal communication that link organisations developing and adopting technological innovations are of considerable importance in the diffusion process [9].
As technological change occurs at an ever-increasing pace, the number of potential
innovations and subsequent incremental improvements has expanded beyond any single
firm’s ability to choose. This fact has led to an increase in the uncertainty associated
with the diffusion process. Networking between adopters and potential adopters, and
between producers and users of new technologies is of foremost importance in the
reduction of such uncertainty. This is particularly important for small businesses, which
are more likely to be unable to develop the necessary technology transfer capabilities
when isolated. Information exchange and direct observation of the adoption of new
technologies by others allow small businesses to develop specific competencies and
improve on others’ methods [10].
Networks of innovators have an explicit local dimension [11] and have been studied
both by mainstream economists and economic geographers. Firm networking is an

<-----Page 2----->GEOGRAPHICAL CLUSTERS AND INNOVATION DIFFUSION

33

essential element in a region’s knowledge infrastructure [12]. Ebadi and Utterback [13]
have demonstrated that network cohesiveness is positively correlated to the degree of
innovative success. Midgley et al. [9] found that cohesiveness (defined as direct userto-user influence) has a positive impact on the diffusion of industrial innovations.
If firms rely on each other to learn about new technology, the diffusion process is
punctuated by externalities, both cognitive and real [14]. These externalities associated
with the learning and transfer of new technological knowledge should reduce the costs
of taking up technology embodying capital goods and facilitate the assimilation of the
new technology into the firm’s value chain. Their intensity is likely to be stronger at
the local level, since this kind of new, tacit knowledge flows more easily through
interpersonal contacts [15]. It should also depend positively on the proximity of early
users and of technologically close firms, either acting as competitors, customers, suppliers, or service providers [16].
Pressures from social emulation and a localised competitive environment lead firms
to adopt a new technology in order to “stay in the game.” Abrahamson and Rosenkopf
[17] present a model in which bandwagon effects occur at the institutional level because
non-adopters fear to be perceived as below-average performers. This situation would
lead to generalised adoption of innovations even when profitability is uncertain.
The dynamics of user-producer linkages can also stimulate diffusion. Networking
between the producers and users of a new technology facilitates the transmission of
knowledge that is specific to it. The accumulated experience and demand pressure of
a technologically progressive user is also likely to influence incremental improvements
and expansion of innovation into new areas [18, 19]. Close interaction and day-to-day
contact between users and producers, where allowed by geographical proximity, should
deepen these relationships.
Given the arguments presented above, it seems reasonable to claim that external
epidemic or informational effects on the diffusion of industrial innovations will be
stronger in some regions than in others. Furthermore, these local differences will be
associated with localised networking and the presence of sources of technological information, such as innovative firms and early adopters. Diffusion may occur faster in
geographical areas where the density of previous adopters and other sources of knowledge about such technologies is higher.

2.1.1. The Geography of Innovation and R&D Spillovers
The issues of R&D spillovers and the geographical distribution of innovative performance are closely connected to the diffusion phenomenon. Spillovers have a crucial
impact on the transmission of new knowledge, which promotes innovation and organisational improvement, and supports the successful adoption of new technologies.
R&D spillovers [20] occur whenever a firm shares knowledge with other bodies
performing research and development, such as other firms, universities, and government
institutions, without having to pay for that information in a market transaction. They
represent the impact of discovered ideas or compounds in the research endeavours of
others [21].
New technological knowledge is said to be more easily transmitted by interpersonal
contact than across great distances, due to its uncodified character [22]. One would
then expect spillovers to be, to a certain extent, regionally bounded. Such a result has
important implications for the regional distribution of both innovative performance
and diffusion.

Jaffe [23] found evidence that corporate patenting activity within a particular U.S.
state increases with the level of research expenditures undertaken by universities in
that state, while also increasing with corporate R&D expenditure. Using innovation
counts for the United States, Acs et al. [24] found that the impact of spillovers from
university R&D is positive and apparently greater on innovations than on patents.
Moreover, geographical proximity seems to play an important part, since there is strong
correlation between university and corporate R&D at the state level, with both having
a positive impact on the generation of knowledge.
Jaffe et al. [25] used data on patent citations to determine the extent to which
knowledge spillovers are geographically localised and concentrated. They find evidence
for a strong geographical localisation of spillovers. Testing for different levels of geographical matching (country, state, and metropolitan area), the authors found that
spillovers become more significant as the geographical area becomes smaller. Localisation appears more significant for patents registered by universities and by medium and
small firms than for the patents filed by top corporations. Another important result
suggests that localisation is likely to be stronger for early citations.
Feldman [26] found that regional innovative output increases in the presence of
high private and academic research expenditures undertaken within a region. The close
presence of related industries has the most significant effect on innovation. This seems
to demonstrate the importance of regional networks of innovators, at least in highly
innovative industries. The presence of specialised business services is significant as well.
Audretsch and Feldman [27] also found evidence in favour of geographical clustering of innovative output in the United States. Using data for the UK, Baptista and
Swann [28, 29] found positive effects on innovative performance, firm growth, and entry
of spillovers mediated by strong regional clustering of industries.
The views that underlie the organisation of industrial innovation point to the
pervasiveness of knowledge spillovers and information sharing on innovative activity
and diffusion. Research on networking and geographic clustering of firms leads to the
conclusion that a localised pattern of development facilitates a collective learning process, increasing the speed of knowledge transfer by reducing uncertainty.
2.2. MODELS WITH PERFECT INFORMATION

Other approaches to the diffusion phenomenon have uncovered a series of factors
influencing the spread of technology. While epidemic models present a disequilibrium
approach resulting from information asymmetries between potential users and have
therefore been criticised on that account [30], other models tend to assume that there
is perfect information concerning the existence and nature of new technologies. Such
models generate a different set of effects on diffusion. Karshenas and Stoneman [31]
group them into three categories: rank (or probit), stock, and order effects. In each
kind of equilibrium model the firm’s decision to adopt depends upon the gains from
adoption relative to the cost of adoption. As such gains and costs change over time,
the number of adopters changes, too.
In the rank or probit models [32], potential users of a new technology differ from
each other in some important dimension so that some firms obtain a greater return
from the new technology than do others and tend to adopt faster. It is then possible
to rank firms in terms of their returns from adoption.
The stock effects models [33, 34] argue that as the number of users of the new
technology increases, the benefits from adoption decline. Hence, there will be a number
of adopters beyond which adoption is not profitable.

<-----Page 4----->GEOGRAPHICAL CLUSTERS AND INNOVATION DIFFUSION

35

The order effects models [35] consider that the firm’s position in the adoption
order determines its return from the use of the technology, with firms higher in the
adoption order obtaining greater returns than firms lower in that order. For any given
technology price, only firms down to a certain point in the adoption order will find it
profitable to adopt.

3. Modelling Diffusion
A model of diffusion combining the approaches mentioned in the previous section
has to consider that the choice of an optimal time of adoption will be influenced by
characteristics specific to the firm (rank effects) and by variables related to stock and
order. It is hard, however, to identify some of those effects separately, and to distinguish
them from the learning or epidemic effect, since this effect acts in a cumulative process
that underlies the course of diffusion.
The empirical model of diffusion used in the present paper is the one introduced
in Baptista [36]. The model was developed from the approach used by Karshenas and
Stoneman [37], and is briefly outlined in the following sub-section.
3.1. THE ADOPTION DECISION

Each firm’s benefits per period from adopting a given new technology are assumed
to depend on:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Characteristics specific to the firm and/or industry, representing the rank effect;
the number of firms already using the technology representing the stock effect;
the number of previous adopters of the technology, reflecting the order effect; and
the number of previous adopters located in the firm’s own region, accounting
for external effects resulting from localised networking and transmission of information.

It should be noted that, since the epidemic effect also acts at the global level in
the economy, the total stock of previous adopters might also generate an effect on
adoption which is the opposite of the expected stock and order effects.
For a firm to adopt a technology at a certain time t, the benefits from adoption
must satisfy two conditions [36, 37]:
1. The profitability condition requires that acquisition at time t must yield a positive profit.
2. The arbitrage condition requires that it must not be more profitable to wait
beyond t to adopt; that is, the net benefit from adoption must not be increasing
over time at t.
It is possible to predict that expected reductions in the price of the technology will
delay adoption [38], as will increases in this price at the present moment. Increases in
the total number of firms adopting before t should delay adoption via the stock and order
effects. However, the existence of a global epidemic effect will counteract such outcome.
A higher number of regional adopters by t should increase adoption in this period
due to localised external learning effects, although such effect could also be counteracted
by some kind of regional stock effect. The rank effect will, of course, depend on which
individual firm characteristics are considered.
3.2. VARIABLES INFLUENCING ADOPTION

There should be numerous firm and industry-specific factors influencing the adoption decision. Size of firm is the most frequently used variable in rank or probit models

<-----Page 5----->36

R. BAPTISTA

[32]. The argument behind this assumption is that many new technologies show positive
scale effects, making adoption more profitable for larger firms; thus larger firms
adopt earlier.
Given contingencies such as sunk costs [34, 39], one should also expect that new
firms, firms with worn-out equipment, and firms expanding capacity will be more likely
to adopt a new technology. The age of establishment and the expected variation in the
industry’s output should account for these effects. While age might show an ambiguous
sign, one would hope that the expected variation in output will have a positive effect
on adoption. It should be noted that new firms will be more flexible to the introduction
of new technologies [40, 41].
The R&D effort at the establishment level can be taken as measure of the firm’s
ability to process new technological information. Firms performing R&D should be
able to reduce the risk associated with the adoption of new technology, since they are
in a better position to benefit from the pool of knowledge created by other firms
engaging in related R&D. Mowery [42] suggests that firms that maintain R&D activities
are thereby provided with an enhanced capability for monitoring and assessing technologies originated elsewhere. Teece [43] argues that R&D contributes to the ability of technology transfer beneficiaries to absorb manufacturing technologies at a minimum cost.
While independent units might be more flexible in terms of implementation speed,
establishments that are part of a larger corporation will experience less uncertainty and
less financial constraints. The corporate status of the establishment (independent or
part of a larger unit) should therefore influence the adoption decision. Rees et al.
[44] found that small (single plant) independent firms tend to be slower in adopting
new technology.
Different industries will present different risks and different adaptabilities to new
technology, and Karshenas and Stoneman [37] have shown that there are sector-specific
endogenous epidemic effects. Therefore, industry or sector characteristics should be
taken into consideration.
The stock and order effects can be measured through adoption-precedence variables. The stock of adopters and the expected number of firms to adopt in each period,
together with the expected price of technology, should have a negative effect on the
adoption rate. However, as it has been pointed out, since the epidemic effect acts
through a learning-by-contact process, the stock of previous adopters might also bring
forth a different kind of effect on adoption—this time a positive one—making the net
effect ambiguous.
It is suggested that one possible way to avoid this problem is to use the price of
the output as an indirect measure of the stock effect. If one expects the widespread
use of the technology to act on production costs (and eventually on industry demand),
then the price of the industry output should eventually show these effects, becoming a
suitable surrogate for the stock effect and therefore replacing the total stock of adopters
in the model. One should note, however, that the output price will reflect a series of
other different effects, giving rise to results which are difficult to interpret.
It is expected that the positive effect of the stock of adopters on the diffusion rate
through the learning/epidemic process will be more significant at the regional level. On
the one hand, any local stock effect will be less significant; on the other hand, the
learning effect resulting from easier contact with other adopters will become stronger.
The stock of regional adopters is, therefore, a measure of the significance of regional
external effects. Total regional employment in the industry measures cluster strength
in terms of the presence of technologically close firms.

Annual adoption is assigned to the ten CSO Regions: North (N), Yorkshire and Humberside (YH), East
Midlands (EM), East Anglia (EA), South East (SE), South West (SW), Wales (WA), West Midlands (WM),
Northwest (NW) and Scotland (SC).

The total stock of previous adopters is expected to have a negative (or, at best,
ambiguous) effect on the diffusion rate, reflecting the predominance of the nation-wide
stock effect over the learning effect, while the regional stock of previous adopters would
have a positive effect on adoption, reflecting the predominance of the learning effect
over the stock effect at the local level.

4. Data and Methodology
The present study uses time-to-adoption as the dependent variable, following Hannah and McDowell [45], Levin et al. [46], Rose and Joskow [47], and Karshenas and
Stoneman [37]. The 1981 CURDS survey covered all identified UK establishments in
the engineering and metalworking industries. Although the survey was repeated in 1986
and 1993, a relatively large number of active firms dropped out, thus generating an
incomplete panel. It was decided, therefore, to use only data from the 1981 survey.
4.1. DATA USED IN THE STUDY

The data set covers six three-digit industrial sectors.1 Establishments are assigned
to the ten standard regions of Great Britain as defined by the Central Statistical Office
(CSO).2 The technology selected for the study was computer numerically controlled
(CNC) machine tools. A summary of the adoption data is given in Table 1. Although
numerically controlled machine tools were first developed in the 1950’s, it was the
introduction of microcomputers as the basis of the numerical control unit that allowed
for a widespread diffusion during the seventies. This is a relatively complex and expensive
technology, and its early users were primarily large firms [48]. The first recorded adoption
of CNC in the UK engineering industry happened in 1968. The data set covers adoption
from 1968 to 1980, so no left-censoring bias should be found.
In principle, it would be possible to identify several different development stages,
or even generations, since the appearance of the technology. However, for the purpose

South West (SW), Wales (WA), West Midlands (WM), Northwest (NW), and Scotland (SC).

of this paper it is more useful to concentrate on the diffusion of a generic technology
than on individual generations. This is the usual procedure in the literature [31] and
the data do not allow for individual analysis. The data set comprised 1035 firms, of
which 284 had adopted CNC machine tools by 1980.
One should note that data refer to the establishment as the adoption unit, so it is
assumed that the adoption decision is taken at the establishment level. Although most
literature treats the firm as the decision-making unit, empirical evidence suggests that
this might not be an unreasonable assumption [49]. Furthermore, any external effects
acting at the regional level should be primarily reflected on the establishment.
A description of the variables used is given in Table 2. Perfect foresight was assumed
when determining values for the expectations variables. Although one would expect
the technology price to fall when adoption increases, CNC machine tools were mainly
supplied through imports, so it is unlikely that individual firms’ decisions would affect
prices. Furthermore, both technology prices and industry output changed monotonically
over the observation period, so the use of any expectation rule would not change the
results considerably.
4.2. ECONOMETRIC ESTIMATION

A duration, or failure time model [50, 51], is used to explain time-to-adoption as
a function of the independent variables. The hazard rate is here defined as the probability
that a firm i will adopt the innovation at time t, conditional on not having adopted the
innovation before t.
Estimation in the absence of a specific functional form for the hazard rate is done
by using a version of the general class of proportional hazard models suggested by Cox
[52]. The procedure is discussed by Kiefer [51] and Karshenas and Stoneman [37].
Estimation of such a model including exogenous covariates (independent variables) is
founded on the definition of an underlying distribution for the hazard rate (baseline
hazard function). This distribution is pre-determined through specification tests.
The examination of the diffusion path (hazard function) for CNC machine tools,
presented in Figure 1, suggests that the rate of diffusion is not uniform over time: the
probability that a firm will adopt, given that it has not adopted previously, increases
with time. Therefore, the assumption of a constant hazard rate, corresponding to an
exponential distribution for the baseline hazard function [50, 51], seems unreasonable.
The diffusion path depicted suggests that the Weibull and the log-logistic distributions
are more likely to be appropriate.
A useful approach to specification testing of failure time models is based on the
concept of pseudo-residuals, or generalised residuals.3 The test compares the residuals
generated by non-parametric estimation of the hazard function [51] with the residuals
that would be produced by adjusting a specific distribution (in this case, the Weibull
or the log-logistic) to the baseline hazard. It is then possible to examine graphically
which one produces the best fit.
Figure 2 shows that the Weibull distribution produces standardised residuals that
are closer to the residuals generated by non-parametric estimation. In practice, as
suggested Karshenas and Stoneman [37], the actual choice of a baseline hazard structure
seems to make little difference as far as estimates and inferences are concerned.4
3

For a detailed presentation of the method, see Blossfeld and Rohwer [53].
In addition to the Weibull, estimations for exponential and log-logistic models were also obtained
showing similar patterns of results.

One other issue worth discussion is the question of individual heterogeneity. It is
possible that the firm and industry level variables included might not pick up all systematic individual differences. Hence, a model incorporating a term for unobserved heterogeneity into the Weibull specification was estimated [54]. Estimation of this model,
however, showed individual heterogeneity to be insignificant.5

5. Results
Before estimation, a non-parametric analysis of the diffusion path for CNC machine
tools (the time series of time to adoption) was conducted in order to test for regional
differences. A log-rank test [55] pooling all ten regions found that the distributions of
adoption times are significantly different.6 A series of Mantel-Haenszel tests [56] con5
A gamma distribution with mean equal to one and variance equal to a parameter ␴ was assumed for
the heterogeneity term. The value estimated for ␴ was not significant at the 1% confidence level.
6
A chi-square test yielded a critical value of 29.44, which is significant at the 1% level.

ducted across pairs of regions also shows significant differences in most comparisons.
It seems apparent then that there is a regional dimension to diffusion.
A model pooling all firms across the ten regions was estimated parametrically.
Three different versions were estimated, including the total stock of adopters, the output
price or both, as variables associated with the stock and order effects. This separation
was tried in an attempt to isolate external epidemic or learning effects (as measured
at the global level by the total stock of previous adopters) from stock effects and to
avoid multicollinearity between the regional and nation-wide stocks of adopters.
Results are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Estimation results for the exponential
baseline hazard are included as a benchmark for the results obtained using the Weibull

that, when modelling time to adoption, a negative coefficient will mean a positive effect
on adoption speed.

The Weibull parameter tests significantly larger than 1 for both technologies, confirming the existence

is significant when industry output price is used instead of the total stock of previous
adopters to account for stock and order effects. The non-significance of the coefficient
when both regional and total stocks of adopters are used may be due to autocorrelation
between the regional and global stock variables, since the absolute value for the coefficient of previous regional adopters is much higher when the total number of previous
adopters is left out of the model.
The stock of total previous adopters is not significant, confirming the expected
ambiguousness arising from the conflict between stock/order effects and external learn-

ing effects that counteract each other. Output price—when used instead of or together
with the stock of previous adopters—shows a negative insignificant effect on adoption
which is difficult to interpret.
Such results seem to substantiate the existence of a significant positive regional
learning effect influencing diffusion. However, regional industry dimension, as measured
by employment, does not appear to be significant on adoption, meaning that exogenous
learning effects are not sensitive to the presence of firms in the same or close activities.
Ownership status of the establishment and the number of R&D-related employees
are never significant. Age and size of firm present significant positive effects on adoption,
and so do expected increases in industry output.
The coefficients for technology price and expected technology price are also significant and have the expected signs. The significance and high absolute values of the
coefficients for the expected price and expected industry output growth seem to confirm
the finding that myopic-type models of diffusion are misspecified [37]. Industry fixed
effects are significant, at least when taken as a whole. A likelihood ratio test for the
inclusion of the industry dummies found this inclusion to be significant at the 1% level.
This may be due to differences in market concentration levels and/or endogenous
epidemic effects.

6. Concluding Remarks
Following an extensive theoretical discussion, the present paper empirically tested
the pervasiveness of external learning effects acting at the regional level on the diffusion
of a new industrial technology. For that, a general model of diffusion was built, incorporating the main theoretical streams existent in diffusion literature: rank, stock, order,
and epidemic/learning effects, both at the regional and global level.
The results confirm the existence of significant regional learning effects mediated
through the presence of previous regional adopters. Significant signs were found of a
positive regional learning effect that overcomes any negative stock/order effects happening at the same level—resulting in a weak, but significantly positive, net effect. At the
national level, the learning benefits are probably too weak to overcome the stock/
order effects.
The positive impact of the growth of output in user industry supports Karshenas
and Stoneman’s [37] finding. The variables related to the price of technology also have
the expected effects. No evidence is found for stock and order effects. However, empirical
testing of game-theoretic models of diffusion still needs considerable improvement, and
studies like Hannan and McDowell [45] have also not found evidence of any stock or
order effects.
The results confirm that exogenous learning and epidemic effects are stronger at
the regional level than at the global level. This should have important implications in
terms of industrial and regional policies. The present study confirms that external
epidemic effects related to the transmission of information through the presence of
previous adopters are strong enough to overcome any negative stock and order effects
that might result from increased competition due to the accumulation of such adopters,
at least at the local level. It is therefore possible to claim that, similarly to knowledge
spillovers [25] and agglomeration externalities related to growth [57], externalities related to knowledge acting on the diffusion of process innovations tend to grow stronger
as the geographical unit of reference becomes smaller.
The results suggest that geography plays a part in the diffusion process as a mediator
of knowledge transmission and of technology transfer. The pervasiveness of locational

<-----Page 13----->44

effects should depend on the nature of technological knowledge and other structural
characteristics of industries, but close presence of sources of technological knowledge,
such as previous adopters, clearly influences the pace of both technological change and
innovation diffusion. The impact upon diffusion of the interaction between informational
externalities, knowledge spillovers, geographical proximity, and firm networking provides an important avenue of research in the economics of diffusion.
With regard to policy, it seems clear that important conclusions can be drawn in
terms of industrial, regional, and technology policies from the arguments presented. On
the one hand, the promotion of inter-firm networking as a way for reducing uncertainty
deriving from imperfect information arises as a clear policy objective. On the other hand,
the existence of various types of externalities associated with regional concentration of
firms is a possible source of market failure and may create problems regarding income
distribution among regions.
Furthermore, it should be pointed out that a broader institutional scope is needed
for evaluating technology diffusion and technology policy [58]. Interpersonal connections
and networking play an important role in knowledge transfer, and supply-side factors
are often significant in determining diffusion paths. This leads to the need for policy
to consider the role of supplier-user relationships, professional and trade associations,
academic and public-funded R&D, and organisations manufacturing complementary
assets and technologies. The significance of these institutional relationships becomes
larger as their geographical scope becomes smaller.
