A MODEL OF VENTURE CAPITALIST 

INVESTMENT ACTIVITY* 

TYZOON T. TYEBJEE AND ALBERT V. BRUNO

The paper describes the activities of venture capitalists as an orderly process involving five
sequential steps. These are (1) Deal Origination: The processes by which deals enter into
consideration as investment prospects, (2) Deal Screening: A delineation of key policy
variables which delimit investment prospects to a manageable few for in-depth evaluation, (3)
Deal Evaluation: The assessment of perceived risk and expected return on the basis of a
weighting of several characteristics of the prospective venture and the decision whether or not
to invest as determined by the relative levels of perceived risk and expected return, (4) Deal
Structuring: The negotiation of the price of the deal, namely the equity relinquished to the
investor, and the covenants which limit the risk of the investor, (5) Post-Investment Activities:
The assistance to the venture in the areas of recruiting key executives, strategic planning,
locating expansion financing, and orchestrating a merger, acquisition or public offering. 41
venture capitalists provided data on a total of 90 deals which had received serious consideration in their firms. The questionnaire measured the mechanism of initial contact between
venture capitalist and entrepreneur, the venture's industry, the stage of financing and product
development, ratings of the venture on 23 characteristics, an assessment of the potential return
and perceived risk, and the decision vis-a-vis whether to invest. The modal venture represented
in the database was a start-up in the electronics industry with a production capability in place
and seeking $1 million (median) in outside financing. There is a high degree of cross-referrals
between venture capitalists, particularly for the purposes of locating co-investors. Factor
analysis reduced the 23 characteristics of the deal to five underlying dimensions namely (1)
Market Attractiveness (size, growth, and access to customers), (2) Product Differentiation
(uniqueness, patents, technical edge, profit margin), (3) Managerial Capabilities (skills in
marketing, management, finance and the references of the entrepreneur), (4) Environmental
Threat Resistance (technology life cycle, barriers to competitive entry, insensitivity to business
cycles and down-side risk protection), (5) Cash-Out Potential (future opportunities to realize
capital gains by merger, acquisition or public offering). The results of regression analyses
showed expected return to be determined by Market Attractiveness and Product Differentiation (R2 = 0.22). Perceived risk is determined by Managerial Capabilities and Environmental
Threat Resistance ( R 2 = 0.33). Finally, a discriminant analysis correctly predicted, in 89.4% of
the cases, whether or not a venture capitalist was willing to commit funds to the deal on the
basis of the expected return and perceived risk. The reactions of seven venture capitalists who
reviewed the model's specification were used to test its validity.

Introduction
Venture capital has become an increasingly important source of financing for new companies, particularly
when such companies are operating on the frontier of emerging technologies and markets. It plays an
essential role in the entrepreneurial process. The purpose of this paper is to model the deal flow in a venture
capital firm, namely the stages in the consideration, scrutiny and disposition of venture investment deals.
The theory of equity markets is well developed in finance; it will not be reviewed here. These theories are
typically oriented toward equity financing in publicly traded companies. Venture capital investments,
however, differ in several important aspects (Poindexter 1976). First, venture capital is usually invested in
new firms which have very little performance history. As a result, the investor cannot rely on historical
performance data, as in the case of the stock market. Second, the investment is typically in small firms and
the nature of the investor and investee relationship involves a higher degree of direct involvement as

compared to the relatively inactive role of investors in publicly traded companies. Third, venture capital
investments are illiquid in the short term because of the lack of efficient capital markets for equity shares of
privately held companies. Long horizons of product and market development make valuation difficult.
Moreover, the legal restrictions that apply to the resale of such investments lock the investor in for a certain
period. Fourth, when a venture capitalist invests in a new startup, it is usually with the implicit realization
that future rounds of capital infusion may have to be financed before the initial investment can bear fruit
(Cooper and Carleton 1979).
The lack of capital markets for the financial instruments of small, new companies introduces considerable
problems in studying venture capital investments within the paradigm of the capital asset pricing model. The
absence of a clearing price determined by the market makes the valuation of an investment vulnerable to the
subjective assessment procedures of the analyst. One study of 29 SBIC funds found that venture capital
funds enjoy a rate of return 63% higher than Standard & Poor's market index returns. This premium,
however, is offset by a higher risk; the variability of the firm's returns were higher than that of the market
index return (Poindexter 1976). Poindexter concludes that venture capital markets are efficient since higher
returns are offset by higher risk. Using a considerably different methodology, Charles River Associates
(1976) reached the same conclusion.
The efficiency of venture capital markets is a central public policy concern because of the latter's goal of
stimulating the flow of funds to new, small companies. However, the efficiency proposition provides little
insight into the decision process of venture capitalists, other than the implication that they select investments
with potential returns high enough to offset the higher risk. In the next section we develop a descriptive
model of the activities or processes involved in managing a venture capital fund. Portions of the model are
empirically tested on the basis of interviews with venture capitalists, and analyses of the characteristics and
disposition of deals which they had recently considered. This methodology is not without its problems. In
the experience of the authors, venture capitalists are reluctant to violate the confidentiality of their investees.
Also they are not receptive to highly structured measurement instruments, which are perceived to be time
consuming to complete. They view every deal and every venture capital fund to be peculiar to itself, and
resist the generalizations which behavioral scientists wish to impose upon them. For this reason, research
methodology which relies on the cooperation of venture capitalists in divulging data on their activities is
likely to suffer from a high nonresponse bias and criticisms regarding the generalizability of small sample
research. It is with this backdrop that we seek to model the activities of venture capitalists.

Model of the Venture Capitalist's Investment Activity

The investment activity of a venture capitalist is modeled as a sequential process
involving five steps (see Figure 1). The first step is one of deal origination which
describes how venture capitalists become cognizant of potential investment activities.
The second step is a screening process by which venture capitalists seek to concentrate
only on a manageable set of potential deals. The evaluation step involves an assessment
of the potential return and risk of a particular deal. If the outcome of the evaluation
process is a favorable one, the venture capitalist enters into a negotiating process with
the potential investee so as to structure the deal in terms of the amount, form and price
of the investment. Once a deal is consummated, the venture capitalist typically has
close contact with the venture. These post-investment activities include setting up
controls to protect the investment, providing consultation to the fledgling management
of the venture, and, finally, helping orchestrate the merger, acquisition, or public
offering which would create a public market for the investment.
On the basis of several previous studies (Dorsey 1977; Hoffman 1972; Poindexter
1976; Timmons and Gumpert 1982; Wells 1974) we can describe the salient features of
each of these steps as follows:
Step 1-Deal Origination. The venture capitalist faces a very poorly defined
environment within which to find prospective deals. The typical investment prospect is
too small a company to be readily identifiable as a potential candidate. For this
reason, we could expect that various intermediaries play an important role in matching
venture capital investors with fledgling ventures with cash needs.
Step 2-Screening.
Venture capital firms typically have small staffs. As a result,
these firms must screen the relatively large number of potential deals available and
consequently invest in only a fraction of the deals which come to their attention. Their
screening criteria reflect a tendency to limit investments to areas with which the

venture capitalist is familiar, particularly in terms of the technology, product and
market scope of the venture.
Step 3-Evaluation.
As noted before, most ventures in search of capital have very
little, if any, operating history. The venture capitalist has to rely on a subjective
assessment procedure based upon the business plan presented by the venture's management. Venture capitalists do weigh risk and return in their decision whether or not
to invest in a particular deal, but few formalize this assessment into a computation of
an expected rate of return or determine its sensitivity to future uncertainties. Instead,
the evaluation procedure seeks to subjectively assess the venture on a multidimensional
set of characteristics. Table 1 shows the characteristics found to be important in
previous studies. Not surprisingly, these criteria are similar to those found in several
new product evaluation models (Montgomery and Urban 1969; O'Meara 1961;
Pessemier 1982). It is interesting to note, however, that none of these criteria reflects
how a prospective deal may correlate with one already in the venture capitalist's
investment portfolio.
Step 4--Deal Structuring. Once the venture capitalist has decided that a deal is
acceptable, the deal will be consummated only if the venture capitalist and the
entrepreneur are able to structure a mutually acceptable venture capital investment
agreement. From the perspective of the venture capitalist, the agreement serves several
purposes. First, it establishes the price of the deal, that is the equity share the
entrepreneur will give up in exchange for the venture capital (Golden 1981). Second, it
establishes protective covenants which limit capital expenditures and management

salaries. Covenants also establish the basis under which the venture capitalist can take
control of the board, force a change in management or liquidate the investment by
forcing a buy-back, a merger, acquisition or public offering even though the venture
capitalist holds a minority position. The covenants may also restrict the power of the
venture management to dilute the equity of the original investors by raising additional
capital elsewhere (Cooper and Carleton 1979; Glassmeyer 1981). Third, through a
mechanism known as the earn-out arrangement, where the entrepreneur's equity share
is determined by meeting agreed upon performance objectives, the venture capitalist is
able to assess the entrepreneur's expectations for the venture (Leland and Pyle 1977;
Ross 1977).
Step 5-Post-Investment Activities. Once the deal has been consummated, the role
of the venture capitalist expands from investor to collaborator. This new role may be
via a formal representation on the board of directors or via informal influence in
market, supplier and creditor networks. The intensity of involvement in the venture's
operations differs from one venture capitalist to another. However, most of those
interviewed agree that it is undesirable for a venture capital company to exert control
over the day-to-day operations of the venture. If a financial or managerial crisis
occurs, the venture capitalist may intervene and even install a new management team.
Finally, venture capitalists typically want to cash-out their gains five to ten years
after initial investments. To this end, they play an active role in directing the company
towards merger, acquisition or a public offering. Bruno and Cooper (1982) followed up
on 250 startups of the sixties. They found that over half of these had either gone
public, or had been merged or acquired.
The post-investment activities of venture capitalists vis-a-vis their portfolio companies have been ignored by the bulk of research on venture capital. In particular, the
venture capitalist's decision-making process for second and subsequent rounds of
financing for ventures already in his portfolio remains a fertile area of research.
Method
The results of two databases, referred to as Study I and Study 11, are presented in
the next section. These databases are described briefly below.

<-----Page 5----->VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

1055

Study I

A telephone survey of 46 venture capitalists in California, Massachusetts and Texas.
Of these, half were SBIC's. The telephone survey used a structured questionnaire
which asked about how ventures are evaluated. The responses were open-ended and
their analysis is based upon a post-hoc categorization of responses.
Study I1

Venture capital firms listed in Pratt's directory (1981) of venture capital were
contacted by mail to solicit their participation in a study of investment decision
criteria. The mailing was restricted to the 156 venture capital firms in the states of
California, Massachusetts, and Texas as these states account for a major portion of the
venture capital industry, particularly as it applies to high technology startups. Fortyone venture capital firms agreed to participate in the study. For nonparticipants, the
dominant reason for refusing to participate was the sensitivity of the information we
requested. A second reason was the busy schedule of the venture capitalists. Finally,
several firms disqualified themselves as participants in the survey as they were either
inactive in new investments or only invested in deals put together by others. The 41
cooperating venture capital firms were mailed a structured questionnaire on which to
evaluate deals under consideration. We asked that they indicate their decision vis-A-vis
investing in that deal. Ninety completed evaluations were returned by the 41 participants, an average of 2.2 deals per participating venture capitalist. The industries
represented in the 90 deals in our sample were computers, semiconductors and
telecommunications (59.6%), energy (13.5%), consumer goods (10.1%) and miscellaneous industries including transportation, construction and biomedical (16.8%).
A major problem with the methodology used in this study for describing the
evaluation step is that it may be biased in favor of the results obtained. In particular,
the statistical relationships between subjectively assessed characteristics of deals and
the venture capitalist's decision regarding them may reflect a post-hoc rationalization
of the decision. To mitigate this problem, the methodology includes a validation
component in which the key results described in the next section were presented to 7
venture capitalists and their reactions recorded. The validation component was administered by mail and its outcome is discussed following the next section.
Results
In this section, the results from Studies I and I1 are discussed within the context of
the five-step model developed earlier. While the data and results are largely focused on
the deal evaluation step of the model, results for the first two steps are also presented.
The last two steps, namely deal structuring and post-investment activities, are not
considered in this section, but will be discussed in the validation section which follows.

Step 1-Deal Origination
Potential deals are brought to the attention of venture capitalists from three sources.
In Study 11, 25.6% of the 90 deals in the sample originated as unsolicited cold calls
from entrepreneurs. The typical response of the venture capitalist is to request the
inquirer to send in a business plan. The second source is through a referral process.
Sixty-five percent of the deals were referred to the venture capitalist. A third of the
referrals came from within the venture capital community, 40% were referred by prior
investees and personal acquaintances, 10% were referred by banks and the remainder
involved an investment broker.
Of those deals referred by other venture capitalists, a substantial number represent
the case of the referring venture capitalist acting as a lead investor and seeking the

<-----Page 6----->1056

TYZOON T. TYEBJEE AND ALBERT V. BRUNO

participation of other venture capital funds. This practice, known as a syndication, is
becoming more prevalent as venture capital firms seek to diversify their portfolios over
a larger number of deals. Syndication offers the capability of adding investments to
the portfolio without adding to the administrative burden, the bulk of which is borne
by the lead investor.
The third mechanism of deal origination is the active search for deals by the venture
capitalist. The venture capitalist sometimes played an active role in pursuing companies at the startup stage or those at the critical point of needing expansion financing.
The venture capitalist monitors the environment for such potential candidates through
an informal network and attendance at conventions, trade shows and special conferences by groups such as the American Electronics Association. An extreme variant of
this active role occurs when the venture capitalist first decides which technology
markets he would like to add to his portfolio and uses executive search agencies to
locate the management team for the venture. In such cases, the roles of venture
capitalist and entrepreneur overlap considerably.
Step 2-Screening

The venture capital firm receives a large number of proposals; far more than they
can possibly fund with the size of the staff and portfolio of the typical venture fund.
Wells (1974) reports that in seven venture capital funds, the annual number of
proposals received ranged between 120 and 1,000, with an average of about 450 per
year. Broad screening criteria are used to reduce this set to a more manageable
number for more indepth evaluation. The initial screening is based upon four criteria:
(1) The size of the investment and the investment policy of the venture fund. The
lower limit of this policy is determined by the fact that a venture capital company is
run with a lean staff and it cannot afford to spread its portfolio over too many small
deals because the subsequent control and consultation demands placed on the venture
capitalists are essentially the same regardless of the size of the investment. Brophy
(1981) reports that of 73 venture capitalists surveyed in 1979 the average number of
deals invested in was 5.6 and the average portfolio size was ten ventures. The upper
boundary of the investment policy is determined by the capitalization of the portfolio
and the desire to maintain an investment base which is diversified across several
ventures. However, the upper limit to the investment policy is relatively flexible
because a venture capitalist may consider larger deals with the intent of soliciting the
participation of other venture capital funds. In fact, in our research we found that the
venture capital community is highly inbred with a substantial amount of participation
across funds, leading many entrepreneurs to conclude that the venture capital market
involves substantially less competition between suppliers than is indicated by the mere
count of number of funds in existence. Brophy (1981) estimates that approximately
80% of the venture capital deals struck in 1980 involved the participation of more than
one venture capital fund and about a third of the deals involved five or more
participants. Fifty-six percent of the deals analyzed in Study I1 involved the participation of more than one venture capital fund. In the case of two-thirds of the deals which
were given a positive evaluation, the venture capitalist was himself willing to commit
less than 75% of the amount requested, with the balance to be raised by inviting the
participation of other venture capital funds.
The investment policy, in terms of the maximum and minimum amounts which will
be considered, is quite heterogeneous across venture capital firms (Timmons and
Gumpert 1982). The dollar amount requested in the 90 deals examined in Study I1
reflects this diversity. The amounts range from $30,000 to $7,500,000, with the median
amount being $1,000,000. About a third of the deals were for less than $500,000 and
another third were for amounts in excess of $1,500,000.

<-----Page 7----->VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

1057

(2) The technology and market sector of the venture. Of 46 venture capitalists
interviewed in Study I, 29 used this screening criterion. The venture capitalist is
investing in more than a company. Implicitly, he/she is investing in the future of a
particular technology or market. For this reason, the venture capitalist must have some
familiarity with the technology or the market of the proposed venture. This leads to an
implicit specialization in a few technology markets because of the inability of the
venture capital fund's manager to be well-versed across a large number of technologies
or markets. Also, venture capitalists tend to favor nascent technology industries over
mature technologies, the industrial market over the consumer market, and products
over services.
The 90 deals in Study 11, which presumably had passed initial screening, demonstrated these preferences. More than three out of four were in technology-intensive
industries, only a tenth were in the consumer goods sector, and over 90% were
manufacturing companies. Sixty-four percent of the deals were described by the
venture capitalist as involving either a new technology or a new application of an
existing technology, 18% were described as improvements on current products, and the
remaining 18% were described as me-too products.
(3) Geographic location of the venture. Of 46 venture capitalists interviewed in
Study I, 9 used this screening criterion. When a venture capitalist invests in a
company, he expects to meet regularly with the management of the new venture. To
maintain travel time and expense at manageable levels, some venture capitalists limit
their investment activity to major metropolitan areas with easy access. Sometimes, this
screening criterion will be ignored if the venture capitalist can involve the participation
of another venture capital fund which is close to the venture's location and which can
oversee the venture with greater ease. Though most venture capital companies do not
actively pursue a policy of restricting their investment activity to a specific geographic
boundary, their portfolios often exhibit this specialization because of a tendency of
entrepreneurs to search for capital close to their venture's home where their banking,
legal and accountancy contacts are strongest.
(4) Stage of financing. Of 46 venture capitalists interviewed in Study I, 22 used
this screening criterion. Venture capital infusions into a company occur at several
points in the life cycle of the venture. Seed capital refers to funds invested before the
venture exists as a formal entity. Venture capitalists rarely invest seed capital and
entrepreneurs typically turn to informal sources for this money (Wetzel 1981). Startup
capital refers to financing for establishing the operation; subsequent rounds of
financing are used for expanding operations. Brophy (1981) reports that of 196 venture
investments in 1978, 34.2% were for startups, 40.3% were for first round expansion and
19.4% were for second round expansion (6.1% were unclassified).
In Study 11, the 90 deals showed a very similar profile to Brophy's data: 45.6% were
startups, 22.2% were first round expansion deals and 21.1% were second round
expansion deals. Described in another manner, in the case of 23% of the deals the
product was still at the design stage, in the case of another 23% a working prototype
had been developed and in the case of the remaining 54% the product was already in
production.
These aggregate statistics, however, hide the fact that the risk preferences of venture
capital funds differ. As a result, some funds will commit capital to later stage rounds
only. Others will not commit to later stage rounds unless they have already invested in
the venture in the prior rounds.
Step 3- Evaluation

We asked cooperating venture capitalists to rate several deals which had passed their
initial screen and were under serious consideration. The deals were rated on 23 criteria

'Percentage of deals for which evaluation was not reported.

(see Table 2) using a four-point rating scale (Poor = 1, Adequate = 2, Good = 3,
Excellent = 4). In addition to rating the venture on the 23 criteria, the participant also
rated the venture on overall expected return and risk, respectively. A straightforward
measure of expected return proved intractable because in 42% of the cases the venture
capitalist was unable to assign a numerical estimate of the expected rate of return. For
this reason, expected return was measured on a four-point scale (Low = 1, Moderate = 2, High = 3, Very High = 4). The perceived riskiness of the deal was measured
by asking the venture capitalist to assign a subjective probability to the venture being a
commercial failure. Finally, the venture capitalists indicated their decision regarding
the deal. Of the 90 deals in the sample, 25 were rejected, 43 were found to be
acceptable and thus fundable, 18 were pending further investigation, and in the case of
4 deals, the decision was not specified.
Table 2 lists the 23 items which sewed as the basis for evaluating deals under
consideration. The number in parentheses next to each item reports the frequency with
which deals received no evaluation at all on each of these criteria. A deal would not be
evaluated on a particular criterion if it did not enter the decision-making process. The
frequency of missing responses was particularly high in the case of five of the
evaluation criteria. The patentability of the product was not evaluated in 30% of the
cases. Manufacturing aspects such as raw material availability and production capabilities were not evaluated in almost one-third of the cases. The tax benefits of the
investment were not evaluated in 34.4% of the deals. Finally, the extent to which the
investment offset or hedged the risk of the existing portfolio was not evaluated in
53.3% of the cases.

<-----Page 9----->VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

1059

Why do these five items sustain such a high nonresponse rate? Though the data
themselves do not answer these questions, it is possible to speculate why this occurs.
There is a disillusionment with the patent process and many entrepreneurs and venture
capitalists feel that the public disclosure of the product design in the patent application
leads to more competitive entry rather than less. Venture capitalists generally do not
worry about raw material and production capabilities as these are technical problems
easily solved if the product and its marketing are viable. Tax benefits are not relevant
in evaluating many deals because venture capitalists see their mission as reaping
capital gains rather than providing tax shelters for the investors in their fund. Finally,
the fact that a deal's relationship to the existing portfolio is not evaluated in more than
half the cases is consistent with the results of Study I. Of the 46 venture capitalists
interviewed, 28 claimed that they evaluated each deal on its own individual merit.
Only one of the interviewees claimed that impact on portfolio risk was formally
analyzed.
All the scales, with the exception of the two which had the highest rate of missing
data, namely the tax benefits and hedge against current portfolio, were factor analyzed.
The varimax factor loadings are given in Table 2. A five-factor solution explains
60.4% of the variation in the 21 rating items. Adding a sixth factor would have added
an incremental 6.3% of the variance explained; however the interpretability of this
sixth factor was poor (each factor was interpreted on the basis of the items which load
most heavily on it).
Based upon the factor structure in Table 2, we conclude that venture capitalists
evaluate potential deals in terms of five basic characteristics. The first characteristic
which we labeled Market Attractiveness depends upon the size, growth and accessibility of the market and on the existence of a market need. The second characteristic
reflects Product Differentiation which is determined by the ability of the entrepreneur
to apply his technical skills in creating a product which is unique can deter competition through patents and enjoy a high profit margin. The third characteristic reflects
the Managerial Capabilities of the venture's founders. This capability results from skills
in managing several business functional areas and is associated with favorable references given to the entrepreneurs. The fourth factor represents the extent to which the
venture is resistant to uncontrollable pressures from the environment. These pressures
may result from obsolescence due to changing technology, from sensitivity to economic conditions or from low barriers to entry by competition. This factor was labeled
Environmental Threat Resistance. The final factor represents the extent to which the
venture capitalist feels that the investment can be liquidated or "cashed out" at the
appropriate time. This is labeled as Cash-Out Potential.
The next step was to profile each deal in terms of the five dimensions. A score was
computed for each deal on each factor as an average of the ratings of the items which
loaded heavily on the factor.' For each factor, a Cronbach alpha was computed as an
indication of the reliability of that factor. The Cronbach alpha values are reported on
the diagonal of the matrix in Table 3. These range from 0.71 to 0.79. Table 3 also
reports the intercorrelation of the factors.
A linear regression model was used to relate each deal's scores on the five
dimensions to subjective estimates of its level of expected return and perceived risk,
respectively. The expected return was estimated on a four-point scale. Risk was

estimated in terms of the probability of commercial failure: the higher the probability
of failure, the greater the riskiness of the venture.* Table 4 reports the results of the
two regressions.

22% of the variance in estimated rate of return. The R values associated with the two
regressions are significant at the 0.01 level.
Two aspects of the deal's evaluation have a significant impact on the risk associated
with the deal. A lack of managerial capabilities significantly increases the perceived
risk ( p < O.O5).The relative magnitudes of the beta coefficients show that managerial
capabilities have the strongest effect on reducing the riskiness of the deal and
resistance to environmental threats has the next highest effect. Other characteristics of
the deal do not influence the perceived risk at a significant level.
Two different aspects of the deal's evaluation influence the expected rate of return.
Attractive market conditions have the strongest effect ( p < 0.01) and a highly differentiated product has the next highest effect ( p < 0.05). other characteristics of the deal
do not significantly influence the expected return.
Interestingly, the cash-out potential of a venture does not seem to influence either
perceived risk or return. This is particularly surprising because without a merger,
acquisition or public offering, the investor is severely constrained in realizing any
gains.

VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

In our sample of 90 deals, 43 were endorsed as acceptable investments, 25 were
denied funds and the balance were either pending a decision or no decision was
specified. Discriminant analysis was used to examine the ability of the perceived risk
and return to distinguish between rejected and accepted deals. For this purpose, we
analyzed only the 68 deals for which a definite decision was made.
The standardized discrimination function coefficients of the two predictor variables,
expected return and perceived risk, are 0.52 and -0.87, respectively. The signs are as
expected; namely, a high expected return increases the likelihood that the deal is
accepted and a high perceived risk increases its likelihood of being rejected. The fact
that the signs of the discriminant coefficients are different, i.e., one is positive whereas
the other negative, indicates a trade-off relationship between risk and return, a lower
expected return is acceptable if offset by a lower risk.
The predictive ability of the discriminant function can be evaluated in terms of the
accuracy with which it can classify deals as accepted or rejected. 68.4% of the deals
actually rejected were classified as such and 95.2% of the deals actually accepted were
classified as such. Together, this represents 86.9% of the deals being correctly classified. The predictive ability of a discriminant function can be evaluated by comparing
the percentage of cases correctly classified against two criteria (Morrison 1969).
Proportional Chance Criterion: C,,, = a 2 (1 Maximum Chance Criterion: C,,, = max(a, 1 - a),
where a and 1 - a are the proportions in each group.

function classified 86.9% of the cases correctly, it performs considerably better than
both the proportional chance criterion and the maximum chance criterion.
Figure 2 is a schematic representation of how evaluation criteria have an impact on
the venture capitalist's decision to invest, as inferred by Study 11. In summary, the
attractiveness of the market and the product's differentiation are related to the
expected return. A capable management team and resistance to environmental threats
indicate a lower risk of commercial failure. Finally, the decision to invest is determined
by the risk vs. return expectations vis-8-vis a venture. As expected, venture capitalists
are risk-averse and profit-oriented in their decision and, moreover, they are willing to
invest in risky deals if offset by the profit potential.
Neither Study I nor I1 collected any data relevant to the deal structuring (Step 4) or
post-investment activities (Step 5) aspects of the model in Figure 1. These were
addressed in a more general fashion in the validation component described in the next
section.
Validation of the Model
Seven cooperating venture capitalists agreed to participate in a follow-up study to
validate the model. The participants were selected to provide representation from the
viewpoint of the various types of venture capital investors. Included in the set of
cooperating venture capitalists were: a large venture capital firm which also participates in underwriting new equity issues; a small venture capital partnership composed
of successful entrepreneurs who have sold their companies; a venture capital partnership with several generations of funds ranked in the top five in terms of number of
deals made and dollars invested for 1982; a well-known venture capital firm which
specializes in a narrow high technology industry segment; an SBIC; an individual
venture capitalist investor; and a venture capital partnership substantially owned by a
major banking institution. Each of the participating venture capitalists was asked to
review the specification of the components of our model. These are summarized in the
left-hand column of Table 5. Also the venture capitalists were asked to elaborate upon
their reaction to the validity of the model. These responses are also shown in Table 5.
In general, there is agreement with the model's specification. Some of the comments
elaborate upon the model specifications; others take exception with selected components of the model. The major departures from the model's specification are as
follows:
(1) The model may have under-represented the extent to which venture capitalist's
stress the quality of the management team as an early screening criterion. Also, the size
of investment is not a screening criterion for several respondents.
(2) There was considerable disagreement with our statistical result that the quality
of the management team influences risk but not expected return. Three of the seven
respondents feel that management capabilities are an indicator of potential return
rather than risk. A more fundamental issue is raised by VC5. This respondent does not
formally distinguish between risk and return, as was implicitly assumed in our
formulation.
(3) Earn-out arrangements are not extensively used in structuring deals. VC5 offers
insight into a different type of deal structure which tries to achieve the same objective
as an earn-out. In an earn-out arrangement, the share of the entrepreneur is determined by the venture's performance, thereby giving the investor control if the
performance is poor. Instead, VC5 achieves much the same effect by the use of a
"vesting" arrangement. Since the share of the entrepreneur vests over time, this gives
the investor control in the early development of the venture even though his ultimate
share may be a minority position.

<-----Page 15----->VENTURE CAPITALIST INVESTMENT ACTIVITY

1065

Though the responses in Table 5 are in general agreement with our model's
specification, there is a disturbing lack of common structure to the way the 7 venture
capitalists reacted to the model. The diversity of the responses, both in content and
style, demonstrates the heterogeneity in the practices of different venture capital firms,
This heterogeneity cautions against too rigid a specification in any model describing
venture capital management.
Conclusions
The purpose of this paper is two-fold. The first is to stimulate an interest in modeling the management of
venture capital funds. The second is to provide entrepreneurs with insights which can help in their dealings
with venture capitalists.
With respect to the first objective, the value of the study may perhaps be as much in what it did not
achieve as in what it did achieve. A five-step model of the activities of venture capitalists has been
developed. The model, however, is highly descriptive and lacks a theoretical basis. Moreover, the model is
admittedly simplistic. A more rigorously specified model, however, could not capture the heterogeneity of
practices across the many venture capital firms. Wells (1974) achieved a higher level of specificity in his
modeling of venture capital fund management, but only at the expense of a unique model for each of the
firms in his relatively small sample. Finally, the empirical portion of this paper has focused on the first three
steps, and especially the third step, of the model. Most of the previous research on this topic share the same
focus. In contrast, the fourth and fifth steps, namely deal structuring and post-investment activities, have not
received much attention. In particular, the pricing of venture capital investments, in terms of the equity
relinquished has not been modeled. Also, since most ventures involve several rounds of financing, the
implications of future capital needs on investment decisions in earlier rounds of financing need to be
explored. These limitations of the model presented in this paper are, hopefully, the stimuli for a continued
interest in modeling venture capital investments.
The second objective of this paper is to provide potential entrepreneurs with insight into the way venture
capitalists manage their funds. These insights are also valuable to managers in large companies who wish to
improve their allocation of resources to internal ventures competing for new business development funds.
First, professional relationships with CPAs, lawyers, bankers and successful entrepreneurs who have a high
degree of credibility with the venture capital community is a help in locating capital. Second, the venture
capital community is often smaller than it seems due to the high incidence of syndication whereby several
venture capitalists co-invest in a venture. Third, venture capitalists differ in the screening criteria used to
guide their investments. Most deals would have to match the investor's industry and geographic preferences,
risk preferences for different financing stages, and investment policy in terms of the amount they will invest
in a single deal. Finally, four aspects of the business plan are used to evaluate the riskiness and potential
profit associated with a particular deal. These are (1) the marketing factors and the venture's ability to
manage them effectively, (2) product's competitive advantages and uniqueness, (3) quality of the management team, particularly in its balance of skills, (4) exposure to risk factors beyond the venture's control, e.g.,
technological obsolescence, competitive entry, cyclical sales fluctuations. In presenting a deal to a venture
capitalist, these four aspects should be used to favorably position the ~ e n t u r e . ~
