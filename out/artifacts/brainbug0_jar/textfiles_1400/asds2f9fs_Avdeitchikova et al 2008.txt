Early research on business angels recognized a couple of methodological obstacles that
signiﬁcantly have hindered knowledge accumulation about the phenomenon. In this
article we will reﬂect upon these methodological obstacles with focus on deﬁnitional
issues and sampling techniques. The purpose is to provide a framework that systemizes
and inter-relates the variety of deﬁnitions within the ﬁeld as well as to critically review
the sampling techniques currently applied in the research ﬁeld. We maintain that
researchers need to make conscious deﬁnitional choices when conducting studies of
informal investors and business angels, and argue that changing the unit of analysis
from investor level to deal level can help to avoid deﬁnitional inconsistencies. Further,
we suggest two alternative ways of creating high quality samples of business angels and
informal investors – the random sample approach and the multi-sample approach. Both
procedures reduce the sample bias and allow for longitudinal analysis which is argued to
be essential in future research.

Introduction
Business angels play an important role in the economy, and in many countries constitute
the largest source of external funding, after family and friends, in newly established
ventures. This has made business angels the centre of attention for policy-makers, who
acknowledge their increasing importance in providing risk capital as well as contributing
to economic growth and technological advances (Murray 2007).
However, business angel investment activities are not a new phenomenon. Private
individuals have always had a tendency to invest in high-risk projects. Examples of
entrepreneurs raising capital from private investors can be found in the Babylonian era as
well as in early medieval Europe. One famous example is the decision by Queen Isabella of
Spain to ﬁnance the voyage of Christopher Columbus – a highly proﬁtable investment for
the Spanish. In addition, it can be argued that in many countries the investments made by
private individuals were inﬂuential in the development of the industrial revolution during
the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
The business angel market started attracting the attention of policy-makers and
researchers in the 1950s and 1960s. For example, in the late 1950s the US Federal Reserve
performed a couple of investigations into the initial ﬁnancing of new technology-based

ﬁrms – studies that preceded the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The interest in the
early ﬁnancing of technology-based ﬁrms triggered a focus on business angels as an
important external source of ﬁnance for entrepreneurial ventures with a basis in new
technologies, and the early research contributions date from the 1960s and 1970s (e.g.
Rubenstein 1958; Baty 1964; Hoﬀman 1972; Brophy 1974; Charles River Associates 1976).
Nevertheless, it was the pioneering work of Professor William Wetzel at the University
of New Hampshire in the USA that put business angels on the ‘research map’. Wetzel’s
study ‘Angels and informal risk capital’, published in Sloan Management Review in 1983,
was based on the widely held perception that new technology-based ﬁrms encountered
problems when raising small amounts of early-stage ﬁnancing. Anecdotal evidence
indicated that business angels played a role in solving this problem.
Wetzel showed that business angels shared some common traits; they were typically
wealthy, self-made, male, highly active investors who invested in close geographical
proximity to their home, and relied heavily on their network of friends and business
associates. In addition, business angels were found to be an important source of external
seed capital and, not least, showed a strong interest in ﬁnancing technology-based
ventures. Wetzel’s work can be regarded as the ﬁrst serious attempt to ‘put some
boundaries on our ignorance’ and gain better understanding of what at that time was a
largely neglected phenomenon.
The seminal study by Wetzel (1983) resulted in an increased interest in the business
angel market among researchers not only in the USA but worldwide. The research has
followed some distinct patterns over time (for a detailed review, see Mason and Harrison
1999, 2000; Mason 2006; Kelly 2007). The ﬁrst generation of studies centred around two
main questions that still are being investigated today:
(1) How large is the business angel market?
(2) What characterizes business angels?
Research has also moved beyond describing the business angel market and the
investor as an individual. During the past two decades, researchers have tended to
turn their attention to questions such as (Mason and Harrison 2000; Mason 2006; Kelly
2007):
. How does the business angel market operate in practice, for example when it comes
to the investment process and decision criteria?
. What is the role of public policy in stimulating and supporting the market?
. How can theory help us to understand the business angel phenomenon?
In many respects these studies provide an important knowledge base from which
researchers can achieve an increased level of sophistication in terms of framing the
research questions and increasing the understanding of the business angel phenomenon.
However, in general, the researchers to date have deﬁned their research interests rather
narrowly, with a strong focus on highly active investors who invest rather large amounts
of money, but also contribute their skills, experience and networks to the ﬁrms in which
they invest. In addition, we can characterize the research within the ﬁeld as being rather
descriptive in nature, most often looking at the phenomenon from the perspective of the
investor and conducted in an Anglo-Saxon context, mainly in the USA and the UK.
Further, the dominant methodological approach in the research is quantitative studies
with cross-sectional surveys as the main data collection method.

Already in early research on business angels it was recognized that this was a very
diﬃcult domain of research and a couple of obstacles have signiﬁcantly hindered
knowledge accumulation about business angels. First, research on business angels is
characterized by the use of inconsistent deﬁnitions, as diﬀerent scholars have deﬁned and
demarcated the object of study in various ways (Riding, Madill, and Haines, Jr. 2007). For
example, the concepts ‘business angel’ and ‘informal investor’ are often used
interchangeably, but are just as often distinguished from each other. To make the
problem even more complicated, studies of business angels refer to them as informal
investors, and vice versa. Second, from a methodological perspective, Wetzel’s seminal
study (1983) revealed that business angels are very diﬃcult to identify, because of their
anonymous and invisible nature. As a consequence, and owing to the fact that the
proportion of business angels in the general population is very low, many studies have
relied on convenience samples. When drawn from formalized angel networks or business
angels who appear in the media, etc., the samples can be argued to generate bias, making it
diﬃcult to claim that the research is representative of the population. This has led to a
situation where research on business angels has not appealed to scholars in search of
methodological and statistical rigour.
In this article we will reﬂect upon the methodological obstacles to research outlined
above. The purpose is to provide a framework that clariﬁes concerns and ‘grey areas’
regarding deﬁnitions of business angels and informal investors, as well as to critically
review the sampling methodologies currently applied in the research ﬁeld and suggest ways
to obtain more rigorous datasets.
Two large research projects on informal investors and business angels constitute the
basis for our reﬂections. The ﬁrst project started in 2004 and concerns informal
investors on a general level. This project focuses on the macro-level characteristics of
the market, such as market scope and geographical distribution of investment activities.
The second project is a study that focuses on the Swedish business angel market. It
was initiated in 2003 with the aim of providing new insights on business angel
characteristics, behaviour, and an understanding of how business angels use their social
networks in their investment process. Both projects represent an attempt to develop
methodological rigour within the ﬁeld of business angel research, but they diﬀer in that
they are based on two fundamentally diﬀerent approaches to studying business angels
and informal investors.
The conclusion that can be drawn from this article is that the research on business
angels is characterized by the use of inconsistent deﬁnitions – there are multiple ways
of deﬁning and demarcating the object of study. Thus, we really do not know what we
mean when we talk about ‘business angels’. Our arguments and reasoning in the
article are as follows. First, it is not possible, and perhaps not even desirable, to
establish a single way of deﬁning the investors on the informal venture capital market.
The ﬁeld is characterized by a growing number of research questions of interest for
inquiry, thus limiting the ﬁeld to one deﬁnition can impede empirical and theoretical
progress. Diﬀerent deﬁnitions are more or less appropriate depending on the research
questions raised. In addition, many deﬁnitional problems are caused by cultural and
institutional diﬀerences in diﬀerent countries, which indicate that we need to
contextualize our deﬁnitions. However, maybe most importantly, researchers within
the ﬁeld need to be more stringent in the way they use deﬁnitions and concepts in their
research.
Second, empirical research has established that business angels make diﬀerent kinds of
investments over time as their investment career develops as well as in diﬀerent kinds of

<-----Page 3----->374

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

deals. For example, in one deal the investor can act as a business angel whereas in
others s/he will act more passively – therefore in order to cover diﬀerent kinds of situations
and the dynamics of the informal investments we need to change focus of our research
from looking at the general investment behaviour of individuals to the nature of the
individual investment, i.e. changing the unit of analysis from the individual to the
investment.
The deﬁnitions used in the studies also have an impact on the sampling techniques
applied. Earlier research in many cases relied on small convenience samples of business
angels. In this respect we argue that in order to gain robust knowledge within the ﬁeld, we
need to increase the quality of the sample frame used. This implies a considerable
investment in terms of time and money, which is necessary in order to gain a better
understanding of the phenomenon as well as to gain legitimacy in the ﬁeld of research. In
the article we suggest two alternative ways of creating high quality samples of business
angels and informal investors, which we have labelled the random sample approach and
the multi-sample approach.
Finally, we argue that the samples should permit longitudinal analysis. This is related
to the fact that investment behaviour changes during the investor’s career and from
deal to deal, and the best way to capture these changes is by following a set of individuals
over a period of time. More importantly, longitudinal analysis allows measurement of
the eﬀect of policy interventions and thereby facilitates the development of more
eﬀective policies for stimulating business angel investment (see Mason and Harrison this
issue).
The remainder of the article is structured as follows. After this introduction, deﬁnition
considerations in research are discussed, followed by a presentation of the sampling
problems identiﬁed within the ﬁeld of research. Two alternative ways of handling these
issues are presented on the basis of two research projects. Finally, the main deﬁnition and
sampling problems in the research ﬁeld are summarized and possible methodological
development is discussed.
Deﬁnition considerations
Despite 25 years of research on business angels there is still no uniform deﬁnition of the
most central concepts within the area. In research, the concepts ‘business angels’ and
‘informal investors’ are not stringently applied. Sometimes the concepts are used to
distinguish one from the other, but more often they are used interchangeably. Additional
problems are caused by the fact that diﬀerent researchers apply varying and often
arbitrary criteria for deﬁning the study population. Needless to say, this lack of rigour
makes empirical studies diﬃcult to interpret and compare.
Institutional venture capital investors and business angels
As a starting point we will make a distinction between investments made by institutional
venture capital investors and investments made by business angels. Although it is no easy
task to provide a generally accepted deﬁnition of institutional venture capital, institutional
venture capitalists act as intermediaries between ﬁnancial institutions (such as large
companies, pension funds, and so on) and unquoted companies, raising ﬁnance from the
former to invest in the latter (Lumme, Mason, and Suomi 1998). Wright and Robbie
(1998) deﬁned institutional venture capital as professional investors of long-term,
unquoted, risk equity ﬁnance in new ﬁrms where the primary reward is eventual capital

<-----Page 4----->375

Venture Capital

gain supplemented by dividends. Elaborating on this deﬁnition, Mason and Harrison
(1999, 16) stated that
the institutional VC industry comprises full-time professionals who raise ﬁnance from pension
funds, insurance companies, banks and other ﬁnancial institutions to invest in entrepreneurial
ventures. Institutional venture capital ﬁrms take various forms: publicly traded companies,
‘captive’ subsidiaries of large banks and other ﬁnancial institutions, and independent limited
partnerships.

Deﬁned in this way, the institutional venture capital market and business angel
investments seem to be distinct from each other with some key distinguishing features.
The main distinctions between the institutional and business angel investments are
summarized in Table 1.
Categories of informal investors
Looking back on the research, we can identify several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of the object of
study on the informal venture capital market (Landström 2007). Initially, the term
‘business angel’ was the most widespread. Originally, the term ‘angel’ was used to describe
individuals who helped to ﬁnance theatre productions on Broadway (‘theatre angels’).
These ‘angels’ invested in theatre productions mainly for the pleasure of rubbing shoulders
with their favourite actors. It was a question of high-risk investment – the investors lost
their money if the production was a ﬂop but shared the proﬁts if it was a success (Benjamin
and Margulis 2001; Mason 2006). Later on, William Wetzel (1983) was one of the ﬁrst to
coin the term ‘business angel’ for people providing the same kind of investment for young
entrepreneurial ventures. Following this line of thought, Lerner (2000) describes a business
angel as:
A wealthy individual who invests in entrepreneurial ﬁrms. Although angels perform many of
the same functions as venture capitalists, they invest their own capital rather than that of
institutional or other individual investors. (p. 515)

In a similar way, Mason and Harrison (this issue) describe a business angel as:
A high net worth individual, acting alone or in a formal or informal syndicate, who invests his
or her own money directly in an unquoted business in which there is no family connection and
who, after making the investment, generally takes an active involvement in the business, for
example, as an advisor or member of the board of directors. (p. 309)

Mason and Harrison argue that some key features that distinguish business angels from
other types of informal investors are (ibid.): business angels invest their own money, make
their own investment decisions, mainly consider commercial aspects, are not involved in
within-family investments and take a ‘hands-on’ approach to the company in which they
invest.
However, in empirical studies it was recognized at an early stage that the informal
venture capital market was very heterogeneous, going far beyond individuals who are
active investors with a hands-on involvement in the ﬁrms in which they invest (e.g. Gaston
1989; Landström 1992). Thus, we have successively seen a broadening of the object of
study, from focusing entirely on ‘business angels’ to including a broader range of private
investors who make equity investments in entrepreneurial ventures (Landström 1992;
Avdeitchikova 2005). A common deﬁnition of these informal investors is, as suggested by
Mason and Harrison (2000), ‘private individuals who make investments directly in
unlisted companies in which they have no family connections’ (p. 137). This deﬁnition of
informal investors includes not only investments by business angels but also those made by
private investors who are less active in the ventures in which they invest as well as private
investors who invest smaller amounts of capital in unlisted companies, but the deﬁnition
excludes investments made by ‘family and friends’.
The exclusion of family and friends from the deﬁnition of informal investors is not
uncontroversial. For example, in the large Global Entrepreneurship Monitor international
research project, investments made by ‘family and friends’ are included in the study of
informal investments in diﬀerent countries (Reynolds, Bygrave, and Autio 2003). Thus, the
deﬁnition incorporates all non-institutional venture capital investments in unquoted
businesses, including family and friends – so-called ‘love money’. However, a central
argument in the deﬁnition by Mason and Harrison (2000) is that investments made by close
relatives and friends are based on considerations and criteria other than those that external
investors apply and, therefore, family-related investments should be excluded. This is not to
deny the importance of family funding in the ﬁnancing of newly established ventures –
family and friends are likely to be the major source of external funding for new ventures.
Based on the diﬀerent ways of deﬁning and demarcating the object of study in informal
venture capital literature outlined in this section, we can summarize our reasoning by
presenting four main deﬁnitions as shown in Table 2.
However, these deﬁnitions are ambiguous, and lead to many problems and grey areas,
as they do not fully address the complexity of the concept and the heterogeneity of the
informal venture capital market (see Figure 1). First, there is a grey area pertaining to the
channelling of investments, i.e. does the capital have to be invested directly by a private
individual or is it possible to invest through companies that are privately owned, or
through a company or fund that has multiple owners? Of course, this could be regarded as
a problem for all kinds of informal investors, but we believe that it is most signiﬁcant for
the category we deﬁne as business angels – there is a grey area between what should be
regarded as a business angel and an institutional venture capital investor. A second grey
area in our deﬁnitions concerns the requirements on the level of investment activity and
hands-on contributions given to the company invested in (e.g. Sørheim and Landström
2001; Avdeitchikova 2008). This blurs the distinction between what can be regarded as a
business angel and the more general deﬁnition of informal investors. Third, the existence
or non-existence of certain types of relations between the informal investors and the
entrepreneur is a subject of considerable debate among researchers within the ﬁeld. One
such example is the inclusion or exclusion of investments in family members’ ventures (e.g.
Farrell 1998; Reynolds, Bygrave, and Autio 2003; Maula, Autio, and Murray 2005).

Investors carrying out professional investments of long-term,
unquoted risk equity ﬁnance in new ﬁrms, where the
primary reward is eventual capital gains supplemented by
dividends (Wright and Robbie 1998).
High net worth individuals who invest a proportion
of their assets in high-risk, high-return entrepreneurial
ventures (Freear, Sohl, and Wetzel 1994). Apart from
investing money, business angels contribute their commercial
skills, experience, business know-how and contacts, playing a
hands-on role in the company (Mason and Harrison 1995).
Private individuals who invest risk capital directly in unquoted
companies to which they have no family connection (Mason
and Harrison 2000). Thus, informal investors include business
angels as well as private investors who contribute relatively
small amounts of money and do not take an active part in the
object of investment.
Investors making investments in start-ups not founded by the
investor him/herself, i.e. including family investments,
investments by friends, colleagues, etc., but excluding
investments in stocks and mutual funds (Reynolds, Bygrave,
and Autio 2003).

Grey areas in deﬁnitions of actors on the risk capital market.

We elaborate on these problems of deﬁnition, or grey areas, in the following. The
purpose of the discussion is not to establish one single deﬁnition, but rather to reﬂect on
the dimensions that need clariﬁcation in a deﬁnition of business angels and informal
investors in order to allow diﬀerent research results to be thoroughly evaluated and
compared.

<-----Page 7----->378

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

Grey area 1: requirements on the channelling of the investments
One area of debate in earlier research concerns the channelling of the invested capital. We
distinguished between business angels and institutional venture capital investors, where
the latter are professional investors who invest other people’s money in funds and ﬁrms.
Business angels, on the other hand, are private individuals who invest their own personal
assets. However, this is to some extent an over-simpliﬁed way of dividing the market.
Earlier unpublished data on business angels in Sweden indicate that 42% of business angel
investments are channelled through private or family-owned companies, and an additional
15% through companies jointly owned by the business angel and his or her co-investors.
Although this scenario is well known, it has become more important to deal with it
methodologically, as increasing numbers of investors carry out their investments through
syndicates and become actively involved in more or less formalized business angel
networks (Sohl 2007). We have also seen examples of funds used to leverage business angel
investments. These ‘side-car funds’ are raised through companies and governmental
organizations that want to support and/or beneﬁt from business angel competence and
used to co-invest with other business angels as well as sometimes being managed directly
by business angel networks (Murray 2007). This creates an additional degree of ambiguity
when distinguishing between business angel investments and institutional venture capital
investments. Historically, researchers have dealt with this issue diﬀerently. Fiet (1995) for
example, called those business angels that invest through a company ‘quasi-angels’, and
deleted all such investors from the study. Coveney and Moore (1998), on the other hand,
labelled such investors ‘corporate angels’, and included them in the sample. In general,
however, most researchers do not describe how they have handled the issue of channelling
of investments.
It is our ﬁrm conviction that researchers should deal with business angels that invest
through private or family-owned companies in the same way as they deal with business
angels that invest their private means directly. Companies are often likely to have been set
up for tax reasons but it is still the investor’s money and the investor is making the
investment decision. Furthermore, the exclusion of informal investments made through
companies is a disadvantage when it comes to comparing results from diﬀerent countries.
Diﬀerent taxation and legislative systems mean that the incentive to invest privately or
through a company diﬀers from country to country, and the proportion of the two types
of investment – individual investments and those made through companies – in each
country is often unknown. On the other hand, it is diﬃcult to draw a line between
institutional venture capital and business angel investment through jointly owned
companies.
Increasing diversity in terms of how investors carry out investments means that the
diﬀerence between business angels and institutional venture capitalists has become less
apparent. The key issue regarding this grey area is whether a business angel or a
‘gatekeeper’ makes the ﬁnal investment decision. There are for instance family oﬃces of
wealthy individuals that carry out investments in venture capital funds in which an
investment manager makes the ﬁnal decision whether to go through with and investment
or not (Leleux, Schwass, and Diversé 2007). As a rule of thumb, it could be argued that a
business angel should always have the possibility to decide whether or not to invest. If this
is not the case, the investor is an investor in an institutional venture capital fund rather
than a business angel. Hence, whether the investment is carried out privately or through a
company is not of primary interest. It is rather whether the business angel has a decisive
inﬂuence on the investment decision that is the key.

<-----Page 8----->Venture Capital

Grey area 2: requirements on the level of investment activity and hands-on contribution
A second grey area in the deﬁnitions used in earlier research concerns the investor’s level of
investment activity and hands-on contributions. Returning to Wetzel’s pioneering work
from 1983, the basic picture of a business angel is an investor who not only invests money
but also becomes actively involved and gives hands-on support based on previous business
experience. This basic picture of ‘intelligent money’ is probably one of the main reasons
why governments decided to support the business angel market in various ways. Although
there has been a tendency in the literature to focus on this group of highly active,
‘professional’ investors, we have seen some attempts to broaden the scope of the deﬁnition.
Many studies focus on informal investors, including not only investments by business
angels but also those made by private individuals who are less active in the ventures in
which they invest. It is not possible to deﬁne some general criteria for the level of
investment activity and hands-on contribution that would qualify an investor as a business
angel. Thus, the very choice of these criteria will largely determine the results.
When discussing the issue of how active an informal investor should be in order to be
regarded as a business angel, it is important to bear in mind that an increasingly large
number of business angels carry out syndicate investments (Månsson and Landström
2006). This means that there are an increasing number of cases where business angels take
the lead position in some investments, at the same time as they are less active in others,
where they allow other investors to lead. This creates a methodological problem that has
to be addressed, as co-investing business angels could easily be mistaken for less active
informal investors.
Informal investors and business angels also diﬀer as regards the amounts invested in
unquoted companies. It is obvious that individuals who invest a couple of 1000 Euro are
very diﬀerent from those investing 100 times or even 1000 times that amount (Sørheim and
Landström 2001). However, placing certain requirements on the level of investment
activity, and especially on the absolute level of ﬁnancial contribution in the investment
situation, can be particularly problematic when conducting cross-country comparisons.
The amounts invested that allow the informal investor to be characterized as business
angel are probably dependent on macro-variables. For instance, it can be argued that this
indicator should be related to the income level or GDP per capita, rather than being
treated as the same for all countries.
Grey area 3: requirements on the ties between the investor and entrepreneur
A third grey area in research concerns the ties between the investor and entrepreneur.
Sometimes investments from friends and family, ‘love money’, are included in the
deﬁnition (e.g. Reynolds, Bygrave, and Autio 2003; Riding 2005) while in other studies
friends and/or family are explicitly excluded. Reynolds, Bygrave, and Autio (2003) found
that the informal venture capital market is dominated by ‘micro’ type investments, where
the level of resource contribution is marginal, and the vast majority of the investments
(88%) come from family members, friends and neighbours. Thus, family-related investors
seem to be an important source of capital for many young ﬁrms, and some scholars argue
that this category of investors ought to be considered a part of the informal venture capital
market (Farrell 1998; Reynolds, Bygrave, and Autio 2003).
Whether or not to include family-related investments in the deﬁnition of the informal
venture capital market has been a subject of academic debate, and the central argument
against inclusion is that investments made by close relatives and friends are based on

<-----Page 9----->380

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

considerations and investment criteria other than those applied by external investors (see
e.g. Mason and Harrison 2000; Maula, Autio, and Murray 2005). For example, Mason
and Harrison (this issue) argue that investments by family investors should be excluded
from the deﬁnition, as they are conceptually distinct from other informal investments.
Moreover, family investments are constrained by ties of blood and marriage and therefore
not available outside the family, thus do not constitute a market.
In addition, the concept of ‘family’ involves a great degree of ambiguity. What
constitutes a family and who should be considered a family member are the questions that
have become increasingly problematic, not least in family business research. Some
researchers have argued that the concept of family is inﬂuenced by historical and cultural
factors. For instance, in countries with a strong individualistic culture, like most of
Western Europe and the USA, people may have a narrower view of family, deﬁning it as
their closest relatives. In contrast, those who live in countries with a collectivistic culture,
such as parts of Asia, South America and the Middle East, may tend to see family in a
broader sense and include not only distant relatives, but in some cases even friends. This
ambiguity becomes problematic when conducting cross-country comparisons, because the
concept of family is country-speciﬁc rather than general. Additional diﬃculties arise as the
meaning of the concept of family evolves over time. During the past decades we have seen
many changes in the view of what constitutes a family, and in many developed countries
the traditional concept of family has become weaker. Therefore, including or excluding
family-related investments needs to be based on a solid deﬁnition of who is considered to
be a family member in the context of each particular study.
Finally, the inclusion or exclusion of investments in friends’ companies creates
additional problems. It can be argued that friendship to a large extent functions and aﬀects
investment decisions in the same way as family ties and that these should be excluded, as
they may not be part of an open market. However, the exclusion of investments in friends’
companies creates some problems for the researcher. Friendship suddenly becomes a key
concept and the researcher has to draw a line between friends, acquaintances, business
associates, etc. (see Farrell et al. this issue). It also becomes an issue of timing, as
friendship may evolve during an investment process, which in itself creates methodological
diﬃculties if excluding investments in friends’ companies from the deﬁnition of informal
venture capital. Thus, the main point is that deﬁning both family and friends is
methodologically challenging, while failure to do so may create bias. This means that,
regardless of the chosen procedure, it is important that the researcher clearly states which
types of investment have been excluded and the criteria on which the decision was based.
When summarizing deﬁnition considerations in the research ﬁeld, it can be stated that
most of the informal venture capital literature today can, in one way or another, be
associated with three main deﬁnitions: (1) business angels, or highly active hands-on
investors; (2) informal investors, which includes not only business angels but also investors
with low investment activity and a passive relationship to their investments; and (3) all
non-institutional investors, including family and friends. While it is possible to
conceptually distinguish between these deﬁnitions, the practical aspects of using them
are far more problematic.
For the sake of conceptual clarity, one could probably argue that the ﬁeld
would beneﬁt from researchers agreeing upon one single deﬁnition. However, looking at
how the research ﬁeld has developed historically, we can see that diﬀerent deﬁnitions have
been driven by diﬀerent research interests. For instance, most of the ‘business angel’
literature concerned investor attitudes, behaviour and characteristics as well as decisionmaking and had a strong policy focus. On the other hand, studies that adopted a broader

<-----Page 10----->Venture Capital

381

deﬁnition – informal investors – were mainly concerned with more general issues, such as
market heterogeneity and geographical variations in investment activity (e.g. Sørheim and
Landström 2001; Avdeitchikova and Landström 2005; Avdeitchikova 2008). Finally,
those that adopted the broadest deﬁnition and included friends and family mostly focused
on macro-level issues and the general role of informal venture capital in ﬁnancing new
ventures (e.g. Reynolds, Bygrave, and Autio 2003). Therefore, prioritizing one deﬁnition
would in practice mean giving preference to certain research questions. Thus, the challenge
is not to establish a single, ‘most appropriate’ deﬁnition of the object of study, but rather
to ﬁnd a way to be consistent about the existing deﬁnitions.
Sampling considerations
Having discussed deﬁnition considerations in the previous section, we will now focus on
problems related to samples of informal investors, and two alternative procedures for
obtaining large samples of these investors will be presented. Whereas the discussion on
deﬁnitions had implications for quantitative as well as qualitative research, this section
was written with an emphasis on quantitative approaches.
From the start of research on business angels and informal investors in the 1980s, it
was noted that the market was anonymous and invisible, making business angels and
informal investors very diﬃcult to identify. Wetzel (1983) stated that ‘the population is
unknown and probably unknowable’, indicating that trying to sample the informal
investor population is a diﬃcult process, as there are no registers or public records of
informal investors. In addition, the fact that only a very small proportion of a country’s
population carries out informal investments makes it expensive to identify suﬃcient
numbers of investors through random selection among the general public.
In order to deal with this situation, Harrison and Mason (1992) suggest diﬀerent
techniques for identifying informal investors: (1) sending questionnaires to a large number
of individuals believed to be investors; (2) contacting investors through the companies they
have invested in; and (3) identifying investors using the ‘snowball’ method by which
known investors are asked to identify their peers. When using the snowball method, the
starting point has often been a fourth technique, namely contacting members of selfselected registers, for instance members of business angel networks (BANs). Each of these
techniques has drawbacks that make the samples non-representative and biased in one
way or another, and many studies have relied on convenience samples of business angels
and informal investors. In addition, as a consequence of the diﬃculties involved in
identifying investors, many studies have relied on very small samples, which of course
increases the problem of representativeness.
The following discussion reviews the sampling techniques used in earlier studies and
illuminates their advantages and disadvantages.
In population studies a representative sample of the adult population is asked about
their investment behaviour. Using a sample of the general population to identify large
numbers of informal investors is desirable, as the degree of representativeness is high.
However, as the proportion of the general population that carries out investments in
unquoted companies is very low, large or very large samples are needed to extrapolate the
results, which make such studies relatively expensive. Studies in which this sampling
technique has been used include the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)
international research programme, in which a representative sample of the adult
population in a country is asked, by means of a telephone survey, about their
entrepreneurial activities and whether they have invested in someone else’s businesses.

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

Avdeitchikova and Landström (2005) and Avdeitchikova (2008) conducted a similar
random population survey of more than 40 000 individuals in Sweden in order to screen
for those individuals who had made investments in unquoted companies not owned by
family members. Studies of this type often have a broader deﬁnitional scope, focusing on
the population of informal investors or even all non-institutional venture capitalists. One
reason for this is that the narrow deﬁnition of business angels makes them even rarer, thus
few such investors are found, even in a large sample.
The problem of sampling a small population is by no means conﬁned to business angel
research. Researchers who, for example, study drug addicts also have to deal with a small
proportion of the general population that prefers to keep a low proﬁle (Biernacki and
Waldorf 1981). In such cases the researcher has no choice but to limit the search for
respondents. This can, for example, be done by setting boundaries on the population
sampled in order to limit the search for business angels to groups in which they are likely
to be found. In these focus group surveys, questionnaires are sent to a large number of
individuals believed to be business angels or informal investors in a broader sense, for
example, high income earners, CEOs, medical doctors, dentists, commercial bankers,
owners and managers of SMEs, business owners, etc. as well as members of intermediary
organizations such as Chambers of Commerce and Regional Development Associations.
It is hoped that the proportion of investors in the sampled population will be large, which
is advantageous when processing the data. A positive aspect is that the registers used to
identify the respondents are often public and/or easily accessible, which reduces the cost of
the research. One disadvantage is that response rates are often low and the selection of
groups for sampling usually based on tautological reasoning. Sampling is made on the
basis of expectations of business angel characteristics and the responses are later used to
proﬁle them (Mason and Harrison this issue). This technique clearly creates a bias by
focusing on a group with certain characteristics.
A second procedure is snowball sampling (Berg 1988), where an initial set of
respondents is identiﬁed and asked to provide information on their peers. Having being
used in several studies, this method has become a popular way of increasing the number of
respondents with a minimum of eﬀort. Although the method usually generates high
response rates, it is biased, and it is important to be aware that it is heavily dependent on
how the ﬁrst set of respondents is recruited. The possibility of using theoretically based
sampling, through recruiting equal numbers of respondents with diﬀerent sets of
characteristics by means of snowball sampling has not been tested within the ﬁeld (for
further information regarding this method, see Biernacki and Waldorf 1981).
Self-selected registers – precisely targeting the population in focus – is one of the most
commonly used methods for studying business angels and includes registers of national
share investment associations, although those most frequently used in business angel
research are registers of membership developed by diﬀerent business angel network (BAN)
and angel syndicates. Furthermore, in some countries, for example the USA and the UK,
new legislation makes it possible for small ﬁrms to sell their shares to ‘accredited investors’
without the need to meet the requirements on securities legislation prospectus and
disclosure. Individuals can certify themselves as sophisticated investors if they meet the
required criteria, thus the register of authorized investors constitutes a well-focused list of
business angels. The use of self-selected registers often produces a high response rate and,
as accessibility and precise targeting levels are high, cost can be kept to a minimum. A
negative aspect of this technique is that the sampling often becomes heavily biased, as only
a very limited proportion of business angels choose to be part of a BAN. Diﬀerent BANs
have diﬀerent proﬁles and consequently attract diﬀerent types of individuals. This means

<-----Page 12----->Venture Capital

383

that a minimum requirement when using BANs to sample business angels is either to
conceptualize the BAN or to create a mixture of diﬀerent BANs that is aimed at oﬀsetting
any bias.
A ﬁnal method is to identify investors through the companies in which they have
invested. This is a popular sampling technique that has been used since the pioneering
studies of the 1980s. However, the sampling procedures diﬀer greatly between studies.
There are large surveys based on representative samples of small and medium-sized
businesses in which company representatives were asked if they had any informal investors
as shareholders in addition to more focused samples of businesses which are assumed to be
attractive to informal investors and business angels. The latter comprise samples of new
businesses or technology-based ﬁrms. An advantage of this procedure is that the
individual deals, rather than investors, are in focus in these studies, which is one way of
addressing the issue of various deﬁnitions discussed above. In addition, it is possible to
study the companies as well as the investors. A negative aspect is that in spite of focused
search parameters, the method requires the distribution of large numbers of questionnaires
to companies in order to generate a small sample of investments/investors.
The advantages and disadvantages of the diﬀerent kinds of sampling techniques can be
summarized as shown in Table 3.
In summary, the diﬀerent sampling techniques employed in earlier studies have various
strengths and weaknesses (see also Mason and Harrison this issue). With a few costly
exceptions, all methods generate some type of bias. In some cases, such as focus group
studies, the bias is obvious, as it clearly aﬀects results pertaining to business angel
characteristics. However, any of the discussed methods arguably generates bias that also
aﬀects the results regarding investor attitudes and behaviours. Whether this in turn has
negative implications for any given research largely depends on the research question. It is
important to bear in mind that, although random population studies are superior in terms
of generating representative samples, they are not always the most suitable way forward.
We will come back to this in the next section.
Following the description of how samples of informal investors and business angels
have been generated in existing literature, in the following section, two examples are
provided of how more rigorous datasets of business angels and informal investors can be
derived. These examples should be regarded as suggestions, as some aspects remain to be
dealt with in order to reﬁne the sampling processes.
Example 1 – random sample approach
A random method for sampling informal investors was suggested by Avdeitchikova and
Landström (2005) and further developed in Avdeitchikova (2008). The method is based on
identifying individuals from a random sample of adult Swedish citizens who invest in
unquoted companies that do not belong to themselves or members of their family. While
the method is similar to that employed in the GEM study, there are two main diﬀerences.
First, the size of the initial sample was 40, 320 individuals, which is more than 10 times
larger than the GEM study. Secondly, the data collection process was conducted in two
stages: (1) identiﬁcation; (2) veriﬁcation and data collection, both of which considerably
enhance the precision of the ﬁnal database.
The study began with a random survey of 40, 320 private individuals aged between 18
and 79 years to determine the number of informal investors in this group. It was carried
out by an external market research agency as part of an omnibus study of household
consumption and investment behaviour in Sweden. The obvious advantage of

participating in an omnibus study compared to conducting one’s own survey is the saving
in terms of cost. The main purpose in the initial stage was the identiﬁcation of active
informal investors for further study. The respondents were asked the following question:
‘Have you invested money in unquoted companies that do not belong to yourself or to a
member of your family within the last ﬁve years?’. Those who answered ‘yes’ were asked if
they would be willing to participate in the second stage of the study in addition to two
questions about their investment activity. Some background data on the respondents were
obtained from the market research agency for the purpose of conducting non-respondent
analysis at a later stage. The total cost of participation in the omnibus survey with the four
questions as outlined above was approximately e40 000. This can be compared to the cost
of designing and conducting one’s own survey with the same market coverage, which
would be many times higher.
The response rate was 59.9% which means that 24, 166 respondents answered the
screening question. To eliminate non-response bias, individuals were assigned weights on a
post-hoc basis to compensate for diﬀerences from the original sample in respect of a
number of background variables – gender, age and geographical location. The preliminary
survey identiﬁed 861 individuals who claimed to have invested in unquoted ventures to
which they had no family connection. The social security number of the 548 individuals
who agreed to participate in the second phase of the study was obtained from the tax
authorities in order to keep an up-to-date record of their contact information. The 548
respondents were then contacted by telephone in order to obtain detailed information
about their investments. Contact was established with 401 individuals (response rate

<-----Page 15----->386

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

73.2%), of whom 123 did not fulﬁl the criteria for informal investors. Some 32 individuals
declined participation, thus 278 met the criteria for informal investors, which resulted in
an eﬀective response rate of 50.7% (Table 4).
The fact that 123 out of 401 individuals that were contacted turned out to be noninvestors is signiﬁcant and once again indicates that there are considerable diﬃculties in
studying the informal venture capital market, and therefore a high risk of misinterpretation. The major source of the misunderstanding was that individuals in the screening
process were referring to investments made in their own companies, in family-owned
companies or in publicly traded companies. This indicates that estimates of the number of
informal investors based on a large random household survey (e.g. the GEM study) may
signiﬁcantly overestimate the number of informal investors in the population, and hence
the size of the market. The reason is that a signiﬁcant minority say ‘yes’ to the screening
question when in fact they are not informal investors.
Strengths and weaknesses of the random sample approach
The above methodology is advantageous in more ways than one. First and foremost, if
applied correctly, it generates an unbiased sample of informal investors, which is
representative of the whole population. This means that the data can be used to explore
the market in a way that otherwise is not possible such as accurately measuring its size and
studying regional diﬀerences in the supply of informal venture capital. Furthermore, the
random sample approach allows the researcher to be consistent about the deﬁnition used,
as every individual in the sample is selected according to the same predetermined selection
criteria. Moreover, the two-step approach results in high precision of the ﬁnal database,
because the respondents are veriﬁed twice for compliance to ensure that they fulﬁl the
selection criteria. Finally, the information obtained from the market research agency
includes the name and contact details of respondents (provided that they agree to
participate in the study), which makes longitudinal studies of individuals’ investment
behaviour possible.

However, the method is not without limitations. First, it can be costly to replicate the
sampling technique in countries with high regional variations in the supply of informal
venture capital, such as the UK and the USA. Considering such factors as diﬀerences in
industrial specialization, historical and cultural factors between regions, we can also
expect that the characteristics of informal investors will be diﬀerent depending on where in
the country they reside. Therefore, to achieve a reasonable level of representativeness, a
critical mass of respondents needs to be found, not only on the national but also on the
regional level. Thus, the size of the initial sample must be larger than at present, otherwise
the results will not have the required precision.
Even if a large sample is taken initially, the sample is very heterogeneous, which has
two consequences. First, while the sample can be expected to provide a reasonably good
picture of the broader population of informal investors, it is unlikely that the method will
generate a suﬃcient number of business angels for study. Even more signiﬁcantly, owing
to the high heterogeneity of the sample, many business angels are likely to be excluded
from the analysis, because most statistical programmes label them as ‘outliers’.
Meanwhile, Mason and Harrison (this issue) speciﬁcally emphasize that it is extremely
important not to exclude what they refer to as ‘super-angels’, or highly active investors, as
it may lead to a dramatic underestimation of the market size. Second, heterogeneity
creates problems when developing questionnaires, because they have to be adjusted to the
respondents, which means that the ‘lowest common denominator’ is chosen. Thus, for the
business angel group, this method does not use the full data accessing potential. In other
words, the random sample approach may be more appropriate for studying general
macro-level factors and exploring market structure and less appropriate for in-depth
analysis of diﬀerent groups of investors.
The two-stage random sample approach presented here addresses several methodological problems in the ﬁeld of informal venture capital research. However, there are a few
potential sources of bias in this method. Individuals are reluctant to provide information
about their investment behaviour, which results in a signiﬁcant number of non-responders,
despite the fact that data were gathered by telephone, which is usually the most eﬀective
means of data collection. In a worst case scenario, this can result in loss of
representativeness and reduce the random sample to what is essentially a convenience
sample. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to have access to background data on the
whole of the initial sample in order to perform a non-respondent analysis.
Furthermore, the sample needs to be updated on a continuous basis in order ensure a
reasonable response level in the subsequent follow-up studies in cases where the
researchers are interested in conducting a longitudinal analysis of the population, the
reason being that individuals can change both their name and address. Thus the best way
of maintaining the sample current is to obtain the social security number of each
respondent directly after the initial sample has been recruited.
Example 2 – multi-sample approach
As noted above, random samples of the general population are an ineﬀective means of
identifying business angels as deﬁned in this paper, because they supply too few
respondents to allow interesting and viable analysis on the data. Researchers have
therefore little choice but to use non-representative sampling techniques. This implies that
business angel researchers have to address the issues related to sampling bias. One way of
coping with the bias usually inherent in non-representative sampling methodologies is to
combine several diﬀerent sampling techniques, which should identify diﬀerent kinds of

<-----Page 17----->388

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

business angels (Sørheim and Landström 2001). This methodology was employed in the
research project presented here, where 1518 business angels were identiﬁed using seven
diﬀerent sampling techniques. The total sample was generated by seven diﬀerent
procedures (see Table 5): (1) 85 individuals were identiﬁed through business angel events
such as investor forums and the annual national business angel meeting, which is arranged
by the Swedish Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (SVCA); (2) another 685
respondents were identiﬁed through 15 diﬀerent BANs in various geographical locations
and with diﬀerent structures, ranging from a dozen closely knit investors who co-invest to
a couple of hundred more loosely tied members in an investors club; (3) 128 respondents
were identiﬁed through the Swedish Patent and Registration Oﬃce (SPRO) company
register, which was consulted in order to search for members of boards whose ﬁrst and
surnames in combination with ‘Investment Inc’ made up a company name; (4) 379
respondents were identiﬁed based on the fact that they are among the most wealthy
individuals in Sweden or within a designated area of Sweden; (5) 65 investors had willingly
or unwillingly made their way into newspaper articles and magazines and were often
identiﬁed through the companies they invested in; (6) 58 respondents were identiﬁed
through an earlier study in which a random sample of the adult population was used to
identify business angels; and (7) 118 respondents were identiﬁed through referral by
diﬀerent individuals who came into contact with our research as well as by means of
snowball sampling, as all respondents were requested to mention other business angels.
As can be seen in Table 5, the response rate was high to very high for most of the
groups, the only exceptions being the media and referral sub-samples. However, this is
understandable, as these more public individuals are probably approached by a large
number of people who are interested in their investments for one reason or another. These
groups also had a large number of respondents who returned the questionnaire but
neglected to ﬁll it in. The groups with the highest response rate were BAN members, with a
response rate of almost 50%, and the respondents identiﬁed through an earlier study,
where it was close to 70%.
Table 5 clearly illustrates that the referral and snowball techniques are most likely to
lead to the identiﬁcation of business angels according to our deﬁnition. This is also the
case with self-selected registers, which include respondents who participate in business
angel events and members of business angel networks. In contrast, the identiﬁcation of
wealthy individuals revealed that the correlation between high wealth and being a business
angel is not as strong as sometimes suggested. Moreover, a surprisingly low number of
business angels were found among the respondents identiﬁed as such in an earlier study,
although the screening question in the two studies was quite similar. This could be due to

the fact that these respondents had become tired of answering questionnaires and thus
gave a negative response to the initial question on the subject of whether they had invested
capital in unquoted companies to which they have no family connections, after which they
returned the blank questionnaire.
Taken together, the two parameters of returned questionnaires and the proportion of
returned questionnaires ﬁlled in by business angels form an important quota that indicates
the accuracy of the diﬀerent subsamples. Clearly, identiﬁcation by means of BANs is very
cost-eﬃcient, while public registers such as the SPRO register or identiﬁcation through
characteristics believed to be common among business angels, such as wealth, result in a
far smaller percentage of business angels for the same number of questionnaires sent.
Strengths and weaknesses of the multi-sample approach
The strengths and weaknesses of the overall study are to a large extent related to those of
the diﬀerent sub-samples. First, the sample is a combination of diﬀerent sub-samples
originating from various contexts, therefore it can be assumed that the level of bias in the
aggregated sample is lower than in each individual sub-sample, even if it cannot be
regarded as strictly representative of the population. Secondly, the procedure of
combining several sub-samples leads to a high response rate compared to population
studies. Thirdly, high response rates combined with the possibility of focusing on subsamples that yield a high proportion of business angels make it possible to reach large
numbers of business angels in a cost-eﬃcient manner.
This latter strength becomes particularly important when conducting longitudinal
analyses of market dynamics. By following the investment activity of business angels over
time, we can both develop an understanding of the investment behaviour of individuals
during their investment career and study how this behaviour is aﬀected by external factors,
such as the macroeconomic situation or speciﬁc policy measures. This is, however, only
possible if we can follow a reasonably high number of individuals over time. For instance,
in this study the initial data collection was conducted in 2003, and the follow-up in 2007.
Of the 693 respondents who received the questionnaire on both occasions, 84 business
angels answered the questions at both points in time. This low proportion, even though the
response rates were equally high on both occasions, clearly highlights the importance of
large samples when conducting longitudinal studies.
The main limitation of the multi-sample approach is that it does not prevent bias.
Although the combination of diﬀerent data sources arguably produces a more rigorous
sample, we still cannot claim that the sample is representative of the business angel
population. One could argue that bias becomes even more problematic when combining
diﬀerent samples, as they may be skewed in various ways, and the larger the number of
data sources used, the harder it may be to understand the way in which the ﬁnal sample is
biased. One way of handling this problem is to use theoretical sampling. The initial data
sources to be included in the study need to be analysed with respect to the main sources of
bias in each sub-sample. Once the bias has been quantiﬁed, the sub-samples can be
assigned weights depending on how much and in which way they contribute to skewing the
ﬁnal results. After that, the sub-samples can be combined to form the ﬁnal sample. The
advantage of this procedure is that it can be done ex post, after the data has been gathered,
at the same time as it does not require the exclusion of overrepresented respondents, while
still ensuring the desired level of balance between diﬀerent sub-samples.
In this section we have elaborated on the problems associated with sampling informal
investors and business angels. The anonymous and invisible nature of the market was

<-----Page 19----->390

S. Avdeitchikova et al.

identiﬁed as a problem already in the early studies. In addition, because of the very small
proportion of the population who make informal investments, researchers have used
diﬀerent techniques to identify them, in many cases leading to convenience sampling of
investors as well as small samples. In this section we have reviewed the advantages and
disadvantages related to the most commonly used sampling techniques: population
studies, focus group surveys, snowball methods, self-selected registers, and sampling based
on the companies in which the investments are made. All sampling techniques have
strengths and weaknesses, as well as generating some form of bias. We have presented and
discussed two examples of sampling techniques – the random and the multi-sample
approach – that have been used in two studies of informal investors and business angels in
Sweden. Based on our review of earlier sampling techniques and experience from the
studies conducted, we can conclude that in order to develop robust knowledge about
business angels and informal investors, we need much higher quality sample frames and
sampling techniques than those used to date. Considerable time and money must be spent
on these issues – researchers within the ﬁeld need to improve their ground work!
Conclusions
Business angel research is characterized by the use of inconsistent deﬁnitions, empirical
studies based on cross-sectional data, as well as small-scale and convenience samples. This
has meant that the bulk of research on this topic has lacked methodological rigour, which
both limits comparability between diﬀerent studies and hinders the development of solid
empirical and theoretical bases in the research. This paper presented an attempt to identify
the most common deﬁnition and sampling problems within the ﬁeld and to point out the
main methodological choices on which researchers need to take a conscious stand. In this
respect we hope that we have contributed to a better understanding of what we mean when
we talk about business angels.
Deﬁnition considerations
The multiple ways of deﬁning and demarcating the object of study in informal venture
capital literature, in combination with the lack of consciousness about the choice of
deﬁnition, has resulted in a great degree of confusion. Nevertheless, this does not imply
that researchers should strive to establish a single deﬁnition of the study object, or even
that it is possible. As outlined at the beginning of this paper, research on business angels
and informal investors has been conducted with many diﬀerent research questions in
mind, and the interest of scholars is continuously broadening. Thus, it is only natural that
diﬀerent deﬁnitions, ranging from the very narrow one of business angels to the broad
view of the market as all non-institutional suppliers of venture capital, are more or less
appropriate, depending on the type of research question.
However, problems are raised by what we refer to as grey areas, or practical issues of
discriminating between diﬀerent deﬁnitions. The main issue of contention in studies that
do consider deﬁnitional issues has been how the investments should be channelled, the
level of investment activity and hands-on contribution required in order to distinguish
between business angels and other informal investors, and the requirements on the link
between the investor and the entrepreneur. Although some general recommendations can
be made for separating the diﬀerent deﬁnitions, many of the reasons these grey areas
emerge are due to the cultural and institutional factors of each individual country – thus,
we need to contextualize our deﬁnitions. In view of the implications that this can have for

<-----Page 20----->Venture Capital

391

the applicability of the results and comparability between diﬀerent studies, researchers
need to report the criteria used to demarcate the chosen deﬁnition, supported by
contextual rationale and, not least, be stringent in the way they use the deﬁnitions and
concepts.
Another complication in this context is that the dynamic nature of the informal
venture capital market is rarely taken into account. Individuals may exhibit diﬀerent
investment behaviours, simultaneously or over time, which makes it problematic to place
them in a speciﬁc category of investors (Riding 2005; Avdeitchikova 2008). For instance,
earlier research has demonstrated that informal investors tend to gain experience and
ﬁnancial sophistication in the course of their investment career (Politis and Landström
2002). Thus, an individual may start his or her investment career by investing small
amounts of money in a friend’s or colleague’s business and, having gained experience, start
to exhibit business angel investment behaviour. In addition, studies that included familyrelated investors in the sample (e.g. Farrell 1998; Riding 2005) have consistently
demonstrated that individuals who make investments in family-owned businesses are often
also involved in other, non-family investments. Thus, investors make many diﬀerent kinds
of investment, sometimes investing large amounts of money and a great deal of
involvement in ﬁrms, whereas at other times they only invest small amounts of money.
This makes it especially problematic to characterize individuals according to any
deﬁnition, including those suggested here, which has led some researchers to start arguing
for a shift in focus from individual investor level to investment level (Riding 2005; Farrell
et al. this issue; Mason and Harrison this issue).
By focusing on the actual investment activity, the researchers can avoid the problem of
deﬁning informal investors according to some general characteristics and investment
behaviour and instead focus on the nature of individual investments. One such attempt
was made by Avdeitchikova (2008) in her study of the Swedish informal venture capital
market. One of the major ﬁndings was that a large number of investors behave diﬀerently
in the various stages of their investment career, at the same time as the context in which the
investment is undertaken also aﬀects investment behaviour. Nevertheless, individuals also
exhibited a certain degree of conservatism in the way they conducted their investments,
which constitutes a subject for further inquiry. Thus this approach allows an individual’s
investment career to be viewed from a life-cycle perspective (Politis and Landström 2002),
at the same time as it provides an opportunity to explore the context-dependency of
informal venture capital investment behaviour, i.e. the investor can act as a business angel
in one deal whereas in others s/he acts more passively.
Sampling considerations
Diﬃculties in identifying business angels and informal investors have meant that
researchers have continuously struggled with issues of biased samples and inability to
establish the representativeness of acquired data. There are several cases in the literature
where scholars have obtained inconsistent and, in some cases even contradictory results,
by relying on diﬀerent sampling methods (e.g. Wetzel 1986; Gaston 1989; Stevenson and
Coveney 1994; Mason and Harrison 1994). What makes it even more problematic is that it
is almost impossible to establish the plausibility of each result, thus it is extremely diﬃcult
to develop policy recommendations based on them. Therefore, researchers have
concentrated on developing a sampling methodology that would allow testing of the
representativeness of the data, as well as replication of the study and the production of
comparable results.

In this article we have argued that in order to gain robust knowledge within the ﬁeld,
we need to increase the quality of the sampling techniques used. This implies a
considerable investment in terms of time and money, but it is necessary in order to gain a
better understanding of the phenomenon. In the article we have suggested two alternative
ways of creating high quality samples of business angels and informal investors, which we
labelled the random sample approach and the multi-sample approach.
Finally, the samples used should allow for longitudinal analysis. This is related to the
point that investment behaviour changes during the career of the investor as well as from
deal to deal, and we recommend a stronger focus on the investment as the unit of analysis
rather than the investor as an individual. The best way to capture these changes is by
following a set of individuals over a period of time. Both the random and multi-sample
approaches make it possible to carry out a longitudinal analysis.
