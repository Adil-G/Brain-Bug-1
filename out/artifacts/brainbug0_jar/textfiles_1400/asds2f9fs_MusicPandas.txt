Music, Pandas, and Muggers: On the Affective Psychology of Value
Christopher K. Hsee and Yuval Rottenstreich
University of Chicago
This research investigated the relationship between the magnitude or scope of a stimulus and its
subjective value by contrasting 2 psychological processes that may be used to construct preferences:
valuation by feeling and valuation by calculation. The results show that when people rely on feeling, they
are sensitive to the presence or absence of a stimulus (i.e., the difference between 0 and some scope) but
are largely insensitive to further variations of scope. In contrast, when people rely on calculation, they
reveal relatively more constant sensitivity to scope. Thus, value is nearly a step function of scope when
feeling predominates and is closer to a linear function when calculation predominates. These findings
may allow for a novel interpretation of why most real-world value functions are concave and how the
processes responsible for nonlinearity of value may also contribute to nonlinear probability weighting.

How long would someone who is willing to work 3 hr for $30
be willing to work for $60? How much would someone who is
willing to donate $10 to save one endangered animal be willing to
donate to save four endangered animals? Such questions concern
the relationship between the quantitative aspect or “scope” of a
stimulus (e.g., the amount of financial reward, the number of
endangered creatures) and a person’s subjective value of that
stimulus.
To elucidate the notion of subjective value, note that to gauge
how much longer someone would work for $60 rather than $30,
one must assess how much satisfaction or value the person accrues
from either amount. If the satisfaction accrued from $60 is not
much larger than that from $30, the individual will not work
appreciably longer for the larger amount. Among other considerations, making a charitable donation presumably gives one moral
satisfaction (e.g., Kahneman & Knetsch, 1992). Thus, to estimate
how much more someone would donate to save four endangered
animals rather than one, one must assess the extent to which an
increase in the number of animals saved increases the amount of
moral satisfaction.
As our disparate examples suggest, the notion of subjective
value is very general and may be applied to just about any
stimulus. The notion of scope is very general as well: Any quantitative aspect of a stimulus may form a scope variable. Perhaps not
surprisingly then, the relationship between scope and value is of
long-standing theoretical interest. For example, both the standard

economic theory of consumption and prospect theory (Kahneman
& Tversky, 1979) involve intricate analyses of this relationship.
In what follows, we examine the relationship between scope and
value by using a process-based account of the determination of
value. Recent literature identifies two distinct modes of thought,
one deliberate and rule-based, the other associative and affectbased (e.g., Chaiken & Trope, 1999; Epstein, 1994; Kahneman &
Frederick, 2002; Sloman, 1996). Building on such dual-process
models, we distinguish between two psychological processes by
which people might assess the value of a particular target: valuation by calculation and valuation by feeling.
We suggest that these two processes yield different relationships
between scope and value, as depicted in Figure 1. Specifically, we
suggest that under valuation by calculation, changes in scope have
relatively constant influence on value throughout the entire range.
The corresponding value function is relatively steep throughout
(the dotted line). However, we suggest that under valuation by
feeling, value is highly sensitive to the presence or absence of a
stimulus (i.e., a change from 0 to some scope) but is largely
insensitive to further variations in scope. The corresponding value
function is relatively flat except for an initial rise (the solid line).
We next provide examples and definitions of valuation by calculation and valuation by feeling.
Consider decisions of how much to pay for a second-hand box
set of either 5 or 10 Madonna compact discs (CDs). Valuation by
calculation might appeal to the typical cost or worth of a single
used CD (e.g., $3) and then account for the number of discs,
perhaps leading to a willingness-to-pay of approximately $15 for
the 5-CD set and $30 for the 10-CD set. In contrast, valuation by
feeling might focus on feelings evoked by Madonna songs and
images. Because such feelings should be independent of the number of discs available, using them as a cue for value might lead to
roughly equal willingness-to-pay for either set.
More generally, we use the term valuation by calculation for
determinations of preference on the basis of some algorithm (e.g.,
involving the typical cost of a disc) that takes into account both the
nature of the stimulus (e.g., the box set consists of Madonna discs)
and its scope (e.g., there are five discs in the collection). We use
the term valuation by feeling for determinations of preference on
the basis of one’s feelings toward the stimulus (e.g., one’s liking of

ostensibly unrelated priming task. The context of the study was similar to
that of the Madonna CD example.
University of Chicago students (N ⫽ 115) were recruited in a public
place on campus, where they individually completed a short questionnaire
packet in exchange for payments varying between $2 and $4. Participants
were told that the questionnaires in the packet were unrelated to one
another. Most were indeed unrelated, but two formed the current study.
One constituted a priming task; the second immediately followed the first
and presented our main dependent measure.
Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions of a 2
(scope) ⫻ 2 (priming) between-subjects design. The priming questionnaire
attempted to encourage either valuation by calculation or valuation by
feeling. In the calculation-priming condition, participants answered five
questions requiring conscious and deliberate calculations. Two of the
questions were as follows:
If an object travels at five feet per minute, then by your calculations
how many feet will it travel in 360 seconds?
If a consumer bought 30 books for $540, then, by your calculations,
on average, how much did the consumer pay for each book?

Madonna). In essence, feelings depend on the nature of a stimulus
but not on its scope, whereas calculations explicitly consider
scope. Feelings are relatively qualitative; calculations are relatively quantitative. Thus, feelings yield marked sensitivity to the
presence or absence of a stimulus (i.e., the change from 0 to some
scope) but yield little sensitivity to subsequent increments of
scope. In contrast, calculations yield relatively constant sensitivity
throughout the entire range. For the sake of brevity, we henceforth
say that feeling yields scope-insensitivity and calculation yields
scope-sensitivity.
We emphasize that at any given scope level, feeling may generate either greater or lesser value than calculation, depending on
the intensity of the relevant affect. For instance, someone who
loves Madonna may establish a higher willingness-to-pay under
feeling than under calculation for either the 5- or 10-disc collection, whereas someone who dislikes Madonna may establish a
lower willingness-to-pay under feeling than calculation for either
collection. A crossover, wherein feeling yields greater value at low
scope but calculation yields greater value at high scope, emerges if
valuation by feeling taps affect of intermediate intensity.
We later detail how our notion of valuation by feeling is closely
connected to the works of Kahneman, Ritov, and Schkade (2000);
Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, and Johnson (2000); and Slovic,
Finucane, Peteres, and MacGregor (2002) and to a recent research
trend that highlights the use of affect as a cue for value (e.g.,
Frederick, 2002). For now, we note only that we build on such
analyses by explicitly juxtaposing feeling with calculation to provide a process-based account of the determination of value.

Study 1: Madonna
Method
In this study, we attempted to manipulate participants’ tendency to
engage in either valuation by calculation or valuation by feeling, using an

In the feeling-priming condition, participants answered five questions that
required them to examine and report their feelings. Two of the questions
were as follows:
When you hear the name “George W. Bush,” what do you feel?
Please use one word to describe your predominant feeling.
When you hear the word “baby,” what do you feel?
Please use one word to describe your predominant feeling.
The main questionnaire asked participants to assume that, for family
reasons, a friend of theirs who was from a foreign country had to unexpectedly leave the United States. They were told that the friend was a
Madonna fan, owned a number of Madonna CDs, and wanted to sell the
CDs to them as a bundle. Participants’ response to the question “What is
the maximum you would be willing to pay for the bundle of CDs?” formed
the study’s dependent measure. Note that participants were not explicitly
instructed to rely on calculations or on feelings when indicating the
maximum they would be willing to pay. The number of CDs in the bundle
formed the scope variable. In one version of the questionnaire, the bundle
contained 5 CDs; in another version, 10 CDs.
We predicted that participants primed to calculate would decide how
much to pay for the bundle of CDs by essentially counting the number of
discs available and multiplying that count by a monetary figure reflecting
the typical cost or worth of a single used disc. We further predicted that
participants primed to feel would be less likely to count and would instead
focus on their feelings for Madonna. Reliance on a calculation involving a
count should yield relative scope-sensitivity, but because one’s feelings for
Madonna should be independent of the number of discs available, reliance
on feelings should yield relative scope-insensitivity.

Results and Discussion
The results are consistent with our predictions. When primed to
calculate, participants were willing to pay significantly more for
the 10-CD set than for the 5-CD set (M ⫽ 28.81, SD ⫽ 25.21 for
the 10-CD set, and M ⫽ 15.10, SD ⫽ 11.43 for the 5-CD set),

The data also yield a crossover effect. At the 5-CD level,
participants were willing to pay more when primed to feel than
when primed to calculate ($22.64 vs. $15.10), t(56) ⫽ 1.91, p ⫽
.06. In contrast, at the 10-CD level, participants were actually
willing to pay less when primed to feel ($19.77 vs. $28.81),
t(53) ⫽ 1.51, ns. As we have mentioned, a crossover suggests that
the feelings engendered by Madonna were on average of moderate
intensity. Had these feelings been more positive, mean
willingness-to-pay may have been greater in the feeling conditions
at both scope levels. Conversely, had these feelings been less
positive, mean willingness-to-pay may have been lower in the
feeling conditions at both scope levels.
We emphasize that the main questionnaire in this study was
identical across the feeling and calculation conditions. An ostensibly unrelated questionnaire was the sole instrument used to prime
one or the other valuation process. Such a priming manipulation is
by its nature quite subtle. Because it does not require participants
to rely on either feelings or calculations, it avoids potential pitfalls
associated with demand characteristics. At the same time, despite
its subtlety, priming presumably influences the actual process used
to assess value. As such, the present priming manipulation provides an operational definition of valuation by calculation and
valuation by feeling.
Manipulations targeted directly at the valuation process itself, as
used in Study 1, have certain experimental advantages. However,
most real-world situations involve indirect manipulation of the
valuation process: Whether people rely on calculation or feeling
typically varies with (a) the target being valued and (b) the manner
in which that target is presented. That is, varying the target being
valued or the manner in which that target is presented (indirectly)
influences which valuation process predominates, because certain
targets and presentations may encourage valuation by calculation,
whereas others may encourage valuation by feeling.
In particular, we suggest that relatively affect-rich targets and
presentations engender more valuation by feeling, leading to
scope-insensitivity, whereas relatively affect-poor targets and presentations engender more valuation by calculation, leading to
scope-sensitivity. We next present three studies examining this
hypothesis. Study 2 examines (a) the valuation of two different
targets, one affect-rich, the other affect-poor, and Studies 3 and 4
examine (b) the valuation of a given target presented in either an
affect-rich or an affect-poor manner.

Study 2: Music Book Versus Cash
Method
University of Chicago undergraduates (N ⫽ 331) were recruited in a
public place on campus, where they individually completed a short packet
containing several unrelated studies in exchange for payments varying
between $2 and $4. They were asked to imagine that they could work
temporarily at the campus bookstore and to indicate how long they would
work for a certain reimbursement, using a scale from 0 to 10 hr.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions of a 2
(scope) ⫻ 2 (target) between-subjects design. The two targets were a music
book and cash. Participants in the music book condition were asked to
imagine that they would be reimbursed with a copy of a book that was
required for a music course they would soon take. They were instructed to

25

imagine that they loved music and that they expected the book to be one of
the most enjoyable works they would ever read. Participants in the cash
condition were simply told that they would be reimbursed in cash (but were
given no further instructions about how to consider this form of
reimbursement).
We suggest that the music book is relatively affect-rich and that the cash
is relatively affect-poor. To confirm this claim, we later asked a separate
group of participants (recruited in a similar place and manner) “Which
form of reimbursement would be emotionally more appealing?” A large
majority, 76%, indicated that the music book was more emotionally appealing (N ⫽ 49, p ⬍ .01 by binomial test).
The financial value of the reimbursement formed the scope variable.
Participants in the book conditions were told that the list price of the book
was either $30 or $60. Participants in the cash conditions were told they
would be paid either $30 or $60.
If the affect-poor cash encourages valuation by calculation, whereas the
affect-rich music book encourages valuation by feeling, then the cash
should yield relative scope-sensitivity, and the music book should yield
relative scope-insensitivity. In the cash conditions, participants may appeal
to a reference wage of $10 per hour. Using this modulus, calculations
suggest working approximately 3 hr for $30 or approximately 6 hr for $60.
Even allowing for adjustments from these anchors, responses in the cash
condition should be scope-sensitive. In contrast, one may feel just as fond
of a $30 book as of a $60 book; indeed, participants in the music book
conditions had essentially been instructed to do so. If participants in the
music book condition decided how long to work by consulting their
feelings for the book, then responses in this condition should show little
scope-sensitivity.

Results and Discussion
As expected, participants in the affect-poor cash conditions were
willing to work much longer for $60 than for $30 (M ⫽ 5.39, SD ⫽
1.93 for $60, and M ⫽ 3.23, SD ⫽ 1.46 for $30), t(162) ⫽ 8.06,

SD ⫽ 2.63 for the $60 book, and M ⫽ 4.40, SD ⫽ 2.03 for the $30
book), t(165) ⫽ 2.54, p ⬍ .05. ANOVA revealed a significant

Furthermore, the data again yielded a crossover. At $30, participants were willing to work more for the affect-rich music book

We recognize that this study is somewhat stylized and that the
cash and the music book differ in many potentially important
ways. Despite these drawbacks, we feel that contrasting the cash
and music book holds an important advantage of ecological validity: There are many real world situations in which the valuation
process that predominates will depend on the nature of the target
being valued. Juxtaposition of the cash and music book is instruc1

tive to the extent that it mimics these types of real-world
circumstances.
Our next studies adopt the general approach of Study 2, yet
circumvent some of its limitations. Study 2 indirectly manipulated
the valuation process, encouraging either calculation or feeling by
changing the target being valued. The following studies also indirectly manipulate the valuation process; however, these studies
hold constant the target being valued and encourage one or the
other valuation process by changing the presentation of the target.

above the second dot or picture, and so forth. This placement was meant to
make salient a “one panda merits $10” modulus.
We predicted that participants encountering the affect-poor dots would
be relatively likely to base their donation on a calculation or, to be specific,
on a count of the number of pandas and an appeal to the suggested
modulus. On the other hand, we predicted that participants encountering
the affect-rich pictures would be relatively unlikely to count and would
instead consider feelings engendered by the pictures. Reliance on a count
and modulus should yield relative scope-sensitivity. In contrast, feelings
concerning one cute picture should essentially match feelings concerning
four cute pictures, yielding scope-insensitivity.

Study 3: Saving Pandas
Method

Results and Discussion

University of Chicago undergraduates (N ⫽ 137) were recruited in a
public place on campus and individually completed a short questionnaire
for $1. They were asked to imagine that a team of Chicago zoology
students had discovered a number of pandas in a remote Asian region; the
team intended to save these endangered animals and was soliciting donations for the rescue effort.
Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions of a 2
(scope) ⫻ 2 (presentation) between-subjects design. The scope variable
concerned the number of pandas discovered. Participants were told that the
team had found either one or four pandas.
Presentation was either affect-poor or affect-rich. Participants were
shown a table indicating the number of pandas found. In the affect-poor
conditions, the table depicted each panda by a large dot. That is, in the
affect-poor conditions the table included either one or four dots. In the
affect-rich conditions, the table depicted each panda with a cute picture,
reproduced in Figure 2. That is, in the affect-rich conditions, the table
contained either one cute picture or four copies of the same cute picture.
Manipulation checks, conducted after completion of the study and using
a new pool of participants recruited in a similar place and manner, confirmed that the pictures evoked considerably greater affective reactions
than the dots. Participants were asked “How much emotion is evoked when
you look at the dot(s) (picture[s])?” On a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (a
little) to 10 (a lot), mean responses were 3.8 for the dots versus 7.0 for the
pictures (N ⫽ 25 in each condition), t(48) ⫽ 4.95, p ⬍ .01. Participants
were also asked, “How strong of an emotional appeal is the team’s request
for donations?” On a 10-point scale ranging from 1 (very weak) to 10 (very
strong), mean responses were 4.5 for the dots versus 5.9 for the pictures
(N ⫽ 25 in each condition), t(48) ⫽ 1.95, p ⫽ .06.
The study’s dependent measure asked participants to indicate “the most
you would be willing to donate” by having them circle either $0, $10, $20,
$30, $40, or $50. The response scale was placed just above the table, so
that the $10 option was above the first dot or picture, the $20 option was

The results are consistent with our analysis. The dots yielded a
fair degree of scope-sensitivity; mean donations were greater given
four pandas rather than one (M ⫽ 22.00, SD ⫽ 16.48 for four
pandas, and M ⫽ 11.67, SD ⫽ 11.47 for one panda), t(58) ⫽ 2.82,
p ⬍ .01. In contrast, the pictures revealed dramatic scope-insensitivity; mean donations were virtually identical across the two
scope levels (M ⫽ 18.95, SD ⫽ 15.21 for four pandas, and M ⫽
19.49, SD ⫽ 14.13 for one panda), t(75) ⬍ 1, ns. The data revealed

Once more, the data revealed a crossover. Given one panda,
participants donated more in the picture than in the dot condition
($19.49 vs. $11.67), t(67) ⫽ 2.47, p ⬍ .05, but given four pandas,
participants donated slightly (but not significantly) less in the
picture condition ($18.95 vs. $22.00), t(66) ⬍ 1, ns. Again, a
crossover suggests that feelings engendered by the picture were of
moderate intensity. Had the picture been even cuter (e.g., a mother
panda caressing her young), affect-rich donations may have been
greater at both scope levels. On the other hand, had the picture
been aversive (e.g., an ugly panda biting a snake), affect-rich
donations may have been smaller at both scope levels.

Study 4: Sentencing a Mugger
In Study 3, the affective intensity of the presentation was varied
by the introduction of either an affect-rich or affect-poor cue
(pictures vs. dots). In Study 4, exactly the same cues were provided
to all participants, and the affective intensity of the presentation
was manipulated using an empathy instruction that required participants to generate affect on their own.

University of Chicago undergraduates (N ⫽ 274) were recruited in a
public place on campus and individually completed a short questionnaire
for $1. They were asked to recommend a prison sentence of up to 10 years
for an individual convicted of mugging a fellow student at night.
Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four conditions of a 2
(scope) ⫻ 2 (empathy) between-subjects design. Scope was manipulated
by varying the number of previous mugging convictions attributed to the
offender—zero or four. Empathy consisted of two conditions: empathy
(affect-rich) and no empathy (affect-poor). In the empathy condition, prior
to recommending a sentence, participants were told to “Put yourself in the
position of the victim(s) and think about how you would feel when being

<-----Page 4----->MUSIC, PANDAS, AND MUGGERS
mugged at night. Please write a sentence below to describe your feelings.”
In the no-empathy condition, these instructions were omitted.
Besides holding external cues constant, two additional aspects of the
present methodology merit mention. First, in our previous studies, the
targets being valued—CD bundles, reimbursement for work performed,
endangered pandas to be saved—were all affectively positive. In the
present study, the target being valued— crimes committed by a mugger—
was affectively negative. We expected that our results in the positive
domain would generalize to the negative domain. Second, unlike Studies 2
and 3, which facilitated calculation by making salient some modulus (i.e.,
$10 for an hour, $10 for one panda), the present study provided no explicit
modulus and thus required that participants establish a calculative rule by
their own initiative (e.g., “Four prior offenses merits many years in
prison”).
People often base punitive decisions largely on feelings, even without
explicit instructions to do so (e.g., Sunstein, Kahneman, & Schkade, 1998).
We predicted that this tendency would be especially pronounced in the
affect-rich conditions. Compared with participants in the no-empathy conditions, participants in the empathy conditions should be even less likely to
count offenses and more likely to base their sentence on the feelings they
were asked to generate. These feelings should be essentially equivalent
given either four or zero prior offenses.

Results and Discussion
The results accord with our analysis. In the no-empathy conditions, recommended sentences were highly sensitive to scope

General Discussion
Across a diverse set of scope variables and dependent measures,
we observed a consistent pattern of results: relative scopeinsensitivity when valuation by feeling is encouraged, and relative
scope-sensitivity when valuation by calculation is encouraged. We
next discuss (a) the relationship between the present research and
the existing literature on scope neglect, (b) other factors that may
influence valuation, (c) the relationship between scopeinsensitivity and probability weighting, and (d) implications of the
present research for interpretations of the concavity revealed by
most real-world value functions.

Relationship With Prior Research on Scope Neglect
Researchers interested in people’s preferences for nonmarket
goods—such as the rescue of endangered species— have conducted studies closely related to ours. In a representative experiment, Desvousges et al. (1993) asked (separate groups of) partic-

27

ipants how much they would donate to save 2,000, 20,000, or
200,000 migrating birds from drowning in oil ponds. The mean
responses, $80, $78, and $88, respectively, showed astounding
neglect of scope (for similar findings see Baron & Greene, 1996;
Boyle, Desvousges, Johnson, Dunford, & Hudson, 1994; Carson &
Mitchell, 1993; Fetherstonhaugh, Slovic, Johnson, & Friedrich,
1997; Frederick & Fischhoff, 1998).
Kahneman et al. (2000) explained these results by arguing that
Desvousges et al.’s (1993) questions evoked “a mental representation of a prototypical incident, perhaps an image of an exhausted
bird, its feathers soaked in black oil, unable to escape” (p. 652) and
that participants decided how much to donate on the basis of their
affective reactions to this image. More generally, Kahneman et al.
(2000) used the term affective valuation to refer to assessments of
preference on the basis of “the sign and intensity of the emotional
response to objects” (p. 643) and stressed that affective valuations
are scope-insensitive because “the attitude to a set of similar
objects is often determined by the affective valuation of a prototypical member of that set” (p. 645).
Our notion of valuation by feeling is taken from the work of
Kahneman et al. (2000). It also follows Slovic et al.’s (2002) and
Finucane et al.’s (2000) investigation of affect as a cue for value
(see also Frederick, 2002; Zajonc, 1980). We build on these
analyses by explicitly juxtaposing valuation by feeling with valuation by calculation. In demonstrating that factors affecting the
relative salience of these two processes moderate the degree of
scope-sensitivity, we offer a process-based account of the determination of value.
In another related study, Dhar and Wertenbroch (2000) found
that “hedonic” goods reveal greater loss aversion than “utilitarian”
goods. This observation may provide a parallel to our findings:
Hedonic goods may be thought of as affect-rich and utilitarian
goods as affect-poor, and affect may influence not only scopesensitivity, but loss aversion as well.

Complexity of Valuation Processes
Although we have offered an account that juxtaposes calculation
and feeling, we emphasize that valuation is a complex process
open to the influence of many variables. For instance, we speculate
that joint valuations of multiple targets will yield greater scopesensitivity than separate valuations of the same targets. To illustrate, consider a hypothetical modification of Desvousges et al.
(1993) study in which each participant makes three responses,
indicating in turn a donation to save 2,000, 20,000, and 200,000
endangered birds. It seems likely that such joint valuations will
yield pronounced scope-sensitivity. Hsee (1996; Hsee et al., 1999;
Hsee & Zhang, in press) provided detailed analysis of the distinction between joint and separate evaluations.
In a slightly different vein, it is clear that valuations are often
influenced by diverse considerations such as “What can I use this
for?” or “What am I supposed to do?” that fall neatly into neither
the category of calculation nor that of feeling. Gilbert, Gill, and
Wilson (1998) provided an especially compelling example that
contrasts preferences constructed by feeling with preferences constructed with an eye toward what one is supposed to do. These
authors had grocery shoppers list the items they intended to purchase. Only some shoppers were allowed to retain their list during
their actual shopping trip. Furthermore, some shoppers were asked

<-----Page 5----->28

HSEE AND ROTTENSTREICH

to eat a quarter pound of muffins before shopping. Among list-less
shoppers, those who were unfed bought more unlisted items than
those who were well-fed. However, among shoppers retaining
their lists, those who were unfed did not buy more unlisted items.
Presumably, list-less shoppers experienced more positive affective
reactions to unlisted items when unfed (“Those cookies look
delicious!”) than when well-fed (“I never want to eat again”).
Shoppers with lists surely had the same affective reactions but
evidently decided whether to purchase an appealing item by checking their list to see if they were supposed to buy it rather than by
following their affective reactions.
The conclusions we have drawn about how feeling and calculation yield different reactions to scope are not meant to deny the
importance of other influences on valuation nor the inherent complexity of valuation. On the contrary, in our opinion that systematic differences arise between valuation by feeling and calculation
even though many factors might dilute such differences, demonstrates the importance of distinguishing between these valuation
processes.

Implications for Probability Weighting
Rottenstreich and Hsee (2001) observed probability by affectrichness interactions that parallel the scope by affect-richness
interactions we report. In one experiment, participants were asked
for their willingness-to-pay for either a 1% or 99% chance of
winning a $500 coupon. The coupon could be used either for
tuition payments (affect-poor) or toward expenses associated with
a vacation to Paris, Venice, and Rome (affect-rich). At 1%, people
were willing to pay more for the vacation coupon, but at 99%,
people were willing to pay more for the tuition coupon. In other
words, people were more sensitive to variation in probability
between 1% and 99% when the prize was affect-poor than when it
was affect-rich. These results parallel the Scope ⫻ AffectRichness interaction we have observed, with probability in the role
of scope.
The distinction between calculation and feeling may explain
probability by affect-richness interactions much as it explains
scope by affect-richness interactions. Rottenstreich and Hsee’s
(2001) results suggest that the value of affect-poor prospects
reveals relatively constant sensitivity to probability throughout the
entire range of probability, from 0 to 1 (see the dotted line in
Figure 3). Relatively constant sensitivity is consistent with the
notion that affect-poor prospects engender valuation by calculation. Furthermore, Rottenstreich and Hsee’s results suggest that the
value of affect-rich prospects is hypersensitive to the presence or
absence of uncertainty (i.e., a change from a probability of 0 or 1
to some intermediate probability) but largely insensitive to further
variations in probability (see the solid line in Figure 3). This
pattern is consistent with the notion that affect-rich prospects
engender valuation by feeling.
Most real-world valuations consist of a mix of calculations and
feelings. The resulting probability weighting function is more
regressive than the nearly linear dotted line in Figure 3 but is less
regressive than the nearly step-function solid line in Figure 3.
Many researchers have observed exactly this pattern of probability
weighting (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992; see also Abdellaoui,
2000; Bleichrodt & Pinto, 2000; Camerer & Ho, 1994; Gonzalez &
Wu, 1999; Kilka & Weber, 2001; Wu & Gonzalez, 1996, 1998).

Figure 3. Probability weighting functions based on calculation (dotted
line) and based on feeling (solid line). The x-axis of the function is stated
probability, and the y-axis is the weight or impact of this probability on
value.

To appreciate why valuation by feeling may yield hypersensitivity near the end-points of the probability scale and insensitivity
at intermediate probabilities, consider a thought experiment by
Elster and Loewenstein (1992). Picture a fatal car crash involving
your closest friend. This harrowing image might make you drive
more carefully. In other words, the possibility of a terrible crash
may lead to an affective reaction to a salient image, and this feeling
(not explicit consideration of the scenario’s probability) may guide
behavior. Such feelings will be hypersensitive to departures from
a probability of 0 or 1, because the difference between no chance
and some chance or between some chance and certainty activates
either an image of the potential outcome or a counterimage accentuating its absence. In contrast, such feelings will be independent
of intermediate probability variations (whether the chances of a
crash are 1 in 1,000 or 100,000), because intermediate variations
will not alter the associated image. (For related hypotheses concerning how affect influences probability weighting, see Wu,
1999, and Brandstätter, Kühberger, & Schneider, 2002.)

Accounting for Concavity
Real-world value functions are typically concave— constant increments of scope yield successively smaller increments of value.
Although our experimental data do not directly address this issue,
we speculate that concavity arises in part because most real-world
valuations mix calculation and feeling. Indeed, appropriate mathematical combinations of the two extreme functional forms previously mentioned (the linear and step functions in Figure 1) yield a
concave function. In such mixes, greater reliance on feeling yields
greater concavity.
Consider, the family of functions V ⫽ A␣S1⫺␣. Here, V denotes
subjective value, A the affective intensity of the target, S its scope,
and ␣ is an affective focus coefficient bound by 0 and 1. When ␣
is small, value depends mostly on scope rather than affect; when ␣
is large the reverse is true. This form is equivalent to the Cobb–

<-----Page 6----->MUSIC, PANDAS, AND MUGGERS

Douglas utility function often invoked in economics; for a given
(A, ␣) pair, it reduces to the power law of psychophysics (Stevens,
1975).
To see how this family of functions captures the data from our
experiments, let us apply it to the results of the pandas study. In
that experiment, S may be either 1 or 4 (the number of pandas), and
A is larger in the picture than dot conditions (denote the particular
values of A by Apicture ⬎ Adot). For simplicity, suppose affect-poor
presentations focus participants entirely on scope, yielding ␣ ⫽ 0,
and affect-rich presentations focus participants entirely on feelings, yielding ␣ ⫽ 1. Then, the subjective value of the pandas will
equal 1 and 4 in the two dot conditions but will be constant, equal
to Apicture, across the two picture conditions. Thus, the model
generates pronounced scope-insensitivity when feeling predominates and generates marked scope-sensitivity when calculation
predominates. If 1 ⬍ Apicture ⬍ 4, it yields the empirically observed crossover.
The illustrations above set ␣ equal to either 0 or 1, making V
either a step-function or a linear function. Intermediate values
of ␣ yield a concave value function. As we mentioned, most
real-world value functions are concave. Previous theoretical
analyses explain concavity by the principle of satiation, according to which the more units of a good an individual consumes
(e.g., reimbursement from work, pandas saved, steaks for dinner, anything else), the less one desires (and thus the less one
values) additional units of this good. By this view, the faster the
rate of satiation, the more concave is the value function. Although satiation is surely an important influence on value, the
present analysis suggests another interpretation of concavity.
The value function may be highly concave when feeling predominates (␣ approaches 1) and less concave when calculation
predominates (␣ approaches 0). In other words, the extent to
which different processes are used to assess value, not just the
nature of consumption and satiation, may be an important
determinant of the shape of the value function.
We close by noting that the model V ⫽ A␣S1⫺␣ highlights two
mechanisms that might contribute to the influence of feelings on
preferences. First, as captured by A, affect may be a source of
value. Second, as captured by ␣, a person may focus on either
affect or scope. Presumably, higher values of A will often coincide
with higher values of ␣, because pronounced affect typically draws
attention to itself (e.g., we have presumed that a cute panda picture
is captivating or that strong empathy for a mugging victim is
engrossing). The notion that affect tends to focus attention on
certain attributes and draws attention away from others is consistent with the findings of Wright and Lynch (1995) and the
accessibility– diagnosticity framework of Feldman and Lynch
(1988). Nevertheless, A and ␣ need not be perfectly correlated and
could in principle operate independently. Indeed, in Gilbert, Gill,
and Wilson’s (1998) example, shoppers who retain their lists
appear not to focus on their strong affective reactions.
Our experiments aimed to provide guidelines for predicting
when people will be either scope-sensitive or scope-insensitive.
Thus, they merely corroborate differences in the assessment of
subjective value under affect-rich and affect-poor presentations.
We hope that future work more carefully investigates the specific
mechanisms contributing to such differences.
