Family Firm Resource
Management:
Commentary and
Extensions
Franz W. Kellermanns

The family firm resource-divestment model by Sharma and Manikutty (2004) is extended
into a longitudinal model of family firm resource management. Resource accumulation is
included as an additional dependent variable, and the influences of family structure, family
involvement, and cultural variables are discussed.

Introduction
Sharma and Manikutty (2004) argue that the time lag between the decision to divest
inferior resources and actual resource divestment is moderated by family structure and
community culture. In their model, the longitudinal process of shedding resources is specific to family firms.
In addition to resource divestment, I included resource accumulation as an additional
dependent variable (Sirmon & Hitt, 2003). Furthermore, I examined resource evaluation
decisions and discussed family involvement, family structure, and collective culture as
potential antecedents of the resource evaluation process that bias family firm resource
accumulation and divestment decisions. Lastly, I argued that power distance moderates
the relationship between family involvement and resource evaluation decisions. In
Figure 1, an overview of a longitudinal model of family firm resource management
outlines the variables suggested by Sharma and Manikutty (2004) as well as my proposed
addition.

Resource Management
Sharma and Manikutty (2004) focus on the evaluation and divestment of resources.
However, organizations can also choose to add resources to eliminate deficiencies in their
resource stock (Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003), which may help them to
achieve competitive parity or a competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool,
1989). In fact, the ability to make sound divestment and accumulation decisions is at the
heart of organizational entrepreneurial behavior (Alvarez & Barney, 2004).

The addition of resources to a resource stock has been underresearched in both management literature (Kellermanns & Floyd, forthcoming; Priem & Butler, 2001) and family
firm literature (Sirmon & Hitt, 2003). However, both the divestment of and investment
in resources need to be investigated simultaneously to understand the resource management process (Alvarez & Barney, 2004; Kellermanns & Floyd, forthcoming; Makadok,
2001). This process assumes that organizational rents are generated by acquiring
resources and losses are avoided by divesting these resources (Makadok, 2001). Evaluating which resources are to be accumulated or divested is based upon the resourcepicking skills of the organizational actors involved (Makadok, 2001); the picking process
itself is based upon expectations, which in turn are subject to biases.
In family firms, the family unit, the business unit, and individual family members
influence the resource pool that is at the disposal of the organization (Habbershon &
Williams, 1999; Habbershon, Williams, & MacMillan, 2003). In fact, a family firm’s
resources and capabilities can be regarded as the outcome of systematic influences of an
enterprising family system (Habbershon et al., 2003, p. 460) that need to be managed
carefully to achieve positive performance outcomes (Habbershon & Williams, 1999). To
understand family-specific biases that affect resource evaluation decisions, I will discuss
the effects of the variables identified by Sharma and Manikutty (2004) as well as family
involvement.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->Antecedents of Resource Evaluation Decisions
Evaluating resources is not easy, since the relationship between resources and a subsequent competitive advantage is causally ambiguous (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990).
Furthermore, resource evaluation decisions are subject to a variety of opinions (King &
Zeithaml, 2001) and are complicated by the psychodynamics specific to family firms
(e.g., ownership dispersion among family members, family employment, succession)
(Chrisman, Chua, & Steier, 2002; Chua, Chrisman, & Sharma, 1999; Gersick, Davis,
Hampton, & Lansberg, 1997). These potential biasing factors can be especially troublesome, since objective information is needed to make sound evaluation decisions
(Kellermanns & Eddleston, 2004; Sirmon & Hitt, 2003). Next, I will discuss how the
variables identified by Sharma and Manikutty (2004) as well as family involvement
influence the resource evaluation process (Chrisman et al., 2002; Chua et al., 1999;
Habbershon & Williams, 1999; Habbershon et al., 2003).

Family Structure and Individualism/Collectivism
Sharma and Manikutty (2004) maintain that family structure and individualism/collectivism moderate the length of time required to make divestment decisions. They further
allude to the potential influence of these variables on resource evaluation decisions. I will
elaborate on these influences in more detail in the next paragraphs.
Members of absolute nuclear families are expected to fend for themselves (Todd,
1985), which makes divestment decisions easier, since the children are not relying on the
family business (Sharma, Chrisman, & Chua, 2003; Sharma & Manikutty, 2004). Thus,
the family firm owner has few incentives to add resources and create a sustainable business across generations, especially if the owner’s income is satisfactory and growth is
not needed for business survival. A similar pattern exists in egalitarian nuclear families,
where the children are expected to live independently. Although incentives to add
resources and grow the business are stronger in these families, they are still relatively
weak, since the children expect to inherit equal parts of the estate (Todd, 1985).
An authoritarian family structure implies that a chosen heir will inherit the family
business (Todd, 1985). Because the current owner and the heir make decisions about the
future of the organization (Sharma & Manikutty, 2004), both parties have a vested interest in the continued transgenerational growth of the organization; thus, adding resources
is more likely. The community family is the most likely to add resources to the organizational resource base. Families with these structural characteristics are very close-knit,
with children expected to work in the family business generation after generation (Tagiuri
& Davis, 1992). Hence, the organization needs to stay viable beyond the current leader’s
tenure. Employing multiple family members is a further indication that resource accumulation is part of a growth strategy.
The tendencies of families to favor the accumulation or divestment of resources are
also influenced by the community culture in which those families reside. In a collectivistic culture, the desire to accumulate resources for the benefit of the family and the
community is more intense. Individualistic cultures might favor divesting resources over
adding them, since the current owners are more likely to look to their own well-being
rather than that of the community or of future family generations. Having discussed the
influence of the variables identified by Sharma and Manikutty (2004) on decisions to
accumulate or divest resources, I will now discuss family involvement as an additional
antecedent of resource evaluation decisions.

<-----Page 3----->Family Involvement
Proposed by Chua et al. (1999) and later operationalized in an empirical study by
Chrisman and colleagues (2002), distinctions between family and nonfamily firms are
made on the basis of family ownership, family management, and transgenerational sustainability. For the purpose of this commentary, these three factors are considered as part
of the latent construct, family involvement. In the next paragraphs, I will discuss these
three components in more detail, since researchers note that the resources and capabilities an organization possesses are a result of family influences (e.g., Habbershon &
Williams, 1999).
Family and business decisions in family firms need to be considered simultaneously
(Tagiuri & Davis, 1992) because family influences bias the process of evaluating
resources. Family firms need to generate new strategies whenever a new generation joins
the business (Post, 1993). Not surprisingly, family ownership profoundly impacts how
resources are valued (Habbershon et al., 2003). In fact, depending on how family ownership is dispersed, some individuals or parts of the family might want to advance their
self-interests at the expense of other family members or of the business in general (Cyert
& March, 1963; Gersick et al., 1997; Tagiuri & Davis, 1992).
Gersick and colleagues (1997) describe three broad phases of family firm ownership
dispersion. In the controlling owner phase, one person, most likely the founder, holds the
most equity. This person will make resource evaluation decisions and his/her resourcepicking skills will determine the ability of the organization to generate rents (Makadok,
2001). In sibling partnerships, ownership is shared by the next generation; however, all
family members may not hold equal shares. Lastly, in the cousin consortium phase, ownership is widely dispersed throughout the family, including third or later generations, and
resembles nonfamily businesses. As the number of generations increases, the distribution
of power shifts and different strategies emerge (Gallo & Sveen, 1991; Kets de Vries,
1993). The further family firms move away from the first generation and the more ownership gets dispersed, the more such firms resemble nonfamily businesses (Gersick et al.,
1997). Accordingly, one can assume that the influences and personal preferences of individual family members are mitigated.
The second component of family involvement is characterized by the extent of
family management of the firm. The ability to pick resources that generate superior rents
or the ability to divest resources deemed detrimental to performance is invaluable to the
organization (Makadok, 2001). The firm’s founders, who have often shown their superior resource evaluation skills, may continue to influence firm development if they
maintain centrality within the top management team, even if that team consists mostly
of nonfamily members (Kelly, Athanassiou, & Crittenden, 2000). Entrepreneurial owners
might also be inclined to add resources to the business since they regret missed opportunities rather than regretting any action they took, even if these actions did not produce
the desired results (Baron, 1998). Because they generally influence decisions more than
their number of shares justifies (Schulze, Lubatkin, & Dino, 2003), family firm chief
executive officers have an incentive to influence the resource evaluation process according to their families’ preferences and needs. Furthermore, controlling owners’ decisions
are often characterized by a strong desire for leadership and control (Harvey & Evans,
1994). Thus, resource evaluation decisions and subsequent resource accumulation and
divestment are strongly influenced by the controlling owners’ preferences (beyond
financial benefits), which dictates the developmental paths of the organization (Schulze
et al., 2003).
Passing control to later generations, however, may weaken the entrepreneurial spirit
and increase the willingness to divest resources. Indeed, if control over the family busi316

<-----Page 4----->ness is easily obtained, potential endowment effects are mitigated and the willingness to
undertake riskier behavior increases (Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2000). Individual biases,
however, can be reduced if family members constructively and openly discuss resource
management decisions (Kellermanns & Eddleston, 2004) or professionalize the business
by employing outside directors (Chua et al., 1999). Since outside shareholders may favor
consumption rather than growth, family ownership dispersion, in addition to family management, needs to be taken into account to predict likely resource evaluation decisions
(Schulze et al., 2003).
The third component characterizing family involvement is the wish to transfer ownership from one generation to the next (Sharma & Chrisman, 1999). This desire to create
transgenerational wealth makes these firms highly entrepreneurial (Habbershon et al.,
2003). Indeed, this desire will lead to adding resources if they are perceived to positively
affect transgenerational values and to divesting resources if they are believed to negatively impact transgenerational sustainability (Habbershon et al., 2003). In the case of
divestment, weighing an individual’s decisions against the greater good of the whole
family will also help to identify mediocre resources that can be shed, thus helping to
improve resource stocks.

Power Distance
Power distance refers to levels of inequality in both society and business (Hofstede,
2001). In an organization, it is the formalized superior–subordinate relationship. Power
distance influences a business superior’s or community leader’s preferred leadership style
(Hofstede, 2001). Communities scoring low on the power-distance dimension tend to be
more egalitarian in nature (Veiga, Floyd, & Dechant, 2001); in organizations, this facilitates individual initiative and reduces constraints between lower- and higher-ranking
members (Veiga et al., 2001). On the other hand, in communities scoring high on the
power-distance dimension, individuals tend to accept the opinions of their leaders or superiors without question (Veiga et al., 2001).
In family firms with high power-distance cultures, the desires and preferences of the
current leaders might supersede the interests of the family as a whole. Although employing outside management makes it more likely that resources are evaluated without bias,
a high power-distance culture means that decisions are not readily challenged. Indeed, a
lack of discussion will mean poor decision quality regarding the firm’s developmental
paths (Kellermanns & Eddleston, 2004). This can be especially critical in already dysfunctional types of ownership dispersion in family firms, like sibling partnerships
(Gersick et al., 1997), and can potentially endanger the transgenerational sustainability
of the business. Accordingly, family firms have to be extremely alert and engage in open
discussion and information exchange to counteract the negative influences of a high
power-distance culture.

Summary and Conclusion
In this commentary, I have extended Sharma and Manikutty’s (2004) model by
designing a longitudinal model of family firm resource management. I have argued that
resource evaluation decisions in family firms are subject to unique psychodynamics influences nonfamily firms do not experience. Family structure and the latent construct of
family involvement, comprised of family ownership, family management, and transgenMay, 2005

evaluation process. These biases then influence the way resources are accumulated or
divested in family firms. In addition to the aforementioned family specific influences, the
importance of collectivism/individualism and power distance as cultural variables was
stressed. In the future, researchers will need to test the proposed relationships empirically
and expand the model by investigating additional cultural variables and influences unique
to the psychodynamics of family firms.
