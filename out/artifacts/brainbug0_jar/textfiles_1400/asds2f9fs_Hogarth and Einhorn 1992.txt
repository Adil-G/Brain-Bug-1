Order Effects in Belief Updating:
The Belief-Adjustment
Model
ROBIN M. HOGARTH AND HILLEL J. EINHORN

c$ Chicago

Much literature attests to the existence of order effects in the updating of
beliefs. However, under what conditions do primacy, recency, or no order effects
occur? This paper presents a theory of belief updating that explicitly accounts for
order-effect phenomena as arising from the interaction of information-processing
strategies and task characteristics. Key task variables identified are complexity of
the stimuli, length of the series of evidence items, and response mode (Step-byStep or End-of-Sequence). A general anchoring-and-adjustment model of belief
updating is proposed. This has two forms depending on whether information is
processed in a Step-by-Step or End-of-Sequence manner. In addition, the model
specifies that evidence can be encoded in two ways, either as a deviation relative
to the size of the preceding anchor or as positive or negative vis-a-vis the hypothesis under consideration. Whereas the former (labeled estimation mode) results in
data consistent with averaging models of judgment, the latter (labeled evaluation
mode) implies adding models. Conditions are specified under which (a) evidence
is encoded in estimation or evaluation modes and (b) use is made of the Step-byStep or End-of-Sequence processing strategies. The theory is shown both to account for much existing data and to make novel predictions for combinations of
task characteristics where current data are sparse. Some of these predictions are
examined and validated in a series of five experiments. Finally, both the theory
and the experimental results are discussed with respect to the structure of models
of updating processes, limitations and extensions of the present work, and
the importance of developing a procedural theory of judgment.

How do people update beliefs across time? Imagine, for example, a
physician who is uncertain whether a patient is suffering from a particular
disease and orders several tests. Knowledge of the test results can change
the physician’s level of uncertainty as well as the therapeutic alternatives

considered. Alternatively, imagine that a new acquaintance has made a
favorable impression on you. Subsequent interactions, however, may
lead you to revise this opinion.
A critical feature of belief updating is its sequential nature. As stated by
Anderson (1981),
In everyday life, information integration is a sequential process. Information is
received a piece at a time and integrated into a continuously evolving impression.
Each such impression, be it of a theoretical issue, another person, or a social
organization, grows and changes over the course of time. At any point in time,
therefore, the current impression looks both forward and back. (p. 144)

This paper presents a descriptive theory of belief updating that can be
applied to many substantive domains. The focus is on order effects. In the
paradigmatic situation considered here, a person responds to the presentation of several pieces of evidence by expressing an opinion about a
specific proposition or hypothesis. However, were the person to process
the same information in a different order, would this affect the final judgment? More specifically, under what conditions does information processed early in the sequence have greater influence, i.e., produce a primacy effect? Under what conditions is later information more important,
i.e., a recency effect? Under what conditions is order irrelevant?
The paper is organized as follows. We first briefly summarize experimental findings on order effects and discuss different hypotheses that
have been advanced to explain their existence. In particular, we show
how order effects are sensitive to both procedural and contextual variables. Second, we present our theory of updating which is based on a
general anchoring-and-adjustment model. This model, however, can take
several forms depending on subprocesses that govern (a) whether evidence is encoded as a deviation relative to the preceding anchor or as
positive or negative vis-a-vis the hypothesis under consideration, (b)
whether beliefs are revised in response to each piece of evidence or only
after all the evidence has been processed, and (c) the adjustment process.
We further specify the conditions under which these subprocesses are
used. Although our model presumes a simple information-processing
strategy, its interaction with different task variables yields a complex
pattern of predictions concerning order effects. These predictions are
validated in two ways: first, by reference to the existing experimental
literature and, second, by testing the model’s predictions for cases where
experimental evidence is sparse. We conclude by discussing the implications of our theory and results for understanding the nature of belief
updating and order effects. At a more general level, our analysis of ordereffect phenomena can be seen as an illustration of how the observed
complexity of behavior can arise through the interaction of simple psy-

chological processes with the demands of an infinitely varied environment
(Brunswik, 1952; Simon & Newell, 1971; Hogarth, 1986).
A BRIEF REVIEW OF ORDER EFFECTS IN BELIEF UPDATING

Belief updating is a ubiquitous human activity. It is an essential component in such diverse areas as probabilistic inference (Peterson &
Beach, 1967; Edwards, 1968; Slavic & Lichtenstein, 1971; Hogarth, 1975;
&hum, 1980; Fischhoff & Beyth-Marom, 1983), decision theory (Raiffa &
Schlaifer, 1961; Winkler, 1972), economics (Camerer, 1987), social cognition (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975; Nisbett & Ross, 1980; Anderson, 1981;
Hastie, 1983),jury decision making (Schum & Martin, 1982; Davis, 1984;
Pennington & Hastie, 1986), communication and persuasion (Hovland,
Janis, & Kelley, 1953), attitude change (Triandis, 1971; Cooper & Croyle,
1984; Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), causal inference (Jones, 1979; Einhorn &
Hogarth, 1986; Carlson & Dulany, 1988), and psychophysics (Green &
Swets, 1966).
Although the study of order effects has played an important role in this
literature, there is disagreement concerning what kinds of order effects
are most prevalent. For example, in an influential book on social judgment, Nisbett and Ross (1980) stated, “Although order of presentation of
information sometimes has no effect on final judgment, and recency effects sometimes are found, these are the exception; several decades of
psychological research have shown that primacy effects are overwhelmingly more probable” (p. 172). This conclusion, however, is contradicted
by Davis (1984) in a review of studies of jury decision making that indicates greater prevalence of recency effects as well as work by Anderson
and his colleagues whose studies have demonstrated both primacy and
recency (see Anderson, 1981).
In the present work, we consider order effects of the following type:
There are two pieces of evidence, A and B. Some subjects express an
opinion after seeing the information in the order A-B; others receive the
information in the order B-A. An order effect occurs when opinions after
A-B differ from those after B-A. (On occasion, within-subject analysis is
also possible; see, e.g., Shanteau, 1970.)
This definition of order effects distinguishes our topic from others in
which the terms primacy and recency have been used. For example,
Pennington and Hastie (1986) have demonstrated the importance of the
first information jurors receive when constructing a mental representation
of a purported crime-a “primacy” effect. In other situations, belief revision is compared with a normative standard such as Bayes’ theorem
(see, e.g., Peterson & DuCharme, 1967). Third, results obtained in the
belief perseverance paradigm (Ross & Lepper, 1980) have been cited as

<-----Page 3----->4

AND

EINHORN

favoring primacy (Nisbett & Ross, 1980, Chap. 8). However, the effects
reported in these studies do not qualify as order effects by our definition
because the same information is not presented to different groups of
subjects in different orders.
The order-effect studies we consider within the paradigm defined above
involve a wide range of tasks including impression formation, probability
estimation, assessment of guilt or innocence in mock trials, attributions of
performance, estimates of contingencies, and judgments of weights.
Task Differences

Studies of order-effect phenomena can be classified on many dimensions, varying, for instance, from the semantic content of stimuli (e.g.,
affective vs evaluative judgments), to specific differences in procedures.
The task variables we consider are the complexity of the individual items
of evidence to be processed, the length of the series of items, and response mode. We first elaborate on each of these variables.
Complexity. It is well known that information-processing strategies reflect the complexity of task requirements. In studies of choice, for example, as complexity increases people cannot use the more comprehensive
strategies that they may apply to simpler choice problems and, instead,
resort to strategies that ease cognitive strain (see, e.g., Payne, Bettman,
& Johnson, 1990). It is reasonable to postulate that differential task complexity will affect strategies people use for processing information in belief-updating tasks. In this paper we define complexity operationally with
respect to characteristics of the individual pieces of evidence that are to
be integrated. Specifically, complexity is assumed to be an increasing
function of both the amount of information that needs to be processed for
each piece of evidence and lack of familiarity with the task. We justify the
former by appealing to the well-known limitations on human informationprocessing abilities and the latter by the fact that an important component
of expertise in a specific domain involves strategies for coping more effectively with greater amounts of information (Newell & Simon, 1972).
Length ofseries. Apart from the amount of information to be processed
for each piece of evidence, the number of pieces to be evaluated can vary.
As the number of pieces increases, we expect two kinds of effect. First,
subjects can tire if asked to process many pieces of information. Second,
as information accumulates, beliefs are expected to become less sensitive
to the impact of new information because this represents an increasingly
small proportion of the evidence already processed.
Response mode. Many studies have shown that judgments are sensitive
to the manner in which they are elicited (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981; Hogarth, 1982; Goldstein & Einhorn, 1987). Our third task variable concerns
two response modes that have been commonly employed in the literature.

These are the Step-by-Step procedure in which subjects are asked to
express their beliefs after integrating each piece of evidence in a given
sequence, and the End-of-Sequence procedure where subjects only report
their opinions once all the information has been presented. These procedures will be henceforth abbreviated as SbS and EoS, respectively.
Table 1 provides a summary of our classification of the outcomes of the
studies we examined using the three task variables discussed above and
indicates the frequency with which different types of order effects have
been observed for different combinations of the task variables.’ The details underlying Table 1 are to be found in Appendix A. However, before
commenting on Table 1, we briefly discuss the operational criteria used
for classifying the studies.
For complexity, we adopted two classes: “Simple” and “Complex.”
Many studies could be unequivocally allocated to the Simple category
because the information subjects were required to process involved only
a single item for each piece of evidence (e.g., trait adjective or number) in
tasks with which one could reasonably assume familiarity, e.g., forming
impressions of people or estimating the average of several numbers. Evidence items were judged to be Complex if they involved a large amount
of information (e.g., 600-word messages, Crano, 1977) or unfamiliar stimr In searching the literature, we followed up on references contained in the reviews by
Anderson (1981), Nisbett & Ross (1980). and Slavic & Lichtenstein (1971), as well as
consulting Psychological Abstracts for studies of order effects in experiments on judgment.
In addition, several colleagues brought particular studies to our attention. The fact that
order effects are not the primary focus of investigation in many experiments means that it
is difficult to identify all studies. We therefore do not claim that the basis for our review is
comprehensive. On the other hand, we do believe it is representative of the universe of
relevant studies.

uli (e.g., estimating averages of sets of noises, Parducci, Thaler, & Anderson, 1968, or weights on a pulley, Anderson & Jacobson, 1968).*
Categorizing studies by whether the series of items of evidence to be
integrated was “Short” or “Long” was made easy by the fact that studies
fell conveniently into two groups, the Short with between 2 and 12 items,
and the Long with 17 or more. Finally, classification by response mode,
i.e., SbS or EoS, was straightforward.
Table 1 is organized in two sections; one dealing with tasks involving
Short series of evidence items, the other with Long series. Each entry in
the table refers to one published study even though these studies might
contain more than one experiment. The exception to this rule is provided
by cases where studies examined the effects of different combinations of
the three task characteristics we had identified as relevant. The outcomes
of the different task combinations within such studies are each represented as data points in Table 1. There are thus 76 data points for the 60
studies detailed in Appendix A.
A simple examination or “head count” of the outcomes of these studies
reveals sharp differences that depend on the classifications adopted.
Note, first, that the total column on the right-hand side of Table 1 documents the presence of primacy and recency effects for both Short and
Long series. The majority of studies (43 of the 76 data points) have examined Simple evidence items for Short series. These have typically involved between, say, three and six evidence items such as trait adjectives
to be used for making social judgments of “likableness” (e.g., Anderson
& Barrios, 1961) or simple (e.g., two-digit) numbers to estimate an average (e.g., Hendrick & Constantini, 1970b). These tasks reveal a clear
pattern: primacy in 19 of 27 EoS studies and recency in 16 of 16 SbS
studies. Moreover, it is significant that the EoS studies resulting in recency involved experimental manipulations that probably affected the
judgment process. In Anderson (1968) and Hendrick and Constantini
(1970a), for example, subjects were required to pronounce each piece of
information (adjectives in impression formation tasks); in Luchins (1957b)
recency occurred when another task was interpolated between two blocks
of pieces of evidence; and whereas 12 independent trait adjectives re* DifIiculties were sometimes experienced in judging whether evidence items were simple
or complex. For example, evidence items in Dreben, Fiske, & Hastie (1979) involved two
sentences totaling about 23 words. We chose to classify this as simple because subjects were
only given 10 s to read the words and provide ratings (and presumably were able to do so).
In Luchins (1957a, 1957b), subjects were presented with short paragraphs describing individuals. We chose to classify these studies as simple because the paragraphs contained a
number of different traits (or evidence items) that were embedded in the text. As can be seen
from Table 1, the main conclusions reached by our analysis would not be substantially
affected if a few such studies were reclassified.

sulted in the modal finding of primacy in Strange, Schwei, and Geiselman
(1978), recency occurred when the same 12 adjectives were characterized
as 4 pieces of evidence each consisting of 3 trait adjectives. There are
fewer data concerning Short, Complex tasks. However, the effect of response mode does not seem to be the same as for Short, Simple tasks.
Almost all (9 of 11) have demonstrated recency independent of response
mode. Among tasks involving Long series, 14 of 16 studies in the Simple
category resulted in primacy, a finding that appears to be independent of
response mode. On the other hand, data for studies classified as Complex
are inconclusive.
To summarize, our task analysis of order effects leads to the following
conclusions: (1) response mode makes a difference in the case of Short,
Simple tasks. EoS induces primacy, SbS induces recency; (2) primacy
seems to obtain when tasks are Simple but Long (this is also independent
of response mode); and (3) recency is associated with more complex tasks
(independent of response mode).
It is important to note that this analysis of the literature does not reflect
two task variables that are important to the predictions of our model
presented below. These are, first, how task demands affect whether evidence is encoded relative to constant or variable reference points (the
preceding anchor) and, second, whether the pieces of evidence to be
aggregated are consistent or inconsistent. Few, if any, studies have explicitly considered how evidence is encoded (but see Lopes, 1985,1987a),
and almost all studies reviewed involved inconsistent information (however, see Anderson, 1968; Chalmers, 1971).
Theories. In accounting for the results discussed above, most theoretical attention has been given to tasks that we have described as Short and
Simple. In his 1946 study of impression formation, Asch suggested that
the first piece of information encountered when forming an impression of
another person set up a direction that, in some cases, might change the
interpretation of subsequent information. Thus, someone described as
“intelligent-tall-mean”
would be judged more favorably than someone
described as “mean-tall-intelligent.”
That is, “intelligent” is taken as
a positive attribute in the first instance but less so when following
“mean.” An alternative explanation of the same phenomenon follows
from the notion that when someone describes another person, there is a
natural presumption that order reflects the importance of the information
provided.
Working within the framework of information integration theory, these
views were challenged by Anderson (1981) who showed that neither
“change of meaning” (as proposed by Asch), nor the “natural presumption hypothesis,” nor “inconsistency discounting” (whereby evidence
that is inconsistent with what preceded it is deemphasized) is necessary to

<-----Page 7----->8

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

induce primacy effects when subjects are required to respond to an EoS
response mode. Instead, Anderson claimed that primacy can be explained
by a process of “attention decrement” whereby people pay less attention
to successive items of evidence. This hypothesis is supported by the
finding that primacy is replaced by recency in the presence of an SbS
response mode (or, as noted above, when the judgment process is affected by demands such as requiring subjects to pronounce each trait
aloud). To describe the belief-updating process, Anderson used a serial
integration model which represents updating judgments in the form of
weighted averages of the scale values of the evidence items where the
inferred weights reflect the effects of serial position (see Anderson, 1981).
The attention-decrement explanation, however, raises two important
issues. First, what is the domain to which the hypothesis applies? (See
also Jones & Goethals, 1972.) For example, in a task involving the estimation of the average lengths of lines, Weiss and Anderson (1969) reported recency effects with both EoS and SbS response modes. In addition, recency was found in two separate experiments using the same
complex evidence items (paragraphs describing U.S. presidents) but different response modes, SbS in Anderson and Farkas (1973) and EoS in
Anderson (1973a). And second, whereas attention decrement provides an
explanation for primacy, what causes recency?
THE BELIEF-ADJUSTMENT

MODEL

Our theory assumes that people handle belief-updating tasks by a general, sequential anchoring-and-adjustment process in which current opinion, or the anchor, is adjusted by the impact of succeeding pieces of
evidence.
In algebraic terms, the model can be written

S, = Sk- 1 + w&W - RI,
where
Sk = degree of belief in some hypothesis, impression or attitude after
evaluating k pieces of evidence (0 s Sk s 1).
Sk-i = anchor or prior opinion. The initial strength of belief is denoted S,.
S(Q) = subjective evaluation of the kth piece of evidence. (Different
people may accord the same evidence, xk, different evaluations. Bounds
on s(xk) are specitied below.)
R = the reference point or background against which the impact of the
kth piece of evidence is evaluated.
wk = the adjustment weight for the kth piece of evidence (0 s wk 6 1).
Within this general model there are three important subprocesses which
concern (a) how evidence is encoded-relative to constant or variable

<-----Page 8----->ORDER

EFFECTS

IN

9

reference points, (b) how evidence is processed-whether beliefs are revised in response to each piece of evidence or only after all the evidence
has been processed, and (c) how the adjustment is accomplished. In this
section, we specify both these subprocesses and our hypotheses concerning the conditions under which they are used. In the following section, we
present the implications of the model for order-effect phenomena.
Encoding
In recent years there has been growing awareness of the effects of
encoding on outcomes of judgment and choice (Kahneman & Tversky,
1979; Lopes, 1987b). This is also important in belief updating where we
hypothesize that, prior to actual updating, evidence is evaluated relative
to a reference point, R. We further argue that R will be equal either to the
prior anchor, Sk- i, or a constant. In other words, evidence is encoded
either relative to the level of current belief or in an absolute manner. This
therefore raises the need to specify both the implications of these alternative reference points or backgrounds and when they are adopted.
We distinguish between evaluation and estimation tasks. In evaluation
tasks, people encode evidence as positive or negative relative to the hypothesis under consideration. Imagine, for example, assessing the validity
of a theory or causal hypothesis in terms of whether it is true where,
conceptually, your current belief can be expressed by some value on the
continuum between “false” (= 0) and “true” (= 1). Irrespective of the
level of current belief, supporting evidence increases belief in the theory
whereas disconfirming evidence decreases it. In evaluation tasks, evidence is seen as bipolar (cf. Lopes, 1982) relative to the hypothesis (confirming versus disconfirming) such that - 1 G s(x,J G + 1 and R = 0 (cf.
Einhorn & Hogarth, 1986; Carlson & Dulany, 1988). In this case Eq. (1)
takes the form

s, = Sk-1 + w&J.

(2)

In contrast, estimation tasks involve assessing some kind of “moving
average” (e.g., impression of “likableness”) that reflects the position of
each new piece of evidence relative to current opinion. Imagine, for example, assessing how much you like another person. Conceptually, current opinion can be thought as being expressed on a scale from “dislike”
( = 0) to “like a lot” (= 1). New evidence is seen as another measure of the
likableness of the person. It will therefore increase current opinion if
greater than the latter, but decrease it if smaller. In other words, in estimation tasks people are sensitive to the difference between the location of
the current anchor (i.e., S,- i) and the level of opinion suggested by the
evidence to be integrated. As an estimate or measure of opinion, evidence

<-----Page 9----->10

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

is seen as unipolar (cf. Lopes, 1982) such that 0 6 S(Q) G I and R = Sk- I.
In this case Eq. (1) can be written

Sk = Sk-, + wJ&J - Sk-J,

(3)

which, after rearranging terms, leads to the averaging form
S/( = (1 - W&s& , + w&J.

(4)

It is important to note that whereas both Eqs. 2 and 3 represent anchoring-and-adjustment strategies, the data produced by the two subprocesses will have different patterns. As indicated by Eq. (4), estimation
tasks will result in data that tit averaging models; data from evaluation
tasks, however, will tit adding models.
To illustrate further qualitative differences between the evaluation and
the estimation modes, consider a task in which subjects are required to
update opinions on the basis of two pieces of evidence in a step-by-step
manner. Assume further that both pieces of evidence are “positive” but
that one is strong and the other weak. To be specific, let the evidence
items have values of + .7 and + .3, respectively, if assessedon the bipolar
evaluation scale, and values, say, of .9 and .6 if assessed on the unipolar
estimation scale; in addition, assume that current opinion is S. Now
consider the implications of processing the information in both the weakstrong and the strong-weak orders.
In evaluation mode, the responses to both pieces of evidence will involve upward revisions of belief whether the information is considered in
the weak-strong or strong-weak orders. This is because the evidence has
been encoded as positive. In the estimation mode, responses to both
pieces of evidence will also involve upward revisions in the weak-strong
order, i.e., because .6 > S, and .9 > “average” of .6 and S. However,
this will not be the case in the strong-weak order. Here, the response to
the strong piece of evidence will be an upward adjustment (.9 > S), but
the effect of the weak evidence will be a downward adjustment, i.e.,
because .6 < “average” of .9 and .5. In other words, whereas the qualitative patterns of responses to data in the weak-strong order are similar
for the evaluation and estimation modes, they differ in the strong-weak
order.
This distinction between estimation and evaluation modes was nicely
illustrated by Lopes (1985, 1987a) in studies investigating why people
sometimes revise probabilistic beliefs in a direction opposite to that prescribed by Bayes’ theorem. In an order-effect paradigm similar to the
hypothetical situation described above, Lopes’ subjects made downward
revisions of belief in response to weak evidence received in the strongweak order as opposed to the upward revisions prescribed by Bayes’
theorem, which, it should be recalled, has an adding formulation. (See

11

also Shanteau, 1970, 1972.) Lopes further showed that subjects could be
instructed to adopt a judgmental strategy that mitigated against errors
vis-a-vis the Bayesian model. From our viewpoint, it is significant that
this involved teaching subjects to start by labeling or evaluating the evidence in terms of which of two hypotheses it favored prior to adjusting
belief in the direction of the label. In other words, subjects were taught to
use the evaluation as opposed to estimation mode.
Both Lopes’ studies and the extensive evidence of averaging processes
in judgment (see, e.g., Anderson, 1981) suggest that estimation may be
more frequently used than evaluation. In addition, many task instructions
in the literature have implicitly or explicitly required subjects to use estimation by requiring the assessment of “averages.” When, however, do
people use evaluation as opposed to estimation in the absence of explicit
instructions? We believe two considerations are relevant.
First, evaluation and estimation differ in the kinds of implicit scales
involved in the judgment process. The outcomes of evaluation tasks involve judgments on dichotomous scales of the “true-false” variety as
opposed to assessments of “how much” that are typical of estimation
tasks. This distinction is further emphasized by the scales used for assessing evidence in the two kinds of tasks. In evaluation, evidence is
conceptually measured on a bipolar scale (- 1 d s(x,J c + 1) but then
transformed onto a unipolar scale (0 d S, < 1). Estimation, on the other
hand, involves the transformation of evidence from one unipolar scale (0
d s(x& G 1) onto another (0 4 S, d 1).
Second are considerations of cognitive economy and the extent to
which the form of the evidence is more compatible with estimation or
evaluation (cf. Tversky, Sattath, & Slavic, 1988). Lopes, for example, has
speculated that subjects tend to use evaluation-mode strategies when
“stimuli are explicitly ‘marked’ for one hypothesis or another” (Lopes,
1985, p. 512) thereby facilitating a directional (positive or negative) interpretation of the evidence irrespective of current opinion. Similar effects
can be expected when evidence is presented in a form that requires explicit interpretation as to whether it is for or against the hypothesis. For
example, imagine having to evaluate testimony in a court case that requires a verdict of guilt or innocence. Here the hypothesis is bipolar in
nature and evidence must be explicitly interpreted as to whether it incriminates or exonerates the accused. In contrast, consider a situation
where, starting with a given level of belief in, say, guilt, one is told that
the evidence of three of four witnesses also favors a guilty verdict. In this
case, the form of the information requires little interpretation and is implicitly scaled in a unipolar manner compatible with estimation; i.e., how
large is 3/4relative to one’s current position?
In summary, we hypothesize that the use of evaluation as opposed to

<-----Page 11----->12

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

estimation will primarily depend on both the nature of the opinion to be
expressed (dichotomous belief versus estimates on a continuous scale)
and the extent to which the evidence is more compatible with estimation
(on a unipolar scale) or evaluation (on a bipolar scale). In Experiment 5
below we test the implications of the hypothesized differences between
evaluation and estimation.
Processing

So far, we have discussed the model as though s(x,J represented a single
piece of evidence. However, by also allowing [S(Q) - R] to represent the
net impact of several pieces of information, we can use the model to
illuminate two important variants of Eq. (1). These are the Step-by-Step
(SbS) and End-of-Sequence (EoS) processes where these terms have
meanings similar to the two response mode conditions discussed above.
Specifically, when using an SbS process, a person is assumed to adjust his
or her opinion incrementally by each piece of evidence processed. With
an EoS process, on the other hand, the initial anchor is adjusted by the
aggregate impact of the succeeding set of evidence. To illustrate this
distinction, imagine forming an impression of “likableness” based on a
series of trait adjectives such as “intelligent-tall-mean.”
In using an
SbS process, a person is assumed to anchor on “intelligent” and then to
update this impression incrementally, first by “tall,” then by “mean.”
Using an EoS process, only one adjustment is made. The impression is
anchored on the first or first few pieces of evidence and then adjusted by
the net effect of the others. If, for example, “intelligent” determines the
anchor, the adjustment results from the impact of the net aggregate impression of the words “tall” and “mean.”
Mathematically, the EoS anchoring-and-adjustment strategy can be
represented by
S, = S, + w,Js(.q, . . . , x/J - RI,

(5)

where s(x~, . . . , XJ is some function, possibly weighted average, of the
individual subjective evaluations (or scale values) of the items of evidence
that follow the anchor.
It would be convenient to assume that people always use an SbS process when faced with an SbS response mode and an EoS process when
faced with an EoS response mode. However, whereas we are confident in
assuming the former, the latter is more complicated. Consider Fig. 1
which shows the four cells that arise from crossing the two forms of
process with the two forms of response mode. Note, first, that when a
task demands an SbS response mode, one cannot use an EoS process. In
other words, an SbS response mode necessarily invokes an SbS process.

SbS and EoS processes and response modes.

Second, an EoS response mode can be met by using either an EoS or
SbS process where the latter involves making step-by-step revisions in
beliefs but overtly verbalizing only the final opinion. Faced with an EoS
response mode, when do people use an EoS or SbS process?
An important difference between the EoS and the SbS processes is the
nature of the demands they make on memory and information-processing
load. When faced, for example, with a sequence of four items of evidence,
the EoS strategy requires aggregating the latter items prior to integrating
them with the anchor. Aggregation, however, can be costly in terms of
mental resources. In contrast, the step-by-step integration of each item of
evidence in the SbS process makes minimal demands on memory and
information-processing load. This difference suggests that the choice between EoS and SbS strategies is determined by the effects of task characteristics on cognitive capacity. We therefore assume that, when required to provide EoS responses, people are more likely to use an SbS
process as the relative complexity and/or length of the series of evidence
items increases. As information-processing demands increase, people are
forced into using the SbS strategy in order to cope with the cognitive
demands of the task (i.e., the upper right cell of Fig. I).
In general, we assume that people try to match cognitive strategy with
response mode but shift strategies if this proves too demanding (cf. Payne
et al., 1990). The choice between EoS and SbS processes can therefore be
summarized as follows (see also Fig. 1):
1. When the response mode is SbS, the SbS process model is always
used.
2. When the response mode is EoS:
(a) the EoS process model is used for short series of cognitively

AND

(b) the SbS process is used for cognitively complex evidence items
and/or longer series in order to handle the information-processing demands of the task.
Adjustment
The underlying purpose of adjusting beliefs to the impact of new evidence is adaptation. Thus the adjustment weight, wk, should depend on
both the sign of the impact of the evidence, i.e., of [s(xk) - RI, and the
level of the anchor, Sk- 1. For s(+) C R, we argue that wk is proportional
to Sk_ 1. The rationale is the following: Imagine that your current position
(i.e., anchor) is weak and a strong piece of negative evidence is received.
Since your current position is already low, the new information cannot
reduce the anchor a great deal (in absolute terms). Now consider the
effect of the same negative evidence if your position were strongly held.
We argue that the reduction of strength will be larger in the latter case.
Note that this assumption implies a “contrast” effect since it says that
large anchors are “hurt” more than smaller ones (given the same negative
evidence). To borrow a boxing metaphor, the contrast effect implies that
the bigger the anchor, the harder it will fall. Thus
wk = dk-,,

when s(xk) s R.

(64

By an analogous argument, we assume that when s(xk) > R, wk is
inversely proportional to the strength of the anchor, i.e.,
wk = p (1 - Sk- ,) when s(.$) > R,

(6b)

where OLand p are constants. 3 To illustrate the effect of these assumptions, substitute Eqs. (6a) and (6b) into Eq. (1) so that the SbS process
model can be written as

(7b)

It is of interest to note that Eq. (7b) leads to a formulation identical to
one proposed by James Bernoulli for combining the probabilistic impact
of two pieces of positive evidence (see Shafer, 1976, pp. 75-77).
Whereas adaptation implies adjusting opinion for the impact of new

forms. However, several other functional forms could also capture the qualitative predictions implied by our model.

evidence, one would not necessarily expect people to adapt to evidence at
the same rate nor that the rate of adaptation be independent of the sign of
the adjustment. We therefore define OLand p (0 G CX,l3 < 1) to represent
sensitivity toward “negative” and “positive” evidence, respectively
(where the sign of the evidence is evaluated relative to R). Small values of
cxand p imply low sensitivity to new information; large values of cxand p
imply high sensitivity. We also posit that OLand l3 are functionsof both
individual and situational variables. Some people, for example, may have
a general tendency to weight negative information more heavily than
positive. In other cases, a person may have such an investment in a
particular belief that CYis much smaller than p. (Consider a scientist who
does not want to hear negative evidence about a favorite theory.) In
general, one would expect that, in the absence of prior information or
biases, a person would have large values of both (Yand p (i.e., be highly
sensitive to evidence). However, as information accumulates and as people become more firmly committed to their beliefs, values of cx and p
would decline in a long series of evidence items.
Summary

Our general model is an anchoring-and-adjustment process. This involves three subprocesses that specify: (a) how evidence is encodedrelative to a variable or constant background, i.e., R = Sk-, or R = 0; (b)
how evidence is processed-Step-by-Step or End-of-Sequence, see Eqs.
(1) and (5), respectively; and (c) the nature of the adjustment process.
This embodies the contrast assumption and different forms depend on the
sign of [S(Q) - RI; see Eqs. (6a) and (6b). We further specified the
conditions under which alternative forms of the subprocesses are used.
We now examine the implications of our model for order effects.
ORDER-EFFECT

PREDICTIONS

We first consider the order-effect predictions for the SbS and EoS
subprocesses prior to showing how these interact with different task characteristics.
The SbS Process

Predictions for this subprocess depend on whether encoding involves
the estimation or evaluation modes, i.e., R = Skpl or R = 0, respectively .
R = Sk-,

This leads to the process modeled by Eq. (3) which has exactly the
same form as a model originally proposed by Anderson and Hovland
(1957~see also Anderson (1959). It has two important properties. First,

<-----Page 15----->16

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

as shown in Eq. (4) it implies an averaging process where S, is a weighted
average of the anchor, Sk-i, and the evidence, s(.Q). Second, when R =
Sk-i, the SbS process always predicts recency (for I@ # O)-see Appendix B.
R=O

In this case, the SbS process no longer has a weighted average formulation and is similar in form to a model proposed by Carlson and Dulany
(1988). Moreover, order-effect predictions depend on whether the sequence of evidence processed involves consistent or mixed evidence. By
the former we mean sequences where the evidence encountered is either
all negative or all positive; by the latter we mean sequences involving
mixtures of positive and negative evidence.
When R = 0, the SbS process predicts no order effects for consistent
evidence but always predicts recency in the sequential evaluation of
mixed evidence except if (Yor B is zero (i.e., either negative or positive
evidence is completely ignored). Furthermore, recency effects will be
largest when both positive and negative evidence are strong and there is
high sensitivity to evidence. These conditions are derived in Appendix C.
The EoS Process

As shown by Eq. (5), the EoS process is characterized by a single
adjustment that reflects the net aggregate impact of the remaining pieces
of evidence on the initial anchor. In fact, in many EoS experiments reported in the literature (see, e.g., Anderson, 1981), subjects have no
explicit initial opinion such that the anchor is derived from the first
piece(s) of evidence. In these circumstances, the structure of the EoS
strategy contains within it a force toward primacy. Moreover, this result
holds whether the evidence is all positive, all negative, or mixed. This
occurs because, in the absence of an explicit starting point, we assume
that the first piece of evidence, or an amalgamation of the first few pieces,
serves as the anchor. Thus, to illustrate by denoting the first piece of
evidence as the anchor, Eq. (5) can be rewritten as

S, = 44

+ w,J&,

. . , x,J - RI,

(8)

where for a wide range of functions s(xZ, . . , x,), it follows that the
effective weight accorded to s(xi) must be greater than the weight attached to any of the other pieces of evidence.
Subprocesses and Task Characteristics

The order-effect predictions that result from the intersection of our
assumptions concerning subprocesses and task variables are summarized
in Table 2. Note that in accordance with the preceding discussion, the

predictions assume that the SbS response mode always invokes the SbS
process, but that the EoS process will only be used when the EoS response mode is required in tasks involving short series of cognitively
simple evidence items (i.e., the first row of Table 2). Second, the predictions reflect the same task variables used in the analysis summarized in
Table 1 with the exceptions that we have now also distinguished between,
first, whether evidence is encoded relative to S,,_ 1 or 0 and, second, the
distinction between series consisting of mixed and consistent evidence.
It is instructive to compare the predictions in Table 2 with the analysis
of order effects summarized in Table 1.
Consider the first row of Table 2 which deals with tasks involving short
series of simple evidence items. For EoS processing, the model always
predicts primacy and this is the predominant outcome in the experimental
literature when EoS response mode is required (19 of 27 studies, Table 1).
For the SbS response mode, the evidence favors recency exclusively (all
16 studies, Table 1) and this is predicted by the model for all but the case
of evaluation (R = 0) with consistent evidence. Here no effects are predicted. However, it is unclear whether any previous studies belong in this
cell of the table.
The second row of Table 2 deals with short series of complex evidence
items. Here the model predicts recency irrespective of response mode
(i.e., SbS or EoS) except for the no-effects predictions for evaluation (R
= 0) with consistent evidence. Evidence from Table 1 largely supports
recency for series of short, complex evidence items (9 of 11 studies).
However, evidence concerning SbS is sparse (only 2 studies) and, once
again, it is not clear that any studies required evaluation (R = 0) with
consistent evidence.
The third row of Table 2 concerns long series of evidence items for
which the model predicts mixed results. On the one hand, SbS processing
typically leads to recency. However, as more information is processed
across time, we predict decrements in (Yand l3 that will eventually induce
primacy. Thus, whereas recency may be observed in long series, this
becomes less likely as the length of the series increases (for relevant
experimental evidence, see Anderson, 1959). Interestingly, in one of the
two studies reporting recency for long series of simple evidence items
(Lichtenstein & Srull, 1987-see Table l), subjects were specifically told
that they would be asked to recall specific evidence items for comprehension. That this instruction disturbed the judgmental process by focussing attention on particular evidence items was borne out by the finding of
primacy in the two other instructional conditions of this experiment (an
impression set and a memory set). In the second case, whereas Jones,
Rock, Shaver, Goethals, and Ward (1968) reported recency in one of
six experiments (see Appendix A), replications by other researchers

<-----Page 18----->ORDER

(Feldman & Bernstein, 1977, 1978) resulted in primacy. Finally, Tetlock
(1983) showed that, although primacy resulted for a long series of complex evidence items with the EoS response mode, order effects could be
nullified by instructing subjects that they would be required to justify their
decisions, i.e., by intervening in the process.
NEW EXPERIMENTAL

EVIDENCE

Comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows strong agreement between predictions and existing experimental findings. This is particularly the case
for series of short, simple evidence items in row 1 of Table 2 for which
there are many data (see Table 1). Of special interest are the predictions
of row 2 of Table 2 where not only have fewer studies been conducted in
the past (see Table l), but where the present model makes novel predictions. These are the presence of recency under all conditions with the
exception of the cells involving consistent evidence in evaluation tasks
(where R = 0). We therefore focus our experimental testing of the model
on the predictions implied by row 2 of Table 2.
Before presenting experimental evidence, it is appropriate to ask what
alternative models could make the same predictions as our model. A
“straw-man” alternative is the Bayesian model that has been much utilized to study belief updating (Slavic & Lichtenstein, 1971). However,
since this predicts no order effects under any conditions, its descriptive
adequacy is discredited by the studies summarized in Table 1 and Appendix A. A second class of models are those of Anderson (1959) and
Carlson and Dulany (1988) which are identical in form to our SbS models
when R = Sk-, and R = 0, respectively. However, the former predicts
recency for both mixed and consistent evidence, and the latter does not
predict order effects for consistent evidence. Third, by changing assumptions concerning the adjustment parameter, wk, it is possible to construct
models that are variants of Eqs. (7a) and (7b) and which do make alternative predictions. For example, if wk is either a constant or proportional
to the scale value of evidence, s(xk), the model would predict no order
effects for either mixed or consistent evidence. If, alternatively, wk were
proportional to (1 - S,- i) for negative evidence and to S,- i for positive
evidence (thereby reversing our contrast assumption), the model would
predict primacy for mixed evidence and no effect for consistent evidence.
However, apart from the fact that all of these alternatives concerning wk
have awkward mathematical implications (S, would no longer be bounded
between 0 and l), they do not appear to have been suggested in the
literature. The fact remains that the belief-adjustment model both accounts for a wide range of circumstances in which order effects have been
demonstrated and makes subtle predictions for cases which have not
previously been considered. Moreover, these predictions are unique rel-

<-----Page 19----->20

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

ative to alternative models that have been suggested in the literature as
well as variants of the model itself.
Plan of Experiments
As noted above, our experimental testing focused on the predictions in
row 2 of Table 2. In Experiments 1 through 4 we examined how new
information changes beliefs in a task using complex evidence items under
conditions involving both SbS and EoS response modes. The stimuli for
these experiments involved the updating of causal hypotheses for which
information was presented in a form that, we hypothesized, would require
subjects to encode evidence as positive or negative vis-a-vis the hypothesis under consideration such that R = 0 and - 1 c s(+) G + 1. For these
stimuli, the model predicts no order effects for consistent evidence and
recency for mixed evidence. Experiments 1 and 2 were designed to test
the prediction of no order effects for consistent evidence. Experiments 3
and 4 tested the prediction of recency effects for mixed evidence.
Whereas the model predicts no order effects for consistent evidence
when R = 0, it does predict recency for consistent evidence when R =
S,- ,, i.e., for estimation as opposed to evaluation tasks. This differential
prediction was tested in Experiment 5. The information in one of the
scenarios used in Experiments 1 through 4 was presented in two forms,
one intended to engage subjects in evaluation and the other intended to
engage subjects in estimation. We predicted no order effects for the
former, but recency for the latter.
It is important to recall that the order-effect predictions are derived
from qualitative assumptions concerning the process of belief updating. In
evaluation tasks, for example, beliefs should be revised upward after
seeing positive evidence and downward after seeing negative. In addition,
the contrast assumption predicts that belief changes will be proportional
(negative evidence) or inversely proportional (positive evidence) to the
current anchor. Together, these process assumptions imply predictions
about the patterns of data that should be exhibited and thus the manner by
which order effects do or do not occur. A second objective of the experiments was to examine these additional, implied tests of the process predicted by the updating model.
EXPERIMENTS

l-3

Because of commonality of procedures, we describe Experiments l-3
together. The main purpose of Experiments 1 and 2 was to test for order
effects in the updating of beliefs based on consistent evidence in a short
series of complex evidence items where the theory predicts no order
effects for either SbS or EoS. Experiment 1 dealt with positive evidence,
Experiment 2 with negative evidence. In Experiment 3 we tested the

model’s prediction that mixed evidence would lead to recency effects for
both SbS and EoS.
Methods
Subjects. Subjects were recruited through advertisements placed around the University of
Chicago. They were offered $5/hour for participating in an experiment on decision making.
Their median age was 22.5 years and their mean educational level was 4.2 years beyond high
school. There were 24 subjects in each of the three experiments.
Stimuli. The stimuli involved a set of four scenarios, each of which involved an initial
description (the stem) and two additional pieces of information presented in separate paragraphs. Excluding response scales and instructions, the stems of the scenarios varied in
length between 68 and 109 words (mean of 88) with additional pieces of information averaging 52 words each. The content of the four scenarios involved: (1) a defective stereo
speaker thought to have a bad connection; (2) a baseball player whose hitting has improved
dramatically after a new coaching program; (3) an increase in sales of a supermarket product
following an advertising campaign; and (4) the contracting of lung cancer by a worker in a
chemical factory. In each case, the stem provided information regarding the hypothesis that
the particular cause was responsible for the effect of interest. After reading the stem,
subjects were asked to rate how likely the suspected factor was the cause of the outcome on
a rating scale from 0 to 100(e.g., in the baseball scenario, subjects were asked, “How likely
do you think that the new training program caused the improvement in Sandy’s
performance?“). After responding to this question, subjects turned the page of their experimental booklets and were presented with two pieces of additional information regarding the
causal hypothesis.
In Experiment I, these two pieces consisted of strong positive and weak positive information about the hypothesis. As an example, a positive argument in the baseball scenario
read “The other players on Sandy’s team did not show an unusual increase in their batting
average over the last five weeks. In fact, the team’s overall batting average for these five
weeks was about the same as the average for the season thus far.” To illustrate why we
consider that this type of evidence would evoke evaluation as opposed to estimation, note,
first, the hypothesis to be judged is dichotomous; i.e., did or did not the training program
cause the improvement in Sandy’s performance? Second, the potential impact of the evidence is bipolar and its sign (positive or negative vis-Zt-vis the hypothesis) must be interpreted prior to integration with the existing anchor. In addition, the evidence has not been
neatly “packaged” in a quantitative, unipolar form that is compatible with estimation.
The new information was presented in either a strong-weak or weak-strong order. In the
SbS condition, the two pieces of new information were presented on separate pages with a
0- to lOO-point rating scale at the bottom of each page. Subjects were asked to respond after
each piece to the question, “Now, how likely do you think X caused Y?” In the EoS
procedure, the two pieces of information were presented continuously as paragraphs. At the
end of the last paragraph, subjects were asked to rate the likelihood that X caused Y.
In Experiments 2 and 3, the same procedures were followed except that in Experiment 2
the two pieces of information consisted of strong negative and weak negative information
about the hypothesis, and in Experiment 3 the two pieces of information were mixed involving positive and negative information. An example of negative information in the baseball scenario was “The games in which Sandy showed his improvement were played against
the last place team in the league. Pitchers on that team are very weak and usually allow
many hits and runs.”
Design and procedure.
The experimental design involved three variables: order of evidence (strong-weak vs weak-strong for Experiments I and 2, and positive-negative vs

<-----Page 21----->22

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

negative-positive in Experiment 3); response elicitation procedure, SbS vs EoS; and the
four different scenarios. The first two variables were factorially crossed (resulting in four
combinations) and arranged as within-subject variables. The four scenarios were presented
in a 4 x 4 Latin square arrangement. Thus, subjects evaluated each of the four scenarios in
one of the four combinations resulting from crossing the order and elicitation variables. The
24 subjects in each experiment were randomly assigned to one of the four groups making up
the Latin square (6 subjects per group).
Subjects were given the experimental materials in booklet form and told to work carefully
and at their own pace. To provide variety, they worked on another, unrelated experimental
task between scenarios. On average, subjects completed all tasks in 1 h, working on the
tasks in a laboratory under the supervision of an experimenter with at most three other
subjects present at the same time. At the completion of the experiment, subjects were asked
to reconsider each piece of evidence and rate it on a scale from - 100 (completely disconfirms the hypothesis) to + 100 (completely confirms the hypothesis). These data were used
to provide a manipulation check on whether the information was of the hypothesized size
and sign.

Results
We present three types of results. First, we discuss manipulation
checks. Second, we consider order effects. Third, we go beyond order
effects to examine the extent to which the patterns of data are consistent
with the assumed underlying process of the model and, in particular, the
contrast assumption.
Manipulation checks. In Experiment 1, across all four scenarios, the
mean rating of the strong positive evidence was 63 while the weak positive evidence was rated as 33, t(92) = 9.0, p < .OOl. Furthermore, in each
scenario the strong evidence was rated higher than the weak evidence,
t(23) > 3.5, p < .OOl, for all scenarios. In Experiment 2, over the four
scenarios, strong negative evidence was rated as being more negative
than weak negative evidence, -30~s -12,t(92) = -5.14,p<.OOl.This
result also held in all four scenarios, although at different levels of statistical significance: for two scenarios, t(23) > 3.5, p < .OOl; for the third,
t(23) = 1.7, p < .lO; and for the fourth, t(23) = 1.4, p < .17. In Experiment 3, over all four scenarios, the positive evidence was rated 65, t(92)
= 24.0, p < .OOl, and the negative evidence was rated -38, t(92) =
- 11.2, p < .OOl. In addition, this pattern held in each of the four scenarios, t(23) > 3.5, p < .OOl.
As an additional test, consider how many times subjects revised opinions down after seeing positive evidence and up after receiving negative
evidence during the experiments. Across all three experiments there were
285 judgments in the SbS condition that should have been constrained in
sign (288 less 3 missing observations). Nineteen of these 285judgments or
6.7% were in the “wrong” direction. In the EoS conditions of Experiments 1 and 2, 7 of 96 or 7.3% of final judgments involved errors in

direction (up after consistent negative evidence or down after positive).
Further evidence of subjects’ sensitivity to the relative strength of the
weak and strong information presented in Experiments 1 and 2 can be
noted by whether belief changes following strong evidence were greater
than after weak. Because of the contrast assumption (see Eqs. (6a) and
(6b)), the model implies that this should always be the case for the strongweak condition but not necessarily for the weak-strong and was verified
in 35 of 47 or 75% of individual cases that could be tested in Experiments
1 and 2 for the strong-weak order, z = 3.21, p < .OOl, one-tailed sign test.
The analogous statistics in the weak-strong order were 30 of 47 or 64%,
z = 1.75, p < .OS,one-tailed sign test. Taken together, the above three
sets of results indicate that we were successful in manipulating both the
sign and the differential strength of the evidence in all three experiments.
Order effects. Figures 2, 3, and 4 illustrate graphically the results concerning order effects in Experiments 1,2, and 3, respectively, for both the
SbS and EoS conditions. As predicted, the figures are consistent with no
order effects in Experiments 1 and 2 but recency in Experiment 3.
One difficulty in analyzing order-effect data when treatments concerning order are between subjects is that initial differences can mask effects
(consider, for example, Fig. 3b). For statistical analysis, therefore, we
focus on the difference between the stem (S,) and final judgments (S,),
i.e., Y = S, - SZ. In each experiment, this measure was subjected to a
2 x 2 x 4 analysis of variance using the appropriate repeated-measures
Latin square design. In Experiment 1, only one effect was significant, a
main effect for scenarios, F(3,72) = 12.9, p < .OOl. This was due to the
fact that one scenario (the stereo speaker) increased more than the others
(Y = -31 vs -9, - 10, and - 12). From our perspective, the major

In Experiment 2, the 2 x 2 x 4 analysis of variance on So - S, also
showed no effect of order, in accord with our prediction. Mean decreases
for strong-weak and weak-strong orders were 27.8 and 28.8, respectively. However, there was a main effect for response mode, F( 1,70) =
3.9, p < .05, and a response mode x scenario interaction, F(3,70) = 3.5,
p < .02. The main effect occurred because the initial judgments decreased
by 32 under the SbS procedure versus 25 under the EoS method. The
interaction was due to the fact that one scenario (the stereo speaker) had
a larger decrease in the EoS method than the three other scenarios (which
showed larger decreases in the SbS procedure). Since we did not control

for the variables constituting scenario content (indeed, it is not even clear
what these variables are), the differential sensitivity of belief change to
particular scenarios under various procedures raises interesting questions
that are beyond the scope of the present model.
In Experiment 3, the 2 x 2 x 4 analysis of variance showed the hypothesized recency effect, F(1,71) = 9.8, p < .003. Specifically, the positive-negative order resulted in a mean decrease of 9.2 relative to the
initial judgment; the negative-positive order resulted in an increase of 2.7.
In addition to the main effect for order, there was a significant scenario
main effect, F(3,71) = 9.8, p < .OOl, and a scenario x response mode
interaction, F(3,71) = 2.7, p < .05, that were similar to those found in
Experiments 1 and 2.
The absence or existence of order effects at the aggregate level does not
necessarily imply the same outcomes at the level of individual subjects.
However, because in each experiment each subject saw four different
scenarios, it is not possible to make direct tests of order effects at the
individual level. On the other hand, within both the SbS and the EoS
conditions, each subject was exposed to different orders of evidence,
namely strong-weak vs weak-strong in Experiments 1 and 2, and positive-negative vs negative-positive in Experiment 3. Thus, by ignoring
scenario differences a surrogate test of order effects can be made at the
individual subject level. To do so, responses of individual subjects were
classified within both the SbS and the EoS conditions to see whether they
indicated primacy, recency, or no order effects (absolute sizes of effects
were ignored). Results are summarized in Table 3. For Experiments 1 and
2, there is an almost exact 50/50 split between primacy and recency for
both the EoS and the SbS conditions. The null hypothesis of no order
effects therefore cannot be rejected for Experiments 1 and 2, z = 0 and L
= .147, ns by sign tests. For Experiment 3, on the other hand, the same
test reveals a majority of recency effects in both the SbS (61%) and the
EoS (75%) conditions, z = 2.51, p < .Ol, one-tailed sign test. Although

not ideal, these tests of individual-level order effects add further support
to the model’s experimental predictions.
Tests of the contrast assumption. A key feature of the underlying model
is the contrast assumption: Negative evidence induces greater belief
change the larger the preceding anchor; for positive evidence it is the
reverse-see Eqs. (6a) and (6b). The contrast assumption therefore imposes restrictions on patterns of data that are consistent with the model:
(i) For consistent evidence, an item of evidence will induce more
change in belief the earlier it is processed. To see this, consider the effects
of two pieces of negative evidence. The piece that is considered second
will necessarily adjust a lower anchor than that processed first. Thus, had
the second piece been processed first, it would have adjusted a larger
anchor thereby inducing greater change in belief. In Experiments 1 and 2,
this implies that strong evidence should induce more change in belief in
the strong-weak than in the weak-strong order. Similarly for weak evidence, greater changes in belief should be observed in the weak-strong
rather than the strong-weak order.
(ii) For mixed evidence, evidence will induce more belief change when
processed after evidence that is opposite in sign. This follows from the
fact that positive evidence processed in a negative-positive order has a
lower anchor than when processed in a positive-negative order. Similarly, negative evidence processed in a positive-negative order has a
larger anchor than when processed in a negative-positive order.
(iii) The amount of belief change, defined by (S,-, - S,), should be
proportional to the preceding anchor, Sk- ,-see Eqs. (6a) and (6b). This
should be evidenced by positive correlation between (S,- 1 - S,) and
Sk- ,. (To see this, note that the amount of belief change associated with
positive evidence should be inversely proportional to Sk- ,; in addition,
(S,- , - S,) < 0. For negative evidence, belief change should be proportional to SkPl, but (Sk-, - S,) > 0.)
We now consider tests of implications (i) and (ii) at the aggregate level.
For positive evidence, examine Fig. 2a and note that when the strong
evidence is presented first (in the strong-weak order) it increases mean
opinion by 15.1, from 63.0 to 78.1. When it appears second (in the weakstrong order) it induces a smaller increase of 11.O, 72.7 to 83.7. Similarly,
the weak evidence has greater impact with the lower anchor in the weakstrong as opposed to the strong-weak order, i.e., (72.7 - 68.2) > (81.2 78.1). Although in the appropriate direction, however, post hoc contrasts
show that neither of the differences in impacts are statistically significant,
t(44) = .86 and t(44) = .48, respectively.
Figure 3a illustrates the data from the SbS condition of Experiment 2.
The strong negative evidence discounts belief more from the larger anchor in the strong-weak as opposed to the weak-strong situation, i.e.,

<-----Page 26----->ORDER

IN BELIEF

UPDATING

27

(68.1 - 41.1) > (55.1 - 35.8), t(42) = 1.58, p = .06, one-tailed test.
Similarly, the weak evidence has greater impact from the larger anchor,
i.e., (68.3 - 55.1) > (41.1 - 35.8), t(42) = 2.16,~ < .025, one-tailed test.
Figure 4a shows the analogous data for Experiment 3 with respect to
mixed evidence. As predicted, the increase in mean opinion due to positive evidence is larger from the lower anchor, i.e., (75.7 - 43.6) > (82.6
- 68.6), t(43) = 3.07, p < .025. However, the implication is not validated
for negative evidence. Here, the negative evidence has more impact when
discounting a smaller anchor, i.e., (69.2 - 43.6) > (82.6 - 62.7) but the
difference is not statistically significant, t(43) = - 1.09.
In summary, the predicted directions of live of the six tests of implications (i) and (ii) (across the three experiments) are validated by the
aggregate data. The exception concerns the use of negative evidence in
Experiment 3 where the model would have predicted more discounting of
the negative evidence in the positive-negative as opposed to negativepositive order. The failure to observe more discounting in this instance
can be interpreted as meaning that the recency effect exhibited in Fig. 4a
is smaller than would have been predicted by the model.
Whereas it is not possible to test predictions (i) and (ii) directly at the
individual level, the recency effect in Experiment 3 can be examined
further by asking whether the change in belief due to processing the
second piece of evidence exceeds that due to the tirst.4 The individual
data support this implication in the SbS condition. The change in belief
due to the second piece of evidence exceeded that due to the first in 32 of
47 cases, 68%, z = 2.33, p < .Ol, one-tailed sign test.
Finally, tests of implication (iii) are provided in Table 4 which shows
correlations between changes in belief, (S,- r - S,), and their preceding
anchors, S,- ,. In addition to the data from the SbS conditions, we also
include statistics from the EoS data where the correlation is necessarily
calculated between (S, - S,) and S,. In order to have meaningful sample
sizes, the correlations have been calculated ignoring scenario differences.
All 16 correlations are of the appropriate sign and 11 of the 16 are statistically significant.
In summary, the data from the three experiments conform with the
order-effect predictions of the model, both in the aggregate and in our
“surrogate” tests of individual-level effects. As to the process inducing
order effects, both direct and indirect tests showed that subjects interpreted and acted on the sign and strength of the evidence in the manner
predicted by the model. In addition, most tests of the implications of the
contrast assumption were confirmed.

4 This is a weaker test because it assumes that s( +) = s( -) and Q = p.

EXPERIMENT

4

Experiment 4 was designed to test the prediction of recency for mixed
evidence but involved four as opposed to two pieces of evidence. Parts of
the various scenarios used in Experiments 1-3 were, however, expressed
differently.5
Methods
Subjects.
There were 60 subjects from the same population as the previous experiments.
They were recruited and remunerated in the same manner.
Stimuli,
design, and procedures.
Experiment 4 followed Experiment 3 in all respects
except that there were four rather than two pieces of evidence and, as noted above, parts of
the scenarios were longer as measured by number of words. The two orders were therefore
( + , + , - , -) and (- , - , + , +). Within the two positive and negative pieces, the orders were
held constant.

Results
The manipulation checks showed that all positive arguments were seen
as positive and all negative arguments seen as negative. All means were
significantly different from zero and in the hypothesized directions, t(59)
> 3.5, p < .OOl. The individual data were also checked to note the number
of times beliefs changed in a direction opposite that intended by us (i.e.,
down after seeing positive evidence or up after negative). Of the 479
judgments that should have been constrained in sign (480 minus one missing observation), there were 48 such violations, a rate of 10%.
5 Experiment 4 was actually conducted before Experiments l-3. The differences in wording had been made to clarify potential ambiguities of interpretation in some of the stimuli.

Figures 5a and 5b depict the pattern of the aggregate data and reveal the
predicted recency effects for both the SbS and EoS conditions as measured by differences in S, - S4, means of 14.5 and 6.0, respectively.
Using Y = So - S, as the dependent variable, analysis of variance
showed that the overall order effect was statistically significant, F(1,180)
= 17.48, p < .OOl. As in the previous experiments, there was a significant
scenario effect, F(3,180) = 7.11, p < .OOl, as well as a scenario by
response mode interaction, F(3,180) = 4.90, p < .003.
Because of scenario differences, it is not possible to make direct tests
of order effects at the individual level. However, surrogate individuallevel tests were made in the same manner as the previous experiments. In
the SbS condition, 42 of 57 or 74% of individual tests showed recency as
opposed to primacy (there were 2 with no effect and 1 missing observation). In the EoS condition, 36 of 57 or 63% showed recency as opposed
to primacy (there were 3 with no effect). One-tailed sign tests showed
surrogate individual-level recency effects to be statistically significant for
both response modes, z = 3.46, p < .OOl, and z = 1.86, p < .05, respectively.
Concerning the overall pattern of the aggregate data in the SbS condition, the contrast assumption implies predictions concerning the relative
sizes of changes in belief. In particular, the increase due to positive evidence should be larger in the negative-positive order than in the positivenegative order because the anchor associated with the latter is larger than
that for the former. Indicating anchors in the negative-positive order by
primes and those in the positive-negative order without primes, this prediction can be written: (i) (S, - S,) < (S,’ - &‘)-see Fig. 5a. Using
analogous arguments, the following predictions can also be made: (ii) (S,

<-----Page 29----->30

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

- S,) < (S,’ - S3’); (iii) (S, - S,) > (S,’ - S,‘); and (iv) (S, - S,) > (S,’
- S,‘)-see Fig. 5a. Means of these differences are, respectively, (i) 5.00
vs 16.58, z = -3.65,~ < .OOl; (ii) 4.33 vs 13.51, z = -2.95,~ < .025; (iii)
13.00 vs 18.12, z = -1.54, ns; and (iv) 13.92 vs 15.51, z = -0.55, ns.
Thus, (i) and (ii) are validated and statistically significant but the data do
not support (iii) and (iv). The substantive implication of these tests is that
although the aggregate data show the predicted recency effect, this is
smaller than would have occurred had the predicted relative sizes in
changes in belief (i) through (iv) all been validated.
Further tests of the model are implied by expected correlations between anchors and subsequent changes in belief. Specifically, (Sk-i S,) should be positively correlated with Sk- i in the SbS data. For k = 1
to 4 in the positive-negative condition, these correlations were .384, .473,
.275, and .441, respectively, p < .025, for all. In the negative-positive
condition, the analogous statistics were .277, .580, .262, and .152, p <
.025, for all except the last correlation which was not statistically significant. In other words, all correlations were of the appropriate sign, and
seven of eight were statistically significant.
EXPERIMENT

5

Experiments 1 and 2 tested the prediction that, for evaluation tasks
(i.e., where R = O), no order effects would be observed for consistent
evidence. These results are subject to alternative explanations. First, if
order effects do occur for consistent evidence, they are likely to be
smaller than those for mixed evidence. This could occur because differences between S(Q) values for consistent evidence would tend to be
smaller than those between mixed evidence. Second, our tests might have
lacked statistical power. In addition, whereas no order effects are predicted for consistent evidence in evaluation tasks, the model does predict
recency for estimation tasks where R = Sk-, (see Table 2). Moreover,
there is evidence in the literature that order effects have been observed
with consistent evidence (Anderson, 1968; Chalmers, 1971).
Experiment 5 examined these issues. We designed an updating task in
which consistent evidence was presented in alternative forms. For one
version, we hypothesized subjects would use an evaluation strategy and
that this would result in no order effects thereby replicating the outcomes
of Experiments 1 and 2. For the second version, we hypothesized that
subjects would use an estimation strategy such that there would be an
order effect, specifically recency (see Table 2).
To interpret both the motivation for this experiment and our subsequent results, it is important to emphasize a qualitative difference in the
way consistent evidence is processed in the evaluation and estimation
modes. Imagine a task requiring step-by-step responses for two pieces of

positive evidence, one weak and one strong. When evidence is processed
in the weak-strong order, the evaluation and estimation modes imply
upward adjustments after processing both the weak and the strong evidence. However, when the evidence is processed in the strong-weak
order this is no longer the case. On the one hand, both modes do imply
upward adjustments after the strong evidence. On the other hand,
whereas the weak evidence implies an upward adjustment in the evaluation mode, its effect is a downward adjustment in the estimation mode.
This occurs because whereas the sign of the adjustment is determined
relative to R = 0 in the evaluation mode, R = S,- , in the estimation
mode. Thus, if weak evidence follows strong in the estimation mode, it
will be seen as weaker than Sk-r thereby implying a downward adjustment. We therefore further predict that the directions of the adjustment
following receipt of the weak evidence in the strong-weak order will be
positive in the evaluation task but negative in the estimation task.
Methods
Subjects.
There were 60 subjects who were recruited through advertisements placed
around the University of Chicago. They were paid $2 for participating in this experiment
after having completed another unrelated experiment. Their mean age was 21 years.
Stimuli. The stimuli were adapted from the defective stereo scenario used in the preceding
experiments. In this scenario, subjects are asked to assess the likelihood that the malfunction in the protagonist’s (Judy’s) stereo is due to a loose connection between the speaker and
the amplifier. In our earlier discussion, we hypothesized that use of evaluation as opposed
to estimation depends on (a) the nature of the opinion to be expressed (dichotomous belief
vs estimates on a continuous scale) and (b) the extent to which the evidence presented is
compatible with the two forms of encoding. We specifically argued that estimation is facilitated when evidence is presented on an implicit, unipolar scale that maps easily onto the
required judgment, whereas evaluation occurs when the potential impact of the evidence is
bipolar and its sign (positive or negative vis-a-vis the hypothesis) must be interpreted prior
to integration with the existing anchor.
To operationalize conditions that would invoke different modes of encoding, we constructed two versions of the same scenario. Whereas both versions required responses
concerning the same dichotomous opinion, the evidence was presented in different forms.
For the estimation mode, we characterized the evidence using explicit numerical information on a unipolar scale that was compatible with the response mode. For the evaluation
mode, we used verbal information that required explicit interpretation concerning the sign
of the evidence.
For the weak evidence, the information in the estimation [evaluation] version was “Judy
has a friend who knows a lot about stereo systems. She told him about her problem. He said
it was quite common and that 60% of the time [more often than not] the cause turned out to
be a loose connection between the speaker and the amplifier.” That is, the only difference
between the two versions lay in the words “60% of the time” versus “more often than not.”
The information for the strong evidence in the estimation [evaluation] version was “Judy
asked a salesman in a stereo store about her problem. He told her that others had asked him
about the same problem and that 80% of the time [in the vast majority of cases] the cause
turned out to be a loose connection between the speaker and amplifier.”
Whereas the differences between the evaluation (or verbal) and estimation (or numerical)

<-----Page 31----->32

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

versions of the stimuli were small, we hypothesized that they would evoke different processes. For the evaluation task, subjects must read the evidence and evaluate whether it is
positive or negative vis-a-vis the hypothesis under consideration before making their judgments. As observed in the previous experiments, this typically leads to an adjustment in the
direction indicated by the evidence. Moreover, this should lead to no order effects with
consistent evidence. In the estimation task, however, the evidence is already encoded in an
easy-to-use, unipolar, quantitative form that is compatible with estimation. Even with consistent evidence, this should lead to recency effects.
Design andprocedure. The experimental design involved two between-subjects variables
each with two levels: order of evidence (strong-weak vs weak-strong) and type of information (numerical vs verbal). Fifteen subjects were allocated at random to each of the four
cells of the design. Subjects were given the experimental materials in booklet form and
instructed to work carefully and at their own pace but without flipping back to previous
answers. The stem and each piece of positive evidence were on succeeding pages in the
booklet and subjects made responses in step-by-step fashion on each of these three pages on
a scale from 0 (“A loose connection does not cause the malfunction”) to 100 (“A loose
connection causes the malfunction”). After completing these judgments, subjects were
asked to reconsider each piece of evidence and rate it on scale from - 10 (“Totally undermines the hypothesis”) to + IO (“Provides irrefutable positive evidence”).

Results
We first consider manipulation checks based on the judgments made
after completing the main task. For both the numerical and the verbal
stimuli, subjects judged the strong evidence as stronger than the weak
evidence, means of 5.02 vs 3.54 for the numerical, t(29) = 3.13, p < .Ol,
and means of 5.38 vs 4.38 for the verbal, t(29) = 2.51, p < .02. In
addition, judgments of the strong evidence did not differ between the
numerical and the verbal versions of the stimuli, t(58) = -0.57, p = .57,
and the same result held for the weak evidence, t(58) = - 1.19, p = .24.
The pattern of experimental results is exhibited in Figs. 6a and 6b and
conforms with predictions. There is a recency effect for the numerical
stimuli but no order effect for the verbal stimuli. For the numerical stim‘i

uli, the mean difference between the initial and the final judgments is 18.1
in the weak-strong order vs 7.7 in the strong-weak order, t(28) = 2.01, p
= .027, one-tailed test. The analogous differences for the verbal stimuli
are 22.6 and 22.7, t(28) = .013, p = .990. In addition, note from Fig. 6 that
whereas the final judgment in the strong-weak order results in a drop
from the preceding judgment for the numerical stimuli, there is an increase in the final judgment for the verbal stimuli. Both the mean reduction of -4.33 (numerical stimuli) and increase of 3.60 (verbal stimuli) are
significantly different from 0, t(14) = -3.04, p < .Ol, and t(14) = 3.58,
p < .Ol, respectively.
The aggregate pattern of results is supported by individual-level analysis. As in the previous experiments, the theory predicts the direction of
changes in judgment following the receipt of new evidence. Overall, there
were 6 violations of a possible 120 (i.e., where adjustments are in the
direction opposite to that predicted). Of particular significance is the manner in which subjects in the strong-weak order made their final adjustments, i.e., for the weak evidence. Of the 15 subjects in the numerical
condition, none adjusted upward. In the verbal condition, only 1 of 15
made a downward adjustment.
DISCUSSION

AND FURTHER EVIDENCE

Experiments 111 tested predictions for task conditions for which little
prior work has been reported in the belief-updating literature (see Tables
1 and 2). The results are consistent with the predictions of the beliefadjustment model concerning order effects for short series of complex
evidence items when R = 0, vis., no order effects in the processing of
consistent evidence (positive and negative), but recency for mixed evidence. Moreover, and also as predicted, these results hold across both the
SbS and the EoS response modes. In addition to the order-effect predictions, implications of the contrast assumption were tested and generally
found to hold.
Experiment 5 was a test of differential predictions concerning order
effects for consistent evidence in evaluation and estimation. As predicted,
consistent evidence lead to recency in estimation (the numerical stimuli)
and to no order effects in evaluation (the verbal stimuli). Detailed analysis
of the data further distinguished the implications of the two modes of
encoding in respect of evidence processed in the strong-weak order. As
predicted, the direction of belief revision following the weak evidence
differed between modes, up for evaluation but down for estimation.
Moreover, these tindings indicate that the experimental methods used
were powerful enough to detect order effects in consistent evidence
which were absent in Experiments 1 and 2.
Our model has also been the subject of independent investigation by

<-----Page 33----->34

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

other researchers. In a series of four experiments, Ashton and Ashton
(1988) tested for the absence of order effects for consistent evidence
(positive and negative) and the presence of recency with mixed evidence.
They used an SbS response mode and each experiment involved four
pieces of evidence. Their subjects were advanced students in auditing and
professional accountants and were required to perform updating tasks in
an auditing content. Results were as predicted by the belief-adjustment
model (i.e., no order effects for consistent evidence, recency for mixed).
In addition to order-effect predictions, Ashton and Ashton (1988) tested
implications of our contrast assumption concerning the adjustment parameter, wk, in two experiments in which they provided three groups of
subjects with different anchor points, .20, SO, and .80, and subsequently
presented the same evidence to all subjects. In one experiment, subjects
received four items of positive evidence, in the other four pieces of negative evidence. Changes in opinion followed the predicted pattern with
the amount of belief change being inversely proportional to the size of the
anchor for positive evidence, but proportional for negative evidence. Specifically, in the positive condition the amounts of belief change were .266,
.207, and .043 for the .20, SO, and .80 cases, respectively. In the negative
condition, the corresponding amounts of belief change were - .077,
- .288, and - .361. One could argue that, for the .80 anchor in the positive
condition and the .20 anchor in the negative condition, the amounts of
belief change were constrained by the boundedness of the O-l scale.
However, the predicted differences were also observed between the .20
and the .50 anchors conditions for positive evidence and the SO and the
.80 for negative evidence, where scale boundedness should not be an
important variable. A further implication tested by Ashton and Ashton
was that of the relation between the magnitude of recency effects and the
size of the initial anchor. The model predicts no relation (see Appendix C)
and none was found.
A further study of updating by professional accountants in an auditing
task was conducted by Tubbs, Messier, and Knechel (1990). They investigated both SbS and EoS response modes in tasks using consistent positive, consistent negative, and either two or four pieces of mixed evidence. The model predicts no order effects with consistent evidence and
none was observed except for a small recency effect for positive information in SbS. With mixed evidence, the model predicts recency, and this
was observed in three cases, the exception being an absence of order
effect for EoS with two pieces of evidence. Subsequent studies using
professional auditors as subjects have further validated the prediction of
recency for short series of complex evidence items involving mixed evidence (Asare, 1989; Messier, 1989; Messier & Tubbs, 1990; Koch, Pei, &
Reed, 1989). An interesting feature of the Koch, Pei, and Reed study was

<-----Page 34----->ORDER

EFFECTS

IN BELIEF

UPDATING

35

an attempt to measure whether the subjective evaluation of evidence, i.e.,
S(Q), was affected by serial position. In accordance with the assumptions
of the belief-updating model, no such effects were found. Finally, in a
study by Butt and Campbell (1989), professional auditors exhibited only
small recency effects which also interacted with whether they had high or
low priors (i.e., initial anchors) concerning the hypothesis. Interestingly,
this study involved updating 10 pieces of evidence so it approaches what
we would call a long series of items. Recall from Table 2 that as the
number of items increases, recency effects are predicted to diminish.
In a study involving undergraduate business students, Dillard, Kauffman, and Spires (in press) both replicated the order-effect predictions we
obtained in Experiments l-4 using our stimuli and reported further support for both the contrast assumption and the implication of independence
between level of the initial anchor or prior opinion and the size of recency
effects. Dillard et al. also obtained recency effects for mixed evidence
using management accounting scenarios. A further validation of recency
effects using our stimuli for an SbS response mode was reported by De
Wit, Hogarth, Koehler, and Luchins (1989).
Our model can also explain other phenomena of belief revision. In a
series of ingenious experiments, Lepper, Ross, and colleagues (for an
overview, see Ross & Lepper, 1980)have demonstrated a phenomenon of
belief perseverance. In this paradigm, subjects are induced into acquiring
certain beliefs, the source of which is subsequently discredited. However,
instead of beliefs reverting to their initial levels, these investigators find
that people persevere in their newly acquired but discredited beliefs. This
phenomenon can be accounted for within our framework by assuming
that B > (Y(i.e., people become advocates for the positions with which
they have been endowed) but does not, of course, explain why this occurs. In a further test of this phenomenon in a mock trial situation, however, Hatvany and Strack (1980) found a different effect. Subjects
changed their beliefs about a case on hearing a witness’s testimony. But,
when that testimony was subsequently discredited, subjects readjusted
their beliefs to such an extent that the net effect of the witness’s testimony
was negative.
The Hatvany and Strack (1980) tinding can be explained parsimoniously within the structure of the SbS process model when R = 0, and
even when (Y = l3 (i.e., when people have the same attitudes toward
positive and negative evidence). Imagine a case in which a person has an
initial belief, S,, and receives a piece of positive evidence which is subsequently discredited. Assume further that in discrediting this information, its subjective evaluation, denoted s(x), does not change. However,
because of the contrast assumption concerning the adjustment parameter,
wk, the amount by which opinion rises and then falls will not necessarily

<-----Page 35----->36

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

be the same. The reason is that each rise and fall in opinion is a function
not only of the evidence, s(x), but also of the previous anchor. Thus,
whereas the amount by which the positive evidence increases S, will be
equal to B(1 - S&(X) (see Eq. (7b)), the amount by which the evidence
will lower the new anchor (S,) is c&is(x) (see Eq. (7a)) which, because S,
# S,, cannot be the same except when S, = 1 - S,. This implies, for
example, that if S, is high, the upward adjustment from incorporating the
evidence will be more than compensated for by the downward revision
when it is subsequently discredited so that the final opinion will be lower
than S,. Similarly, if S, is initially low, incorporation of positive evidence
followed by discrediting the same will lead to a final opinion that is greater
than So.
We call this-the asymmetric rebound effect to denote that discrediting
information does not necessarily imply returning to one’s original position, and we emphasize that, within the model, this can occur even if
there is no asymmetry in a person’s attitude toward negative and positive
evidence (i.e., (Y = B).
GENERAL

DISCUSSION

We now discuss our work in relation to the structure of updating models, limitations of our approach and opportunities for future research, and
the importance of developing a procedural theory of judgment.
Structure

of Updating

Models

The basic structure of belief updating proposed in this paper is an
anchoring-and-adjustment process that has the advantage of being relatively easy to implement from a cognitive viewpoint. Three critical features of our analysis center on assumptions concerning (1) the encoding of
evidence, (2) the mode of processing, and (3) the adjustment weight.
(I) Encoding. In our framework, evidence is encoded relative to a
reference point or background, R, which is equal either to the prior anchor, S,- t, or a constant. Which of these reference points is adopted
depends on whether people treat the task as involving evaluation or estimation. In evaluation, where evidence is thought of as bipolar in nature
(e.g., supports or refutes a hypothesis), data are encoded as positive or
negative with respect to the hypothesis under consideration. This was
operationalized by allowing the subjective evaluation of evidence, s(x,J,
to vary between - 1 and + 1 and by setting R = 0. A consequence of this
formulation is data that fit adding models of judgment. By contrast, in
estimation sequential integration of information across time involves a
“moving average” that is adjusted by new evidence in the direction in
which this deviates from the present position. In these cases evidence is

37

thought of as unipolar such that s(x,J varies between 0 and 1 and R = Sk- 1
(the previous anchor). A consequence of this formulation is a model that
produces averaging data of judgments (see also Lopes, 1982, 1987a).
As demonstrated above (Table 2 and our experimental work), whether
people adopt an evaluation or estimation mode affects the kinds of order
effects observed. Moreover, an important contribution of the evaluation/
estimation distinction is to resolve the apparent conflict between adding
or averaging formulations of judgmental processes. Consider, for example, what Anderson (1981) refers to as the “set size effect.” Imagine a
situation where a person is presented with, say, three pieces of information (in SbS format) each having the same evidential impact, i.e., of the
same strength and polarity. What is the final opinion after seeing these
pieces of evidence? According to an averaging model, the final opinion
must be equal to the average of the scale positions of the evidence, which
in this case is the same as the scale value of each of the three pieces of
evidence. An adding model, however, predicts a final opinion that grows
more extreme (i.e., higher or lower according to circumstances) than this
common value. And indeed, this is what is observed empirically. To
account for this phenomenon within an averaging formulation, Anderson
has suggested that, in addition to the evidence items presented, subjects
had in mind a previous value on the opinion scale that was more extreme
than the evidence presented. Thus, when this imaginary prior value is
averaged with the scale values of the information presented, the new
average becomes more extreme across time thereby producing the socalled “set size effect.”
Our model suggests two alternative explanations. One is that evidence
is being encoded relative to a constant as opposed to varying reference
point (i.e., R = 0 rather than R = Sk- i). The second is to note that people
can approach judgmental tasks in ways that produce both “averaging”
and “adding” data. Moreover, as demonstrated in Experiment 5, the
differences in task conditions that invoke estimation or evaluation modes
can be quite subtle, e.g., numerical versus verbal representations of the
same information. Thus, although it would be convenient from a conceptual viewpoint to assume use of a single mode within the same task, the
fact that apparently small contextual differences can evoke different processes makes plausible the notion that subjects might also shift modes
within the same task. Thus, when subjects see evidence with the same
scale value on successive occasions, they may switch from estimation to
evaluation mode thereby avoiding having to repeat the same answer.
Indeed, Lopes (1987a) has made a similar suggestion.
To summarize, an important contribution of the belief-adjustment
model is to locate the substantive, process difference between models of

<-----Page 37----->38

AND

EINHORN

judgment that produce averaging and adding data in the manner in which
evidence items are encoded prior to integration in judgment (cf., Lopes,
1982). Moreover, because people use both evaluation and estimation
modes of encoding, it may be unrealistic to believe that they only use one
or the other within the same task. In the present work, we made specific
hypotheses about conditions that tend to favor the use of each mode and
provided an experimental demonstration of the difference between conditions. However, more work is required to provide complete specification of these conditions.
(2) Processing mode. Our model distinguished between two modes of
processing, Step-by-Step and End-of-Sequence. Moreover, we examined
tasks where subjects were required to respond either in a step-by-step
basis or only after all the information had been received. In the presence
of a step-by-step response mode, it is reasonable to assume that people
must use an SbS process. However, an end-of-sequence response mode
may or may not invoke an EoS process. By appealing to the wellestablished notion of cognitive limitations, we assumed that people will
use an EoS process in the presence of an end-of-sequence response mode
if this does not exceed their processing abilities. With more complex and
longer tasks, however, they will adopt an SbS process. These assumptions raise interesting and, as yet, unanswered questions concerning the
point at which people decide to switch from one strategy to another (i.e.,
EoS to SbS) as well as details concerning the EoS process that were not
addressed in this paper. For example, what rules govern the aggregation
of information that is used to adjust the anchor when using the EoS
process? (See Eqs. (5) and (8), also Anderson, 1981.)
A further issue with respect to processing concerns the evaluation of
evidence. In the normative Bayesian model of inference, evidence is evaluated with respect to both the hypothesis under consideration and its
alternatives. In constructing our model, however, we explicitly built on
the notion that people typically fail to evaluate evidence with respect to
its diagnostic impact on alternative hypotheses. Rather, they tend to evaluate evidence with respect to a single hypothesis which is cognitively
simpler (see, e.g., Schum & Martin, 1980; Fischhoff & Beyth-Marom,
1983; Robinson & Hastie, 1985). An intriguing issue for future research
therefore centers on determining when such “simplistic” evaluation leads
to inferential “errors” apart from the issues already considered in this
paper.
(3) Adjustment. The contrast assumption concerning wk in Eq. (1) is
critical to the belief-adjustment model. As noted previously, a model that
is almost identical to the SbS process when R = 0 has been proposed by
Carlson and Dulany (1988). The purpose of their model is to explain how

<-----Page 38----->ORDER

EFFECTS

IN

BELIEF

UPDATING

39

people form judgments of the “convincingness” of evidence and then
integrate this into an overall judgment recorded on a scale going from - 1
to + 1. Carlson and Dulany postulate that the convincingness of evidence
is encoded positively or negatively vis-a-vis the hypothesis under consideration (i.e., R = 0) and that revision of belief is “proportional to remaining uncertainty.” This latter assumption is mathematically equivalent to our contrast assumption but is not given the same rationale. Instead, it “reflects the intuition that completely convincing evidence
should remove all uncertainty regardless of the absolute amount; and, by
generalization, as the evidence is less convincing it should remove smaller
proportions of uncertainty” (Carlson & Dulany, 1988, p. 468). In an experiment investigating the use of circumstantial evidence when reasoning
in relation to a simulated crime scenario, Carlson and Dulany (1988) found
strong support for their postulated process concerning the way people
arrive at judgments of the convincingness of evidence. They also show
that these judgments can be used to predict how people revise beliefs
across time. As noted earlier, Ashton and Ashton (1988) formally tested
and validated our contrast assumption (and Carlson and Dulany’s
“intuition”) by measuring the size of adjustment when the same information was processed after different-sized anchors.
Limitations and Extensions
Our model is not a complete explanation of belief updating and ordereffect phenomena and it suggests a number of directions for further theoretical and empirical work. One important and interesting topic centers on
specifying how semantic content may interact with various task characteristics thereby influencing order effects in a manner unaccounted for in
our predictions (see, e.g., Benassi, 1982). Another concerns how people
deal with dependencies among different pieces of information. Imagine,
for example, that symptom X is highly diagnostic of disease Y. However,
if you knew that a person with X had already experienced the disease, the
symptom might be irrelevant because of an acquired immunity. In our
work, we have implicitly assumed that the outcomes of the coding process already include whatever conditioning the subject has done based on
prior evidence. However, this should be studied in its own right. Similarly, Schum and Martin (1982) reported that when information processed
by subjects (in a judicial context) was not in decomposed form (i.e., piece
by piece), positive evidence was sometimes evaluated as negative (and
vice versa). However, when subjects were given decomposed information
that highlighted the structure of the data, fewer errors of this type were
made. We note, parenthetically, that this issue is similar in structure to
the “change of meaning” hypothesis that has been said to account for

<-----Page 39----->40

HOGARTH

AND

EINHORN

primacy effects in impression formation (Asch, 1946). Whereas our model
shows that change of meaning is not necessary for primacy, it does seem
likely to occur when there is ambiguity concerning the evidence to be
evaluated (cf. Asch & Zukier, 1984).
Related to this issue is the problem of updating beliefs on the basis of
new but redundant evidence. While we have not dealt with this issue, we
note that Schum and Martin (1982) found that, “The most systematic
result in our study concerns the holistic tendency to ‘double-count’ corroboratively redundant testimony” (p. 144). While such “doublecounting” is consistent with our sequential anchoring-and-adjustment
model because it is assumed that memory is limited to the location of
one’s current anchor and not how this was reached, much work will be
necessary to understand how, and why, redundant information is integrated with existing beliefs.
Finally, whereas we have outlined a framework showing how task variables and processes interact in producing order effects in belief updating,
much remains to be done in studying how further procedural and task
variables affect this process. It would be illuminating, for example, to
study the effects of variables such as time pressure, different forms of
aggregated and disaggregated data presentation (see, e.g., Ashton & Ashton, 1988; Shanteau, 1970), temporal delays (see, e.g., Miller & Campbell,
1961; Insko, 1964; Luchins & Luchins, 1970; Kruglanski & Freund, 1983),
the effects of interrupting updating tasks (see, e.g., Hoch, 1984; Luchins,
1957b), expertise (Messier & Tubbs, 1990), and how roles and incentives
might affect differential sensitivity to negative and positive evidence.
For example, because the model distinguishes between sensitivity toward positive and negative evidence, it would be illuminating to investigate different combinations of the OLand p parameters. These are illustrated graphically in Fig. 7 which shows how joint attitudes toward positive and negative evidence can be characterized by regions in the a, p
space. The positions at the lower left (CL= p = 0) and upper right (01 =
p = I) corners represent, respectively, attitudes of extreme insensitivity
and sensitivity to both negative and positive evidence. To illustrate, the
parameters of someone with little or no prior information on a topic would
be expected to lie in the upper right region. However, as information
accumulates, the parameters of an unbiased person would be expected to
move down toward the lower left region. The off-diagonal regions depict
asymmetric attitudes toward positive and negative evidence. At one extreme, the lower right comer represents the position of the skeptic who is
highly sensitive to negative evidence but ignores positive evidence (a =
1, p = 0); at the other extreme, the top left corner represents the advocate
who ignores negative evidence but is highly sensitive to positive evidence
(a! = 0, p = 1).

Toward a Procedural

Theory of Judgment

In recent years, the greatest challenge to those interested in decision
making has been the extreme sensitivity of judgment and choice to seemingly minor changes in tasks (Einhorn & Hogarth, 1981; Payne, 1982).
The importance and pervasiveness of various context effects (including
framing, Tversky & Kahneman, 1981; response modes, Hogarth, 1982;
and so on) may create a view of decision making as a fragmented and
chaotic field. After all, if judgments and choices are sensitive to small
changes in tasks, what hope is there of obtaining generalizable knowledge
(cf. Cronbach, 1975)?
We believe that one answer lies in developing what Lopes (1982) has
called a “procedural theory of judgment.” That is, by focusing on the
effects of task variables on information-processing strategies, complex
behavior can be seen to arise from the interaction of simple psychological
processes with an infinitely varied environment (see also Hogarth, 1986).
Indeed, this general approach underlies our attempt to understand the
updating of beliefs.
The updating of beliefs plays an important role in many areas of psychology. We have proposed and tested a model that illustrates how a
simple psychological process, based on the sequential processing of information, can interact with task variables to produce a wide range of
judgmental effects. We view our approach as providing a bridge between
the idea that people are limited information processors, on the one hand,
and the complexity of behavior and its sensitivity to environmental
changes, on the other. Thus, our approach can be seen as an attempt to
bring “chaos” (at the level of responses), out of “order” (in the underlying processes).

Order Effects for the SbS Process when R = Sk-,
As stated in the text, order effects for the SbS process when R = Sk-. 1
always imply recency effects. We demonstrate the conditions under
which this statement holds following the proof provided in Anderson and
Hovland (1957).
Consider two evidence items, a and b, with subjective strengths s(x,)
and s(xb) where, without loss of generality, s(xJ < s(x& Define opinion
reached after processing the evidence in the order a followed by b by Sat,,
and opinion reached after processing the same information in the reverse
order by Sba. Let the order effect be defined by D = S, - Sbaand note
that recency is implied by D > 0. By successively applying Eq. (1) in the
text, we can write

s,, = s, + w,bW - Sol + watwb)

03.1)

Sba= s, + YJ~(-%)- &I + ~t&W

and

where w, and wba refer to the adjustment weights when evidence item a
is processed first and second, respectively, and wb and w,b are the analogous adjustment weights in respect of evidence item b (0 S w,, w&, wb,
w& 6 1). By subtracting Eq. (B.2) from (B.l), we obtain
D = b(x,) - ~~l[W, - w,w,b - %a]
+ b(xb) - s,l[w,, - wb + WbWbd

(B.3)

Anderson and Hovland (1957) assume that w, = Wbaand wb = w,b in
which case Eq. (B.3) can be reexpressed as
D = b(xb) - $)lw,wl,
- b(x,) - &llw,wl,

or
D = w,w,b(-$)

(B.5)

Because s(xb) > x(x3, D > 0 and recency always obtains.
We note that in our model it is not necessarily the case that w, = Wba
and that wb = w,,,. However, this assumption considerably simplifies the
algebraic proof of recency effects. In addition, the form of Eq. (B.5)

shows that the size of recency effects is proportional to the difference
between s(xJ and s(x,).
APPENDIX

C

Order Effects for the SbS Process when R = 0

Consistent evidence. For consistent evidence, no order effects are predicted by the SbS process when R = 0. To see why in the case of nkgative
evidence [s(x,J < 01, note that Eq. (7a) in the text can be rewritten in the
form
Sk = Sk-, 11 + (Ys(x/J.

Cl)

Thus when k = 2, Eq. (C.l) can be written S, = S, [l + (Ys(x2)] and
further expanded as
s, = s, [l + (Ys(x,)][ 1 + cys(xJ].

(C-2)

Since multiplication is commutative, S, is not affected by the order in
which 3(x,) and s(xJ are processed, a result that can be generalized for k
> 2. Thus, the model predicts no order effects.
In analogous fashion, the same prediction can be made for the case of
consistent positive evidence. Specifically, Eq. (7b) in the text can be
rewritten as

Sk = Sk- 1t 1 - P hJ1 + P &J,

(C.3)

which, when k = 2, can be expanded to the form
s, = &I + PU - So) Wl)

+ 4-Q) - P dqb(xJl.

(C.4)

Since both addition and multiplication are commutative, it can be seen
that the order in which s(xJ and s(xJ are processed has no effect on S,,
a result that can also be generalized for k > 2.
Mixed evidence. When processing a sequence of mixed evidence the
SbS process (with R = 0) does lead to order effects, and specifically
recency .
Consider the effects of processing a negative piece of evidence, denoted s(x-), followed by a positive piece, denoted s(x+), and then the
positive followed by the negative. Define an order effect as
D = S(-,

+) - s(+,-).

(C.3

This can be written

D = [So + w1 s(x-) + r2 s(x+)l - [So + r&x+)
= s(x+)(r2

- r,) + s(x-)(wI

- w2).

+ w2 s(x->]
(C.6)

<-----Page 49----->50

By definition, r, = B (1 - S,) and r2 = p[l - {S, + wp(x-)}] such
that (r2 - rl) = -B wIs(x-) or -S, (Y p S(L). Similarly, w1 = ci S,
and w2 = a[S, + r,s(x+)] such that (w, - w2) = -cx r,s(x+) or
-(I - S,) (YB s(x+). Substituting these values into Eq. (C.6) we obtain
D = -s(x+&
CYp S(L) - 3(x-)(1 - S&Y p s(x+)
= -a p s(x-) s(x+) > 0,

(C.7)

because s(x_) < 0.
Thus for two pieces of mixed evidence, the recency effect is the product of both sensitivity to evidence (a and p) and the subjective strengths
of the two pieces of evidence. Note also that the model predicts that the
magnitude of the recency effect is unrelated to the size of the initial
anchor (an implication that was explicitly tested and verified by Ashton
and Ashton, 1988).
