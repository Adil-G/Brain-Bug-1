We evaluate the contributions to entrepreneurial orientation (EO) in three articles: Wales,
Monsen, and McKelvie; Wiklund and Shepherd; and Morris, Webb, and Franklin, commenting
on key findings and their implications for further development of EO. We outline the potential
for a multiplicative construct of EO and future directions for research in the field of international entrepreneurship: cross-border internationalizing firms and comparative studies.

Introduction
Three decades since its conceptualization, entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is a
central component of entrepreneurship and strategy research. Seminal contributions by
Miller (1983; Miller & Friesen, 1982), Covin and Slevin (1989, 1991), and Lumpkin and
Dess (1996) have each accumulated over 1,000 citations.1 The breadth and depth of EO
scholarship enables meta-analyses; however, many key knowledge gaps remain (Rauch,
Wiklund, Lumpkin, & Frese, 2009).
We thank the special issue editors, Jeff Covin and Tom Lumpkin, for inviting us to
discuss the papers and future directions for EO research. This commentary reviews three
papers that enhance our understanding of EO: Wales, Monsen, and McKelvie (2011),
Wiklund and Shepherd (2011), and Morris, Webb, and Franklin (2011). We highlight key

<-----Page 1----->findings and implications of each article, and then offer insights for the methodological
and theoretical development of EO.

Wales, Monsen, and McKelvie
Wales et al. (2011) are concerned with two key questions: “Why might EO pervade
organizations differently?” and “How is EO typically manifest within organizations?”
They describe the potential for organizational heterogeneity of EO by hierarchy, business
units, and time and then put forward three dynamic models of EO pervasiveness in
organizations. We comment on assertions and implications related to horizontal (strategic
business unit [SBU] level) and vertical (employees) dimensions.

Manifestation of EO at the SBU Level
Wales et al. assert that “To date, researchers have commonly assumed that as an
organizational phenomenon, EO pervades organizations homogenously across all hierarchical levels and organizational sub-units, providing little or no greater theoretical justification to support this assumption.” Indeed, there are many examples of EO research
conducted at a firm rather than an SBU level. For example, in this issue, Wiklund and
Shepherd (2011) gather firm-level data among small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) with fewer than 250 employees. In another recent study, Short, Broberg, Cogliser,
and Brigham (2010) employ Computer-Aided Text Analysis (CATA), a content analysis of
shareholder letters from a sample of small, high-growth S&P 500 firms. It is likely that in
both studies, some of the sampled firms have multiple business units. Some researchers
have provided specific instructions to key informants as a way to specify which level they
should address as well as the importance of not mixing levels (unless doing a multilevel
study). Here is the set of instructions that Covin and Slevin have offered to key informants
that might be useful for other EO scholars with respect to ensuring that their data are
gathered at the business unit level:
A business unit can be defined as an organization or some part of an organization
which has its own competitive strategy. If you are a member of an independently held,
single-industry firm, the entire firm would be a business unit. However, large, diversified, multi-industry firms contain numerous business units (sometimes referred to as
subsidiaries, divisions, strategic units, etc.). If you are a member of a multi-business
unit firm, we would like you to answer the questions on the following pages in
reference to your specific business unit rather than in reference to the overall firm.

Employees’ EO
With respect to the vertical hierarchy within firms, the authors raise an excellent point
concerning nonmanagerial employees and EO. As it is accepted that nonmanagerial
employees can make or break the performance of the firm (Fey, Bjorkman, & Pavlovskaya, 2000), might employees also make or break, or at least make a major contribution to, the level of EO in the firm? Wales et al. (2011) cite several studies indicating
that compared with their managers, nonmanagerial employees have lower EOs. It is
important to note that EO should not be construed as an individual construct (Covin &
Slevin, 1991; Miller, 1983). While individuals contribute to a firm’s EO, the use of EO as
an individual construct is problematic.
974

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 2----->There are several well-developed individual-level indicators of entrepreneurial behavior such as entrepreneurial awareness, entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial
effectuation. These measures are grounded in individual-level psychological and cognitive
theories. We strongly encourage researchers to use EO at the business unit level. Future
work could incorporate multiple levels, for example investigating the relationship between
business unit-level EO and business unit employees’ individual-level entrepreneurial
awareness, self-efficacy, and effectuation.

Wiklund and Shepherd
Wiklund and Shepherd (2011) complement the extant research focus on “EO-asadvantage” (Rauch et al., 2009) with a new perspective of “EO-as-experimentation” that
accounts for a broader range of EO outcomes, including the possibility of failure. This
clever extension of EO helps push forward the frontier of EO research as we attempt to
understand the relationship of EO to distributions of outcomes. We comment on the
importance of managing EO and identifying longitudinal data.

Managing EO-as-Experimentation
Wiklund and Shepherd’s study provokes several critical questions about the exhibition and management of EO. First, in a study of 466 Swedish SMEs over a 3-year period,
Wiklund and Shepherd found that even among failed firms, levels of EO were high. What
can and cannot be inferred from this observation? It is possible that the firm exhibited high
levels of EO since start-up and that this unbridled EO led to failure. It is equally plausible
that the firm was underperforming and the exhibition of EO was a last-ditch effort to turn
things around. There are many examples of risk taking that leads to failure. One prominent
case that illustrates the danger of unbridled risk taking is British e-retailer Boo.com,
which launched in August 1999 and was placed in receivership just 8 months later after
spending $180 million, and named a top ten dot-com flop (CNET, 2011; Malmsten,
Portanger, & Drazin, 2002). From the outset, Boo.com pursued a risky strategy of
launching in multiple country markets with different languages, pricing, and taxes. An
example of EO as a last-ditch effort to turn things around is FedEx founder Fred Smith’s
actions when he learned that a Chicago bank would not provide a subsequent round of
funding to his fledgling company. Smith faced the prospect of flying home to Memphis to
tell his employees that FedEx would be forced to close. At O’Hare Airport, Smith decided
to fly to Reno to gamble FedEx’s remaining funds. In Smith’s case, the gamble paid off
(Café Hayak, 2011).
Prospect theory might be useful for explaining the results in Wiklund and Shepherd’s
research. Prospect theory describes how individuals decide between risky alternatives
with uncertain outcomes (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). According to prospect theory, an
individual evaluates a risky prospect from his or her unique reference point. Individuals
are more risk averse to potential gains and risk seeking with respect to losses. Thus, facing
failure, prospect theory suggests that managers are more likely to take a risk.
A second essential question is: Do Wiklund and Shepherd’s findings suggest that firms
should not exhibit EO—that is, that firms should not behave entrepreneurially? History is
certainly replete with examples of unsuccessful entrepreneurial actions. First movers fail
47% of the time (Tellis & Golder, 1996). Established players also fail in their entrepreneurial ventures, e.g., Crystal Pepsi, 7-Up Gold, and Diageo’s New Business Ventures

<-----Page 3----->unit. There is, however, a rich history of entrepreneurial successes. We would suggest that
such a conclusion based on Wiklund and Shepherd’s results would be inappropriate.
Although not stated directly, Wiklund and Shepherd call attention to the challenge that
firm leaders face not in exhibiting EO, but rather in managing EO.
A third critical question is: How can firms effectively manage EO? Future research
could explore how entrepreneurial initiatives can be managed through identification,
selection, adaptation, and termination processes. Such efforts can stop bad ideas quickly
and redirect financial and time resources to more promising options. Future research could
investigate the implications of business as experiments. Scholars can explore, for
example, what mechanisms should firms rely upon each time a new business experiment
is initiated? Do certain control mechanisms such as strategic funds programming and real
options support entrepreneurial success? Are there interrelationships among these mechanisms? What capabilities do firms need to build in order to manage EO?

Finding Longitudinal Data With Failures
Wiklund and Shepherd outline a number of exciting research opportunities, begging
the question: “How can we obtain empirical data to test these propositions?” From a
sample perspective, researchers have several options. First, future researchers could
collect secondhand data, for example using the CATA method. Using the terms identified
by Short et al. (2010), researchers could assemble longitudinal data from years of annual
reports, shareholder calls, and other communication. Care should be taken to focus on the
firms’ SBUs, perhaps by examining text in the annual reports’ subsections on specific
business units. A second possibility is the return to earlier data sets. In revisiting earlier
samples, researchers could identify what happened to the firms (e.g., outcomes such as
persistence or dissolution) and conduct follow-up surveys in subsequent waves. Third, EO
measures could be incorporated into existing longitudinal data efforts, for example the
Panel Study of Entrepreneurship Dynamics and Kauffman Firm Survey. The inclusion of
early-stage ventures eliminates the “left-censoring” bias (Aldrich, 1999) of focusing only
on organizations that achieved a seminal venture stage. Fourth, and as suggested by
Wiklund and Shepherd, researchers may consider gathering data from multiple case
studies. The combination of qualitative and quantitative data can be particularly powerful
for accuracy and generalizability (Shah & Corley, 2006). Finally, although Wiklund and
Shepherd’s study is based on a 3-year time period and other researchers have explored
similar time lags (e.g., Davidsson, Steffens, & Fitzsimmons, 2008), future researchers are
encouraged to gather data over a longer period. Studying EO over an extended time period
could help explore dynamic changes, such as those described in the Cyclical Wave Model
identified by Wales et al. (2011).

Morris, Webb, and Franklin (2011)
Morris et al. (2011) review existing research on EO in the nonprofit context and
suggest a new approach for capturing EO in nonprofits. Our comments on this creative
and provocative article center on the investigation of nonprofits around the world, board
membership, and other considerations for the nonprofit sector.

Nonprofits Around the World
Morris et al. anchor their call for nonprofit research in the context of the growth of the
sector in the United States. We wish to call attention to the international phenomenon as
976

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->globally nonprofits vary in their prevalence and form. The rate of social entrepreneurial
activity around the world ranges from .2% to 4.3% of the adult population, and the
nonprofit model is the most prevalent (LePoutre, Justo, Terjesen, & Bosma, forthcoming).
Furthermore, nonprofit organizations face vastly different regulatory, political, economic,
and sociocultural environments in their home countries (Anheier & Salamon, 1998;
LePoutre et al.). These distinct institutional environments may lead to different manifestations of risk taking, proactiveness, and innovativeness across countries. A related promising direction for future scholarship is the investigation of EO among organizations
devoted to sustainability.

Board Membership
The authors raise an important point related to the potentially very strong influence of
the nonprofit board on the organization’s EO position. Top management teams shape
organizational strategy and culture (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Board directors play a
critical governance role by setting strategic objectives and monitoring policies (Institute of
Directors [IOD], 2011). Future research could examine the composition of internal and
external directors. From a human capital experience perspective, are inside directors
selected to the board based on a promising business unit, or one that has already delivered,
for example, on innovation? Similarly, are outside directors appointed to the board based
on their prior entrepreneurial experience? A social capital perspective could facilitate
investigating the networks that board directors bring to the table. Researchers could
collect primary data from board meetings (e.g., Huse, 2009) as the content analysis of
conversations can yield insights into how the board views innovativeness, proactiveness,
and risk.

Other Considerations for the Nonprofit Sector
The nonprofit sector has recognized the potential value of acting entrepreneurially
(Zietlow, 2001). In consideration of the lessons from Wiklund and Shepherd (2011),
nonprofits would be ill-advised to embrace EO without reflecting on its implications.
Nonprofits must manage EO, and there is a real possibility of failure. In the United States,
for example, of the 252,000 public charities filing IRS form 990 in 2000, only 84%
survived until 2005 (National Center for Charitable Statistics [NCCS], 2011). Furthermore, a recent survey reported that 8–10% of charities are in “imminent danger” of
closing due to financial reasons (Ottenhoff, 2010). Failure can seriously impact communities as clients may have no other options from which to receive critical services.
Furthermore, many nonprofits are multibusiness organizations. For example, local
United Ways are composed of multiple certified nonprofit agencies, and many of these
nonprofits have multiple business units. Consistent with Wales et al.’s (2011) recommendations, researchers intent on investigating EO in a nonprofit setting should take care to
ensure that the nonprofit sample is composed of sole divisions or business units.

Directions for Future Research
The EO field remains a promising area for future scholarship. We wish to identify two
disparate issues pertaining to the advancement of EO. First, we discuss the potential for a
multiplicative measure of EO. We then highlight promising directions for the future
development of EO in the field of international entrepreneurship: internationalizing firms
and comparative cross-country studies.

<-----Page 5----->Multiplicative Construct
As highlighted by Wales et al. (2011) and Morris et al. (2011), there are a variety of
measures of EO. While recognizing the potential utility of the Lumpkin and Dess (1996)
conceptualization of EO, our principal focus is the Miller (1983)/Covin and Slevin (1989)
(M/CS) scale, which is the most utilized EO measure (Rauch et al., 2009). The M/CS scale
operationalizes EO as a mean of the three components: innovativeness, proactiveness, and
risk taking. Each component has 3 items, thus a 9-item scale. Despite calls by Lyon,
Lumpkin, and Dess (2000), there is “little progress” on new approaches to EO (Covin &
Wales, 2011). One means by which EO scholarship might be extended is to measure EO
as a multiplicative, rather than a mean, construct.
If evidence suggests that EO can be meaningfully conceived as the simultaneous
exhibition of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking, is it worth considering the
possibility that EO can be modeled as a multiplicative effect of the three components? We
outline the case for a multiplicative construct and provide the results of two empirical
tests. Based on the evidence presented below, operationalizing EO as a multiplicative
construct is of questionable value.
A Multiplicative View. A multiplicative construct is based on interactions among the
variables. Multiplicative constructs are commonly employed in other fields of business
research. For example, in organizational behavior, Vroom’s (1964) expectancy theory
calculates an individual’s motivation as a multiplicative function of three constructs:
valence, expectancy, and instrumentality, where valence is the emotion that people hold
about outcomes such as pay, promotion, and benefits; expectancy is the expectation/level
of confidence; and instrumentality is employees’ perception that they will get what they
deserve. Vroom’s theory predicts a variety of career outcomes including job satisfaction
and occupational choice.
The significance of the multiplicative measure is that each variable is required in order
for it to be a construct. Thus, any multiplicative measure must have dimensional interdependence and can only be composed when all items covary. In the case of EO, several
leading scholars have argued that for a firm to be entrepreneurially oriented, it must
possess and positively covary on all three dimensions. For example, in a seminal article,
Danny Miller (1983, p. 780) argues:
In general, theorists would not call a firm entrepreneurial if it changed its technology
or product line (“innovated” according to our terminology) simply by directly imitating competitors while refusing to take any risks. Some proactiveness would be
essential as well. By the same token, risk-taking firms that are highly leveraged
financially are not necessarily entrepreneurial. They must also engage in productmarket or technological innovation.
A multiplicative EO construct is calculated as I ¥ P ¥ R rather than the mean of
I + P + R. Algebraically, a multiplicative construct is the same thing as a three-way
interaction; however, there is no interpretation of the highs and lows. The interactions are
created by the product terms. Table 1 illustrates the differences in mean and multiplicative
scales with four firm examples.
The cases of Firms A, B, and C are consistent with extant research on the EO construct
as there is covariance across all three dimensions. In the case of Firm C, there is little EO
demonstrated. The case of Firm D is not commonly found—that is, a firm demonstrates
significant scores on two, but not all three, dimensions of EO. Taken together, the
multiplicative EO model demonstrates a much higher variance (from 18 to 343) than
the mean EO (from 2.67 to 7).

An Empirical Test of the Multiplicative Model. We examined the efficacy of the multiplicative EO measure using the M/CS scale with two existing databases of 86 and 148
SBU cases, respectively. Consistent with earlier work (e.g., Covin, Green, & Slevin,
2006), we investigated the relationship between EO and performance, as measured by
annual sales growth. In the first case, the traditional EO measure of the mean value of the
summated dimensions (I + P + R/3) results in a correlation of .251 (significance = .02).
The multiplicative I ¥ P ¥ R measure results in a correlation of .329 (significance = .002),
a 31% improvement. In the second data set, the traditional EO mean measure has a
correlation of .199 (significance = .015), while the multiplicative measure’s correlation is
.252 (significance = .002), a 27% improvement. Notably, in each case, the multiplicative
term explained significantly more of the variance in sales growth.
However, to empirically assess the relative predictive power of the multiplicative term
over the summated scale, all two-way interactions must be entered before the three-way
interaction. Once the two-way interactions are included, the multiplicative term is no
longer significant. Furthermore, a multiplicative construct should incorporate a true rational zero point on the measures entered (Schmidt, 1973), which EO does not have as it is
measured on a 1–7 Likert scale.
Taken together, although the multiplicative construct is consistent with theory, it does
not explain significantly more variation in performance than the traditional mean measure.
Furthermore, the multiplicative construct artificially inflates the variance of the resulting
scores, which leads to larger (inflated) correlations. This does not necessarily signify that
the construct–level relationship is stronger, but rather that the observed correlations are
larger due to the data transformation. One interpretation of Miller’s (1983) original
description of the EO construct would suggest a multiplicative operationalization.
However, compared with traditional mean score measures, multiplicative EO measures
may not explain significantly more of the variance in key performance outcomes such as
sales growth rate. Furthermore, before employing it, EO scholars should consider all the
requirements for a multiplicative measure (see Schmidt, 1973). The expectations and
demands of a multiplicative measure are stringent, and it is not apparent that additional
predictive power is gained, at least in the samples assessed here.

International Entrepreneurship
Given the ongoing development and applications of the EO construct evident in this
special issue, we believe that EO scholarship can be meaningfully extended into the field
September, 2011

979

<-----Page 7----->of international entrepreneurship as well. International entrepreneurship scholarship consists of two research fields: “one focusing on the cross-national-border (internationalization) behavior of entrepreneurial actors and another focusing on the cross-national-border
(cross-country) comparison of entrepreneurs, their behaviors, and the circumstances in
which they are embedded” (Oviatt & McDougall, 2005, p. 540). We outline opportunities
for further exploring EO in both cross-border internationalizing firms and comparative
cross-country research. Broadly speaking, there are three major conversations with
respect to EO in an international context. First, scholars use the traditional EO construct
to explore the relationship between EO and internationalization behaviors. Second, scholars have proposed an international EO construct where internationalization is inherent to
the conceptualization. Third, there is a growing stream of research that examines variation
in EO across two or more countries.
EO and the Cross-Border Internationalization of Firms. To survive and thrive in
today’s global economy, firms of all sizes may need to sell their goods and services to
overseas customers. An EO can enable a company to conduct such activities effectively.
Being entrepreneurial is “the intentional creation or transformation of an organization for
the purpose of creating or adding value through organization of resources” (Bird &
Jelinek, 1988, p. 21). An entrepreneurial act can take one of two forms: new entry (e.g.,
corporate venture, new market) or new value creation (e.g., renewal, strategic change, new
business model). In an international context, new entry implies internationalizing, for
example through exports; new value creation involves the appropriation of new value from
existing operations in international markets, for example through restructuring operations.
EO could be a correlate of either.
From a conceptual standpoint, research variously describes EO as an antecedent to
various phenomena including exporting (e.g., Ibeh & Young, 2001), internationalization
preparation (Knight, 2001), export performance (Jantunen, Puumalainen, Saarenketo, &
Kyläheiko, 2005; Mostafa, Wheeler, & Jones, 2005), and global technological competencies, unique products development, quality focus, and leveraging foreign distributor
competencies (Knight & Cavusgil, 2004). EO has also been described as both an antecedent and an outcome of firm efforts to internationalize (e.g., Ripollés-Meliá,
Menguzzato-Boulard, & Sánchez-Peinado, 2007). Extant studies find that researchers
often use the term EO to theorize and set up hypotheses, then test relationships with a
variety of measures of EO.
In terms of measuring EO, a minority of internationally related studies utilize the
“classic” M/CS scale (e.g., Mostafa et al., 2005). Most research modifies, to various
degrees, the EO scale into some type of an International Entrepreneurial Orientation (IEO)
scale. For example, Knight (2001, p. 159) describes IEO as “the firm’s overall proactiveness
and aggressiveness in its pursuit of international markets” and measures this with four
items. His subsequent work (Knight & Cavusgil, 2004) measures IEO with 12 items. Other
IEO measures include Kuivalainen, Sundqvist, and Servais (2007), who adapt a 24-item
scale to an export context. Ibeh (2004: p. 57) develops the concept “export-entrepreneurial
orientation,” which assesses firms’ “export-related innovativeness (i.e., the extent to which
they pursue new product ideas for export, consider new export markets, seek new information on exporting); proactiveness (nature of motivations regarding exporting, search for
export information, attendance at local/foreign trade fairs); and risk-taking (perceptions of
exporting risks versus opportunities, relative focus on domestic versus export markets,
relative emphasis on current export returns versus long-term marketing objectives).” Extant
IEO measures also vary by level of analysis. Some research ascribes IEO as an individual
characteristic (Nummela, Saarenketo, & Puumalainen, 2004; Weerawardena, Mort, Liesch,
980

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 8----->& Knight, 2007), while others note that IEO is strongly associated with a decision maker’s
international orientation (Ibeh, 2003). Taken together, there is no consensus around how EO
should be conceptualized in an international context, although most operationalizations
place it in an export context.
We seek to clarify that there are two ways to study EO in the international context.
First, scholars can retain the traditional measure of M/CS and look at the relationship
between EO and international processes. Jones and Coviello (2005) outline this conceptually, and empirical tests include Mostafa et al. (2005) and Ripollés-Meliá et al. (2007).
Second, scholars can modify the wording of the indicators to reflect the internationalization process, thus adopting some type of IEO measure (e.g., works by Ibeh, Knight, and
Kuvailanen highlighted above). Researchers employing the latter route need to be careful
not to employ tautological indicators.
In both cases, EO research can answer scholars’ calls for deeper advancements and
tests of theory in the broad field of internationalizing firm research (e.g., Autio, 2005;
Keupp & Gassmann, 2010). For example, with respect to the original EO construct,
scholars could examine EO as a learning mechanism (Anderson, Covin, & Slevin, 2009;
Sapienza, De Clercq, & Sandberg, 2005; Zhao, Li, Lee, & Chen, 2009), exploring how
entrepreneurial firms learn from their internationalizing efforts. For example, entrepreneurial firms that form alliances with larger, more established partners overseas may be
particularly well positioned to learn from these activities. With respect to the IEO construct, transaction costs theory investigation could explain the costs of entrepreneurial
organizations’ internationalization activities.
Furthermore, both EO and IEO research could consider a broader range of phenomena
associated with international activities. Extant research is mostly concerned with firms’
export activities. Researchers using the EO construct could examine other types of
internationalization such as offshoring back-office activities, cross-border joint ventures
and alliances, and new business models in foreign markets. With respect to the IEO
construct, scholars could operationalize the construct to reflect a wider range of international activities beyond exporting. Furthermore, the IEO construct could then be examined
in the context of a broader range of firm outcomes such as performance, diversification,
reputation, and goodwill.
Cross-Country Comparative International Studies of EO. Comparative international
entrepreneurship research involves the comparison of entrepreneurial activity in two or
more countries (Terjesen, Acs, & Audretsch, 2010). The identification of cross-country
differences can enable scholars to develop better theories that explain conditions that help
or hinder entrepreneurial activity (Terjesen, Hessels, & Li, 2011). The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor annual survey in 50+ countries finds that entrepreneurial activity varies
across nations (Bosma & Levie, 2010). Furthermore, country populations have different
perceptions of entrepreneurship, with some populations highly favorable (e.g., Ireland,
United States) and others considerably less favorable (e.g., Hungary, Japan) (Bosma &
Levie). Taken together, this suggests that the exhibition of EO will also vary across
countries. The identification of these differences might aid the development of national
policy to encourage EO in certain industries and firms. We first outline extant comparative
research in EO, highlighting gaps and inconsistencies, and suggest future research with
respect to measurement, conceptualization, theory, and context.
An emerging body of EO research advances comparative studies. For example
Marino, Weaver, and colleagues (Hansen, Deitz, Tokman, Marino, & Weaver, 2011;
Kreiser, Marino, Dickson, & Weaver, 2010; Kreiser, Marino, & Weaver, 2002; Marino,
Strandholm, Steensma, & Weaver, 2002) examine EO in SMEs in Australia, Finland,
September, 2011

981

<-----Page 9----->Greece, Indonesia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. Renko, Carsrud, and
Brännback (2009) explore EO among firms in the United States, Sweden, and Finland.
Arbaugh, Cox, and Camp (2005) investigate 1,045 small firms in Belgium, Canada, Czech
Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand,
South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. We found only two studies
(Arbaugh et al., 2005; Kemelgor, 2002) that utilize the original 9-item M/CS scale. Most
research reduces the scale to eight items, for example Marino, Weaver, and colleagues
delete one of the two items concerning aggressiveness and boldness. Although a singlecountry study, Knight’s (2001) investigation of English and French-speaking regions of
Canada uses eight items that were significantly modified from the M/CS scale. Taken
together, this research suggests a number of critical questions related to measurement and
conceptualization upon which to build the foundation for future research.
First, from a measurement perspective, this research presents the question: Should
researchers employ the M/CS scale in different countries and use those results to infer
whether EO differs across countries? If so, great care should be taken when translating the
scale. As an example of the importance of semantics, in Swedish there are two words for
entrepreneur: entreprenör and företagare. Despite the similarity in spelling and pronunciation to English, entreprenör describes a worker who is contracted out for technical
purposes, and is also used as a suffix, for example begravningsentreprenör (undertaker)
and byggentreprenör (general contractor). The Swedish word, företagaren, is a more
accurate synonym for entrepreneur and literally means “a person that does.” In Swedish,
the adjective entrepreneurial is företagsam; however, it is only applied to individuals and
is defined as “som gärna inlåter sig på företag; driftig, energisk; initiativrik” (one who
likes to engage in business, is enterprising and energetic, and is showing initiative). An
entrepreneurial firm would be described as “väldigt innovativt” (very innovative).
The Swedish example highlights the possibility that “being entrepreneurial” may
mean different things in different countries. As highlighted earlier in the discussion of a
potential multiplicative construct of EO, Danny Miller suggests that risk taking, innovativeness, and proactiveness strongly covary. It is possible that this covariance is found only
in the United States. In other countries, there may be a need to conceptualize EO
differently. For example, in Sweden, items may need to be added to address energy and
initiative. In other countries, Lumpkin and Dess’s (1996) conceptualizations of competitive aggressiveness and autonomy may be critical to fully understand EO. Scholars in
other countries might indicate that entrepreneurs are adaptive. Additionally, future EO
research should be clear about the separation between the construct and how the dimensions are measured. There may be observed variations on how the dimensions covary.
Indeed, it may be that the current EO dimensions are highly correlated in some countries
but not in others.
Existing comparative EO research could be meaningfully extended by enriching
theory. Two particularly promising lenses are institutional and cultural theory. Institutional theory could be developed to explain how national-level institutions influence
entrepreneurial activity. For example, formal (e.g., rules, laws) and informal constraints
(e.g., norms of behavior) (North, 1994) or regulative, normative, and cultural-cognitive
institutions (Scott, 1995) may drive entrepreneurial behavior. Pfeffer and Salancik’s
(1978) institutional entrepreneurship theory lens could be used to interpret how entrepreneurial initiatives shape institutions. Future institutional studies of EO should carefully
consider institutions’ dynamic changes and processes.
Culture theory offers another promising lens. As comparative EO research has
examined culture in terms of Hofstede’s dimensions (e.g., Kreiser et al., 2010; Marino
et al., 2002), future researchers could take into account the Global Leadership and

<-----Page 10----->Organizational Behavior Effectiveness measures (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, &
Gupta, 2004), which focus on cross-country differences in 9 cultural dimensions (i.e.,
performance orientation, uncertainty avoidance, humane orientation, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism, assertiveness, gender egalitarianism, future orientation, and
power distance), 6 culturally endorsed leadership theory dimensions (i.e., charismatic/
value based, team oriented, self-protective, participative, humane oriented, and autonomous) and 21 primary leadership dimensions (i.e., administratively competent, autocratic,
autonomous, charismatic/visionary, charismatic/inspirational, charismatic/self-sacrificial,
conflict inducer, decisive, diplomatic, face saver, humane orientation, integrity, malevolent, modesty, nonparticipative, performance oriented, procedural, self-centered, status
consciousness, team collaborative, and team integrator).
From a context perspective, although there is a growing body of EO research conducted around the world (Rauch et al., 2009), the majority is conducted in a handful of
developed countries (namely the United States, U.K., Australia, and Germany), neglecting
most of the world’s countries. Scholars should focus on developing economies’ firms’ EO.
For example, the Boston Consulting Group annually names the 100 most entrepreneurial
firms that are “reshaping global industries.” In the most recent list, the identified firms’
home countries include the rapidly developing economies of China, India, Brazil, Mexico,
Russia, Thailand, South Africa, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Chile,
Argentina, Egypt, and Hungary (Boston Consulting Group [BCG], 2011). By contrast,
there is limited academic research on entrepreneurial firms from these countries.

Conclusion
EO as a research concept had a rather modest start nearly 30 years ago. Because of
the large number of researchers working with it, progress has been strong and should
continue. In conclusion, we are happy to observe that EO research has experienced a
vigorous adolescence and now seems on the threshold of a new maturity. The EO
concept is widely acknowledged and, we hope for practitioners, increasingly manageable. We are grateful to the contributors to this special issue for their strong efforts to
clarify and extend the field.
