Disruptive Innovation: In Need of Better Theory
Constantinos Markides

hristensen’s (1997) original theory focused on
disruptive technologies. Over time, the same
theory has been used to explain all kinds of
disruptive innovations. This is a mistake. Different
kinds of innovations have different competitive effects
and produce different kinds of markets. They should
be treated as distinct phenomena. This article summarizes what the academic literature has to say about
two specific types of disruptive innovations—namely,
business-model innovations and radical (new-to-theworld) product innovations. It argues that even
though they share many similarities to what Christensen calls disruptive innovations, they are still
different phenomena: they create different kinds of
markets, pose radically different challenges for established ﬁrms, and have radically different implications
for managers. It is only when the topic of disruptive
innovation is broken down into these ﬁner categories
that progress can be made.
In a recent survey of the literature, Danneels (2004)
examined the theory behind disruptive technological
innovation and identiﬁed a number of issues that
require further and deeper exploration. One of these
issues is the actual definition of disruptive innovation.
It appears that despite the widespread use of the term
by both managers and academics, there is still a rather
unclear understanding of what constitutes disruptive
innovation.
In its original formulation, Christensen (1997)
focused primarily on technological innovation and
explored how new technologies came to surpass
seemingly superior technologies in a market. Over

time, Christensen widened the application of the term
to include not only technologies but also products and
business models. For example, Christensen and
Raynor (2003) list as disruptive innovations such disparate things as discount department stores; lowprice, point-to-point airlines; cheap, mass-market
products such as power tools, copiers, and motorcycles; and online businesses such as bookselling, education, brokerage, and travel agents.
Although I agree that all of these innovations are
disruptive to incumbents, treating them all as one and
the same has actually confused matters considerably.
A disruptive technological innovation is a fundamentally different phenomenon from a disruptive business-model innovation as well as a disruptive product
innovation: These innovations arise in different ways,
have different competitive effects, and require different responses from incumbents. Lumping all types of
disruptive innovations into one category simply mixes
apples with oranges, which has serious implications
on how we study disruptive innovations in the future
(Henderson and Clark, 1990).
To appreciate this point, this article summarizes
what the academic literature has to say about two
specific types of disruptive innovations—namely, business-model innovations and radical product innovations—and then demonstrates that even though both
are disruptive innovations, they nevertheless pose radically different challenges for established ﬁrms and
have radically different implications for managers.

One type of innovation that tends to be disruptive to
established competitors is business-model innovation.
In earlier work (Markides, 1997, 1998), I called this
type of innovation strategic innovation, which is a
confusing term. Business-model innovation captures

<-----Page 1----->20

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:19–25

the essence of this type of innovation without
ambiguity. Business-model innovation is the discovery of a fundamentally different business model in an
existing business. For example, Amazon and Barnes
& Noble compete in the book retail business in fundamentally different ways. Similarly, Charles Schwab,
easyJet, and Dell compete in their respective industries in substantially different ways from their competitors, such as Merrill Lynch, British Airways, and
HP (or IBM).
To qualify as an innovation, the new business model must enlarge the existing economic pie, either by
attracting new customers into the market or by encouraging existing customers to consume more.
The requirement to enlarge the market implies that
a business model innovation is much more than the
discovery of a radical new strategy on the part of a
ﬁrm. Thus, IBM’s change of strategy in the early
1990s, radical as it may have been, is not what we call
business-model innovation. On the other hand, companies such as Amazon, Schwab, Dell, Swatch, and
Southwest are considered business-model innovators
because they introduced new business models in their
respective markets that attracted new consumers (and
so enlarged their markets).
It is important to note that business model innovators do not discover new products or services; they
simply redeﬁne what an existing product or service is
and how it is provided to the customer. For example,
Amazon did not discover bookselling; it redeﬁned
what the service is all about, what the customer gets
out of it, and how the service is provided to the customer. Similarly, Swatch did not discover the watch; it
redeﬁned what this product is and why the customer
should buy it.
As shown in Table 1, new business models invade
an existing market by emphasizing different product

C. MARKIDES

or service attributes to those emphasized by the traditional business models of the established competitors. For example, whereas traditional brokers sell
their services on the basis of their research and advice
to customers, online brokers sell by promoting a different value proposition, namely, price and speed of
execution. Similarly, whereas traditional airline companies sell their product on the basis of frequency,
range of destinations, and quality of service on board,
low-cost, point-to-point operators emphasize price.
And whereas traditional business schools sell their
product on the basis of quality and career placement,
online schools like the Open University in the United
Kingdom and University of Phoenix in the United
States sell their education on the basis of ﬂexibility
and price.
Since innovators emphasize different dimensions of
a product or service, their products or services inevitably become attractive (at least originally) to a different customer from the one desiring what the
traditional competitors offer. As a result, the markets
created around the new competitors tend to be composed of different customers and have different key
success factors than the established markets.
Since the new markets have different key success
factors, they also require a different combination of
tailored activities on the part of the ﬁrm. For example,
the value chain, internal processes, structures, and the
culture that Amazon needs in place to compete successfully in the online distribution of books is demonstratively different from the one Borders or Barnes
& Noble needs to compete in the same industry using
their business model.
Not only are the new activities required different,
but also they are often incompatible with a company’s
set of activities because of various trade-offs or conﬂicts existing between the two ways of doing business.

For example, by selling its tickets on the Internet just
like its low-cost competitors, British Airways risks
alienating its existing distributors, the travel agents.
In the same way, if Unilever moves aggressively into
private label, it risks damaging its existing brands and
diluting the organization’s strong culture for innovation and differentiation. The existence of such tradeoffs and conﬂicts means that a company trying to
compete in both positions simultaneously risks paying
a huge straddling cost and degrading the value of its
existing activities (Porter, 1996). The task is obviously
not impossible, but it is certainly difﬁcult. This logic
led Porter (1980) to propose more than 20 years ago
that a company could ﬁnd itself stuck in the middle if
it tried to compete with both low-cost and differentiation strategies.
Given that (1) new business models attract different
customers from those that established companies focus on; and (2) require different and conﬂicting valuechains from the ones established companies currently
have, it should come as no surprise that incumbent
ﬁrms will, initially, have little incentive to adopt them
or to respond to them.
However, over time, the new business models improve to such an extent that they are able to deliver
performance that is sufﬁcient in the old attributes established competitors emphasize and superior in the
new attributes. At this point, even established customers begin to ﬁnd the new way interesting and begin
to switch. Inevitably, the growth of the disruptive innovation attracts the attention of established players.
As more customers—both existing and new ones—
embrace the new business model, the new business
receives increasing attention from both the media and
the established players. At a certain point, established
players cannot afford to ignore this new way of doing
business anymore, and they therefore begin to consider ways to respond to it.
Herein lies the dilemma for established ﬁrms: these
new ways of competing conﬂict with existing ways. It
is extremely difﬁcult to make the two coexist in the
same organization—hence the reason why these innovations are considered disruptive to the established
ﬁrm.

Business-Model Innovations Are Different
from Technological Innovations
It should be obvious from the discussion so far that
business-model innovations—and in particular the

J PROD INNOV MANAG

21

process by which they emerge and grow—share
many similarities with disruptive technological innovations, which Christensen’s (1997) original work
examined. The similarities between the two have led
some researchers to treat the two types of innovation
as one and the same—this is a mistake.
Over the past 10 years, several researchers have
explored business-model innovation in depth (e.g.,
Charitou, 2001; Gilbert and Bower, 2002; Hamel,
2000; Kim and Mauborgne, 1997; Markides, 1997,
1998; Slywotzky, 1996). As a result, we now know a
lot about this kind of innovation, most of which seems
to contradict the accepted wisdom on disruptive
innovation.
One of the key ﬁndings of Christensen’s work is
that disruptive technological innovations eventually
grow to dominate the market. Christensen and
Raynor (2003, p. 69) make this point forcefully by
arguing that ‘‘. . . disruption is a process and not an
event . . . it might take decades for the forces to work
their way through an industry but [they] are always at
work.’’ Similarly, Danneels (2004, p. 247) summarized
the existing theory on disruptive innovation by pointing out that ‘‘. . . disruptive technologies tend to be
associated with the replacement of incumbents by entrants.’’ If correct, such a fact carries a serious implication for incumbent ﬁrm: The only way to respond to
the disruption is to accept it and then ﬁnd ways to
exploit it. Christensen and Raynor (2003) suggested
that established companies could exploit a disruption
only by creating a separate unit.
The available literature on business-model innovation does not support such an extreme position. What
often happens in the case of a business-model innovation is that the new way of competing in the business grows—usually quickly—to a certain percent of
the market but fails to completely overtake the traditional way of competing. For example, Internet banking and Internet brokerage have grown rapidly in the
last ﬁve years but have captured only 10–20% of the
market. Similarly, budget, no-frills ﬂying as a way of
business has grown phenomenally since 1995 but has
captured no more than 20% of the total market. In
market after market, new ways of competing grow to
a respectable size but never really replace the old
ways. Nor are these innovations expected to grow in
the future to 100% of their markets.
Given such an outcome, then some of the accepted
wisdoms on disruptive innovation need to be modiﬁed. First, new business models are not necessarily
superior to the ones established companies employ,

<-----Page 3----->22

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2006;23:19–25

a fact implying that it is not necessarily an optimal
strategy for an established company to abandon its
existing business model in favor of something new or
to grow the new model alongside its existing business
model. The decision should be based on a careful costbeneﬁt analysis and would depend on the specific circumstances of the ﬁrm as well as the nature of the
innovation.
In his article in this issue, Christensen takes exception to this by arguing, ‘‘. . . I had simply assumed that
the objective function of management should be to
maximize shareholder value. If survival is instead the
objective function, then quite possibly inaction is a
good course of action.’’ In other words, if a ﬁrm
chooses not to imitate the disruption or chooses to
destroy it, then it must be doing so to survive rather
than to maximize shareholder value. This is an
interesting point, but no theoretical reason or empirical evidence exists to suggest that any action
other than imitation is value destroying. In fact,
Charitou and Markides (2003) demonstrated that
in deciding how to respond to disruptive businessmodel innovations, incumbent ﬁrms have several
options at their disposal. Most of these, including
the ‘‘disrupt-the-disruptor’’ strategy that companies
like Swatch have adopted, are indeed value enhancing.
The truth of the matter is that established companies would simply ﬁnd most of these innovations
unattractive—and not for the reasons articulated in
Christensen (1997), though they undoubtedly play a
role. Rather, most of these business-model innovations
simply do not make economic sense for established
companies. In its efforts to grow, the established ﬁrm
has many other alternatives to consider, including
investing its limited resources in adjacent markets or
taking its existing business model internationally.
Given its other growth options—and given its limited resources—the decision to invest in the disruption
may rank low on its priority list.
The academic literature suggests three exceptions
to this generalization. Specifically, established ﬁrms
would, on average, ﬁnd it advantageous to create disruptive business-model innovations in the following
circumstances:
(1) When they enter a new market where entrenched
competitors have ﬁrst-mover advantages (e.g.,
Canon entering the copier market). In such a
case, the new entrant must attack by breaking
the rules (Markides, 1997; Porter, 1985).

C. MARKIDES

(2) When their current strategy or business model
is clearly inappropriate and the ﬁrm is facing
a crisis (e.g., Kresge introducing the discount
retail concept in the 1960s and renaming itself
K-Mart)
(3) When they are attempting to scale up a new-tothe-world product to make it attractive to the
mass market (Markides and Geroski, 2005) (This
situation is discussed in the next section.)
A second sacred cow regarding disruptive innovations is that the best way for an established company
to adopt and to exploit such innovations is through a
separate unit. Presumably, this is the best way to
overcome the inherent conﬂicts between the established business and the innovation. Yet, as argued
elsewhere (Markides and Charitou, 2004), established
companies could exploit disruptive strategic innovations in a number of ways, and they do not necessarily
have to use a separate unit to do so.
Finally, even if the disruptive innovation is not superior to the established business model, incumbents
need to ﬁnd a way to respond to it. However, response
does not necessarily mean that they have to adopt it.
They could respond to the innovation not by adopting
it but by investing in their existing business to make
the traditional way of competing even more competitive relative to the new way of competing. Incumbents even have the option of counterattacking the
innovators by trying to disrupt the disruptors. The
different response options available to established
ﬁrms were explored in Charitou and Markides (2003).

Radical Product Innovations
A second type of innovation that tends to be disruptive to the established competitors is radical innovation, which creates new-to-the-world products (e.g.,
the car, television, personal computers, VCRs, mobile
phones). Radical innovations are disruptive to consumers because they introduce products and value
propositions that disturb prevailing consumer habits
and behaviors in a major way. They are disruptive
to producers because the markets they create undermine the competences and complementary assets on
which existing competitors have built their success.
Because they are disruptive to both consumers and
producers, these innovations are rarely driven by
demand. Instead, they result from a supply–push
process originating from those responsible for

<-----Page 4----->DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION: IN NEED OF BETTER THEORY

developing new technologies (Markides and Geroski,
2005).
The available academic evidence (e.g. Klepper and
Simons, 2000; Utterback, 1994) shows that markets
emerging as a result of supply–push processes share
certain characteristics:
 Despite enormous technological and product uncertainty, newly created markets are invaded by
hordes of new entrants, sometimes numbering in
the hundreds. Amazingly, this surge in ﬁrm population happens well before the new market starts
growing.
 Not only is the new market ﬂooded with hundreds
of new entrants, but product variety in the young
market also surges to amazingly high levels. In
fact, the rate of innovation at the start of a market’s life is the highest this market will ever see.
 Eventually, the wave of entry subsides and in turn
is followed by what is sometimes a sharp, sudden,
and very sizeable shakeout leading to the death of
most of the early pioneers. The shakeout is associated with the emergence of a dominant design in
the market, which signals the beginning of growth
in the industry.
 All of this takes a long time to unfold. Thus, the
structure of new markets remains remarkably
ﬂuid throughout most of the early years, and
many more ﬁrms come and go than are left operating in the market when its structure ﬁnally settles
down.
The end result of this is that the early pioneers that
create these new-to-the-world markets are very rarely
the ones that scale them up from little niches to big,
mass markets. The companies that eventually scale up
new markets jump into the market right before the
dominant design emerges. But jumping in at the right
time is not enough to conquer the market. The eventual winners not only time their entry into the market
to perfection, but they also undertake a series of actions that grows the market from a niche into a mass
market. Typically, this involves making heavy investments in exploiting scale economies, traveling down
learning curves, developing strong brands, and controlling the channels of distribution to the mass market.
One of the strategies these latecomers use to scale
up a market and steal it away from the early pioneers
is similar to the process disruptive innovators use
to upset established competitors (as described by
Christensen, 1997). In particular, whereas early pioneers emphasize the technical attributes of the prod-

J PROD INNOV MANAG

23

uct, latecomers shift the basis of competition away
from technical performance to other product attributes such as quality and price by cutting the price
of the product to a mass-market level while simultaneously improving the quality of the product to make
it acceptable to the average consumer. All of a sudden, the product becomes attractive to the mass market, and rapid growth follows.
The irony is that in many cases, a late entrant captures the market even when their product is not as
good as the products of the early pioneers. This
happens for two reasons. First, as a result of the efforts of the early pioneers, the new product improves
in performance to levels that either are good enough
or even surpass customer needs. At that stage, any
additional investments to improve the performance
of the product further are not really necessary. But
the early pioneers cannot help themselves: Their
engineering cultures go to work, and sure enough,
more and more money goes into research and
development (R&D) to improve the product further
and to add to its functionality. All of this occurs
even with the full realization that their customers do
not need—nor will they ever use—the added functionality.
Product overengineering is linked to a second
change taking place: The extra investments and incremental additions to the product’s performance do
not come for free. The rising costs lead to rising prices. The high price, in turn, limits the attraction of the
product to a small segment made up of technology
enthusiasts and early adopters.
The combination of these two factors gives latecomers their chance to move in and steal the market
away. They know that all they have to do is to produce a product good enough in performance but
cheaper than what is on the market now. Their product may not be as good as the product of the pioneers,
but this does not really matter. The early adopters are
not attracted to these inferior products, but the average consumer is. To them, this product is good
enough and cheap. Over time, the consolidators may
improve the performance of their product to such an
extent that even the technically astute customers begin
to ﬁnd them attractive—and so switch. However, this
is not absolutely necessary. As long as they control the
mass market, the consolidators are happy to leave a
few little niches for other competitors to feed on.
Their overriding objective is to make a product that is
not necessarily the best—just one good enough in
performance and superior in price.

<-----Page 5----->24

Radical Product Innovations Are Different
from Technological Innovations
Note again the similarities of this scaling-up process
to the disruptive innovation process Christensen
(1997) described. In fact, many of the examples of
disruptive innovations that Christensen and Raynor
(2003) use in their book (e.g., Black and Decker power
tools, Honda motorcycles, Canon copiers, Seiko
watches) are really examples of companies scaling
up a niche market into a mass market. Therefore, if
established companies want to achieve this kind of
disruptive innovation, the way to do it is not as described in Christensen and Raynor (2003).
Markides and Geroski (2005) described how established companies could exploit such disruptive
product innovations. Their thesis is that established
companies should not even attempt to create such innovations but should leave the task of creating these
kinds of markets to small, start-up ﬁrms that have the
requisite skills and attitudes to succeed at this game.
Established ﬁrms should, instead, concentrate on
what they are good at—consolidating young markets
into big, mass markets.
Practically speaking, what this means is that instead of spending valuable resources and managerial
talent at growing new radical businesses inside,
established companies should aim to create, sustain,
and nurture a network of feeder ﬁrms—of young,
entrepreneurial ﬁrms busy colonizing new niches.
Through its business development function, the
established company could serve as a venture capitalist to these feeder ﬁrms. Alternatively, it could develop formal strategic alliances with them or even
could maintain minority equity stakes in them.
Then, when it is time to consolidate the market, it
could build a new mass-market business on the
platform these feeder ﬁrms have provided. Since the
younger ﬁrms do not have the resources, power,
marketing, and distribution to scale up their creations, they should, in principle, be happy to subcontract this activity to the bigger ﬁrms, subject to a fair
division of the spoils.
This might strike some people as too radical of an
idea, but it is in fact a widely accepted business model
in industries where companies live and die on their
ability to continuously bring creative new products to
the market—industries such as music and book publishing, Hollywood movies, theater plays, and art
galleries. If this organization of work functions well
in such creative industries, should we not at least

C. MARKIDES

attempt to import it into other industries that aspire
to become more creative?
Again, the point is not to suggest that this is a riskfree or trouble-free strategy for big companies to create disruptive new markets. Rather, I simply highlight
how radically different this suggestion is from what is
found in the disruptive innovation literature (e.g.,
Christensen and Raynor, 2003). What big established
companies need to do to achieve this kind of disruptive innovation (i.e., radical product innovation) is
fundamentally different from what they have to do to
achieve either business-model innovation or technological innovation.

In Need of Finer Categories
The basic thesis of this article is that not all disruptive
innovations are the same. In particular, I propose
that technological, business-model, and new-to-theworld product innovations should be treated as distinct phenomena. All three types of innovation may
follow a similar process to invade existing markets
and may have equally disruptive effects on incumbent
ﬁrms, but at the end of the day they produce different
kinds of markets and have different managerial implications. It is only when the topic of disruptive innovation is broken down into these ﬁner categories
that progress can be made.
