ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO DECISION MAKING
UNDER RISK:
MOMENTS VERSUS RISK DIMENSIONS'
JOHN W. PAYNE2
University of California, Irvine
The literature in the area of individual decision making under risk may be characterized by two different approaches to the description of gambles. The first approach
describes gambles as probability distributions over sets of outcomes. Models of
decision making developed within this approach have concentrated on the moments
of the distributions as the primary determinants of risky decision behavior. The
second approach describes gambles as multidimensional stimuli which may be conceptualized in terms of basic risk dimensions, such as probability of winning, amount
to win, probability of losing, and amount to lose. This approach views risky decision
behavior as a form of information processing. The relative merits of explanations
derived from each approach are discussed. It is argued that the risk dimension approach appears more promising than that based on moments of the underlying
probability distribution.

The purpose of this paper is to present an those most commonly incorporated in decision

Variance and skewness are not strictly the second
and third moments of a distribution. More precisely,
variance is the second moment about the mean and

skewness is often defined in terms of a function of the
third moment about the mean. However, since Coombs
and Pruitt (1960), the term "moment" has been used
when referring to variance and skewness in studies of
decision making. This convention will be followed in
this paper.

tion-processing approach to human behavior.
The first implication involves the research
strategies and goals to be employed. Research
in risky decision behavior should be directed
towards the correct identification of the sources
of information and the processes used to combine information from these sources into a
decision. The emphasis is placed on how a particular decision came about. Newell (1968)
pointed to this emphasis as one important
characteristic of the representation, of human
behavior in terms of an information-processing
model. This emphasis on understanding what
a subject is actually doing can be viewed as
opposed to an emphasis on the description of
his observable behavior. The view that the
goal of psychology is description has been
argued by Bourne (1969):
The task of psychology is to ascertain which objective
factors in the past and present states of the organism
and his environment make a difference in how he behaves, so that behavior can be described and predicted
rather than merely attributed to another process
[pp. 175-176].

This distinction has also been referred to as one
of description versus explanation (Green,
1968). Green posed a basic question about
models, "the extent to which an adequate description of the data provides an adequate explanation of the process generating the data
[p. 97]." The orientation of this review is to
evaluate models of decision making not only
on the basis of their ability to describe the statistical properties of a set of data, but on the
ability of each model to provide an explanation
of the psychological processes which led to the
observed data.
The acceptance of an information-processing
view of behavior has also involved an assumption about the form of the processes. Processing
rules and strategies have been described as
being heuristic in nature. Heuristic processes
are problem-solving methods which tend to produce
efficient solutions to difficult problems by restricting
the search through the space of possible solutions, on
the basis of some evaluation of the structure of the
problem [Braunstein, 1972, p. 520].

Simon and Newell (1971) have proposed that
the central process in human problem solving
is the use of heuristic methods to carry out
highly selective searches of problem spaces.
The conceptualization of risky decision behavior as a form of information processing also

implies that this behavior is not fundamentally
different from other forms of judgment behavior, such as choices among careers, stocks,
graduate school applicants, or even perceptual
judgments. Many of the generalizations arrived
at from studies of information utilization in
other types of judgment may apply to risky
decision behavior. For example:
1. The way in which the sources of information are displayed affects their utilization.
2. The method of response will affect the
utilization of information.
3. Individuals find it difficult to process
information and therefore employ decision
strategies designed to reduce the informationprocessing load.
EXPECTATION MODELS
Early theoretical approaches to choice
among risky alternatives were centered about
two concepts. The first was that people choose
the "best" alternative. This concept has been
used to support the validity of an approach
that starts from a normative model of behavior
(Edwards, 1971). The second concept involved
the principle of mathematical expectation
developed from early mathematical studies of
probability. The expectation of a probability
distribution refers to that value of the distribution which could be expected to occur
over the long run. The combination of these
two concepts may be seen in what is perhaps
the earliest theory of decision making under
risk, that of maximization of expected value.
The expression for expected value (EV) is:
£F = £ pa,
i=l

where vt is the value of the tth outcome and pi
is the likelihood or probability of the ith outcome. The role of mathematical expectation in
this model is clear. The concept of choosing the
best alternative is reflected in the idea of
maximizing. Since it seemed reasonable to
assume that more value will always be preferred to less value, it was argued that the
alternative with the greater EV would always
be chosen. The EV model further implied that
people would seek alternatives with positive
EV, avoid alternatives with negative EV, and
be indifferent between alternatives with equal
EV. Human behavior clearly contradicted

<-----Page 2----->DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK

these implications of the EV model. Moreover,
the contradictions involved the failure of the
model to account for the behavior of "any reasonable man" when faced with a number of
decision problems, such as the St. Petersburg
paradox, the purchasing of insurance, and
gambling (Coombs et al., 1970).
It has often been argued that this evidence
contradicting the EV theory accrues from
special cases and that in the large majority of
decisions, EV maximization is an appropriate
description of human behavior. Lichtenstein,
Slovic, and Zink (1969) explored the effects of
variations in EV on a person's choices among
gambles when the use of EV in decision making
was clearly encouraged. The gambles were of
the form (a,p), where a is the amount to be
won and p is the probability of winning. The
subjects were asked to select the gamble they
would most prefer to play from each of two sets
of gambles which displayed only the probabilities of winning and the amounts to be won.
They were then instructed in the meaning of
EV and asked to choose a gamble in each of the
two additional sets, with the EV for each
gamble clearly displayed. The choices were far
from optimal in terms of maximizing EV. The
authors concluded that "The majority of 5s
found EV irrelevant as a guide to action, even
when the concept was carefully explained and
clearly displayed for them [p. 236]."
Motivated by the early recognition of the
deficiencies of the EV model, Bernoulli (1738)
proposed a model of decision making in which
a utility function was substituted for monetary
values, the expected utility (-EC/) model. The
EU of an alternative is given by:
EU = E piUfa),
»-i
where U(vi) is the utility of the ith outcome.
One great advantage of the EU theory, and
one of the main reasons why Bernoulli proposed such a theory, is that it allows individuals
to have different utilities for outcomes and
hence different preferences among risky alternatives. Unfortunately for the development
of the EU model as a descriptive model of
human behavior, the diminishing marginal
utility function which Bernoulli proposed made
even such common behavior as betting on a
mathematically fair game of chance an "irra-

441

tional" act. It was not until much later that a
utility function capable of accounting for both
gambling and the purchasing of insurance was
suggested (Friedman & Savage, 1948).
The modern form of EU theory was first
developed by von Neuman and Morgenstern
(1947). The theory was presented as a set of
axioms designed to lead to numerical utilities
measurable up to a linear transformation. The
authors prescribed that when dealing with alternatives involving only chance, the player's
judgment must be directed solely by the mathematical expectation. Arrow (1951) has referred to this model as an "axiomatic treatment of choice among probability distributions [p. 405]."
While some empirical support was found for
the EU model (Hosteller & Nogee, 1951),
acceptance of the model was not universal.
Edwards (1955) made the observation that
"If it is reasonable to assume that subjective
values of money should be substituted for objective values . . . it is equally reasonable to
make the same assumption about probabilities
Q). 201]." He then proposed that people choose
among risky alternatives, so as to maximize
subjectively expected utility (SEU). The SEU
of an alternative is given by:

SEU = ZS(pi)U(vi),
where S(pi) is the subjective probability corresponding to the objective probability of the
tth outcome. An extensive presentation of an
SEU model, from a more prescriptive viewpoint, has been provided by Savage (1954).
Tversky (1967) has provided an intensive
analysis of a special case of this model. The
^analysis involved the simplest case of risky
choice behavior: choice among gambles of the
form (a,p). For these simple gambles, Tversky
showed that the fundamental condition for the
SEU model "is that utility and subjective
probability contribute independently to the
overall 'worth' of a gamble [p. 178]." While
Tversky showed this condition to be necessary
and sufficient for the SEU model of decision
making, two additional assumptions are usually
made:
1. There is no utility for gambling.
2. The subjective probabilities of complementary events sum to unity.

<-----Page 3----->442

JOHN W. PAYNE

Tversky (1967) reported experimental data
which supported the independence principle
but could not simultaneously support the two
additional assumptions. If the principle of no
utility for gambling was accepted, then in
order to fit the data, the notion that subjective
probabilities of complementary events sum to
one had to be rejected. Conversely, if the
complementary notion was accepted, utility
could not be risk invariant. Further support
for the independence principle was found in a
study by Wallsten (1971). Wallsten also tested
the assumption that probability estimates by
individuals would be identical to their subjective probabilities inferred from SEU theory.
The results showed the obtained estimates to
differ from the inferred subjective probabilities.
The differences were small, but statistically
significant.
These three theories of decision making—
EV, EU, and SEU—are often referred to as
expectation models. Each theory combines the
two basic concepts previously mentioned:- (a)
the idea that people choose the "best" alternative, a concept used to justify the search
for some rational measure of best, and (6) the
principle of mathematical expectation, as the
measure of best. The differences among the
theories lie in the restrictions which are placed
on the forms of the two main components of
each model, value and probability. Central to
these expectation models is the explicit acceptance of some form of description of risky
alternatives as probability distributions over
sets of outcomes. Choice among such alternatives or distributions is then assumed to be
made on the basis of some function of each
distribution's central tendency.
Evaluation of the research aimed at testing
expectation theories of decision making yields
a mixed conclusion. Models of this type have
been reasonably successful in overall predictions of decisions among gambles (Coombs,
Bezembinder, & Goode, 1967), but provide
limited information concerning the detailed
processes by which these decisions are actually
made. Edwards (1955) pointed this out when
he introduced the SEU model of decision
making:
This model, like the others, does not assert that 5s
know the SEU values of various bets and deliberately
choose the bet with the largest SEU; it asserts only
that the hypothesis of SEU maximization will enable

an E to predict the choices that 5 will actually make
[p, 202].

A similar rationale for an SEU theory of
decision making under risk has been offered by
Krantz, Luce, Suppes, and Tversky (1971).
A number of recent studies have provided
evidence of decision behavior which cannot be
accounted for by any expectation model.
Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971) and Lindman
(1971) asked subjects to evaluate gambles by
means of both a choice procedure and a bidding
procedure. The bidding procedure involved
the subject equating a gamble with an amount
of money such that he would be indifferent
between the option of playing the gamble or
receiving the amount of money. The gambles
used in both studies were of the form (a,p,b),
where the player would'win amount a with
probability p, or lose amount b with probability 1 —p. In both of these studies it was
found that subjects would often indicate
greater preference for one gamble when a
choice procedure was used and bid more for
another gamble when a bidding procedure was
used. Choices in the experiments tended to be
of the gamble with the higher probability of
winning. The higher bids were made for the
gambles with the larger amounts to win. As
Lichtentstein and Slovic pointed out, such
behavior is clearly inconsistent with any expectation theory of decision making:
For example, subjectively expected utility theory
(Edwards, 1955) postulates both a subjective probability function and a subjective worth function, but
does not allow either function to change its shape as the
response mode changes Cp. 54].

Tversky (1969) has also demonstrated decision behavior which cannot be accounted for
by the expectation models. Tversky investigated a consequence of expectation models,
referred to as transitivity. The transitivity
principle states that if x > y and y > z then
x > z, where > stands for the relationship
preferred to or indifferent between. Gambles of
the form (a,p) were displayed on a card showing the payoff a and a disc divided into black
and white sectors. The probability of winning,
p, corresponded to the relative size of the black
sector. The probabilities of winning were 7/24
to 11/24 in increments of 1/24. The amounts
ranged from $4.00 to $5.00 in increments of
$.25. It was hypothesized that at least some
subjects would ignore small probability differ-

<-----Page 4----->DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK

ences and choose on the basis of the amount to
win, but when the probability differences were
large, these subjects might choose on the basis
of the probabilities. Tversky was able to demonstrate consistent and predictable intransitivity of preferences for these gambles. Similar
results were obtained in a second experiment
involving choices among profiles of college
applicants.
VARIANCE, SKEWNESS, AND RISK
While most of the work on decision making
under risk has focused on the central tendency
or first moment of a probability distribution,
the second moment, variance, and the third
moment, skewness, have also been suggested
as variables affecting decision behavior. The
strategy of researchers investigating these
higher moments may be contrasted to that of
the researchers who have concentrated on
utility and subjective probability versions of
the EV model. In the latter case, the problem
of improving the descriptive validity of the EV
model has been attacked by loosening the restrictions on the forms of the value and probability components. For the former researchers,
the strategy has involved maintaining the basic
expectation model, but improving its predictive power by adding additional moments of
the underlying probability distribution. These
researchers seem to have pretty much followed
a suggestion of Tinter's (1942):
Starting with the assumption that the individual is
only guided by the central tendency, let us try to explain
his behavior by assuming that he simply tries, e.g., to
maximize the mathematical expectation or the weighted
arithmetic mean of the utilities. More complicated
models would take the dispersion, the skewness, the
kurtosis and other features of the probability distribution into account [p. 304].

One of the first uses of higher moments of
the probability distribution in the psychological study of preference was in variance preference models. Such models suggest that choices
among alternative gambles are based not only
on maximization of expectation, but to a large
degree on the dispersion of the possible outcomes. This concept has been used as equivalent to a utility for gambling or risk (Royden,
Suppes, & Walsh, 1959). In one of the most
significant studies in this area, Coombs and
Pruitt (1960) found both variance and skewness preferences. Approximately one-third of

443

their subjects preferred high variance gambles,
one-third preferred intermediate variance gambles, and one-third preferred low variance
gambles. The ideal degree of skewness for the
subjects seemed to be at either one end or the
other of the skewness scale. There was evidence of an interaction between skewness and
variance. A greater degree of variance was
preferred at a subject's ideal skewness level.
Coombs and Pruitt suggested an alternative
to the maximization of EU model, where
"while £ will always prefer more expectation
(other things being equal), he may have a
utility for risk which will exhibit itself as a
preference for certain amounts of variance and
skewness [p. 276]."
Lichtenstein (1965) investigated the effects
of the first four moments of a gamble's underlying probability distribution on subject's
judgment of the attractiveness of a gamble.
Bidding responses were related to EV and
variance but not to skewness or the fourth
moment, kurtosis. The finding that skewness
had no effect is contrary to the results of the
Coombs and Pruitt (1960) study. Another
contradictory result was that most subjects
seemed to prefer low variance. This difference
in results may have been due to a difference in
motivating conditions in the two studies. The
subjects in the Lichtenstein study actually
played a proportion of the gambles for real
money. Lichtenstein suggested that "The fears
of losing money under such conditions may
account for the avoidance of the riskier, high V
bets [p. 168]."
Recently, there has been increased interest
in the concept of risk and its role in determining preferences among gambles (Coombs
& Bowen, 1971; Coombs & Huang, 1970a,
1970b; Coombs & Meyer, 1969; Pollatsek,
1971; Pollatsek & Tversky, 1970). The work
by Coombs and his associates has been centered around an alternative to subjective expectation theories of individual decision making in risky situations called portfolio theory.
Portfolio theory starts with the description of
risky alternatives as probability distributions
over money. The theory is presented by
Coombs and Huang (1970b) in terms of three
assumptions. The first assumption states that
a risky alternative is characterized by its EV
and perceived risk. The second assumption
states that the preference function over a set

<-----Page 5----->444

JOHN W. PAYNE

of gambles equal in EV will be a single-peaked
function over risk. This assumption implies an
ideal level of risk for each subject at each level
of EV. The third assumption states that, in
choosing among gambles which differ in EV,
the subject will maximize EV if these gambles
all deviate equally from their respective ideal
levels of risk. Portfolio theory does not provide a definition of risk. Tests of this theory
have been conducted by making certain ad hoc
assumptions about risk. Experimental support
for predictions .derived from these assumptions
are then taken as support for portfolio theory.
For example, Coombs and Meyer (1969) assumed that the risk of playing a gamble increases with the value of the payoffs. The
gambles were ofithe form (D,|,—Z)) where D
represents the denomination of the coin to be
won or lost. An additional variable was the
number of times a gamble was played, N.
Subjects expressed preferences among gambles
arranged in sets, with each set having either a
fixed D or a fixed N. The results provided overall support for the hypothesis that "subjects'
choices are mediated by a single-peaked preference function over a unidimensional risk scale
[p. 523]." It was suggested that, at least for
the simple gambles used in that experiment,
"risk is monotonic with some measure of dispersion in possible gambling outcomes [p.
525]." However, the results indicated an unpredicted relationship between the particular
set of games from which the subject chose,
either a fixed D or a fixed 2V, and the values of
the ideal games from those sets. Coombs and
Meyer suggested that the subjects may have
been adopting two different decision rules for
evaluating risk, depending on whether D or N
was fixed.
A similar test of portfolio theory was conducted by Coombs and Huang (1970b). They
used gambles of the form (a,%,b), where a > b.
The subjects were asked to indicate their
preference orderings among sets of these
gambles. While the results generally supported
portfolio theory, there was one unpredicted
finding of particular interest. The proportion
of violations of pair-wise preference orderings
based on maximizing EV was greater for pairs
of gambles lying above the ideal level of risk
than below the ideal level. Coombs and Huang
suggested that the indifference curves in an
individual's preference space may have been

steeper below the ideal than above. There is
another possible interpretation. Subjects may
have been employing different decision strategies in choosing among pairs of gambles depending upon whether the pairs were above or
below the ideal crest level of risk. Such an interpretation would seem consistent with the
explanation offered by Coombs and Meyer
(1969) to account for their failure to find consistent risk functions across sets of gambles.
Coombs and Huang (1970a) attempted to
develop a structure of perceived risk which
could lead directly to the measurement of risk
by examining the effects of three transformations on simple gambles on an individual's perception of the riskiness of those gambles. The
distributive model was assumed to govern the
joint effect of these transformations. The
gambles were of the form (y,p,z), where y > z
and p = %. The first transformation involved
adding an amount a to y and subtracting the
amount (p/q)a, where q = 1 — p, from z. Such
a transformation preserves EV. The second
transformation involved adding a positive
amount b to both outcomes y and z. This transformation increases the EV of the original
gamble by the amount b. The third transformation involved repeated independent plays of
the gamble. The EV for a gamble played repeatedly would be the EV for a single play
multiplied by the number of plays. The original
gamble used in constructing transformed gambles was defined as (0,/>,0). The subjects were
asked to independently rank order a large set
of single gambles from most to least risky. Perceived riskiness increased as the size of the
amount a in the first transformation increased.
Riskiness was perceived to decrease as b increased in the second transformation. The
data generally supported the idea that the
effect of the third transformation, multiple
play, was to merely enhance the joint effect
of the other two transformations. Such a finding is consistent with the distributive model.
It was concluded that substantial support was
found for a distributive rule governing the
joint effects of the three transformations
studied.
The Coombs and Huang (1970a) study provided empirical support for an explicit theory
of risk developed by Pollatsek and Tversky
(1970). The theory is formulated in terms of:

<-----Page 6----->DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK

1. A set, S = {A,B,C,. . .} of risky options
characterized as probability distributions.
2. A binary operation of convolution, denoted by the symbol °.
3. A binary relation of comparative risk
denoted >.
A risk system is then denned in terms of a
set of axioms similar to those of extensive measurement (Krantz et al., 1971). A very strong
and interesting theorem results from these
axioms:
Theorem: If (S, °, >) is a regular risk system, then there exists a unique 0 < 6 < 1
such that for all A, B in S (with finite expectations and variances) A > B if and
only tt~R(A)>R(B) where R(A) =
6V(A) - (1 - 6)E(A).
Thus, the risk of an alternative, R(A), is solely
a linear function of mean, E(A), and variance, V(A). Pollatsek and Tversky showed
that this result would imply the distributive
model investigated by Coombs and Huang
(1970a). However, as Pollatsek and Tversky
pointed out, the theory may be too restrictive.
For example, skewness may turn out to systematically affect the perception of risk. If this
is the case, they suggested restricting their
theory to symmetric or equally skewed options.
The possibility that skewness may be a relevant variable in the perception of risk was investigated as part of a study by Coombs and
Bowen (1971) using rank-order judgments of
the perceived riskiness of gambles. They found
that, with expectation and variance controlled,
about two-thirds of their subjects regarded
gambles with positive skewness as more risky
than gambles with negative skewness. This
result would seem to limit the applicability of
the Pollatsek and Tversky (1970) theory of
risk, or any theory in which perceived riskiness
depends solely on a gamble's expectation and
variance.
Some of the relationships of variance and
skewness preferences to the EU and SEU
models are discussed by Pollatsek (1971). He
presented two theorems which show that the
EU model is inconsistent with single-peaked
preference functions on l both skewness and
variance and the SEU model is inconsistent
with single-peaked preference functions on both
skewness and range.

Evaluation of the research on variance and
skewness preferences, or on risk, yields as
mixed a conclusion as did the evaluation of the
expectation theories of decision making. The
conclusion to a review by Rapoport and Wallsten (1972) of the recent work on risk seems
highly appropriate.
In summary, it seems that the concept of risk is psychologically meaningful but highly elusive. Expected
value, variance, number of independent plays, probabilities of winning and losing, and other transformations of two-outcome gambles all affect the perceived
riskiness of gambles in one way or another, making the
development of a satisfactory theory of risk a very
difficult task [p. 145].

RISK DIMENSIONS
Slovic and Lichtenstein (1968b) recently
suggested an alternative to descriptions of
gambles based on moments of the underlying
probability distributions. They characterized
a gamble as a multidimensional stimulus which
"can be described by its location on four basic
risk dimensions—probability of winning (Pw),
amount to win ($w), probability of losing (Pi),
and amount to lose ($1) Qx 1]." A primary
characteristic of this approach is the distinction
between explicit probabilities and amounts and
implicit or underlying values. Models .based on
the moments make no clear distinction. A
subject's failure to utilize the values of the
underlying probability distribution is handled
as error. In contrast, the approach based on
the risk dimensions views the explicit probabilities and amounts as the critical variables
governing the subject's decision processes. In
attempting to understand the relative influence
of these basic risk dimensions on decision behavior, Slovic and Lichtenstein have emphasized the idea of "importance beliefs" and
information-processing considerations. By importance beliefs they mean that an individual
might pay more attention to a particular risk
dimension because he believes that dimension
to be more important than some other in a particular decision situation. The emphasis on
information-processing considerations suggests,
among other things, that decisions may be
affected by limitations on the ability of an
individual to act on the basis of those importance beliefs when processing the information
that describes a gamble.
To test their hypotheses, Slovic and Lichtenstein (1968b) carried out a series of experi-

Association, Inc., 1968.)

ments involving special gambles, called "duplex
gambles." Figure 1 shows an example of a
duplex gamble.
To play the gamble, the subject would have
to spin a pointer associated with each pie diagram. They proposed that this form of gamble
would eliminate the normal confounding of a
gamble's probabilities and allow for the independent varying of the four basic risk dimensions of a gamble. In the usual two-outcome
gamble, PI is necessarily equal to 1 — Pw. A
duplex gamble allows the displayed values of
Pw and PI to be varied independently.
In their main experiment, four groups of
subjects were asked to judge the attractiveness
of a number of duplex gambles. One group used
a rating procedure; each of the other three
groups used some variation of a bidding
method. A regression analysis indicated a large
difference in the weights attached to each risk
dimension both within and between subjects.
On the average, the highest correlation between
a subject's responses and one of the four risk
dimensions was twice the size of the lowest correlation. Ratings correlated more highly with
Pw than with any other- dimension, while the
bidding responses correlated most highly with
the payoff dimensions, particularly $1. Slovic
and Lichtenstein (1968b) suggested that since
a bid is expressed in terms of money, a subject
may have found it easier to use the monetary
aspects of the gamble to produce this response.
The results of the experiments by Slovic and
Lichtenstein, while not designed specifically to
test the SEU model, cast doubt on the adequacy of that model. The finding of large in-

equalities among risk dimensions with regard
to their influence on the attractiveness of
gambles, a finding that Pw had more import
than P\, and the discrepancies in the import

and bids for the same gambles, are results contradictory to the common SEU model of
decision making.
The risk dimension concept was applied to
the study of risk perception by Slovic (1967).
Subjects were asked to rate a set of gambles in
terms of the degree of risk involved in playing
each gamble. The risk dimension which showed
the highest average correlation with ratings of
risk (.52) was PI. In contrast, the average correlation of variance with ratings of risk was
only .08.
The two studies just described provide general support for the usefulness of describing
gambles in terms of risk dimensions but do not
directly compare that approach to those which
use descriptions based on moments of the
underlying distribution. There are two obvious
ways in which to approach the question of
which of the two conflicting descriptions of
gambles is the more psychologically meaningful. The first would be to keep the stated probabilities and payoffs equal for pairs of gambles
with unequal underlying distributions. This
method was used by Slovic and Lichtenstein
(1968a) in a study of variance preferences.
They employed "parallel" gambles, consisting
of a two-outcome gamble and a duplex gamble
(Figure 2). Both gambles had the same explicit
probabilities and payoffs but the duplex gamble
had less variance. Their hypothesis was that
if decisions about gambles are made by employing strategies utilizing only the basic risk
dimensions and not the differences in dispersion
of the underlying distributions there should be
no strong preferences between parallel twooutcome and duplex gambles. The great
majority of subjects bid equivalently for
parallel standard and duplex gambles and
failed to exhibit any strong preferences for
variance in a choice situation. Slovic and
Lichtenstein "concluded that dispersion or
variance, as manipulated here, is at best a
minor determinant of bids and choices [p.
653]."
A second way in which to explore the relative
merit of the basic risk dimensions and the
underlying distributions as explanations of

decision behavior involves the use of pairs of
gambles which display different values for the
risk dimensions but which are equal in their
underlying distributions. Payne and Braunstein (1971) used this method in a study of
preferences among gambles with equal underlying distributions. It was argued that if subjects choose between these gambles on the
basis of their underlying distributions, no consistent preferences would be expected. If,
however, subjects choose on the basis of the
explicitly stated values on the risk dimensions,
preferences should be related to these dimensions. The gambles used were specially constructed pairs of duplex gambles called "equivalent" duplex gambles (Figure 3). The explicit
(displayed) probabilities were different for
each gamble in an equivalent pair but the
underlying distributions were identical. Significant preferences were found among pairs
of gambles with explicit values on the basic

risk dimensions unequal and the underlying
distributions equal. These results, along with
those of Slovic and Lichtenstein (1968a,
1968b), were taken as support for the concept
that subjects respond to gambles in terms of a
set of basic risk dimensions. It was suggested
that while the predictive value of particular
moments or subjective variations of the moments of the underlying distribution has been
demonstrated (Coombs et al., 1967; Coombs
& Pruitt, 1960), these abstractions of gambles,
such as expected value and variance, may be
good predictors of choices among pairs of
gambles only because they correlate with the
relevant variables.

derived from an information-processing approach to decision making under risk. Within
such an approach there are two basic research
tasks. The first is the correct identification of
the sources of information actually used by the
individual. The investigations cited above suggest that the explicitly stated probabilities and
payoffs are the sources of information used in
risky decision making. This view may be contrasted to that which uses the moments of the
underlying probability distributions to predict decision behavior in situations of risk.
The second research task within an information-processing approach is the identification
of the rules or processes which are used to combine information into a decision. This section
of the paper reviews some of the information
utilization rules that have been proposed.
Additive Models
Perhaps the earliest rule of information
utilization suggested is the additive model.
With an additive model of choice, the evaluation of two multidimensional alternatives is
assumed to proceed as follows: Each alternative is evaluated separately. A value, either
objective or subjective, is arrived at for each
component of an alternative. The components
are then combined in an additive fashion resulting in an overall value for that alternative.
A comparison is then made between the overall
value of each alternative and the one with the
greater value is chosen. A general formulation

of the additive model states that:
x > y if, and only if,

V(x) = E

> E

= U(y),

i=\

where the f/,s represent a real-valued function.
Additive models of decision making under
risk have been proposed by Slovic and Lichtenstein (1968b) and Anderson and Shanteau
(1970). Both models assume that subjects use
a strategy of choice based on differential
weighting of the importance of the sources of
information. The model proposed by Slovic
and Lichtenstein is :

A(G)=u. + WiPw + PF2$W + WsPi + W&i,
where A (G) is the attractiveness of a gamble
and the Ws are weights reflecting the relative
importance of each risk dimension. The model
proposed by Anderson and Shanteau is based
on a general theory of information integration
characterized by two parameters : a subjective
value S of a piece of information and a measure W of the importance of the source of information to the response. They suggested that
the basic pieces of information are the amounts
Sg and Si, which correspond to subjective versions of the risk dimensions $w and $1. The information is assumed to be weighted by a subjective function of its likelihood or probability
of occurring, Ws and W\. The model equa-

<-----Page 10----->449

DECISION MAKING UNDER RISK

tion is:

R = PFA + WiSi,
where R is the theoretical response and S\ has
negative value. As Anderson and Shanteau
pointed out, their model appears identical to
the SEU model, although, unlike the common version of the SEU model, the weights in
the integration model do not have to sum to
1.0. Anderson and Shanteau argued, however,
that the two formulations have substantive
differences. They suggested two basic differences. The first is that integration theory,
unlike utility theory, does not impose a normative element. The second, and more important
difference, is in the interpretation of the weight
parameters. Since integration theory applies
to value judgments generally, the interpretation of the weight parameter need not be
limited to probability. Rapoport and Wallsten
(1972) have criticized these assumed differences. They suggested that the first difference
is based on a misunderstanding of the SEU
model in its axiomatic form. Rapoport and
Wallsten argued that "Rather than assuming
maximization of SEU, the theory derives it
from more fundamental assumptions [p. 147]."
Perhaps, but the point by Anderson and
Shanteau is still a valid one. The SEU theory,
whatever its present formulation, has derived
from a normative approach to decision making.
The axioms involved are still presented as rules
of rational behavior. The second criticism by
Rapoport and Wallsten concerns the lack of
restrictions on the weight parameters which
they suggested may make experimental investigations of such concepts as the utility of
gambling difficult.
The results of the experimental work conducted by Anderson and Shanteau (1970) were
mixed. They claimed that the discrepancies
from the model which they found, especially in
the additive component, were small in magnitude and that "The model at least provides a
good approximation to the data even though
its validity is yet uncertain [p. 449]." Their
comment serves to sum up the research involving additive models quite well.
Nonlinear, Noncompensatory Models
Einhorn (1970) suggested that conjunctive
and disjunctive strategies are used by decision
makers. The conjunctive model implies that

whether a multidimensional alternative x =
(xi,xz,. . .,xn) surpasses some stimulus or
standard y = (yi,y%,. . .,yn) will depend on Xi
being greater than y< for all i. An alternative
must have a certain minimum value on all the
relevant dimensions in order to be chosen. This
model is similar to the satisficing principle proposed by Simon (1957). In the disjunctive
model, the alternative x will be preferred to
some standard y if one %i > yi, regardless of
Ji > Xj where i ^ j. An alternative is evaluated on its "best" dimension regardless of the
value of its other dimensions. Einhorn showed
how these models may provide a better fit to
certain decision data than the additive model.
While neither the conjunctive nor disjunctive
model has been applied to decision making
under risk, the research by Einhorn is useful
in demonstrating the potentials of other than
strict additive models of judgment.
Tversky (1969) proposed an additive difference model of choice, which states, that :
x > y if , and only if,
> 0,

where <j>i(— 8) = — <£;(5) for all i. The quantity
S corresponds to the difference between the two
alternatives on the ith dimension and <£,• is a
function that determines the contribution of
the ith difference to the overall evaluation.
Unlike the additive model, the additive difference model suggests an intradimensional evaluation strategy in which the alternatives are
compared directly on each dimension and the
results of these comparisons are combined in
reaching a decision. The two models are compatible if, and only if, the difference functions
are linear. Tversky pointed out that such a
compatibility does not necessarily mean that
the processing strategies coincide.4 Tversky
4
Hoffman (1960, 1968) has made the general observation that two or more models of judgment may be
algebraically equivalent yet suggestive of radically
different underlying processes. This observation is
important in the context of the distinction between
descriptive and explanatory validity. The compatibility
of the additive and additive difference models under
certain assumptions provides a good example of the
care which must be exercised in distinguishing between
the mathematical form of two models and their process
assumptions.

<-----Page 11----->450

JOHN W. PAYNE

argued that
The proposed processing strategies, as well as the models
associated with them, are certainly affected by the way
in which the information is displayed. More specifically,
the additive model is more likely to be used when the
alternatives are displayed sequentially (i.e., one at a
time), while the additive difference model is more likely
to be used when the dimensions are displayed sequentially [p. 42].

An important consequence of the additive
difference model is that the model does not
necessarily require transitivity to be satisfied.
This can be seen most clearly when one (or
more) of the difference functions approaches
a step function, that is, <£(5) = 0 when 8 < e.
In this form, the additive difference model resembles a lexicographic semiorder. The following example, similar to one offered by Tversky,
demonstrates how a lexicographic processing
strategy with a just noticeable difference structure could lead to intransitive behavior.
Imagine that an individual is faced with three
alternative gambles, x, y, and z. Each gamble
is of the form (a,p), and thus has a value on
each of two dimensions, Pw and $ w :

• x
Gambles y
z

Dimensions
®
Pw
wvr
A
.8
.5
.6
.6
.4

The individual considers the dimension Pw to
be more important than the dimension $w, but
feels that a probability difference greater than
.1 is needed to be a significant difference. In
comparing gamble x with gamble y the individual finds the difference in Pw less than or
equal to .1 so he chooses x over y on the basis
of $w. Similarly, in comparing y to z, y is preferred to z. However, when comparing x to z,
the difference on Pw is greater than .1, and the
individual chooses z over x, thus violating the
transitivity principle.
Tversky (1969) suggested that in evaluating
complex multidimensional alternatives people
may find it extremely difficult to properly
utilize all the available information and may
employ approximation methods that enable
them to process the information which they
consider most relevant in making a decision.
This rationale for the additive difference model
is consistent with the generalization about
human judgment proposed by Slovic and

Lichtenstein (1971) regarding the difficulty
individuals seem to have in weighting and combining information. The suggestion that subjects use approximation methods is also consistent with the general view of Simon and
Newell (1971) of the importance of heuristic
processes in human behavior.
Tversky (1972) presented another theory of
choice which is closely related to the lexicographic model. The theory is called the elimination-by-aspects model. The model describes
choice as a covert elimination process. In
choosing among multidimensional alternatives the individual is assumed to proceed in
the following manner: First, a dimension or
aspect is selected. Then all the alternatives
that do not possess that aspect are eliminated.
The procedure is repeated until all the alternatives are eliminated but one. The probability of
selecting an aspect or dimension is assumed to
be proportional to its weight.5 Tversky found
empirical support for the elimination-byaspects model for choices among college applicants and gambles, but not for a psychophysical task.
A Contingent Process Model
The final model to be discussed was developed by Payne and Braunstein (1971) as
an explanation of the results obtained in a
study of preferences among paired duplex
gambles. The hypothesized decision strategy
was presented in the form of a process model
involving two stages: an evaluation stage
followed by a choice stage. The particular
choice rule used by the subject was assumed
to be contingent upon the outcome of the evaluation process. Specifically, the model assumed
that the subject first considers the probability
relationship within the gambles in a pair. If
Pw < Pi, the gamble with the lower P\ is
chosen. If Pw > PI within each gamble in a
6

This is the first "probabilistic" theory of choice to
be discussed here. The reason is that most previous
probabilistic theories of choice have dealt with the
problem of decision making under risk by combining
probabilistic choice theory with the EU model. This
point is made clear in the writings on probabilistic
choice theories for uncertain outcomes (risky alternatives) by Luce and Suppes (1965). For example, the
proposed strict EU model combines EU. theory with
Luce's choice model. Excellent reviews of probabilistic
theories of choice are offered by Luce and Suppes, and
Becker and McClintock (1967).

pair, an attempt is made to maximize the $w.
In the case where the amounts are equal within
a pair, Pw may be used as a secondary criterion,
and the gamble with the greater Pw chosen.
For pairs of gambles where Pw = P\, there are
alternative paths which can be taken in the
model, possibly corresponding to two types of
subjects. These types of pairs of gambles may
be treated as if they were pairs of gambles in
which Pw > PI, or as if they were pairs of
gambles in which Pv < PI. Figure 4 presents
the model in flow-chart form. While no claim
was made for the generality of this model, it
was argued that this type of explanation of
risky decision behavior, based on relationships
among the basic risk dimensions, appears more
promising than models based on moments of
the underlying distribution. Further research
is needed to support this contention. However,
results from research in other areas of human
behavior provide indirect support for the form
of the model proposed by Payne and Braunstein. For example, Biederman (1972) has
shown how an analysis of human performance
in terms of contingent information processing
is useful in understanding the results obtained
with a speed recognition task. Finally, the
heuristic nature of the decision processes suggested is consistent with both empirical and
theoretical considerations presented by a
number of researchers in decision making (e.g.,
Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1971; Tversky, 1969,
1972).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The earliest research efforts in the area of
decision making under risk were conducted by

mathematicians and economists. The psychological study of risky decision behavior has
just begun to move away from the influence of
these early efforts. This influence has led to
the traditional description of gambles as probability distributions over outcomes of money
with little or no attention paid to the cognitive
representation used by the individual decision
maker. The result has been models of decision
behavior which have concentrated on the
moments of the underlying distributions as the
determinants of choice among gambles. Descriptive considerations have been handled
primarily by loosening the restrictions which
are placed on the components of the models.
Thus, the progression of expectation theories
has been EV,EU, and the current SEU. The
other approach to solving the obvious descriptive problems of the basic expectation
(EV) model has been to postulate a "risk"
variable, often defined in terms of the second
and third moments of the underlying probability distribution, variance and skewness.
The predictive success of the moment models
has been mixed. They have been reasonably
accurate in predicting overall statistics of
decision making. However, the models have
failed to predict the results of some recent
studies of decision behavior. The finding of inconsistencies between bids and choices among
gambles by Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971) and
Lindman (1971), the lack of systematic
preferences among gambles with equal explicit
stated probabilities and amounts found by
Slovic and Lichtenstein (1968a), and the preferences found among gambles with equal underlying distributions by Payne and Braunstein

Whether one accepts a model of decision
making under risk derived from a conceptualization of a gamble as a probability distribution
over money, or a model based on a set of explicit risk dimensions, may depend in part on
one's research purposes. For normative purposes or for strictly predictive purposes,
models based on either objective or subjective
values of the moments of the underlying distributions may serve, at least for a first approximation. If one's research goal is uncovering the underlying information-processing
