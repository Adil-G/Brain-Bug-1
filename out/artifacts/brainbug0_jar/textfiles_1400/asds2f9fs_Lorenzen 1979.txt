GENERALIZING

THE SECRETARY

PROBLEM

THOMAS J. LORENZEN,* General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, Michigan

Abstract
The secretary problem refers to a certain class of optimal stopping problems
based on relative ranks. To allow a more realistic formulation of the problem,
this paper considers an arbitrary loss function. A finite and an infinite problem
are defined and the optimal solutions are obtained. The solution for the
infinite problem is given by a differential equation while the finite problem is
given by a difference equation. Under general conditions, the finite problem
tends to the infinite problem. An example involving the secretary problem
with interview cost is considered and illustrates the usefulness of the present
paper.
OPTIMAL STOPPING RULES; RELATIVE RANKS; LOSS FUNCTION

1. Introduction
A finite secretary problem is usually defined in the following way: n
applicants apply for a secretarial position. Some criterion is established to rank
the candidates from 1 (best) to n (worst) with no ties. The candidates arrive in
a random fashion and their relative ranks are observed. On the basis of the
observed relative ranks, a candidate is either hired (and the process stops) or
passed by. Passed candidates can never be recalled. If the (n - 1)th candidate is
passed, the last candidate must be selected. A loss function (based on absolute
ranks) is defined and the objective is to find a stopping rule that minimizes the
expected loss.
For the infinite secretary problem, defined by Gianini and Samuels (1976),
following a suggestion of Rubin (1966), an infinite number of rankable candidates arrive at times which are i.i.d. (independently identically distributed)
uniform on (0, 1). Like the finite problem, a loss function is defined and the
objective is to find a stopping rule that minimizes the expected loss. It is shown
that the infinite secretary problem is the limit of the finite secretary problems
as n--oo and that the solution is given by a differential equation.
In the usual finite problem see for example Chow et al. (1964) or Mucci
(1973a), (1973b), an increasing function q(-) is given, where q(i) is the loss for
stopping on a candidate of (absolute) rank i. From this sequence the expected

loss Q(r, k) for stopping on a candidate of relative rank k at time r is derived.
The solution is obtained as a function that depends only on the function
Q(r, k).
For the infinite problem, this same sequence is used to derive the expected
loss for stopping at time x on a candidate of relative rank k, denoted Rk(x) and
equal to the limit of Q(r, k) as r/n->x. Again the solution to the problem
depends only on Rk(x).
In this paper we maintain the same general format for the secretary problem
(even though the results can be used to solve problems formulated differently).
However, we will start with a known loss function, not necessarily generated by
an increasing sequence q(-). The results obtained in this paper will be of a
qualitative nature and will serve as a guide to quantitative studies of more
realistic formulations of the problem. As a specific example, we will consider
the secretary problem with sampling cost. This example will be used throughout the paper and will illustrate the usefulness of the results.
Some of the results of this paper are patterned after previously published
results. For these results, we will omit the proofs, indicating that they are
extensions of previously published works. Of course, proofs that are not
straightforward extensions will be included. The differences between the new
results and the previously published results will be illustrated by the sampling
cost problem.
Let us first consider the infinite problem. For the sampling cost example let
h(x) denote the cumulative cost for sampling up to time x and let q(-) be the
loss sequence previously defined. Then the expected loss for stopping at time x
on a candidate of relative rank k is Rk(x)+h(x).
Except for trivial cases, no

will
R*(x) identically equal
Rk(x) + h(x). Even though the
generate
q*(-)
only difference is in the expected loss function, nothing in the literature will
give the solution to this new problem. Thus, we will need to derive the solution
to the secretary problem under more general conditions.
In deriving the solution, let us consider the infinite problem first.
2. The differential equation for f
Throughout this paper, we will use the following notation:
Ak(x)=loss (or expected loss) for stopping at time x on a candidate of
relative rank k (AO(x)=limAk(x) as k->oo),
=
Ui arrival time of the ith best candidate (i.i.d. uniform (0, 1)),

lose

We will impose two conditions on Ak(x),
(2.1)
(2.2)

Ak(x) - Ak+l(x)
=
=
Ai(O) A2(O)= A.(O+).

Condition (2.1) states that you lose more for stopping on a candidate of
greater relative rank. Condition (2.2) alleviates problems associated with the
start of the process. For the finite problem, the first candidate always has
relative rank 1; while for the infinite problem there is no first arrival since
every interval contains an infinite number of arrivals. Condition (2.2) solves
this problem. (Note that the sampling problem has Rk(x)+h(x) -Rk+l(x)+
h(x) which satisfies (2.1); and has Rk(O)+h(O)=q(oo)+h(O), Roo(x)+h(x)=
q(oo)+ h(x) which satisfies (2.2) whenever h is continuous at 0. The notation
q(oo) will denote limq(i) as i->oo.)
Some of the results of this paper require an additional condition. Since this
condition is mild, we will impose it in general. This condition is given by
(2.3)

Ak(x) continuous and finite on (bk, 1) for some bk.

For our special case, this is equivalent to having a loss function h(*) that is
continuous and finite on [0, 1).
The first question we ask concerns the relation between f and V. It is
obvious that V f(t) for all t but not every procedure is necessarily greater
than some to> 0 so it is not obvious that V f(O+). However, we can verify the
following result.
Proposition 2.1. V=f(O+).
Proof. That V f(O+) follows immediately from the above remark.
Consider any interval [0, t]. The best possible risk in this interval is
infos,,st A(s) and f(t) is the minimal risk for all procedures stopping after time
t so we have V>min f(t), infos,st A(s)]. Since this holds for all values of t,
(2.4)

V

min [f(0+), A(0O)].

Now consider any procedure r* that stops in (t, t+8). As -->0, Y(T*)-->o
so it follows that f(t) -_Aoo(t+). Letting t->0 and recalling Condition (2.2), we

<-----Page 4----->387

Generalizingthe secretaryproblem

get
f(0+) - A.(O+) = Al(O).

(2.5)

Inequalities (2.4) and (2.5) prove the proposition.
If V = AI(O) we are in the trivial case, i.e. the game is not worth starting. So
let us assume that V<Ai(O). Since A1(-) is continuous, V<info--,to A1(s) for
some to>0 which shows that V=f(t) for all t sufficiently small. This implies
that we skip a certain proportion of the candidates no matter what their ranks
are.
The main result of this section will be the derivation of the function f (thus
giving V) and the resulting optimal procedure.

equation
f'(t)= t-r1

subject to f(l) )=A(1).
Proof. First let us prove continuity. Using the reasoning in Proposition 2.1,
f(s) infsx-tAY(x(x)Ax)f(t) for all t>s. As t-s-->O, Y(x)->oo so we conclude
and f(s)-<f(s+) (f
f(s)>Ao(s+)^Af(s+). Since we already know f(t)<A.(t+)
we
conclude
can
that f(s+)-AoA(s+) which
being an increasing function),
implies f(s) = f(s+).
The same reasoning gives f(s)= f(s-) and thus proves continuity.
Next we will derive the differential equation. Assume we are not in the
trivial case (i.e. assume V<Ai(O)) and let t be such that AI(t)<f(t). Let
r =max {i IAj(t)<f(t)}

and let s be close enough to t that
A,(u)<f(u),

A,+1(u)>f(u)

for all

u (s, t).

Define a stopping rule cr by r = inf {Ui (s, t) I Y(Ui) r} or a = 1 if that set
is empty. Since orI-,,, +lI{,>} is a stopping rule, we can let T approach
optimality in the set of all rules greater than t and obtain

f(t)].

Suppose now that we could observe the entire interval [s, t] and choose 0 so
that A (o)(0)= infxt,, A y(X)(x). For this 0 we have
(2.8)

f(s) - E[A y()(0) A f(t)].

But when A,(t)> f(t), f(t) is constant so f'(t)= 0 and the differential equation
again holds.
For our special case, the solution is given by f(0) where f(-) satisfies the
differential equation f'(t)=t =l [f(t) - Rk(t)- h(t)]+ subject to f(l)=
R,(1)+ h(l). Although the proof was not trivial, the result is not surprising
since the classical solution is given by the above with h(t) deleted.
However, the form of the stopping rule is very surprising. To illustrate this
point, let us again consider the sampling cost problem. Intuition tells us that we
should stop sooner than the no-interview cost problem and that the optimal
solution should be of the same form; namely a 'cutoff point' rule. That is, like
the classical case we must find the optimal ak (the 'cutoff point') and will then
stop the first time after ak a candidate of relative rank _k appears.
As examples will show, this intuition is wrong. Instead of the classical 'cutoff
point' rules, the optimal stopping rule belongs to a more general class called
island rules.
Definition. The rule T is an island rule if T stops as soon as a candidate of
relative rank k arrives in the island Ik where [0, 1] = I, 12 " * * 1}.
{
The restriction Ik v Ik+l is not really a restriction at all since it states that you

<-----Page 6----->389

Generalizingthe secretaryproblem

are willing to take a candidate of relative rank k if you are willing to take a
candidate of relative rank k +1.
We will refer to 'cutoff point' rules as single island rules. Clearly whenever
Ak(x) is decreasing in x the optimal rule is of the single island type. However,
not every rule is of this type. This can be demonstrated through the use of our
example, the sampling cost problem. Specifically, we will consider the infinite
best choice problem (q(1)=0, q(i)=l for i_2 with the object being to
maximize the probability of making the best choice), with sampling cost
- and h(x)=1-e-1
for -x
1.
h(x)=0 for 0x_
On the interval [?, 1], we find no additional sampling cost. Therefore, the
optimal rule is identical to the optimal rule for the classical best choice
problem. (See Moser and Pounder (1960).) That is, I [, 1]=[e-1, 1] and
Ik [, 1] = {1} for k '-2 and finally f() = f(e-l) = 1-e-l + e- = 1.
Now consider the interval (0, A).We again have an infinite number of arrivals
and the probability structure of these arrivals is the same as the probability
structure of the problem defined on the whole interval. Since f(3)=1, the
classical solution applied to (0, A)is optimal. This gives an optimal solution of
I = [e-1/3, )U [e-1, 1] and Ik ={1} for k> 2.
We note that we can obtain an arbitrary number of islands by repeating the
above process and that we can get islands for all k, not simply k = 1. We also
note that we can get arbitrarily close to the above island rule with a continuous
loss function, resulting in closed islands.
One of the nicest properties of island rules is that they are fixed. That is, they
can be computed prior to the start of the game and do not depend on any
particular realization of the process. Another, equally important property is:
some island rule is optimal. Specifically, we have the following result.
Theorem 2.2. The island rule * given by
(2.11)

Ik ={x IAk(x)-f(x)}

is an optimal rule.
Note that our restriction Ik v Ik+1 is trivially satisfied.

Proof. If V =oo, necessarily A(0) = oo and we are in the trivial case. Let us
assume V<A1(0) oo and let r be an arbitrary stopping rule with finite
expected loss. We will show that T can be improved on sets {T<r*} and
Assume P(T < T*) >0. If we let Io= [0, 1] and Jk = interior {Ik_- - Ik}, then
there exist k such that P({T < *}nJk)>0. Since Ak is continuous, for each x
in Jk there exists an ex such that Ak(y)> f(x) for all y in (x - x, x) which we
denote B,. The B. form a covering of Jk so by Lindelofs theorem we can
choose a countable cover. On all sets of the form {r < T*} JkN B,

<-----Page 7----->390

THOMAS J. LORENZEN

Ak(T) > f(x). On each of these sets, T can be improved by waiting
E[Ay(,)(T)]until x and choosing a rule with loss sufficiently close to f(x).

This can be used to show that max (T, *) is at least as good as v for any T.

For the other half of the proof, assume P(T > T*)> 0. For any stopping rule
T', following the proof in Gianini and Samuels (1976), we can show

As in that proof, this implies that the min (r, *) is at least as good as

Proof. Apply the theorem to the interval (t, 1).
3. The truncated problem
Before we consider the relationships between the infinite problem and the
corresponding finite problems, let us consider the truncated problem. In the
classical case, truncation was obtained by truncating the sequence q(-) at some
large value, say q(N). This actually accomplished two things; it put an upper
bound of q(N) on the expected loss and it put an upper bound of N on the
greatest acceptable relative rank (i.e. it forced ak equal to 1 for k_ N).
In our general formulation no such q(-) exists. We can consider truncations
of Bk(x)

and C'(x)=

Ak(x)AAM(x)

of truncation. Instead we will consider a third truncation, corresponding closely
to the classical case. That is, we will let
(3.1)

A j(x) =Ak(x)AAM(x)AM.

The main result of this section will be the proof that the loss for truncated
problem (3.1), VM, tends to V as M-> oo. This will also show that the loss
corresponding to the other two truncations tend to V as M -> oo.
Before proving the main theorem, we need the following lemma.

Proof. The proof is an extension of a similar lemma given in Gianini and
Samuels (1976).
This lemma leads to the main result of this section; the truncated problem
tends to the non-truncated problem no matter what the risk is.

show lim VM? V. Let I' be the island rule specified by TM,the optimal rule

that converges as in Lemma 1. For convenience relabel this sequence and let Ti

4. The finite problem and its limit
Let us again consider the classical formulation of the secretary problem. A
sequence q(-) is used to compute the expected loss for stopping both for a finite
number (n) of candidates and an infinite number. A natural relationship
between the two exists. As i/n--x, the expected loss for stopping at time i in
the finite problem uniformly tends to the expected loss for stopping at time x in
the infinite problem. This relationship leads to the proof that the finite problem
tends to the infinite problem.
Since we have presented Ak(x), the loss function for the infinite problem, let
us define
(4.1)

A'(i) = loss for stopping on the ith candidate (out of n) having relative
rank k, where A'(-) satisfies suplki-,Sn IAn(i)-Ak(i/n)
I->0 as
n --> 0.

Then we have defined a finite secretary problem whose solution can be
obtained by backward induction. To be formal let
C(i) =minimal going on risk at time i
and
V = minimal risk;
then backward induction gives
C(n- 1)= n-1

ing f'(x) = x-l Xk=1 [f(x)-Ak(X)]+ which we recognize as the differential equation for the infinite problem.
The last section of this paper considers circumstances under which the finite
problem tends to the infinite problem. First we will prove the result for
truncated loss and then consider the non-truncated problem. For truncated
loss, two proofs will be offered. The first is motivated by Gianini (1977) who
imbedded the finite problem in the infinite problem. This proof is offered since
it is basically probabilistic and gives a feel for the behavior of the finite
problem. The second proof is analytical and concise. It will be given in greater
detail.
For the first proof, consider two intermediary problems, called the finite
memory model and the full memory model. For both models, the unit interval
is divided into n equal parts and the stopping process altered so it can only stop
on the best arrival in each interval. For the finite memory model, the stopping
decision is based upon the ranks of these best arrivals relative to themselves.
For the full memory model, the stopping decision is based upon the ranks of
these best arrivals relative to all previous arrivals.
Let T(r) be the arrival time of the best candidate among all candidates
arriving in [(r- l)/n, r/n]; Y(r) be the relative rank of the candidate arriving at
T(r) with respect ot those arriving at T(1), T(2), * * , T(r); Y(r) be the relative
rank with respect to [0, r/n]; V: be the minimal risk for the finite memory
problem (i.e. based on the Y(-)) and V* be the minimal risk for the full
memory problem (based on the Y(-)). We restrict ourselves to the truncated
problem, make use of the equicontinuity of the loss function and consider the
four problems, finite, finite memory, full memory and infinite, in pairs.
First we consider the finite and the finite memory problems. We have the
following result.
Proposition 4.1. For truncated loss (3.1), IVn-V-:O

as n->o.

Proof. For the finite memory problem, the decision to stop or go on at time
T(r) is based solely on Y(1), * -, Y(r). But it is easy to see that Y(1) through
Y(r) have the same probability structure as the relative ranks in the finite
problem. The difference is the time scale. If we associate T(r) and time r in the
finite problem, the stopping rules are interchangeable.
For the finite problem, the loss for stopping at time r on a candidate of
relative rank k is A'(r) while the finite memory loss is given by Ay(r)(T(r))_

<-----Page 10----->393

Generalizingthe secretaryproblem

Ak(T(r)). By equicontinuity and uniform convergence, we can ignore the
difference between A'(r) and Ak(T(r)). Therefore, for the same stopping rule
applied to both processes, the risks differ only when Ay(r)(T(r))>Ayr)(T(r)).
Since the loss is truncated, these two quantities only differ when Y(T(r))>
Y(T(r)) and Y(T(r))<M. This can only happen if two or more of the arrival
times U1, * * , UM- fall in the same interval [(r-1)/n, r/n]. As n->oo, this
probability tends to zero. Since the loss function is bounded above by M, the
difference in the risks tends to zero and therefore the proposition is proved.
Proposition 4.2. For truncated loss (3.1), IV*- V--> 0 as n->oo.
Proof. The full memory problem contains more information than the infinite
problem so the inequality

Vn** V is obvious.

For the other inequality, use the solution to the full memory problem to
induce an island rule for the infinite problem. Namely, if the full memory
problem would stop at time T(r) on a candidate of relative rank k, let
Ik [(r- 1)/n, r/n]. Using reasoning similar to the previous proof, we can show
that the two rules give the same asymptotic risk. Since the induced island rules
are not necessarily optimal for the infinite problem, we get the other inequality
and prove the proposition.
as n->oo.
Proposition 4.3. For truncated loss (3.1), |V*-V**|-o0
Proof. The full memory problem contains more information than the finite
memory problem so V**_ V* for all n.
For the other inequality, again use the solution to the full memory problem
to induce a stopping rule for the finite memory problem. That is, if the full
memory problem would stop at T(r) on a candidate of rank k relative to all
previous candidates, then stop at T(r) for the finite memory problem if a
candidate has rank k relative to only the arrivals at T(1), * -, T(r). Again the
reasoning in Proposition 4.1 shows that the difference of the two risks tends to
zero. This will give the other inequality and prove the proposition.
These three propositions lead to the following theorem. We will also include
an additional proof, of an analytic nature and not depending on any of the
above propositions.
Theorem 4.1. For truncated loss (3.1), Vn

Since x was arbitrary, g'(t) = m=L
[g(t)-Ak(t)]+ = k= [g(t)-Ak(t)]+, almost
everywhere. Because the right-hand side of the above equality is continuous,
we can replace the almost everywhere with everywhere.
Since the above procedure holds for all convergent subsequences, the
sequence gn(-)must converge to g(-) and the theorem is proved.

Generalizing the secretary problem

In addition to the theorem, the following corollaries give results for the
non-truncated problem.
Corollary 1. For any A'(x) satisfying (4.1), V<liminf

V,.

Proof. Let V~ and VM be the risks for the finite and infinite truncated
problems. Using Theorems 3.1 and 4.1 we conclude
V = lim VM
M

= lim inf Vn.
Corollary 2. If Aoo(x) is bounded and continuous, then lim Vn= V.
Proof. Since Ak(x) is continuous for all k, Ak(x) converges uniformly to
Aoo(x). Thus, for any e>0, we can choose M large enough that IAk(x)Aoo(x)|< E for all x and k M. Considering the loss truncated at M and using
the notation given in the last corollary, this implies
lim sup Vn = lim sup V + e

< V+e.
Corollary 1 gives the other inequality.
Finally, we can show the following corollary
Corollary 3. If Ak(x) is decreasing in x for each k, then lim V = V.
Proof. We have lim inf Vn V by Corollary 1.
Consider the infinite process with added information. Suppose we know
whether or not a candidate is one of the n best. Denote the minimal risk for
this problem V' and the best rule 'r. It is easy to see that V V', ' E
{U1, U2, * * , U}, and the optimal rule is of the form I, = [bk, 1] where bk may
be stochastic and bk = 1 for k > n. Use this rule to induce a randomized policy
T" on the finite problem that stops at time r on a candidate of relative rank k
with the same probability T' stops in [(r- l)/n, r/n] on a candidate of relative
rank k. Since An(i) uniformly tends to Ak(i/n) and Ak(') is decreasing, we have
V > lim sup Vn
> lim sup E[A y(,r(Tr")]
lim sup Vn.

One gap still exists; can Corollary3 be extended to show Vn->V for all
Ak(-)? If Ak(-) is an equicontinuous family, then the proof given in Corollary 3

will go through and we can answer yes. For the samplingcost problem, the
answer is again yes as long as the samplingcost is continuous.But, in total
generality,the question remains.
