Abstract
This research extends an initial trust model proposed
and empirically tested by McKnight, Choudhury, and
Kacmar (2002) in an e-commerce context. This trust
model is extended by the addition of two key
constructs: trusting attitude and subjective norm.
These added constructs improve the theoretical
foundation of this model by more closely aligning it
with the theory of reasoned action. The extended trust
model is applied to the context of information systems,
specifically a national identity system. Survey data
collected in an experimental setting were used to test
and compare the extended trust model against the
initial trust model. Empirical results indicate that the
additional constructs of trusting attitude and subjective
norm explain significantly more variance in initial
trusting intentions.

Introduction
Trust has been long been recognized as a
fundamental aspect of relationships, both personal and
business, and has more recently been examined in the
interactions between individuals and information
systems. Several information systems (IS) studies
have investigated consumer trust with an e-vendor
and/or the e-vendor’s web site (Gefen et al., 2003;
Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; McKnight et al., 2002).
Existing research has acknowledged the importance of
trust in aspects of information systems, but there has
been little focus on trust in a specific information
system.
A national identity (NID) system is a public information
system used at the societal or government level. A
variety of NID systems have been implemented in
many countries and districts. The older forms of these
systems simply store citizens’ information in a global
database and retrieve it for verification purposes when
a citizen presents his or her NID card. The newer
forms of these systems, such as the Smart ID used in
Hong Kong, provide more advanced features including
library services, electronic payment facilities, and
online access (Hong Kong Smart ID, Government
Information Centre, 2004). While there has been
renewed interest in establishing such a system in the
U.S. and other countries since the September 11,
2001, attack, strong resistance to such a system still
exists. NID system acceptance is heavily dependent
upon citizen trust in these systems. Gaining an
understanding of initial trust in an NID system would
help governments better evaluate citizens’ responses

implementation concerns.
The purpose of this research, therefore, is to extend
an existing model of trust in IS and apply it to the
context of NID systems. The selected trust model by
McKnight et al. (2002) was developed from existing
trust research in management and specified within the
general framework of the theory of reasoned action
(TRA) (Fishbein & Azjen, 1975). The model was
empirically tested in the context of initial trust in an evendor’s web site, which is similar to the context of
understanding initial trust in an NID system.
We extend McKnight et al.’s (2002) initial trust model
through the addition of two constructs, trusting attitude
and subjective norm, which align the model more
closely with TRA. In addition, we apply the extended
McKnight model to the new context of NID systems.
The context of NID systems was specifically selected
for two reasons. First, given the renewed interest in
establishing an NID system in the U.S. and other
countries, more research in this context is needed to
facilitate our understanding of NID systems. Second,
trust becomes more salient as the level of possible risk
increases (McKnight et al., 2002), and the current
debates on NID systems reveal potential risks, such as
security and privacy. Given these concerns, citizens
can easily build salient trust-related opinions on this
type of system and be less reliant on their individual
dispositions to trust in forming these opinions.
The extended trust model is empirically tested through
survey data collected in an experimental setting. The
experimental setting conveys the context of NID
systems and includes the more advanced features
found in newer NID systems, such as library services,
medical services, and electronic transactions.
Empirical results demonstrate that the additional
constructs of trusting attitude and subjective norm
explain significantly more variance in the model.
In the following section, the extended trust model and
hypotheses are presented. The research methodology
is then described, followed by a discussion of the

results. Lastly, the conclusion outlines the
contributions, limitations, and future research
opportunities.

Theoretical Foundation and Hypotheses
McKnight et al. (2002) proposed a model to predict
initial user trust in an e-vendor by drawing on existing
trust research from the management literature (Lewicki
& Bunker, 1995; Mayer et al., 1995) and integrating it
within the framework of TRA (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975).
This model is shown in Figure 1 and will be referred to
as the McKnight Model. The high level constructs for
this model are shown in Figure 1, while the definitions
for the constructs and sub-constructs are provided in
Table 1.
McKnight et al. (2002) developed a survey instrument
to test their model in the context of e-commerce. The
study focused on customers’ initial trust in an e-vendor
given no prior experience with the e-vendor, and future
trusting intentions were measured after the customer
interacted with the web site. Empirical results from the
study demonstrated the convergent and discriminant
validity of the instrument and the nomological validity
of the model.
The McKnight Model follows the general framework of
TRA, but does not include two of the primary
constructs prescribed by this theory, attitude and
subjective norm. TRA posits that an individual’s
intention to perform a behavior is determined by
his/her attitude toward the behavior and subjective
norm (the social influence determinant of intention)
(Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). Attitude represents an
individual’s positive or negative feelings about
performing a behavior, and subjective norm represents
an individual’s perception of other people’s opinions
about performing the behavior (Ajzen & Fishbein,
1980).
Attitude is a distinct construct from the collection of
behavioral beliefs that an individual has regarding the
likely outcomes of a behavior.

Definition
One assumes that others are usually benevolent, have
integrity, and are competent.
Regardless of what one believes about people's attributes,
one assumes better outcomes result from dealing with
people as though they are well meaning and reliable.
One believes that the environment is in proper order and
success is likely because the situation (institution) is normal
(favorable), benevolent, competent, and has integrity.
One believes that structures, like guarantees, regulations,
promises, legal recourse or other procedures are in place to
promote success.
Trustee caring and motivation to act in the trustor’s interests.
Trustee honesty and promise keeping.
Ability of the trustee to do what the trustor needs.
Volitional preparedness to make oneself vulnerable to the
trustee.
The perceived likelihood that one will depend on the other.

Probability of Depending

Table 1. Summary of Constructs and Definitions
TRA depicts attitude as an aggregate of an
individual’s beliefs about the behavior, and there are
other external factors that influence an individual’s
beliefs (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980). In the McKnight
Model, disposition to trust (an individual difference
construct) and institutional trust are external
determinants of trusting beliefs, and trusting intentions
are then jointly determined by these three constructs.
The McKnight Model departs from TRA by omitting
attitude and subjective norm, and by including direct
paths between the external determinants and trusting
intentions.

The research model for this study, the Extended Trust
Model, is shown in Figure 2. In this model, trusting
attitude is defined as an individual’s positive or
negative evaluation of trusting an NID system. Based
upon TRA, the set of salient NID-related beliefs
provides a foundation to build trusting attitude, and
trusting attitude determines trusting intention. Thus, in
the context of trust in an NID system,
H1a: Trusting beliefs positively affect trusting
attitude.
H1b: Trusting attitude positively affects trusting
intention.

<-----Page 3----->The subjective norm construct is related to other
constructs in the model through TRA and the social
process of internalization (Kelman, 1958). TRA
predicts that subjective norm will positively affect
trusting intention. An internalization process occurs
when social influence indirectly affects an individual’s
behavior by changing his/her values. Internalization
predicts that someone may incorporate a referent’s
belief into one’s own belief structure if the important
referent thinks that he/she should perform a behavior.
Earlier research posits that the internalization process
of subjective norm indirectly affects behavioral
intention through attitude (Davis et al., 1989; Kelman,
1958) and through beliefs (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000).
Thus, the internalization process suggests that
subjective norm may affect trusting beliefs and
trusting attitudes.
In the current study, subjective norm is defined as the
social influence on trust, whether important referents
think one should trust or not trust an NID system, and
is included as a determinant of trusting beliefs,
trusting attitude, and trusting intention with regard to
an NID system. Thus, in the context of trust in an NID
system,
H2a: Subjective norm positively affects trusting
beliefs.
H2b: Subjective norm positively affects trusting
attitude.
H2c: Subjective norm positively affects trusting
intention.

Research Methodology
Instrument Development
The scales used to operationalize the constructs in
this study were taken or adapted from existing scales
whenever possible. The scales are summarized in
Table 2, and the scale items are included in Appendix
A. The scales for disposition to trust were taken
directly from McKnight et al. (2002). The scales for
institution-based trust, trusting beliefs, and trusting
intention (general willingness to depend) were
adapted from McKnight et al. (2002).
The scales for the constructs of trusting attitude,
subjective norm, and trusting intention (probability of
depending) were developed according to the TRA
guidelines provided by Ajzen and Fishbein (1980) and
from other scales that followed these guidelines
(Ajzen & Driver, 1991; Hrubes et al., 2001; McKnight
et al., 2002). The guidelines specify that these
constructs should be defined based upon the
potential behaviors or actions toward the object of
interest. Given the object of interest, NID systems, the
three behaviors identified were 1) advocating an NID
system; 2) providing personal information to an NID
system; and 3) using an NID card. These same three
behaviors were used to operationalize the measures
for attitude, subjective norm, and probability of
depending (sub-construct of trusting intention).

Table 3. Descriptive Statistics
Data Collection
The data for this study were collected through
questionnaires administered in a 3-step experimental
setting. The subjects were initially asked to complete
a pre-survey that included demographic questions
and the scale for disposition to trust. The disposition
to trust scale was included in a pre-survey to avoid
confounding these trust-related individual differences
with beliefs and attitudes toward a specific trusting
object. Unlike the McKnight study, our subjects did
not interact with a representation of an NID system
during the experimental procedures, and thus we
measured initial trust prior to any system interaction.
The subjects then reviewed some prepared material
on the topic of NID systems and were given an
assignment to search for information on NID systems
on the Internet. These experimental interventions
were designed to provide enough second-hand
knowledge on NID systems for subjects to form initial
trust perceptions. After the experimental interventions,
a post-survey containing the remaining scales was
administered.
The subjects for this study were undergraduate
students enrolled in a sophomore level business
course. A pilot study was initially conducted with 59
subjects to determine whether any refinement of the
experimental process and scales was required.
Internal consistency validity was assessed with the

112

pilot study results and found to be acceptable
(Cronbach α’s ranged from 0.82 to 0.97) (Nunnally &
Bernstein, 1994). The final data collection included
390 subjects (228 males, 162 females) with an
average age of 20.6. The use of students as subjects
for this study was in keeping with the original work
that this study extends (McKnight et al., 2002).
Limitations from the use of student subjects are
discussed in the conclusion section of this paper.

Results and Discussion
The means and standard deviations for each
construct and sub-construct are shown in Table 3.
Data analysis was performed with AMOS 4.0 for
structural equation modeling with maximum likelihood
estimation. The measurement model results are first
discussed, then the structural regression model
results are presented. The results of the data analysis
are then summarized and discussed.
Measurement Model
The measurement model was analyzed and
confirmatory factor analysis performed using the
same procedures followed by McKnight et al. (2002).
Confirmatory factor analysis was initially performed
for each second-order construct using the individual
scale items for each sub-construct. The standardized

Note: Trusting attitude and subjective norm items are included in Table 5.

Table 4. Standardized Loadings (all loadings p<.0001) for Scale Items
loadings for these items were all >.7, and thus in an
acceptable range (Gefen et at., 2000), as shown in
Table 4. In addition, these constructs appeared to be
unidimensional
as
all
standardized
residual
covariances were less than the recommended 2.58
cutoff (Gefen, 2003).
Confirmatory factor analysis was then performed on
the overall measurement model after averaging the
scale items for the sub-constructs and treating the
means as direct observations. Research has shown
that the averaging of items may provide adequate
estimates when working with a large number of
observed variables (Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994;
Yuan et al., 1997).1 Detailed measurement models
and fit statistics for the second order constructs and
the overall model are provided in Appendix B. The
standardized loadings and fit statistics for the overall
model are shown in Table 5.
1

The particular approach that we used is referred to as a partial
aggregation model with hierarchical organization of components, in
which a single latent construct is represented by dimensions of the
construct that serve as indicators (Bagozzi & Heatherton, 1994). The
factor loadings and error terms for the averaged items (dimensions)
are not fixed, and thus are estimated through maximum likelihood
estimation, allowing the model to incorporate measurement error.

The standardized loadings shown in Table 5 were
largely acceptable with most being >.7. Two of the
items for disposition to trust (faith in humanitycompetence = .54, trusting stance = .56) were less
than .7. These two items did not appear to cross load
with other constructs in the model. The literature on
disposition to trust presents faith in humanity and
trusting stance as two dimensions of this construct,
and given the lower loading for trusting stance and
similar findings (.56) by McKnight et al. (2002), future
research should consider whether these two
dimensions are distinct constructs. The lower loading
that we found for faith in humanity-competence, and
the lower loading found by McKnight et al. (2002) for
faith in humanity-benevolence (.52), further suggest
that the dimensions of disposition to trust may be
better represented as individual constructs or perhaps
modeled as formative indicators. We retained the
current structure of the model in order to facilitate our
comparison with the McKnight model. The fit statistics
shown in Table 5 were within acceptable ranges
(Gefen et al., 2000), and were just slightly lower than
those obtained in the McKnight et al. (2002) study,
which may be attributed to the difference in sample
sizes (current study n=390, McKnight n=1403).

0.9, GFI and AGFI just slightly less that 0.9, and

85% of the variance in trusting intention. As shown in
Figure 3, all hypothesized relationships were
supported at p<.001. In addition, two paths in the
McKnight Model, from disposition to trust and

114

institution-based trust to trusting intention, were nonsignificant, supporting the TRA premise that external
factors only affect the whole model through their
influence on beliefs. McKnight et al. (2002) found
similar empirical results for the paths from these
trusting antecedents to trusting intention.
Additional analysis was performed to test whether
trusting attitude fully or partially mediated the
relationship between trusting beliefs and trusting
intentions. A multiple regression, 3-step procedure

Table 6. Tests for Mediating Effect of Trusting Attitude

was conducted (Baron & Kenny, 1986), as shown in
Table 6. The results of this additional analysis
suggest that trusting attitude partially mediates the
relationship between trusting beliefs and trusting
intentions, as trusting beliefs still have a direct effect
on trusting intentions when intentions are regressed
on both trusting beliefs and attitude. The significant
drop in the beta coefficients for trusting beliefs from
step 2 to step 3 (.749 to .290), along with the high
beta coefficient for trusting attitude (.614), suggests
however, that trusting attitude is an important
predictor of trusting intentions and should be included
in the model.
Variance Explained

trusting attitude and subjective norm significantly
increased the variance explained in trusting intentions
from .705 to .849, a change of .144 (or a 20%
increase in variance explained), with attitude
providing the majority of the increase. In addition,
subjective norm significantly increased the variance
explained in both trusting beliefs and trusting attitude.
The variance accounted for in trusting beliefs and
trusting attitude increased by .293 (102%) and .075
(11%), respectively. As shown in Table 8, the fit
measures remain acceptable despite the added
complexity of this model.
Implications

A comparison of the McKnight Model and the
Extended Trust Model results is provided in Tables 7
and 8. The McKnight Model provides a baseline for
determining whether the Extended Trust Model
explains more variance in trusting intentions. Squared
multiple correlations (SMCs) for the endogenous
constructs in this baseline model are first compared to
an extended model that includes trusting attitude, and
then to the full, extended model that includes both
trusting attitude and subjective norm. The addition of

The empirical results suggest that the addition of
attitude and subjective norm to McKnight’s model of
initial trust does provide additional insight into user’s
trusting beliefs and trusting intentions toward an NID
system. The results also indicate that the opinions of
others, subjective norm, have a greater impact on
trusting beliefs than both disposition to trust and
institutional trust combined in this context.

systems and how external factors may influence trust.

Conclusion
An existing and well-accepted trust model, the
McKnight Model, was extended to understand trust in
information systems, specifically, NID systems. The
McKnight et al. (2002) study was replicated in the
context of NID systems and two constructs, attitude
and subjective norm, were added to the model.
Empirical results show that significantly more variance
in trusting intentions and trusting beliefs were
explained by adding attitude and subjective norm to
the model. The findings of this study have significant
practical implications given the importance of NID
systems in national security. The extended model also
has a stronger theoretical foundation, as it is more
consistent with TRA.
One limitation of the study is the use of student
subjects, as students do not necessarily represent the
views of the diverse population that would use an NID
system. Also, the controlled, experimental nature of
the study is another limitation as it provides less
external validity than a field study conducted prior to
the implementation of an actual NID system. Lastly,
the model was tested in only one context, limiting its
generalizability to trust with other types of information
systems.
Future research is needed to apply the extended trust
model to other contexts involving trust with information
systems. A longitudinal study would be useful in
understanding how the determinants of trusting
intentions and behaviors change over time, and with
actual use of a system. Our study measured initial
trust before system use. Longitudinal studies that
measure user trust after system use may provide
broader insight into user trust. Future studies could
also measure normative beliefs, in addition to
subjective norm, to more closely conform with TRA
(Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980) and to better understand the
influence of normative perceptions on trusting beliefs,
attitude, and intentions. Research on the disposition to
trust construct is needed to determine whether the
current representation as a reflective, single construct
is most appropriate. The findings of this study also
suggest that the construct of attitude should be
revisited in general user acceptance models in IS
research. Early work on user acceptance excluded
attitude based upon the results of multiple regression
analysis (Davis et al., 1989), whereas the more
comprehensive analysis provided with structural
equation modeling may provide more insight.
