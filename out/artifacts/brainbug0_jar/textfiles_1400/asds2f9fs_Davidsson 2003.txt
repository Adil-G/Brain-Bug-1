ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH:
SOME SUGGESTIONS
Per Davidsson
DEVELOPMENT – AND LACK THEREOF – IN
ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH
There is progress in entrepreneurship research. Important works in entrepreneurship increasingly appear in highly respected, mainstream journals (see Busenitz
et al., 2003; Davidsson, Low & Wright, 2001). There is conceptual development
that attracts attention (e.g. Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) and handbooks are
compiled, providing the field with more of a common body of knowledge (Acs
& Audretsch, 2003a; Shane, 2000a; Westhead & Wright, 2000). Further, there
is evidence of methodological improvements (Chandler & Lyon, 2001) and
accumulation of meaningful findings on various levels of analysis (Davidsson
& Wiklund, 2001). Moreover, due to time lags in publication the reported
improvements are likely to be underestimated. This author’s experience as
organizer, reviewer and participant in core entrepreneurship conferences on both
sides of the Atlantic (e.g. Babson; RENT) suggests that much of the lower end of
the quality distribution has either disappeared from the submissions or is screened
out in the review process. Much more than used to be the case a few years back we
find among the presented papers research that is truly theory-driven; research on
the earliest stages of business development, and research that employs methods
suitable for causal inference, i.e. experiments and longitudinal designs.

PER DAVIDSSON

This is not to deny that there is confusion, signs of identity crisis, or widespread
frustration among entrepreneurship researchers because of a sense that the field
of entrepreneurship research has not come “far enough, fast enough” (Low, 2001)
or that we are “getting more pieces of the puzzle, but no picture is emerging”
(Koppl & Minniti, 2003). The literature is full of definitions of entrepreneurship,
which differ along a number of dimensions, e.g. whether entrepreneurship should
be defined in terms of dispositions, behavior, or outcomes,1 whether it belongs
in the economic-commercial domain or can be exercised also in not-for-profit
contexts; whether it belongs only in small and/or owner-managed ﬁrms or in any
organizational context, and whether purpose, growth, risk, innovation or success
are necessary criteria for something to qualify as entrepreneurship (Gartner, 1990;
Hébert & Link, 1982; Kirzner, 1983).
There is, no doubt, disagreement on conceptual issues and a perceived need
to try to sort these out (Bruyat & Julien, 2000; Gartner, 2001; Low, 2001; Shane
& Venkataraman, 2000, 2001; Singh, 2001; Zahra & Dess, 2001). There are also
numerous empirical attempts to understand the field or assess it progress (Aldrich
& Baker, 1997; Busenitz et al., 2003; Cooper, 2003; Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001;
Grégoire, Déry & Béchard, 2001; Landström, 2001; Low, 2001; Meeks, Neck &
Meyer, 2001; Meyer, Neck & Meeks, 2002; Reader & Watkins, 2001). Of these,
Low (2001, p. 20) and Meeks et al. (2001) find almost no order at all in empirical
work published under the entrepreneurship label. The others find meaningful
patterns but also reason for frustration, or even for very pessimistic views on the
future and potential contribution of the field.
I personally think that on the contrary, we now finally have the intellectual
building blocks in place that are necessary for the creation of a strong paradigm
in entrepreneurship, which can lead to academic credibility and respect as well
as a stream of scholarly and practically meaningful research contributions. The
purpose of this manuscript is to facilitate further progress in entrepreneurship
through elaboration on several such intellectual building blocks. Drawing predominantly on ideas developed by Kirzner (1973), Venkataraman (1997; Shane &
Venkataraman, 2000, 2001) and Gartner (1988, 2001), I strive to achieve three
things. Firstly, I want to make a clearer distinction between the definition of entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon, and the delineation or entrepreneurship
as a scholarly domain. These are not identical. The former describes the function
of entrepreneurship in society, while the latter suggests what entrepreneurship
researchers should study in order to generate maximum knowledge about this
societal phenomenon. Arguably, the distinction should make it easier both to
agree upon and communicate what entrepreneurship is, on the one hand, and
what entrepreneurship research should study on the other. In addition, it may be
useful to regard the teaching subject “entrepreneurship” as a – in part – separate

<-----Page 2----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

317

issue. Second, I want to achieve a domain delineation that is more complete than
its predecessors; one which makes room for both Venkataraman’s and Gartner’s
views on entrepreneurship, and which tries to find an agreeable middle ground on
important issues where entrepreneurship scholars seemingly disagree. This may
seem an insurmountable task given the apparent conflict and confusion reported
above. However, I believe that a lot of the apparent conflict is superficial and
can be reconciled. Third, I want to go further than the predecessors in pointing
out what the suggested domain delineation implies for the design and analysis of
empirical research on entrepreneurship.
In the next section, I will discuss entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon,
arguing that from this perspective Kirzner’s (1973) notion that entrepreneurship
consists of the competitive behaviors that drive the market process is highly
useful. I will then turn to entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain, which also
includes a discussion of the central concept “opportunity.” After reviews of
Venkataraman’s (1997; cf. Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) and Gartner’s (1988)
viewpoints I will propose that when talking about the scholarly domain, we would
benefit from a delineation that does not presuppose the outcome, and focus on the
behaviors undertaken in the processes of discovery and exploitation of ideas for
new business ventures. The scholarly domain, then, should study these processes
as well as their antecedents and effects.
I will further discuss how entrepreneurship relates to other scholarly domains,
essentially agreeing with Low (2001) that “entrepreneurship as distinct domain”
and “entrepreneurship belongs in the disciplines” are, in fact, mutually dependent
strategies for the development of the field. Before concluding I will also discuss
some of the many methodological challenges that arise for entrepreneurship
research because of issues related to emergence, process, heterogeneity, and level
of analysis.

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS SOCIETAL PHENOMENON
Many scholars include in their understanding of the concept “entrepreneurship”
the criterion that the outcome is somehow successful or influential. Others hold
that entrepreneurs act under genuine uncertainty and that therefore one should
base the definition on the behavior itself and not the outcome, which is more or
less contingent on luck (cf. Gartner, 1990). This is a strong indication that we
need to separate entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon – its role in societal
organization and/or the economic system – from entrepreneurship as a scholarly
domain, i.e. what entrepreneurship research should study. When we think of
entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon it is a distinctive advantage to include

<-----Page 3----->318

PER DAVIDSSON

an outcome criterion and make clear, for example, that mere contemplation over
radically new ideas or vain introduction of fatally flawed ones do not amount to
“entrepreneurship.” It is along with this type of view on entrepreneurship, then, that
criteria like “wealth creation” or “value creation” rightfully belong (Drucker, 1985;
Morris, 1998).
A discussion of entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon, including an
outcome criterion, benefits from the work of economic theorists. The major
intellectual building block I will use in this section is the notion in Austrian
economics that entrepreneurship consists of the competitive behaviors that drive
the market process (Kirzner, 1973, pp. 19–20).2 This definition is based jointly on
behavior and outcomes. I choose this definition because it gives a satisfactorily
clear delineation of the role of entrepreneurship in society. It puts entrepreneurship
squarely in a market context and makes clear that it is the suppliers who exercise
entrepreneurship – not customers, legislators, or natural forces that also affect
outcomes in the market.
The “drive the market process” part is about the outcome: entrepreneurship
makes a difference. If it does not, it is not entrepreneurship. That is, sellers who
introduce new, improved or competing offerings in an emerging or pre-existing
market give presumptive buyers new choice alternatives to consider, attract
additional new entrants as followers, and/or give incumbent firms in existing
markets reason to, in turn, improve their market offerings. As a result, resources
are put to more effective and/or efficient use. This is what driving the market
process means, and this is what entrepreneurship does. Importantly, driving the
market process does not require that the first mover makes a profit but refers to the
suppliers as a collective. Even if it eventually loses out the first mover contributes
to driving the market process if subsequently someone gets it right, which leads
to a lasting change in the market.
Put in slightly different words, entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon is
the introduction of new economic activity that leads to change in the marketplace
(cf. Herbert Simon in Sarasvathy, 1999b, pp. 2 and 11). This is illustrated in Fig. 1.
Note that “new” along the market axis means either that an entirely new market
emerges, or that an activity is new to an existing market. Likewise along the firm
axis “new” means that the new activity is an independent start-up, i.e. a new firm
emerges as a result, or it is an internal new venture, i.e. the activity is new to
the firm.
Under the suggested definition the left hand side of the figure – quadrants I
and IV – exemplify entrepreneurship, whereas quadrants II and III do not. This
conjures also with the argument developed at some length by Baumol (1993) in
that imitative entry and internationalization are included in the concept, whereas,
e.g. take-over is excluded.

Fig. 1. Firm and Market Newness of Economic Activities.

New Offer as Entrepreneurship
Starting with quadrant I the first entry reads “New offer.” This refers to the situation
where something so new is introduced that a new market is created (Bhave, 1994,
p. 231; Sarasvathy, 1999a) or at least no supplier has previously made the same
offer in the same market. There is hardly any disagreement among scholars that
this should be included in the concept of entrepreneurship, although some might
want to restrict the inclusion to situations where a new and/or independent firm is
behind the new offer.
The first category, new product or service, corresponds to Schumpeter’s (1934)
“new product” and Bhave’s (1994) notion of “product novelty,” respectively, and
requires no further explanation. The second category, new bundle, refers to any
combination of product and service components that – as a package deal – is unique
relative to what has previously been offered on the market, although no individual
component may be strictly new. This overlaps with Schumpeter’s (1934) general
idea about “new combinations,” with Bhave’s (1994) notion of “new business
concept,” and with Amit and Zott’s (2000) “new business model” – as long as
the new combination, concept or model includes newness as perceived by buyers
and competitors. In some cases it amounts to Schumpeter’s (1934) category
“re-organization of an entire industry.” An illustrative case is IKEA, where the

<-----Page 5----->320

PER DAVIDSSON

newness was not in the piece of furniture in use, but in the division of labor among
different actors, including the consumer, in the production and distribution of
the end product.
IKEA would also qualify under the third category included in “new offer,” new
price/value relation. This does not create a new market but drives the market
process because it changes consumer choices and give other competitors reason
to change their offerings. Consequently, Kirzner (1973, pp. 23–24) explicitly
discusses offering the same product at a lower price as one form of entrepreneurship. A new price/value relation may be contingent upon organizational change
(quadrant II), but this is not necessarily the case. It may also represent a strategic
change that relies on expected scale economies in production or a switch from
low volume/high margin to high volume/low margin strategy.

New Competitor as Entrepreneurship
The second main entry in quadrant I is “New competitor.” This is when a new,
start-up firm enters the market, or an existing firm launches a new product line
in a situation where other firms already supply the market with essentially the
same product. That is, I suggest that not only innovative but also imitative entry be included in the entrepreneurship concept (cf. Aldrich, 1999; Aldrich &
Martinez, 2001). The reason for imitative entry to be included in the entrepreneurship concept is that such entry drives the market process in the sense that consumers
get additional choices and incumbent firms get reason to change their behavior to
meet this new competition.
Moreover, it has been observed that entry with complete lack of novelty tends
not to appear empirically (Bhave, 1994, p. 230; Davidsson, 1986). No entrant is
a perfect clone of an existing actor. Therefore, trying to include an innovativeness
criterion in the definition of entrepreneurship would create problems. Rather
than drawing the line at zero innovation (which would exclude no cases) one
would be forced to define an arbitrary limit across different industries and
types of novelty. This problem is aggravated by the fact that what appears
new in one market may be a blueprint copy of what already runs successfully
in a different market (Gratzer, 1996). All in all, then, there are several good
reasons to include imitative market entry in the concept of entrepreneurship as
a societal phenomenon. While both aspects of the entrepreneurship, it may be
advantageous to model the antecedents and effects of “innovation” and “imitative”
new ventures differently in theories and empirical analyses (cf. Samuelsson,
forthcoming).

Geographical Market Expansion as Entrepreneurship
Defining entrepreneurship the way we have done makes it logical to include also
quadrant IV – geographical market expansion – in the concept of entrepreneurship. Although by now the activities are (largely) no longer new from the firm’s
perspective their introduction in new markets – if not totally unsuccessful – drives
the market process in these new places. This may to some look like over-extending
the entrepreneurship concept. However, when IKEA enters its nth country market
it may well be as revolutionary for the consumers and competitors in that market
as it was for Swedish consumers and furniture retailers when IKEA first developed
its concept. If IKEA’s entry is successful it reflects Schumpeter’s (1934) “new
market” category of economic development. The alternative to require newness
to the firm as a criterion would lead to less desirable consequences. For example,
had Southwest Airlines successfully introduced their concept in the European
market it would not constitute entrepreneurship. If instead a new actor (e.g. Ryan
Air) copied the concept and took it to the European market it would count as
entrepreneurship. This is less than satisfactory from any perspective, and from a
market perspective it is unacceptable.

Organizational and Ownership Changes are not Entrepreneurship
By contrast, according to our conceptualization the organizational and ownership
changes listed in quadrant II do not by themselves constitute entrepreneurship. It
is certainly conceivable (and likely) that reorganization facilitates the creation of
new economic activity by the organization. However, it is also conceivable that
organizational units that are transferred to new ownership and/or undergo internal
reorganization experience changes in job satisfaction and/or financial performance
without at all changing the consumers’ choice options or influencing the behavior
of competitors. Actually, there are at least four cases: (a) an organizational or
ownership change is intended to lead to more new market offerings by the firm,
and does so; (b) same as (a) but the intended increase in new market offerings
does not happen; (c) the change is undertaken for other reasons and has no effect
on the firm’s market offerings; and (d) the change is undertaken for other reasons
but has the unintended effect of also making the firm more entrepreneurial. I think
it is valuable to conceptually separate the organizational or ownership change
from its effects. Therefore, it is the (successful or influential) launching of new
business activities that might follow from it, and not the organizational change
itself, that constitutes entrepreneurship.

<-----Page 7----->322

PER DAVIDSSON

The argument is perhaps easier to accept if we move to the level of societal
organization. Politicians can decide on changes in how society is organized
and introduce, e.g. de-regulation or other institutional changes which create
opportunity in market x and therefore an increase in competitive behaviors that
drive the market process in that market, i.e. entrepreneurship. According to
my argument, it is not the politician who exercises entrepreneurship in market
x, but the micro-level actors in that market. The political decision facilitates
entrepreneurship. In the same way, a manager may facilitate entrepreneurship
through organizational change, but it is the market related activities that may
result, and not the organizational change per se, that constitute entrepreneurship.
This conceptual distinction is also the reason why I refrain from including
Schumpeter’s (1934) “new production method” and “new source of supply,” as
well as Bhave’s (1994) “novelty in production technology,” in the definition of
entrepreneurship as societal phenomenon (cf. Davidsson, Delmar & Wiklund,
2002; Kirzner, 1983, p. 288). As we shall see, the study of how organizational
change relates to discovery and exploitation of new venture ideas remain an
important question for entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain.

Business as Usual and Non-Entrepreneurial Growth
Turning now to quadrant IV, “Business as usual” here is at first glance as easy to
exclude from the notion of entrepreneurship, as was “New offer” in quadrant I easy
to include. But not even here does there seem to exist full agreement. First, we
have von Mises’ denial of the existence of such a thing as “business as usual” when
saying that “In any real and living economy every actor is always an entrepreneur”
(Mises, 1949, p. 253). One can argue that no market action is completely void
of novelty. For example, when a daily newspaper carries out the totally expected
and routine actions of producing a new issue and distributing it to its subscribers
and usual sales outlets, it is a new issue, and not yesterday’s paper, that is being
distributed. Competitors will equally routinely read it, and it cannot be ruled out
that some part of the contents may have a twist that inspires the competitor to do
something in a future issue, which it would otherwise not have done. In other words,
we find an element of “competitive behavior that drives the market process” in these
routine actions. Although this seems to lead to a delimitation problem similar to
the arbitrary innovation criterion discussed above, my conclusion in this case goes
in the other direction. That is, there is a lot of “known products for known buyers”
activity going on that is so clearly predominantly of a “business as usual” character
that it is not very difficult to classify it as such both conceptually and empirically,
and thus exclude it from entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon.

<-----Page 8----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

323

More problematic, perhaps, is the fact that there exist explicit and implicit
definitions of entrepreneurship, which do not clearly require that “business as
usual” be excluded. For example, Cole (1949) defined entrepreneurship as “a
purposeful activity to initiate, maintain and aggrandize a profit-oriented business.”
This means that he included mere “maintenance” while stressing “freedom of
decision” (p. 88), making entrepreneurship equal to “starting and/or running
and/or expanding one’s own firm.”3 Although explicit reference to Cole is
infrequent, this is a recurrent implicit definition in research published under
the “entrepreneurship” label. While I hold that many differences in views on
entrepreneurship can be reconciled or are of marginal importance, this is not one
of them. When entrepreneurship is defined as the competitive behaviors that drive
the market process, “business as usual” can never be included.
The issue of non-entrepreneurial growth is tricky for slightly different reasons
(see Davidsson, 2002, for an elaborate discussion). When an economic actor
exploits a venture idea, there will be no well-defined moment at which “entry”
ends and “continued, routine exploitation” begins. Schumpeter (1934) held
that mere volume expansion was not entrepreneurial, while he included the
opening of new markets. It is a similar distinction I have in mind here. By
“non-entrepreneurial growth” I mean passively or re-actively letting existing
activities grow with the market. This would not provide much cause for alert
among competitors nor give customers new choices.

Outcomes on Different Levels
It was pointed out in the beginning of this section that while we have included an
outcome criterion in the definition of entrepreneurship, it is not necessary that each
and every individual venture that drives the market process is successful in itself.
This is illustrated in Fig. 2. “Venture” could here mean the sole activity of a new
firm or a new, additional activity by an established firm. Thus, “venture” should not
be interpreted (necessarily) as new firm or company, but as a new-to-the-market
activity as discussed above.
Naı̈ve conceptions of venture outcomes typically classify them as successes
or failures. Figure 2 complicates the picture by considering outcomes on two
levels, venture and society. If we turn first to quadrant I we find ventures that are
successful in themselves and which produce net utility to society as well. These
ventures are analytically unproblematic. Their successful entries into the market
no doubt “drive the market process” and hence they exercise entrepreneurship
under the definition we have chosen. Likewise, the failed ventures in quadrant III
are analytically unproblematic. These represent launching efforts that do not take

<-----Page 9----->324

PER DAVIDSSON

off financially, and neither do they inspire followers or incumbent firms so that
the eventual net effect becomes positive on the societal level.
The catalyst ventures in quadrant IV are an interesting category, and probably
make up a large share of all new ventures (internal or independent) in any real
economy. Although not successful on the micro-level – perhaps because they are
outsmarted by followers or retaliating incumbents – they do “drive the market
process” precisely because they bring forth such behavior on the part of other
actors. An unsuccessful venture that inspires more profitable successors does
not complete the entrepreneurial process but still contributes to entrepreneurship
as a societal phenomenon. As the total effect on the economy is not necessarily
smaller than for “success ventures” the catalysts are a very important category
from a societal point of view (cf. Low & MacMillan, 1988; McGrath, 1999). This
should serve as a warning against too simplistic a view on micro-level failure.
The ventures in quadrants I and IV, then, represent entrepreneurship while the
failed ventures in quadrant III do not. What about the “Re-distributive” ventures
in quadrant II? These are ventures that yield a surplus on the micro-level while
at the same time the societal outcome is negative. Examples could be trafficking
with heavy drugs or – as in an actual case in Sweden – a graffiti removal operation
whose owners used nighttime to generate demand for their business. Thus, those
involved in the venture enrich themselves at the expense of collective wealth.4
Does this represent entrepreneurship? It has been pointed out that re-distribution
of wealth is an important function of entrepreneurship in capitalist economies

<-----Page 10----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

325

(Kirchhoff, 1994). However, what has here been labeled “success ventures” also
re-distribute wealth, in addition to creating new wealth. The theoretical status
of “re-distributive” ventures is determined, I would argue, by the answer to
“towards what?” entrepreneurship drives the market process. Schumpeter (1934)
and Kirzner (1973, p. 73) give seemingly contradictory answers to that question,
but in actual fact the movement from Schumpeter’s (local) equilibrium and the
movement towards Kirzner’s (global) equilibrium are in full agreement insofar
as that entrepreneurship drives the market process towards more effective and/or
efficient use of resources. Therefore, I would on theoretical grounds suggest that
“re-distributive” ventures do not represent entrepreneurship.5 Entrepreneurship
as a societal phenomenon leads to improved use of resources in the economic
system as a whole.
The portrayal of possible outcomes in Fig. 2 is, of course, still a radical
simplification. Outcomes are described as dichotomous and no explicit time
horizon was introduced. Only two out of many possible levels of outcomes
(e.g. venture, firm, industry, region, nation, world) were discussed. In practice,
assessing exactly where individual ventures fit into this framework would in
many cases be very difficult, and contingent on the time perspective. Nonetheless,
I think it is useful to highlight the distinctions made here and to note that as
theoretical categories not only “success ventures” but also “catalyst ventures”
carry out the entrepreneurial function in the economy, whereas neither “failed
ventures” nor “re-distributive ventures” fulfill this role.

Degrees of Entrepreneurship?
The inclusion of imitative entry, as well as the admittedly vague borderline
between the end of the entrepreneurial exploitation process and the beginning of
non-entrepreneurial growth, call for a discussion of “degrees” of entrepreneurship
(cf. Davidsson, 1989; Schafer, 1990; Tay, 1998). It seems natural to treat
entrepreneurship not as a dichotomous variable, but to say that some ventures
show more entrepreneurship than others. But what should be the criterion
by which we judge the degree of entrepreneurship? There are at least three
possibilities:
The degree of (direct and indirect) impact on the economic system. This
is a criterion that is consistent with defining entrepreneurship as the competitive behaviors that drive the market process. In a theoretical discussion of
entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon, then, this should be the preferred
criterion, i.e. the most correct one. For research practice the criterion has severe
shortcomings because impact can only be assessed after the fact and not in real

<-----Page 11----->326

PER DAVIDSSON

time, and because even then it can be very difficult to obtain even roughly correct
estimates of total impact of direct and indirect effects on a complex economic
system. A variation (or an indicator) of this criterion is “how much net wealth is
created,” but this suffers from similar assessment problems.
The degree of novelty to the market. This is intuitively appealing in the
sense that what is more creative is seen as a higher degree of entrepreneurship.
Although the above-discussed problem of comparing very different kinds of
novelty pertains to this criterion it has the advantage that it can be reasonably well
assessed in real time. The main problem is that while successfully introduced
innovative new activities are likely to have larger market impact on average,
there is no guarantee that a high degree of novelty ascertains market effect.
History is full of weirdo inventions that nobody wanted or cared about. Some
seemingly relatively marginal innovations revolutionize markets and create great
private and societal wealth while some radical innovations have marginal impact
or fail altogether. Therefore, when market effect is part of the definition of
entrepreneurship the degree of novelty is at best a rough proxy for degree of
entrepreneurship.
The degree of novelty to the actor. Sometimes expressions like “That was very
entrepreneurial of you (or of that firm)” are heard, meaning that the action was
radically different from what that actor has done before (but not necessarily very
novel or valuable as the market sees it). Relating the degree of entrepreneurship to
the history of the actor rather than to the market in this way has highly undesirable
consequences. With this type of criterion previous inactivity or conservatism
increases an actor’s potential for showing a high degree of entrepreneurship.
Moreover, it is a criterion that regards it more entrepreneurial to do something
totally unrelated to one’s prior experience. Theories as well as empirical findings
suggest this may not be a wise move (Barney, 1991; Sarasvathy, 2001; Shane,
2000b). I would therefore discourage its use in any academic context.
In all, while there is a conceptual need for discussing “degrees of entrepreneurship” there is no easy or straightforward way to actually assess such variation.
Of the available alternatives, the degree of impact on the economic system
is the criterion that matches the definition of entrepreneurship (as a societal
phenomenon) that I have proposed. One might conceive of entrepreneurship
itself as a graded phenomenon or hold that empirical instances that qualitatively
are instances of entrepreneurship have quantitatively different impact on the
economic system. I do not believe it to be a hugely important distinction whether it
is entrepreneurship itself or its impact that is a matter of degree. However, degree
of novelty either to the market or to the actor is better regarded as a possible cause
of variations in the degree of entrepreneurship (or impact of entrepreneurship)
than being a direct measure of such variation.

Conclusions on Entrepreneurship as a Societal Phenomenon
I have suggested here that entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon consists of
the competitive behaviors that drive the market process (towards more effective
and efficient use of resources). In contexts where less precision is required the even
easier and roughly equivalent entrepreneurship is the creation of new economic
activity can be used. Relative to many other alternatives I would argue that the
suggested definitions have advantages in terms of being clearly delimited, logically
coherent, and easy to communicate. They are clearly and fully explained as “when
a supplier introduces something on a market so that buyers get a new alternative to
choose from (potentially increasing the value they get for their money); this action
may also make incumbent suppliers change their market offerings and/or attract
additional suppliers to the market.”
Further, despite being clearly delimited the definition is permissive in that it does
not take a restrictive stand on purposefulness, innovation, organizational context,
or ownership and personal risk-taking. Hence, while some would like to include
more restriction in the definition they should in these regards at least find room
for their favorite notions of entrepreneurship within the definition suggested here.
Importantly, the view of entrepreneurship I propose is consistent with the views
expressed by professional users of the concept. In Gartner’s empirical analysis,
out of 90 attributes the most agreed upon central features of “entrepreneurship”
were: (1) the creation of a new business; (2) new venture development; and (3)
the creation of a new business that adds value. That is, new activity and successful
outcome are emphasized (note that items 1 and 2 mention new “business” or
“venture” – not “firm” or “organization” – and that item 3 says “adds value” which
may or may not mean micro-level success). By contrast, few regard, e.g. buy-out as
an important entrepreneurship attribute (Gartner, 1990, p. 20). The view I suggest
is also consistent with Lumpkin and Dess’ (1996) definition of entrepreneurship
as “new entry,” which they separate from the concept of “entrepreneurial
orientation.”
In some respects the suggested definition of entrepreneurship as a societal
phenomenon is restrictive, and this may cause some controversy. First, a successful
outcome – at least indirectly in the form of lasting market impact – is required.
As described above this is necessary in order to exclude fundamentally flawed
attempts to launch inferior novelty on the market. The outcome criterion will
be relaxed when we turn to entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain. Second, the
exclusion of organizational change from the definition may arouse opposition.
However, the exclusion concerns organizational change per se. Hence, the study of
how organizational change affects entrepreneurial action remains a valid and important question for entrepreneurship research. For these reasons the exclusions of

<-----Page 13----->328

PER DAVIDSSON

failed ventures and organizational change from the definition are not as restrictive
as it might first seem.
The remaining aspect most likely to be a source of disagreement, I believe,
is the restriction to market situations, to new economic activities. However,
“economic” should not necessarily be interpreted as restricting the term for the
“commercial” domain. Markets or market-like situations exist outside of industry
and commerce. For example, politicians try to appeal to voters and journalists, and
when they find novel ways to do so rival politicians may try to copy or improve
upon winning recipes. In various forms of arts and sports there exist everything
from a fully commercial industry to human action that is governed by entirely
different principles than the market logic. As long as there are close equivalents
to both customers and competitors, it may be meaningful in such domains to talk
about “entrepreneurship” as defined here.
Admitting that similar processes of creative re-combination of resources
occur in other domains as well I believe it is useful to restrict the use of the
entrepreneurship concept at least to the extended domain of market-like situations.
One reason for this is, simply, that it is valuable to make the concept as distinct and
well defined as possible. Moreover, those who want to include novelty through
“new combinations” (Schumpeter, 1934) in any domain of human behavior in the
concept of “entrepreneurship” have reason to contemplate the full implications of
this choice. For example, when this view is applied the events of September 11,
2001, must be considered an entrepreneurship masterpiece. To conceive of a fully
fueled passenger jet as a missile and to combine the idea of hi-jacking with that
of kamikaze attacks is certainly innovative, and in terms of impact – economic
and otherwise – it has few parallels. However, regarding these attacks as driving
market processes is far-fetched, and this author would therefore suggest they be
not regarded an instance of entrepreneurship.6

ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A SCHOLARLY DOMAIN
Entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain7 aims at better understanding of the societal phenomenon we call “entrepreneurship.” Paradoxically, however, delimiting
research only to empirical cases known to qualify under the definition we discussed
above would not lead to maximized knowledge accumulation, and therefore
it does not work adequately as a delineation of this scholarly domain. Most
importantly, while including an outcome criterion is desirable when we discuss
entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon, it becomes a burden when we think
of entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain. This is because we have to be able
to study entrepreneurship as it happens, before the outcome is known. It would

<-----Page 14----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

329

be awkward indeed not to know until afterwards whether one was studying
“entrepreneurship” or not. To study the processes as they happen is important
also in order to avoid selection and hindsight biases. In order to understand the
successful cases we need to study also those that fail. Further, it is not reasonable
to ask of every empirical study of “entrepreneurship” that the outcome on every
relevant level be awaited and assessed. Researchers must be allowed to go deeply
into aspects of the process without following up on the outcomes – and still be
acknowledged for doing “entrepreneurship research.” That is, attempts to offer
buyers new choices should suffice.
Moreover, it is not a given that previous and current entrepreneurship practice
has all the answers needed to develop normative theory about entrepreneurship,
or that finding real cases of “best practice” is the only or most accessible road
towards developing such knowledge (Davidsson, 2002). Empirical entrepreneurship research may be well advised to study induced entrepreneurial situations as
well, such as experiments or simulations (cf. Baron & Brush, 1998; Fiet, 2002;
Sarasvathy, 1999a).
While helpful for clarifying the role of entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon, Kirzner’s (1973) theorizing – like that of many other economists –
only provides limited guidance for what empirical studies should be conducted
in order to understand and facilitate entrepreneurship. There is little process
perspective on individual entrepreneurial events in Kirzner’s analysis. Discovery
is conceived of as instantaneous and ascribed to “alertness” – an ability that is
costless and thus has to be inborn, or – as critics have pointed out – equivalent to
luck (Demsetz, 1983; Fiet, 2002). Neither does Kirzner consider exploitation to
be part of entrepreneurship.8 Kirzner’s interest is to distill the theoretical kernel
of the function of entrepreneurship in the economic system and not to guide
empirical research.9
To seek guidance for entrepreneurship as scholarly domain – including
empirical work – we will have to look elsewhere. Acknowledging that others
have also made important contributions to giving direction to entrepreneurship
research (e.g. Aldrich, 1999; Fiet, 2002; Low, 2001; Low & MacMillan, 1988;
Sexton, 1997; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990) I will concentrate on the contributions
of the two probably most persistent and cited proponents of entrepreneurship as
a distinct domain of research, Bill Gartner and Sankaran Venkataraman.
The reasons why I focus on those two perspectives are the following. First, as
I see it, each represents a major step forward towards making entrepreneurship
a coherent, productive and respected scholarly domain. However, each also
contains elements that may make it difficult for some prospective followers to
fully embrace them. Secondly, there are emerging signs of a divide between those
two perspectives. This is an unfortunate and unnecessary development. As I see it,

<-----Page 15----->330

PER DAVIDSSON

with some clarification, elaboration and slight modification, the two perspectives
can be combined and extended into a delineation of the scholarly domain of
entrepreneurship that current “entrepreneurship researchers” as well as outside
observers can appreciate.
Venkataraman’s View
Venkataraman’s suggested delineation of the field was first presented to a broader
audience in Venkataraman (1997). It has subsequently been refined and elaborated
by Shane and Venkataraman (2000). The latter state as their point of departure
(2000, p. 217) that “For a field of social science to have usefulness it must have
a conceptual framework that explains and predicts a set of empirical phenomena
not explained or predicted by conceptual frameworks already in existence in other
fields.” They go on to define the field of entrepreneurship as:
[T]he scholarly examination of how, by whom, and with what effects opportunities to create
future goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited (Venkataraman, 1997). Consequently the field involves the study of sources of opportunities; the processes of discovery,
evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities; and the set of individuals who discover, evaluate,
and exploit them (p. 218).

They further point out the following three sets of research questions as especially
central: (1) why, when and how opportunities for the creation of goods and
services come into existence; (2) why, when and how some people and not
others discover and exploit these opportunities; and (3) why, when and how
different modes of action are used to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities. In the
subsequent dialogue they agree with Zahra and Dess (2001) that the outcomes
of the exploitation process represent a fourth important set of research questions,
adding that outcomes on the level of industry and society should be considered as
well (cf. Venkataraman, 1996, 1997). As regards antecedents of the process and
its outcomes they emphasize the characteristics of individuals and opportunities
as the first-order forces explaining entrepreneurship and hold that environmental
forces are second order (Shane & Venkataraman, 2001). They describe their approach as a disequilibrium approach (cf. Eckhardt & Shane, 2003). They highlight
variations in the nature of opportunities as well as variations across individuals.
Further, they point out that entrepreneurship does not require, but can include, the
creation of new organizations (cf. Simon in Sarasvathy, 1999b, pp. 11, 41–42; Van
de Ven, 1996). In short, they depict the economy as fundamentally characterized
by heterogeneity.
One reason to show particular interest in this delineation of the field is, simply,
that it has stimulated considerable discussion, debate and commentary, as well

<-----Page 16----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

331

as some following (Busenitz et al., 2003; Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001; Erikson,
2001; Gartner, 2001; Low, 2001; Meyer et al., 2002; Shepherd & DeTienne, 2001;
Singh, 2001; Zahra & Dess, 2001). Behind this great interest lies, I believe, the fact
that the focus is clearer and in important ways different from that of some other explicit or implicit definitions of entrepreneurship. At the same time it is open-ended
on issues where others may have been overly restrictive. In my view, the combination of focus and openness that Shane and Venkataraman (2000) show solves
many of the problems associated with earlier definitions and research streams in
entrepreneurship. Some important merits of their contribution are listed below.
 They try to delineate the scholarly domain rather than suggesting yet another
definition of the societal phenomenon. Making this distinction is in itself a
contribution.
 Focusing on the creation of future goods and services, their delineation directs
attention to the problem of emergence (cf. Gartner, 1993). This adds a distinctive
feature to entrepreneurship research; an element that is missing in established
theories in economics and management.
 They put the main focus on goods and services rather than including organizational change per se (cf. Sharma & Chrisman, 1999) or creative behavior
in any context. They thereby carve out a domain that has a manageable size
and relatively clear boundaries, and which is consistent with Kirzner’s (1973)
notion that entrepreneurship is what drives the market process.
 While retaining an interest in individuals they emphasize their actions (entrepreneurship) and fit with the specific “opportunity” rather than general characteristics of entrepreneurs. They thereby avoid the dead end of “trait research.”10
 As to openness, their domain delineation includes two partly overlapping
processes, discovery and exploitation.11 In line with empirical evidence (Bhave,
1994; de Koning, 1999b; Van de Ven, 1996) this refutes the view that discovery
is instantaneous and that entrepreneurship consists solely of discovery (cf. Fiet,
2002; Kirzner, 1973).
 No mention is made of the age, size or ownership of the organizations in which
“opportunities” are pursued. Shane and Venkataraman (2000) even point out
the existence of alternative modes of exploitation for given “opportunities” as
an important research question. Hence, the stated domain includes corporate
entrepreneurship as well (Stevenson & Jarillo, 1990; Zahra, Karutko & Jennings,
1999). By implication, small business research is included only when it deals
explicitly with discovery and exploitation of “opportunities” to create future
goods and services (cf. Hornaday, 1990).
 They do not include purposefulness (cf. Bull & Willard, 1993; Cole, 1949) in
their domain delineation. They thereby avoid an overly rationalistic view and

<-----Page 17----->332

PER DAVIDSSON

make room for the possibility of luck (Demsetz, 1983) and serendipity (Bhave,
1994; Gartner, 1993; Sarasvathy, 2001) in entrepreneurial processes.
 Finally, if we disregard for the moment their definition of opportunity, Shane
and Venkataraman’s (2000) wording “. . . with what effects” makes the field
open to different types of direct and indirect outcomes of processes of discovery
and exploitation, e.g. satisfaction, learning, imitation and retaliation in addition
to financial success or failure. Importantly, the perspective suggests that in
line with Fig. 2 above, an important task for entrepreneurship research is to
assess not only outcomes on the micro-level, but on other levels (e.g. societal
wealth creation) as well (Shane & Venkataraman, 2001; Venkataraman, 1996;
Venkataraman, 1997, cf. Low & MacMillan, 1988).
These many positives arguably make Shane and Venkataraman’s framework the
best effort to date to delineate entrepreneurship as a distinct scholarly domain.
However, in order for it to gain more widespread acceptance there are some
aspects that need further elaboration, clarification or even modification. Firstly, as
observed also by Singh (2001), their central concept “opportunity” is problematic.
They hold that, among other things, we should study with what effects “opportunities” are exploited. They then adopt Casson’s (1982) definition of opportunity as
“those situations in which goods, services raw materials and organizing methods
can be introduced and sold at greater than their cost of production.” This makes
entrepreneurship become characterized by certainty rather than uncertainty
regarding one important aspect of the effects of the pursuit of opportunity: it
is profitable. As I see it, Casson’s definition is compatible with the view of
entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon that we have developed above, but
largely unhelpful for entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain as it is inconsistent
with having the outcomes of entrepreneurship as an unrestricted research question.
This apparent weakness of Shane and Venkataraman’s exposition points at a more
general problem in the entrepreneurship literature, namely that “opportunity” is
becoming a central concept but one which often is ill-conceptualized or applied in
an inconsistent manner.
Secondly, the phrase “discovery, evaluation and exploitation” contains words
with objectivist and abusive connotations, and may leave the impression of
a rationalistic, linear process. Such interpretations misrepresent Shane and
Venkataraman’s intended meanings and positions, but some clarifications on how
to interpret the terms and the process may be needed before others are willing to
subscribe to this vocabulary.
Third, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) position themselves away from Gartner
(cf. below), emphasizing that they address a different set of issues than the
creation of new organizations (cf. also Eckhardt & Shane, 2003). They have good

<-----Page 18----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

333

reason for doing so, as they want to highlight the possibility of different “modes
of exploitation” for a given “opportunity.” However, this may also create an
unnecessary divide or make it wider than it needs to be. After discussing Gartner’s
view of the field of entrepreneurship and trying to combine it with Venkataraman’s
I will return to each of these three issues and try to offer solutions to the identified
problems.

Gartner’s View
Gartner’s (1988) view – which he is careful to present as a suggestion for
re-direction rather than a formal “definition” – is that entrepreneurship is the
creation of new organizations. This choice of focus has two origins. One was
a perceived lack of treatment of organizational emergence in organization
theory. Somehow organizations were assumed to exist; theories started with
existing organizations (cf. Katz & Gartner, 1988). The other was a frustration
with the pre-occupation that early entrepreneurship research had with personal
characteristics of entrepreneurs. For these reasons, Gartner (1988) suggested
that entrepreneurship research ought to focus on the behaviors in the process of
organizational emergence. This view certainly has a lot to commend it:
 It has a clearly defined focus, thereby avoiding the risk of over-extending the
field.
 It inspired a fruitful re-direction of the field from a dispositional to a behavioral
view on entrepreneurship.
 It has a strong process orientation.
 It addresses an ecological void that has been given only cursory treatment in
economics and management studies.12
 It is offered as a minimalist definition. Gartner does not exclude other aspects of
entrepreneurship, but argues that organization creation is a situation where we
should “all” be able to agree that entrepreneurship is taking place. Accordingly,
Gartner has no problem welcoming Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000) article
as “a significant theoretical contribution” and “a courageous step in the right
direction” (Gartner, 2001, pp. 29, 35).
The main problem with Gartner’s (1988) approach is that it does not emphasize
the discovery process. Further, his approach directs no or only cursory attention
to the possibility of alternative modes of exploitation for given “opportunities”
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Van de Ven, Angle & Poole, 1989). If interpreted
as a delineation of the (entire) scholarly domain his take on entrepreneurship
appears overly narrow in these regards.

<-----Page 19----->334

PER DAVIDSSON

On the other hand his perspective may seem overly permissive in that he does
not explicitly restrict what kind of emerging organizations qualify. Taking the
argument to extremes, a new stamp collectors’ club and even a new anthill or
school of fish is a “new organization.” Many would be reluctant to accept these
as instances of “entrepreneurship.”
I have not found in Gartner’s writings a clear statement regarding whether an
attempt to create a new organization has to be successful in order to constitute
entrepreneurship. It is possible to read into his argument that regarded as a
societal phenomenon entrepreneurship consists of the actual emergence of new
organization, i.e. that success is required. His emphasis on behavior (Gartner,
1988) and his involvement in real-time study of start-up processes (Carter, Gartner
& Reynolds, 1996; Gartner & Carter, 2003) clearly suggest that start-up attempts
regardless of outcome qualify as the object of study for the scholarly domain.
The creation of a new organization is a special case of organizational change.
I have argued above that organizational change does not in itself constitute
entrepreneurship. My argument may thus seem decidedly anti-Gartnerian. This is
not my intention. I regard Bill Gartner as one of the greatest intellectual contributors to the field of entrepreneurship research, in particular for re-directing interest
from characteristics of small business owners to behavior in the entrepreneurial
process. Importantly, while I would challenge that “the fundamental outcome of
entrepreneurial behavior is the organization itself” (Gartner & Carter, 2003) it is
important to note that his “creation of new organization” should not necessarily be
read as “creation of new, owner-managed firms.” Gartner (1988, p. 28) explicitly
discusses internal venturing. Although he – arguably with good reason – regards
the emerging new firm as a particularly promising arena for studying it, his
interest is in “organizing” in the Weickian sense (Gartner, 2001, p. 30; cf. Gartner
& Carter, 2003), not necessarily the creation of formal and legally defined
organizations. Organizing is an important aspect of the exploitation process for
all new activity regardless of the formal or legal organizational context.
In conclusion, I see Gartner’s focus on organizing as an incomplete domain
delineation (of entrepreneurship) because it disregards the discovery process. The
focus he suggests is, I believe, the natural task for an organization theorist to take
on within a somewhat broader domain.

Combining Gartner’s and Venkataraman’s Perspectives
As I see it, Shane and Venkataraman’s and Gartner’s views on entrepreneurship
are not opposing but compatible and complementary. While highlighting different
aspects of the entrepreneurial process as being the most fundamental, the two

<-----Page 20----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

335

perspectives are far from clashing heads on. In order to further develop the scholarly
domain of entrepreneurship I believe we should try to combine and extend their
respective contributions.
In his various writings, Gartner has established at least three very important
foundations for entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain:
 Entrepreneurship is about behavior (rather than dispositions/characteristics).
 Entrepreneurship is a process.
 Entrepreneurship is about emergence.
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) have adopted these three aspects of Gartner’s
reasoning. In addition, they offer important broadening of Gartner’s domain:
 The entrepreneurial process consists of two sub-processes, discovery and exploitation.
 Entrepreneurship leads to the emergence not only or primarily of new (independent) organizations, but to the emergence of new goods or services. While their
emergence has to be organized (an important part of the exploitation process) this
can occur within new or established organizations, i.e. through different modes
of exploitation.
 Entrepreneurship can have a range of interesting and important outcomes on
different levels.
Emphasizing a disequilibrium perspective, Shane and Venkataraman (2000; cf.
Eckhardt & Shane, 2003) also suggest a particular perspective on the economic
system. Although some pressure towards conformity should be admitted (Aldrich,
1999; Raffa, Zollo & Caponi, 1996) I believe it sound to regard this as fundamental
to this scholarly domain:
 The economy is characterized by heterogeneity; this remains a permanent and
fundamental feature of economic actors and environments.13
In a powerful manner, this combination of the two perspectives offers clear
direction for the field. The scholarly domain of entrepreneurship should study the
processes of discovery and exploitation from a behavioral perspective under the
assumption of heterogeneity, taking an interest in different types of outcomes on
different levels of analysis.
Standing on the shoulders of solid predecessors also allows us to see – and
hopefully solve to some extent – additional conceptual issues that have to be
dealt with before we have achieved a strong paradigm for entrepreneurship
research. Some of the issues I believe need further elaboration are the concept of
“opportunity” and the role of uncertainty, as well as the meaning of “discovery”

<-----Page 21----->336

PER DAVIDSSON

and “exploitation” and the interrelatedness of these two processes. This is what
I will turn to in the immediately following sections.

Uncertainty and the Concept of Opportunity
In addition to the seven points derived from Gartner’s and Venkataraman’s
perspectives, let me suggest as the eighth fundamental point for the scholarly
domain of entrepreneurship that:
 The economy is also characterized by uncertainty; this remains a fundamental
feature of most economic actions and environments in the context of discovery
and exploitation of ideas for new goods and services.
What I refer to here is genuine, Knightian uncertainty (Knight, 1921), i.e. a
situation where the future is not only unknown, but also unknowable (Sarasvathy,
Dew, Velamuri & Venkataraman, 2003). I do not argue that all decisions for all
actors are non-calculable. However, the situations in which behaviors aimed at
creating new economic activity are undertaken often have this characteristic. That
is, information collection and processing, careful planning and calculation cannot
give a conclusive and reliable answer as to whether something will be successful or
not; only (trial) implementation will tell. Very rarely are entrepreneurial situations
certain in the way Kirzner (1973) portrays them. Kirzner likens entrepreneurial
opportunity with realizing that a free ten-dollar bill is resting in one’s hand,
ready to be grasped. If we should use the ten-dollar bill metaphor at all, I would
suggest the true situation is more like spotting the bill from your balcony. From
that distance one would face the (calculable) risk that the bill was for anything
from one to a hundred dollars. But moreover, while you dash down the stairs it
may blow away, or someone else may get it before you, or it may turn out upon
closer look that it was not a real money note, after all, but some kind of toy
money. There is no way the finder can tell before she takes the decision to run
down the stairs. In order to understand behaviors in such situations it is important
to start from a theoretical perspective that acknowledges or even emphasizes
uncertainty.
This brings us to the concept of opportunity. The increased use of this concept
in entrepreneurship has been accompanied with increased attention to the earliest
phases of the entrepreneurial process, which is sound development. However, despite its recent popularity and apparent centrality to entrepreneurship (de Koning,
1999b; Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Gaglio, 1997; Hills & Shrader, 1998; Sarasvathy
et al., 2003; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000), there is reason to question whether
“opportunity” really is a very useful concept for entrepreneurship research. By

<-----Page 22----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

337

Casson’s (1982) definition, which Shane and Venkataraman (2000) adopt, an
opportunity is known to be profitable. By almost any definition, an opportunity
is known to be a favorable situation. For example, the Oxford English Dictionary
(cited from Sarasvathy et al., 2003) defines opportunity as “A time, juncture, or
condition of things favorable to an end or purpose, or admitting of something being
done or effected.” Therefore, the term “opportunity” is fundamentally opposed
to acknowledging uncertainty as an inescapable aspect of the environment of the
emerging activity and/or organization that the entrepreneurship scholar tries to
study and understand. At the time, the actors cannot know whether or not what
they pursue is an “opportunity.”
If we take Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000) delineation of the field and their
definition of opportunity at face value, we have a suggested scholarly domain that
should only study successful cases, and which is – in practice – restricted to doing so
retrospectively (cf. Baumol, 1983; Singh, 2001). If only profitable “opportunities”
are studied, Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000) second and third sets of research
questions (about individual differences and different modes of action) would not
address why some people pursue unprofitable venture ideas or why in some cases
a particular mode of exploitation leads to an unprofitable result. These appear to
me to be highly interesting and relevant questions for entrepreneurship research,
which relate to the uncertainty emerging activities operate in.14
This is the ﬁrst major problem with the opportunity concept. Entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain needs to regard on-going emergence as an instance of
entrepreneurship, and acknowledge the uncertainty that typically surrounds such
activity. The positively laden concept “opportunity” as normally understood and
defined is therefore an unsuitable label for on-going pursuits. One way to solve
this problem is to consistently talk about perceived opportunity as long as a situation’s profitable or favorable nature is unproven. However, resorting to “perceived
opportunity” is not an ideal solution because of its inherent ambiguity. It could
mean either “objectively existing opportunity, and also perceived” or “perceived
to be an opportunity, but not (necessarily) objectively being one.”
This brings us to the second major problem with the opportunity concept. This is
the question whether “opportunities” objectively exist or if the actor creates them.
That is, do “opportunities” exist “out there,” independently of a person identifying
and acting upon the opportunity, or do entrepreneurs create “opportunities” where
none existed before they conceived of them? This is a hotly debated issue where
scholars tend to take strong positions, which points to a risk for a major divide
among entrepreneurship researchers. This problem is aggravated by the fact that
leading proponents of the perspectives that I try to merge and extend tend to
take different sides on this issue (cf. Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Gartner & Carter,
2003; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Venkataraman, 1997). However, rather

<-----Page 23----->338

PER DAVIDSSON

than being deeply ontological I believe those differences to be based largely
on semantic issues. Scholars may take different positions in part because they,
simply, mean different things when they use the concept. With a more refined
view of “opportunity” and its “components” (cf. Moran & Ghoshal, 1999) more
agreement is possible to achieve. As I see it, there are at least three possibilities:
Objectivist: Opportunities exist “out there” as individual, “ready-to-use”
entities. They are like mushroom in the forest. Some are bigger and some are
smaller; some grow early and some grow late. Although they are not necessarily
easy to find, they are out there, and they are equally big and equally accessible to
anyone who goes to or happens to be in the forest.
Objectivist-Subjectivist: Opportunities exist “out there” as individual, “ready-touse” entities. However, because of individual differences in perception, knowledge
and skills, all actors do not have access to exactly the same opportunities.15 It is
like mushroom-picking for the chosen few. The mushroom still exist “out there”
at the same times and sizes for all actors, but some of us have developed better
perceptual abilities regarding well-camouflaged mushroom, and can therefore
find opportunities hidden for others. Alternatively, some only know about a few
types of edible mushroom whereas others are experts and find edible species all
over the place. Further, some are good chefs and can convert the mushroom into
a delicacy, whereas others mess up in the kitchen due to lacking cooking skills.
That is, after successful discovery they fail in the exploitation process.
Subjectivist-Creative: Opportunity is not about anything existing “out there” at
all. Opportunities are created in the entrepreneur’s mind and it is not meaningful
to talk about these opportunities separate from their creators. If it has anything at
all to do with mushroom, it is because the actor chose to paint or sculpture a mushroom (which could be two-dimensional, blue in color, five feet high, make funny
noises – and be started as an attempt to create an apple rather than a mushroom).16
The objectivist position clashes with our heterogeneity assumption and seems
to have few if any followers among entrepreneurship scholars who ever gave the
issue a thought. Shane and Venkataraman (2000; cf. Shane, 2000a, b; Eckhardt &
Shane, 2003) seem to favor the objectivist-subjectivist position, whereas writers
like de Koning (1999b), Gartner and Carter (2003) and Sarasvathy (2001) are
more supportive of the subjective-creative perspective. Now, who is right? Both, I
believe. As I see it, the following three points should be easy for most scholars to
agree upon.
(a) Opportunity exists out there, independently of particular actors. However,
opportunities do not exist as complete, individual entities. Rather, opportunity
exists as an uncountable in the form of technological possibilities, knowledge,
and unfulfilled human needs backed with purchasing power.

<-----Page 24----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

339

(b) Venture ideas are the creations of individuals’ minds. They are specific
(but changeable and more or less elaborate) entities that are acted upon.
Whether these reflect opportunity or not can only be known afterwards and –
paradoxically – only when the outcome was successful (because failure may
be due either to poor exploitation or to lack of opportunity; cf. Eckhardt &
Shane, 2003).
(c) Because of differences in knowledge, skills, motivations and other dispositions, individuals (and firms) differ from one another as regards what venture
ideas they can and will pursue and as regards what external opportunity they
can profitably exploit, and how.
Let us take the Ice Hotel – an unlikely but highly successful international tourist
attraction in the far north of Sweden – as our example. Dismissing entirely the
idea that opportunity exists “out there” in this case means denying that its success
and viability has anything to do with its location in a dark, cold and remote
(i.e. exotic) location, albeit within reasonable reach for international air travel.
Dismissing the notion that venture ideas are the creations of individuals’ minds
would mean arguing that the specific Ice Hotel concept – this particular response
to the co-existence of coldness, darkness and remoteness in one place and wealthy
potential tourists hungry for new experiences in other places – somehow existed
before an entrepreneur (Yngwe Bergkvist) conceived of it. Dismissing the third
point means holding that you or I would be equally likely as Mr. Bergkvist to
come up with the Ice Hotel idea and/or succeeding with it. Apart from those who
subscribe to extreme ontological positions at any cost, I think it should be much
easier for scholars to agree with all of the above three points than to refute one or
more of them.
It is not fruitful for entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain that a central concept
like “opportunity” is used for: (i) a set of external conditions known in retrospect
to be favorable (to some people) for the successful discovery and exploitation
of new business activities; (ii) a set of external conditions thought (by some
people) but not proven to be existing and favorable for the successful discovery
and exploitation of new business activities; (iii) specific new venture initiatives
known in retrospect to be viable; and (iv) specific new venture initiatives that are
currently being pursued but whose viability is not yet proven.
The term “opportunity” is particularly misleading for the last category, which
at the same time arguably is the most central unit of interest for the scholarly
domain of entrepreneurship. I suggest this entity be referred to as Venture Idea in
order to underline that its viability is not yet proven and to disconnect it from any
argument as regards to which extent it is externally or internally based. Venture
ideas are internally generated (i.e. created in individuals’ minds) based on more

<-----Page 25----->340

PER DAVIDSSON

or less explicit and more or less “correct” perceptions of external conditions. Over
time, they can change and become more and more elaborate. This leads us to:
 The entrepreneurial discovery process starts with the conception of a venture
idea. This venture idea, including the activities and structures that evolve around
it, is the focal unit of interest in entrepreneurship research.

The Meaning and Interrelatedness of “Discovery” and “Exploitation”
The term discovery may be suspected to reflect an objectivist view on venture
ideas, i.e. that they somehow exist “out there,” ready to be discovered. It should
be clear from the above that this is not the view I recommend. Rather, like
Eckhardt and Shane (2003) I use the term “discovery” to maintain consistency
with prior literature, despite its potentially misleading connotations. Discovery
refers to the conceptual side of venture development, from an initial idea to a
fully worked out business concept where many specific aspects of the operation
is worked out in great detail, especially as regards how value is created for the
customer and how the business will appropriate some the value (de Koning,
1999b, p. 121). Importantly, discovery is a process – the venture idea is not
formed as a complete and unchangeable entity at a sudden flash of insight. Thus,
it includes not only what is elsewhere called “idea generation,” “opportunity
identification” and “opportunity detection,” but also “opportunity formation” and
“opportunity refinement” (Bhave, 1994; de Koning, 1999a, b; Gaglio, 1997). Also
importantly, discovery refers to the initial conception and further development
of a venture idea, not a proven opportunity. In some cases, then, the discovery
process ends with the realization that the venture idea did not reflect favorable
external conditions in the way the involved actors initially thought it did.
The term exploitation may evoke negative associations from its use in other
contexts. In the present context I would suggest it is a neutral term referring to
the decision to act upon a venture idea, and the behaviors that are undertaken
to achieve its realization. The exploitation process deals primarily with resource
acquisition and co-ordination, as well as market making (see Eckhardt & Shane,
2003; cf. also Sarasvathy, 1999a; Van de Ven, 1996). Exploitation thus has to do
with the attempted realization of ideas, and should in this context carry none of
the negative connotations associated with the word “exploitation” is certain other
contexts. Like discovery, exploitation is a process that may or may not lead to the
attainment of profit or other goals.
Further, the sequential feel of the phrase “discovery, evaluation and exploitation” may give the impression of a linear, orderly process. In line with empirical

<-----Page 26----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

341

evidence (Bhave, 1994; de Koning, 1999b; Sarasvathy, 1999a) I think discovery
and exploitation are best conceived of as overlapping processes. For example, an
entrepreneurial process may start with an individual perceiving what she thinks
is an opportunity for a profitable business [discovery]. In the efforts to make this
business happen, contacts with resource providers and prospective customers [exploitation] make it clear that the business as initially conceived will not be viable
[feedback to discovery]. The individual changes the business concept accordingly
[discovery] and continues her efforts to marshal and coordinate the resources
needed for the realization of the revised business concept [exploitation]. Although
the above process starts with an element of discovery, this is not necessarily
always the case. Empirical research suggests that venture creation processes can
follow almost any sequence (Carter et al., 1996; Gartner & Carter, 2003).17
With those clarifications, I hope that a broader set of scholars are prepared to
accept the notions of discovery and exploitation processes as useful conceptual
tools for the scholarly domain of entrepreneurship.

Core Research Questions for the Scholarly Domain of Entrepreneurship
Returning to Fig. 1, according to the perspective developed here entrepreneurship
research is research that ask questions about real or manipulated instances of “new
offer,” “new competitor” or “geographical market dispersion” (quadrants I and
IV). Relating to the heterogeneity issue, a seriously under-research area here concerns the characteristics of new venture ideas and how these characteristics relate
to antecedents, behavior and outcomes. Samuelsson (2001) represents one of the
few entrepreneurship studies that have explored the nature and effects of characteristics of venture ideas, and followers are needed. While an abundance of studies
have tried to assess the characteristics of entrepreneurs, very few have focused on
the characteristics of the venture ideas they pursue (cf. Shane & Venkataraman,
2000, p. 218).18
With regard to quadrant II, while organizational changes do not in themselves
represent entrepreneurship they remain important possible antecedents in entrepreneurship research. Therefore, studies referred to by Ucbasaran, Westhead
and Wright (2001, p. 64) showing that management buy-outs are associated
with increased development of new products, are examples of entrepreneurship
research. Empirical tests of Stevenson’s argument that certain organizational
changes would facilitate entrepreneurship in established organizations (Stevenson,
1984; Stevenson & Jarillo, 1986) would clearly be instances of entrepreneurship
research, as would empirical tests of the relationship between “entrepreneurial
orientation” on the one hand, and actual discovery and exploitation behaviors on

<-----Page 27----->342

PER DAVIDSSON

the other (cf. Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Creation of new organizations (Gartner,
1988) remains a very central aspect of the exploitation process in entrepreneurship
research, at least as long as these new organizations aim at “new offer” or
becoming a “new competitor.” Finally, quadrant III (business as usual, and
non-entrepreneurial growth) does not exemplify entrepreneurship but can be
included in entrepreneurship research for comparative purposes.
In relation to Fig. 2, I suggested above that only success ventures and catalyst
ventures exercise entrepreneurship as we defined the societal phenomenon.
However, entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain should not delimit its empirical
study to these two categories but include also re-distributive ventures and failed
ventures. Indeed, I would suggest that in showing a genuine interest in outcomes
on different levels, and in providing a more refined and empirically informed view
on “failure,” entrepreneurship can distinguish itself from other fields and make
strong contributions to social science at large (cf. Low, 2001; Venkataraman,
1997). The question of when successful venture level outcomes are and are not
associated with successful outcomes on the societal level, and vice versa, is highly
relevant but seldom asked. It is conceivable that under certain circumstances the
successful pursuit of ideas for new ventures does not benefit society (cf. Baumol,
1990). It is also possible to conceive of a situation where entrepreneurial efforts
on the whole benefit society while at the same time the most likely outcome on
the micro-level is a loss – and that therefore the rational decision is to refrain from
entrepreneurship (cf. Olson in Sarasvathy, 1999b, p. 35). Both of these situations
represent important problems that entrepreneurship research can help societies to
solve or avoid. The question of differential outcomes on different levels can also be
asked from the perspective of the corporate manager: when and why does and does
not new venturing – successful or not at the venture level – contribute to company
performance? Again, because of potential learning and cannibalization the answer
is not a simple one to one relationship between venture- and organizational
level outcomes.
The issue of catalyst ventures, then, is of particular interest. Too narrow or
simplistic a view on “failure” may lead to gross misrepresentation of the benefits
of attempts to create new business activity, on micro – as well as aggregate levels.
What in a narrow perspective appears to be a “failure” may instead be a beneficial
“catalyst” either because those directly involved in the failure learn for the future
or because others imitate. Kogut and Zander (1992) discuss the first possibility
while Van de Ven (1996) casts some doubt on the extent to which learning really
takes place. Aldrich (1999) and McGrath (1999) discuss both possibilities. A
possible outcome of deeper and more refined research into apparent “failure” is
that pure failure as defined in Fig. 2 is far less usual than previously thought (cf.
Gimeno, Folta, Cooper & Woo, 1997, pp. 69 and 72). I think one of the first things
entrepreneurship scholars should try to get rid of is the bias against failure. In

<-----Page 28----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

343

addition to the “catalyst” potential, both theory and empirical evidence actually
suggest that experimentation that may end in failure as well as the demise of
less effective actors are necessary parts of a well-functioning market economy
(Davidsson, Lindmark & Olofsson, 1995; Eliasson, 1991; Reynolds, 1999;
Schumpeter, 1934).
An alternative point of departure for a discussion of core research questions
are the four sets of research questions that Shane and Venkataraman (2000, 2001)
suggested for the scholarly domain of entrepreneurship research. Adapted to our
above reasoning these questions read as follows:
(1) Why, when, where, how and for whom does opportunity for the creation of
new goods and services come into existence?
(2) Why, when and how do individuals, organizations, regions, industries, cultures,
nations (or other units of analysis) differ in their propensity for discovery and
exploitation of new venture ideas?
(3) Why, when and how are different modes of action used to exploit venture
ideas?
(4) What are the outcomes on different levels (e.g. individual, organization, industry, society) of efforts to exploit venture ideas?19
The first question is about the existence of entrepreneurial opportunity. It requests
empirical study of when and why (as well as “where” and “for whom”) “real”
opportunity has come into existence, e.g. as a result of technological or institutional changes. As depicted in Fig. 3, it is a question that can be asked at different
types of entities or levels of analysis, e.g. for nations, regions or other spatial units
over time or across space, as well as for organizations, industries or population
sub-groups. Asking this question is a prerequisite for building strong theory about
where opportunity will emerge in the future. Building such theory is a challenging
but important aspect of scholarship in entrepreneurship, which feeds directly
into entrepreneurship education (cf. Davidsson, 2002) where learning where to
look for opportunity should be one of the most central features (cf. Drucker,
1985; Vesper, 1991). As noted earlier, proven “opportunity” can only be studied
in retrospect. That, however, is not the only problem. As remarked in an earlier
note it is impossible to know the universe of not-yet-discovered, but potentially
viable, venture ideas. Therefore, not even the number of venture ideas that are
both acted upon and proven successful is a direct measure of opportunity-density.

Fig. 3. Graphical Representation of RQ 1.

<-----Page 29----->344

PER DAVIDSSON

Fig. 4. Graphical Representation of RQ 2–4.

It is inescapable that whatever measure is used for opportunity density, it will
be a proxy measure.
Research questions 2–4 are graphically represented in Fig. 4. As I see it,
the middle box is a necessary part of the research design for these questions
to be “entrepreneurship research,” whereas the outer boxes may or may not be
included in the research design. In other words, an explicit focus on behaviors
in the discovery and/or exploitation processes, or on the existence and/or
characteristics of venture ideas as discussed above, or on or both, is required
(cf. Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001). As discussed earlier, I think that questions
2–4 have to be addressed for venture ideas rather than only for “opportunities”
proven to be profitable. Otherwise, many aspects of question 4 would not be very
meaningful.
With regard to question 2, I agree with Shane and Venkataraman (2000) that
individual(s) should remain a core interest for entrepreneurship research, at
least when the interest in personality is replaced by an interest in knowledge
and cognition (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Shane, 2000b). However, when the
individual is used as the level of analysis it is often advisable not to have a single
event (e.g. being or not being in the process of starting a firm; acting or not acting
upon a particular venture idea) as the dependent variable. In order to be able to
single out what was truly attributable to the individual from the idiosyncrasies
of the particular venture idea a more appropriate analysis might be to relate
individual characteristics to patterns of repeated entrepreneurial behavior (cf.
Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001; Ucbasaran et al., 2001; Venkataraman, 1997).
I have generalized question 2 also to other levels of analysis. That is, it should
include the questions about why, when and how, e.g. organizations, networks,
competence clusters, regions, industries, cultures or nations differ as regards
discovery and exploitation propensity, in addition to differences in opportunity
density (cf. Reynolds, Storey & Westhead, 1994; Shane, 1992). For example,
due to the distinction between “opportunity-based” and “necessity-based”
entrepreneurship, nations and regions may have similar firm start-up rates for
very different reasons, and representing very different levels of real, profitable
opportunity. Therefore, also the quality of the enacted ideas has to be considered
(Davidsson, 1995; Reynolds, Camp, Bygrave, Autio & Hay, 2001). The same
problem is likely to occur on the organizational level. A firm desperately struggling

<-----Page 30----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

345

for its survival may take more new initiatives than a firm that is doing well, even
if more objective opportunity is available for the latter (March & Sevón, 1988).
The third question concerns modes of action. This can be understood as including all aspects of behavior in the process. This very central set of questions – what
individuals and other economic entities actually do in order to come up with ideas
for businesses, how they refine those ideas, and make them happen – needs much
more investigation. Researchers have only just begun to address them seriously
(e.g. Bhave, 1994; Carter, Gartner & Reynolds, 1996; Chandler, Dahlqvist &
Davidsson, 2002; Delmar & Shane, 2002; Fiet & Migliore, 2001; McGrath, 1996;
Samuelsson, 2001; Sarasvathy, 1999a).20
One important aspect that this question highlights is the need for studies that
apply the “venture idea” itself as the unit of analysis (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001).
This is a possibility rarely used or even considered by researchers in other fields.
Applying this level of analysis is highly relevant for entrepreneurship research,
and a possibility for entrepreneurship researchers to make unique contributions.
Such studies would follow samples neither of individuals nor of organizations, but
precisely new, emerging activities – i.e. venture ideas and what evolves around
them – from their conception and through whatever changes in human champions
and organizational contexts might occur along the way. With this approach the
mode of exploitation would not be locked in by the design. In some cases what
originated as a de novo start-up is transferred to an existing firm; in other cases
what originates within a firm may be spun out at an early stage. Case studies
describing the process in detail (Van de Ven et al., 1999) as well as survey studies
designed for the purpose (Chandler et al., 2002) can apply this level of analysis.
Concerning the fourth question entrepreneurship researchers can make a
contribution by employing a more complex and less narrow-sighted view on
outcomes, as discussed above in relation to Fig. 2. As indicated in Fig. 4 this entails
also following up on outcomes on more than one level. Put differently, both direct
and indirect outcomes are of interest. Not only venture and societal levels are of
interest (and the latter may be very hard to assess). For example, in a venture-level
study, as discussed above, outcomes can be assessed for its host organization
(if any) and for the industry, in addition to assessing the venture-level outcome.
Different types of outcomes are also of interest. Entrepreneurial processes do
not only have financial outcomes, and affect not only those directly involved in
the project. Supplementary outcome assessment may concern, e.g. satisfaction,
learning, imitation and retaliation.
Related to the issue of heterogeneity, Venkataraman (1997) raises the important issue that relative (ﬁnancial) performance may often not be an adequate
outcome measure for entrepreneurship research. Venkataraman focused on firm
performance but the problem is the same for other levels of analysis as well. If

<-----Page 31----->346

PER DAVIDSSON

heterogeneity is taken seriously the following situation is conceivable. Individual
A chooses to try to exploit a venture idea (x) that actually has less potential than
the best possible idea she could have pursued with success. At the same time,
individual B manages to find and act upon the very best venture idea available
to her (y). Further, individual A’s exploitation of x is substandard relative to what
would have been possible for her, whereas individual B’s exploitation of y reaches
the theoretical maximum. And yet, while y performs to B’s satisfaction and even
exceeds her expectations, x performs better than y when we compare across them.
To whom and for what purpose is this relevant to know? And if it is relevant to
know, would not in this case other yardsticks be more relevant to A and B as well as
to outside observers? It is not easy to give clever and general advice on what should
be done instead of assessing relative performance. However, Venkataraman’s
(1997) observation should caution against habitual and mindless application of
relative performance as the (sole) outcome measure in entrepreneurship research.
Another set of “questions within the questions” that are seriously underresearched – and perhaps under-emphasized above – concerns the several issues
of ﬁt that arise from heterogeneity along several dimensions. This concerns fit
between individuals’ prior knowledge and (information about) the new opportunity (e.g. Cooper, Folta & Woo, 1995; Shane, 2000a, b); relatedness between
organizations’ prior knowledge, resources or capabilities and (information about)
the new potential venture (e.g. Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Teece, Pisano & Shuen,
1997; Van de Ven, 1996); relatedness of the knowledge and characteristics of key
individuals involved in the processes, i.e. the homogeneity or heterogeneity of
the team (e.g. Nahapiet & Ghosal, 1998; Zahra & Wiklund, 2000); fit between
existing resources and what strategies can lead to the venture’s success (e.g.
Chandler & Hanks, 1994) and fit between characteristics of the new potential
venture and current user practices (e.g. Raffa, Zollo & Caponi, 1996). Empirically
based knowledge on these issues is limited, which means abundant opportunity for
research contributions.

Conclusions on Entrepreneurship as a Scholarly Domain
Summing up the above, when we think of the scholarly domain a suitable definition
of entrepreneurship could be the behaviors undertaken in the processes of discovery
and exploitation of ideas for new business ventures. This definition connects well
to Venkataraman’s and Gartner’s perspectives without presupposing the outcome.
Not even this definition, however, fully describes the scholarly domain. Therefore,
I would propose the following delineation of entrepreneurship as a scholarly
domain:

<-----Page 32----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

347

Starting from assumptions of uncertainty and heterogeneity, the scholarly
domain of entrepreneurship encompasses the processes of (real or induced, and
completed as well as terminated) emergence of new business ventures, across
organizational contexts. This entails the study of the origin and characteristics
of venture ideas as well as their contextual fit; of behaviors in the interrelated
processes of discovery and exploitation of such ideas, and of how the ideas and
behaviors link to different types of direct and indirect antecedents and outcomes
on different levels of analysis.
As I see it, this delineation is broad enough to encompass core issues highlighted
by Venkataraman’s and Gartner’s respective perspectives. At the same time, it
is distinct enough to be the basis of a community and coherent theory building
(Gartner, 2001; Low, 2001). As will be discussed in the next main section I would
argue that this scholarly domain holds promise of explaining and predicting “a set of
empirical phenomena not explained or predicted by conceptual frameworks already
in existence in other fields” (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) although considerable
overlaps exist, which entrepreneurship researchers should take advantage of.

What Has Been Left Out?
I have excluded from the suggested domain delineation criteria like “value creation,” “wealth creation,” or other indicators of “success,” arguing that such criteria
belong in a definition of entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon (cf. Section
2 above). I have further excluded criteria like purpose and motivation, skill or
expertise, and expectations of gain for self (cf. Bull & Willard, 1993; Cole, 1949;
Fiet, 2002; Gartner, 1990; Hisrisch & Peters, 1989) from the definition of the phenomenon as well as from the domain delineation. This is because these are, as I
see it, not necessary ingredients of entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon or
scholarly domain. They are of central interest, however, from a third perspective:
entrepreneurship as a teaching subject. Entrepreneurship students can be assumed
to expect to learn what it takes to succeed in entrepreneurial endeavors, and it
is therefore understandable that scholars who have the teaching subject in mind
want to include criteria of this kind. For entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain
or societal phenomenon I would argue, however, that they are unnecessary and
potentially misleading restrictions.
The American Academy of Management Entrepreneurship Division includes in
its domain statement also issues like self-employment, small and family business
management, and management succession (cf. Gartner, 2001). Such topics
may also make sense from the perspective of entrepreneurship as a teaching
subject. Teaching is directed at individuals; in this case often entrepreneurs

<-----Page 33----->348

PER DAVIDSSON

or would-be-entrepreneurs, meaning “business founders” (and sometimes also
“venture champions”). From this perspective, entrepreneurship easily becomes
“anything that is of great concern to entrepreneurs, i.e. business owner-managers.”
Business founders become – and often stay – self-employed. If they stay with
the business they have founded they become managers of a small business, which
often engages other family members as well. Eventually, the issue of succession
becomes a major concern. Therefore, these issues become natural parts of courses
or programs in “entrepreneurship.”
However, unless explicitly related to competitive behaviors that drive the market process the issues pertaining to self-employment, or smallness, or family, or
succession do not reflect the societal phenomenon “entrepreneurship.” A scholarly
domain could be delimited to the concerns of business owner-managers over their
lifetime. However, this would be a domain far removed from our definition of the
societal phenomenon, because small and independently owned businesses do not
necessarily have a larger role in driving the market process than have other types of
suppliers. Further, given the diversity of issues such a domain would encompass,
it would also be a poor prospect for coherent theory development (Gartner, 2001).
Many scholars who are interested in entrepreneurship as defined above also
have interests in – and do research on – issues like firm growth or small business
management. We should not give up those other interests. However, we should be
careful not to inappropriately put the “entrepreneurship” label on them. Careless
application of that label gives the entrepreneurship domain a “hodgepodge”
or “pot-pourri” appearance, which hinders theory development and academic
legitimacy (Gartner, 2001; Low, 2001; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). When
small- or family business research explicitly addresses characteristics of venture
ideas and/or behaviors in the processes of discovery and exploitation, it qualifies
as entrepreneurship research. When these issues are not explicitly treated in the
research, I strongly suggest the entrepreneurship label not be used.

THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF THE
ENTREPRENEURSHIP DOMAIN
It appears that for Venkataraman (1997; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) and
for Gartner (1988, 2001) establishing entrepreneurship as a distinct (and respected) scholarly domain, is an important goal. One could counter-argue that
entrepreneurship research is best pursued within established disciplines like
economics, psychology and sociology as well as within the various branches
of management studies. A first strong reason for this is that despite Shane and
Venkataraman’s (2000) alleged focus on explaining and predicting phenomena

<-----Page 34----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

349

not explained or predicted in other fields, there are few contingencies of interest to
entrepreneurship scholars that are not the topic of theory in at least some discipline
in the social sciences (cf. Acs & Audretsch, 2003a; Delmar, 2000; Thornton,
1999). Not making full use of the tools available within the disciplines would
appear to be a wasteful practice. Second, disciplinary research is required to meet
the quality criteria of the respective discipline. Thus, the pursuit of entrepreneurship questions by disciplinary researchers should be a way for entrepreneurship
to attain academic respectability. Therefore, I agree with Low (2001, p. 23)
that entrepreneurship as a distinctive domain is desirable but not viable in
isolation, i.e. without theoretical input and quality standards from other fields
of research.
It is not so easy, however, that all the theory entrepreneurship researchers need
already exists in the disciplines. No matter how sophisticated the tools, they may not
always be adequate for the task at hand (cf. Davidsson & Wiklund, 2000). Under
the perspective on entrepreneurship research that I have developed some of the
questions one should ask before applying existing theory “as is” are the following:
(1) Does the theory acknowledge uncertainty and heterogeneity?
(2) Can it be applied to the problem of emergence, or does it presuppose the
existence of markets, products or organizations in a way that clashes with the
research questions?
(3) Does the theory allow a process perspective?
(4) Does it apply to the preferred unit of analysis (e.g. “venture idea” or “emerging
venture” rather than “firm” or “individual”)?
(5) Is it compatible with an interest in the types of outcomes that are most relevant
from an entrepreneurship point of view?
Theories exist, and whenever possible, entrepreneurship research should deductively test theory from psychology, sociology and economics as well as from
various branches of business research. However, as a scrutiny of some existing
theories in relation to the five questions above would show, they are not always
optimal for research questions addressing the processes and analysis levels of
most relevance to entrepreneurship research. Therefore, the domain must allow
also for filling gaps and asking new questions through inductive, theory-building
approaches.
Thus, the existence of disciplinary theories that relate to all or most entrepreneurship research questions does not prove there is no need for entrepreneurship
as a distinct scholarly domain. In addition, if it is clear that most core research
questions in entrepreneurship would fit in some discipline, it is equally clear that
entrepreneurship is not in its entirety a sub-division of any one established discipline (Shane & Venkataraman, 2001). As pointed out by Low (2001) the obvious

<-----Page 35----->350

PER DAVIDSSON

problem with leaving entrepreneurship research to the disciplines is the lack
of community. The existing community of long-time entrepreneurship scholars
has a portfolio of hard-earned, close-up knowledge about entrepreneurship, e.g.
that it is not primarily about individual heroes; that most start-ups are imitative
and not very growth-oriented; that only a tiny minority ever use venture capital;
that available data sources typically do not cover the early stages of emergence
of new ventures; that “start-up” is not one event but a series of behaviors that
may be undertaken in different order and over very different durations of time;
about the extent of heterogeneity of entrepreneurial efforts along a number of
dimensions, and so forth. Temporary visitors would no doubt be naı̈ve about many
of these things, as were entrepreneurship researchers in the formative stages of
the field. Therefore, without the trading of such knowledge through a research
community, strong theoretical and methodological schooling from disciplines
may not suffice for making maximally fruitful contributions to the understanding
of entrepreneurial phenomena.
The issue of lack of community is a very real problem. In an interesting and
comprehensive citation analysis, Landström (2001) has shown that the recent
tremendous growth of entrepreneurship research has been accompanied by an
increasing share of “transitory” contributors, i.e. scholars with their main home
in some mainstream discipline and just one publication in entrepreneurship. In
addition, his analysis shows that despite their disciplinary training these scholars
are largely non-influential. This supports the idea that disciplinary knowledge
has to be combined with deep familiarity with the phenomenon in order to make
really valuable contributions.
The strongest argument for entrepreneurship (also) as distinct domain, however,
is the following. If left to the disciplines, there is no guarantee that a lot of research
would be conducted on the most central questions of entrepreneurship, as we have
here outlined that scholarly domain. Many of these questions may be peripheral to
every discipline (cf. Acs & Audretsch, 2003b). Therefore, a failure to collectively
cover the entrepreneurship agenda is neither a problem nor a shortcoming on the
part of the disciplines. When an interest in maximum knowledge development
about entrepreneurship is the vantage point, however, it becomes a problem.
Concluding the discussion of the domain vs. the disciplines I would argue that
knowledge about entrepreneurship is best developed if deep familiarity with the
phenomenon is combined with disciplinary knowledge and standards. This can be
achieved in three ways: (a) researchers who focus their research more or less exclusively on entrepreneurship learn more theory and method from the disciplines; (b)
disciplinary researchers who occasionally apply their knowledge to entrepreneurship read a lot of entrepreneurship research before conducting and publishing
their studies; and (c) direct collaboration between topical and disciplinary experts.

<-----Page 36----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

351

I would argue that all three of these are more likely to happen in the presence of
a distinct, coherent and acknowledged domain of entrepreneurship research.

SOME FURTHER SUGGESTIONS FOR EMPIRICAL
RESEARCH IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Although there has been considerable progress in empirical entrepreneurship
research, much more is needed in order to realize the potential of entrepreneurship
as a scholarly domain. At the time of this writing it is still the case that a lot of the
research presented in “entrepreneurship” outlets address research questions that
are not clearly about entrepreneurship as defined here – or anywhere. Neither are
they always clearly different from research questions addressed in other fields.
Most studies are cross-sectional rather than process-oriented, and work with
samples of existing firms or established business owner-managers rather than
emerging new ventures and people in the process of becoming entrepreneurs
(Aldrich & Baker, 1997; Chandler & Lyon, 2001; Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001).
But there are hopeful signs. For example, in the Frontiers of Entrepreneurship
Research 2001 (Bygrave et al., 2001) the first 172 pages were devoted to Nascent
and Start-up Entrepreneurs, Opportunity Recognition, and New Venture Creation
Process. As recently as in the 1999 edition most of the first 200 pages were
devoted to “characteristics of entrepreneurs” (Reynolds et al., 1999). Below I will
offer some guidance that I hope can help strengthen this positive trend.

General Design Issues
Before going into any detail, let us just point out some of the most important
and obvious implications for empirical work that the argument so far has given.
First, theories exist. Whenever possible, entrepreneurship research should apply
existing theory, after ascertaining that the theory is conceptually adequate for
the task. However, the domain must allow also for filling gaps and asking new
questions through inductive, theory-building approaches. This will likely require
both in-depth and broadly based investigations. I would argue that a systematic
combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches within focused research
programs has the highest probability of attaining a high yield.
Second, entrepreneurship is about emergence. This means that the objects
under study have to be captured at – or traced back to – a very early stage.
Studying samples of established small firms or business owner-managers does
not automatically capture aspects of emergence. Third, we have discussed

<-----Page 37----->352

PER DAVIDSSON

entrepreneurship as behaviors in the processes of discovery and exploitation. This
calls for longitudinal research. Cross-sectional designs do not capture processes
very well. Fourth, we have accepted heterogeneity and uncertainty as fundamental
and permanent features of the economy. This has a series of implications for
selection of theories, samples, analysis methods and interpretations.
Clearly, doing good empirical work on entrepreneurship is going to be
difficult and requiring some creativity and ingenuity. It is not for the lazy or the
faint-hearted. For those who appreciate challenges it can be all the more rewarding.

Sampling and Data Collection
In my treatment of sampling and data collection issues I will put the heaviest
emphasis on a kind of study that I find to be very short in supply in spite of its
potential for addressing very central research questions in entrepreneurship. This is
the longitudinal, real time study of samples of emerging business activity, using the
venture itself as the level of analysis. I will only provide occasional commentary
on other types of study.
I have argued that entrepreneurship research should study the behaviors undertaken in the processes of discovery and exploitation of ideas for new business
ventures. Behaviors in such processes can be studied on various levels of analysis,
which entails the problem of measuring but not sampling them (cf. Fig. 4).
However, as suggested above and unlike the previous preference for samples
of individuals or firms (Chandler & Lyon, 2001; Davidsson & Wiklund, 2001),
entrepreneurship researchers should consider using the emerging new venture
itself as the level of analysis. Doing so involves several tough but interesting
sampling challenges related to (non-)existence, frequency, and heterogeneity.
The essence of the problem of existence is that it will be difficult to sample
directly from available business registers. In many countries most new, independent start-ups remain so small that they never enter official business registers (cf.
Aldrich, Kalleberg, Marsden & Cassell, 1989). When and where they do, they
typically do so at a late stage. Internal ventures are even more invisible in business
registers. Archival data can be of some use for aggregate level or historical studies,
and advice on how emerging firms and populations can be located in archives
at early stages is provided by Aldrich et al. (1989), Aldrich and Martinez (2001)
and Katz and Gartner (1988). However, even with the most ingenious approach,
success (selection) bias is almost certain to hamper the analysis. Because only
efforts that have survived to a certain stage are included, risk-taking behaviors
that increase outcome variance will be interpreted as success factors. Therefore,
primary data collection techniques for capturing discovery and exploitation

<-----Page 38----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

353

processes at early stages are needed for the study of entrepreneurial processes as
they happen, without selection and hindsight biases.
This leads to the problem of frequency. In the absence of a sampling frame
that lists the population of emerging ventures, the sampling process has to start
with something else. In the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED)
the solution was to start from a sampling frame of households to arrive at a
representative sample of the adult population of individuals (Reynolds, 2000; cf.
Reynolds et al., 2001). With this approach, all contacted individuals are asked
a series of nested screening questions, the most important being whether they
are at present trying to start a new business. Because only a small fraction is
involved in entrepreneurial processes at any given time a very large sample
has to be screened in order to arrive at a sizable number of cases eligible for
continued study. Although there may exist ways to make the sampling more
efficient (cf. Reynolds & Miller, 1992) the frequency problem will always mean
that sampling for entrepreneurship studies will be expensive. So-called “snowball
sampling” (Douglas & Craig, 1983, p. 213) could reduce the monetary cost but
only at the cost of introducing bias. Because more and more people know about
an emerging venture the longer it has been active, and because well-networked
nascent entrepreneurs appear to be more successful (Davidsson & Honig, 2003),
snowball sampling is likely to yield a sample of emerging ventures that is farther
into the process, and more successful, than average.21
It may be possible to further refine the PSED method of capturing processes in
early stages, but a two-stage sampling process of this kind is likely to remain an
important tool for entrepreneurship research. For example, Chandler et al. (2002)
recently extended it to internal ventures by starting from a large cohort of firms and
screening them for emerging internal ventures. In their case the firms were young
and small. If extended to larger firms the additional complication is added that no
single individual can be assumed to know early on about all new initiatives that
are taken within the firm. Therefore, procedures for locating relevant informants
have to be developed.
Another aspect of the frequency problem concerns the earliest stages of the
discovery process, i.e. when new ideas are initially conceived of. This is a
particularly infrequent phenomenon, which creates particular challenges for the
researcher (cf. Simon in Sarasvathy, 1999b, p. 52). For example, field studies of
“entrepreneurs” mimicking Mintzberg’s (1974) study of managers are unlikely to
capture initial discovery. The early stages of discovery may be better researched
through laboratory methods (Fiet & Migliore, 2001; Sarasvathy, 1999a). This also
attracts attention to another important sampling issue, namely that the behaviors
of practicing entrepreneurs do not necessarily give all the answers needed for the
development of normative entrepreneurship theory. Therefore, entrepreneurship

<-----Page 39----->354

PER DAVIDSSON

research – especially when addressing discovery – can work also with samples composed of individuals other than (nascent) entrepreneurs (Davidsson,
2002; Fiet, 2002).
The frequency problem is further aggravated by the problem of heterogeneity.
After investing in the expensive screening procedure needed for obtaining a sample
of ongoing entrepreneurial processes the research may end up with a sample that
is too diverse for any strong relationships to emerge. This is one of the problems
with PSED and its sister projects in other countries. A random sample of ongoing
independent start-ups will be heterogeneous along many dimensions. In addition,
it will be dominated by relatively modest and imitative efforts (Aldrich, 1999;
Delmar & Davidsson, 1999; Samuelsson, 2001). Pre-stratification of the underlying screening sample may be a way to get more homogeneous samples, or samples
with a higher yield of high-potential ventures. Individuals may be stratified by, e.g.
education or occupation. When firms are used for screening of samples of emerging
internal ventures traditional stratification variables like firm age, size and industry
can be used.
However, it is not a given that these pre-stratifications can deal with the most
relevant aspects of heterogeneity. For example, Bhave (1994) points out that type
of novelty (in product, business concept, or production technology) may be a
better indication of similarity than is industry classification. For many purposes
post-stratification may be the only way to obtain more homogeneous samples.
When this is the case the only alternative is to increase the size of the study,
so as to make possible analysis of subgroups not identifiable a priori. This, of
course, further increases the cost of sampling for good empirical research on
entrepreneurship.
With a qualitative approach it may be easier to distil cases that are at the same
time less heterogeneous and more relevant for the research questions. However, the
very heterogeneity that would motivate such an approach in the first place makes the
applicability of theory generated from a small number of cases even more narrow
and uncertain than when the cases are drawn from a more homogeneous population.
Heterogeneity is not only a problem that should be designed away. Aspects
of heterogeneity may just as well be the essence of research questions in
entrepreneurship (cf. above). The conventional way of doing this is to carefully
measure the aspects of heterogeneity that are of interest and to include control
variables and interaction effects in the analysis. This helps, but can never
simultaneously address all aspects of heterogeneity in a satisfactory manner. Less
conventional studies combine homogeneity and heterogeneity in fruitful ways.
Gratzer’s (1996, 1999) complete reconstruction of the rise and fall for the automated restaurant industry in Sweden, and Shane’s (2000b) study of all individuals
and business initiatives associated with a particular technological innovation are

<-----Page 40----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

355

examples of retrospective studies where focus on a narrow empirical context (i.e.
homogeneity) allows interesting insights about heterogeneity.

The Problem of Process
The process character of entrepreneurship creates additional challenges. We have
noted already that this calls for longitudinal studies, which are still short in supply
(Aldrich & Baker, 1997; Chandler & Lyon, 2001). The first problem that comes to
mind when discussing longitudinal data collection is attrition, i.e. the tendency for
the sample to get smaller and smaller over time because cases cannot be located or
refuse to continue to participate in the study. Experiences from PSED and related
studies have been, however, that attrition in this regard is not the big problem. On
the contrary, once nascent entrepreneurs have been identified and taken through
the initial interview they have been very willing or even enthusiastic about further
participation.22 Instead, there are other but less obvious problems that have to be
dealt with.
First, firm start-up processes have different duration. In some cases the time
between the first concrete step towards a new business, and an up and running firm,
is a matter of weeks or months. In other cases it takes several years, or the process
may never be completed nor terminated. As longer processes are eligible for
sampling over longer periods of time, a sample of on-going initiatives identified
at a given point in time will in a sense have an over-representation of long start-up
processes relative to short processes. This may require some kind of correction
either in the sampling procedure or in the analysis (cf. Delmar & Shane, 2002).
Second, when sampling emerging business ventures some minimum criterion
is needed in order to determine whether a case qualifies, e.g. that some concrete
start-up activity like “talking to the bank,” “writing a business plan” or “renting
premises” has been undertaken. Likewise, a maximum criterion is needed beyond
which the case is no longer an emerging venture but an established one (cf. Shaver
et al., 2001). With these criteria in place, however, the problem remains that when
sampled at a particular point in time the sampled venture efforts will be captured
at different stages of development. Some will be caught at the very earliest
stages while others may be close to “up and running.” In the PSED research, the
use of questions that give “time stamps” for different gestation activities helps
address this question. Cases that appear to be “eternal start-ups” that will never be
completed may be eliminated from the analysis, and the data can be re-organized
using the reported time of a certain activity as the anchor rather the time of the
interview (Delmar & Shane, 2002). Alternatively, either the number of start-up
behaviors or the time elapsed since the first behavior can be used as a control

<-----Page 41----->356

PER DAVIDSSON

variable in the analysis (Honig & Davidsson, 2000). However, it is inevitable that
samples of real emerging processes will have some heterogeneity of this kind on
the time dimension.
Third, when re-contacted over time it will happen in each wave that some
of the cases no longer are “emerging ventures” but either abandoned efforts
or established business operations. Conceptualizations, analysis strategies and
methods have to be applied that ensure that these differential outcomes do not
cause biased results. Fourth, among those cases that still are “emerging ventures”
when re-contacted, one possibility is that the initial respondent is still pursuing
the same venture idea. This is an unproblematic case, as is the case when the case
when the original respondents and all other team members have abandoned the
project. It is also possible, however, that: (a) the initial respondent is still trying
to start a business, but based on a completely different idea; or (b) the initial
respondent is no longer active in the process, but other team members continue to
pursue the original venture idea. Because of these unstable relationships between
individuals and ventures it has to be decided what is the level of analysis, i.e.
what it is, that should be followed over time. This is not a decision that should
be taken lightly. A data set that follows individuals may be appropriate for some
theories and research questions whereas a venture-based data set may be more
appropriate for other theories and research questions. Therefore, one attractive
alternative is to create, within the same study, different versions of the data set,
where the different versions use the individual(s), the emerging venture, or the
juxtaposition of the two (cf. Shane & Venkataraman, 2000) as the basic unit.
Finally, when the emerging venture is the entity being followed situations will
arise when it has to be asked whether the studied entity is in a meaningful way still
the “same” unit, or if it has changed so much that it is now a different emerging
venture than the original one. This, too, is a tricky issue to settle. For some
purposes keeping such chameleons in the sample may create disturbing noise. In
other cases the changes in the business concept that occur over time may be the
researchers’ main interest. While perhaps particularly pronounced when studying
early stages and dynamic aspects of the economy, this problem is in no way unique
to entrepreneurship research. For example, in a study that followed business
firms over a ten-year period we found that a majority of these firms underwent
such changes that it could be questioned whether they could meaningfully be
considered “the same” units at the end of the period (Davidsson & Wiklund, 2000).

Measurement and Data Analysis
Apart from the challenges of sampling and following the sample over time, there
are additional challenges associated with measurement and data analysis. There is

<-----Page 42----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

357

a lack of validated measures of central concepts in entrepreneurship (Chandler &
Lyon, 2001). This is particularly true for concepts that are central in entrepreneurship research but not in the disciplines or in other fields of research, such as
“venture idea,” “discovery behaviors” and “exploitation behaviors” (Davidsson,
2000). Although some work in this direction has been done in PSED and related
studies (Chandler et al., 2002; Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Reynolds, 2000;
Samuelsson, 2001) much more remains to be done. Likewise, non-traditional
assessment of outcomes on different levels needs to be developed. Another aspect
of improved measurement is the combination of data sources for triangulation
purposes, which has been infrequent in entrepreneurship research (Chandler &
Lyon, 2001). As noted above, archival data are likely not to exist for emerging
business activities. However, teams rather than single individuals run a large share
of all independent start-ups, and probably an even larger share of all internal ventures. This makes it possible reduce common method variance through the use of
multiple respondents.
I have emphasized repeatedly that entrepreneurship is characterized by
heterogeneity and that it is a process, which should be studied over time. One
aspect of heterogeneity is that the most interesting cases are likely to be found
at the outskirts of distributions. Another is that a sample of emerging businesses
is going to consist of entities that were initiated at different points in time, and
likewise will “graduate” into established new businesses at different points in
time. I have also remarked, with Venkataraman (1997), that relative performance
may not be the most relevant outcome variable.
As a consequence, the standard package of statistical analysis methods will not
be the most appropriate tools for analyzing this phenomenon. These methods are
often developed for cross-sectional analysis and focus around central tendencies
and variance – preferably normally distributed – around them. Outliers are a
problem, as are incomplete data. This means that the researcher who wants to do
really good empirical work will have to find and learn methods that better match
the research questions and data characteristics at hand. This, too, is a development
that has only just begun. To name a few examples that probably point out the
right direction we have Gimeno et al.’s (1997) careful adaptation of analysis tools
to the analysis problem, Delmar and Shane’s (2002) use of event history analysis
and Samuelsson’s (2001) introduction of latent growth modeling to the domain of
entrepreneurship research.

CONCLUSION
I argued in the introduction to this chapter that rather than being a confused
research community heading for disaster we now have the intellectual building

<-----Page 43----->358

PER DAVIDSSON

blocks in place to build a strong paradigm for entrepreneurship research. My
purpose with this manuscript has been to bring together and elaborate on insights
that others have provided, in the hope that doing so could help researchers conduct
entrepreneurship research that constitutes genuine and valuable contributions to
academia and practice.
The field of entrepreneurship can achieve greater coherence, I argued, if we
realize that different views on what entrepreneurship is to a great extent are due to
differences in emphasis on entrepreneurship as societal phenomenon, as scholarly
domain, or as a teaching subject. I have tried to clarify these distinctions and
to point out where various criteria do and do not belong, in the hope to show
that what appears to be opposing views are in fact rather easy to reconcile in
many cases. Reaching a reasonable level of agreement on what entrepreneurship
research should study may be much easier than it might first seem.
More specifically, I have suggested that it is adequate to include some kind
of “success” in the definition when we have entrepreneurship as a societal
phenomenon – but not the scholarly domain – in mind. Leaning on Kirzner
(1973) I suggested that the societal phenomenon is well captured by the notion
that entrepreneurship consists of the competitive behaviors that drive the market
process. I argued that criteria like purposefulness, skill and expectation of gain
for self come naturally when we think of entrepreneurship as a teaching subject,
but may be overly restrictive from the other perspectives. I also argued that
while topics like self-employment, small business management, and family
business succession might fit naturally in an entrepreneurship teaching context,
they represent a diverse set of phenomena that are not necessarily related to
“entrepreneurship” as we have defined the societal phenomenon.
With regard to the scholarly domain I have tried to develop a perspective that
makes use of and room for earlier contributions by Gartner (1988, 2001) and by
Shane and Venkataraman (2000, 2001). I have also proposed what I hope to be an
agreeable middle ground position on the issue of opportunity as created or existing
independently of the actor. I have further proposed – along with Low (2001) – that
neither “entrepreneurship as separate domain” nor “entrepreneurship belongs in
the disciplines” is the right strategy for maximizing knowledge development about
entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship research requires input from the disciplines
but it also needs the community created by or in a distinct domain. The domain
delineation I suggested reads:
Starting from assumptions of uncertainty and heterogeneity, the scholarly
domain of entrepreneurship encompasses the processes of (real or induced, and
completed as well as terminated) emergence of new business ventures, across
organizational contexts. This entails the study of the origin and characteristics
of venture ideas as well as their contextual fit; of behaviors in the interrelated

<-----Page 44----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

359

processes of discovery and exploitation of such ideas, and of how the ideas and
behaviors link to different types of direct and indirect antecedents and outcomes
on different levels of analysis.
Finally, I discussed a number of method challenges in entrepreneurship
research. In particular, I argued for more studies that use the venture idea and the
activity that evolves around it as the unit of analysis. Such studies would capture
new business initiatives at an early stage and follow them over time, through
whatever changes in human champions and organizational contexts that might
occur.
Entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain has the potential to generate unique
insights about phenomena of very high societal relevance. In order to realize that
potential, the field needs to continue to improve. In the role as researchers this is a
task we can take on along two routes. First, we can be more careful with how we
use the word “entrepreneur” and its derivatives. Second, we can conduct better research, following some of the suggestions outlined in this chapter. That is, we can
make our research more theory-driven, have it address research questions closer
to the heartland of the scholarly domain, and apply more adequate methodology.
Doing such research requires ingenuity and attention to many new challenges in
sampling, measurement and analysis. The problems may seem prohibitive, and one
should not expect every single study to have a perfect solution to every possible
problem. That would be asking too much. From senior researchers and research
foundations one can reasonable demand that more large-scale, longitudinal
studies be conducted. Doctoral students and junior scholars under time and tenure
constraints could then “tap into” these pre-existing studies. Alternatively, they
could focus on research questions that do not demand process data, such as development and validation of better measures of concepts, or “laboratory” research
on discovery.
Researchers do not have the only key role. Reviewers, conference organizers
and journal editors are very important for the field’s future development. As I see it,
they should give priority to research on emergence of new business activities. They
should also continue to welcome research on, e.g. self-employment, small business,
family business, organizational change, regional development, or strategy and firm
performance – but only when these issues are explicitly linked to the existence
and characteristics of venture ideas, to behaviors in the processes leading to their
discovery and exploitation, and to the outcomes of such efforts. It is when holders
of such roles become tougher in asking “is this really about entrepreneurship?” that
the scholarly domain of entrepreneurship can become a logically distinct and coherent field of research. Achieving this is necessary for entrepreneurship research
to make real progress, to earn and deserve respect, and provide a better basis for
community.

EPILOGUE
Writing a manuscript of the present kind is an idea one gets or a kind of assignment
one accepts only in moments of outrageous hubris. It is, of course, beyond the
capacity of most scholars, and certainly beyond the capacity of the current author,
to have the overview that would be needed in order to really manage such a task.
So the punishment for the hubris, I guess, is to realize that every reader will be
able to spot many omissions, misrepresentations, or even pure errors. However,
I rationalize my overly pretentious effort on the grounds that: (a) I have admired
others work of the same kind and found it very rewarding to read it, even if I did
not find every line they wrote well-informed or logically convincing; and (b) if we
were allowed to speak only when in possession of complete knowledge we would
not say much at all.
A conference reviewer of the extended abstract of a (much different) early
draft of this manuscript opened her “comments to author(s)” by pointing out that
“Paradigm development seldom takes place through normative claims . . . .” This
is a critique well deserved – and well taken. In a similar vein, Aldrich and Baker
(1997, p. 398) point out:
What lesson can be learned from history? Influence comes from exemplary research, not from
propagation of rules or admonition. The field will be shaped by those who produce research
that interests and attracts others to build on their work (. . .). Those who believe they know the
path forward need to do such work themselves and (. . .) provide exemplars that attract others
to follow.

This is an idea that I have tried to take seriously. Therefore, I have referred
repeatedly in this manuscript to other researcher’s work that I find exemplary and
worth following, in the hope that some curious readers may check the sources.
I have further had the privilege to lead the Program on Entrepreneurship and
Growth (PEG) at the Jönköping International Business, where we have tried to
apply some of the ideas outlined above. That is, we run longitudinal, real time
projects using the “emerging new venture” as the level of analysis; we do study
behaviors that shape the discovery and exploitation processes, and we do research
on the characteristics of venture ideas, and their effects. Whether or not any of
our research will be regarded “exemplary” and worth following is, however, for
others to judge.

NOTES
1. The disposition-based view sees (the degree of) entrepreneurship as an inherent
characteristic of, e.g. individuals, regions, or cultures. While it is not impossible to

<-----Page 46----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

361

gain valuable insights from a dispositional view (e.g. Baumol, 1990) I would generally
discourage its use, and instead use behavior- and outcome-based criteria.
2. This choice should not be interpreted as a general preference by the author for Kirzner’s
theorizing over, e.g. Schumpeter’s or Baumol’s. As will become evident, while I find
Kirzner’s way to express the role of entrepreneurship very useful and clarifying there are
many aspects of Kirzner’s theory that I find debatable or less useful.
3. Alternatively, Cole’s definition can be interpreted as requiring initiation and maintenance and aggrandizement. While much tougher than the “and/or” interpretation this is
still fundamentally different from the market-based view of the societal phenomenon of
entrepreneurship that I suggest be used.
4. Starting from an ideal situation where existing regulatory frameworks were optimally
designed for the functioning of the economy, “re-distributive” ventures would coincide with
ventures that break the law in order to achieve their goals. In a real economy regulatory
frameworks are unlikely to be optimally designed and “legal yet re-distributive” and “illegal
yet socially beneficial” ventures are both possible, making it very difficult to classify with
certainty in which category (quadrant) each individual venture belongs. The conceptual
distinctions between the categories in Fig. 2 may nevertheless be valuable.
5. Kirzner (1973, p. 94) asserts that entrepreneurial activity is always competitive
and competitive activity is always entrepreneurial. In combination with the assertion that
entrepreneurship moves the economy towards equilibrium, i.e. towards more efficient
resource use, this does not seem to leave room for the existence of “re-distributive” ventures.
However, Kirzner points out that his assertion is made for a (hypothetical) market economy
free of government limitation on individual economic action. In real economies, I would
argue, “re-distributive” ventures undoubtedly exist. Moreover, one might wonder whether
Kirzner’s reciprocal identity between competitive and entrepreneurial behaviors would
hold in an economy free of government intervention. In such an economy a producer may
well try to win the market by killing his competitors and/or burning their premises. Either
“competitive” must be defined in way that such behaviors for some reason do not qualify,
or their existence is inconsistent with Kirzner’s assertion that all competitive behavior
is entrepreneurial.
6. With a strained argumentation one can say, of course, that al-Quaida operates in
the “market” for recruiting future terrorists, and that by demonstrating the “power” and
“success” of the September 11 attacks it drives the market process in that market, presumably
making it harder for “competing” terrorist organizations to attract the same recruits.
7. I have chosen to follow Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000) terminology. Alternatively,
what I discuss could have been called entrepreneurship as “research domain” or “field of
research.”
8. According to Kirzner (1973) “Entrepreneurship does not consist of grasping a free
ten-dollar bill which one has already discovered to be resting in one’s hand; it consists of
realizing that it is in one’s hand and that it is available for the grasping.”
9. Reportedly when asked at a seminar whether entrepreneurs could be studied empirically, Kirzner was not able to give an answer (Beckman, 1990, p. 100).
10. In fact, one of Schumpeter’s (1934) few weaknesses was that despite first defining
the entrepreneur as a function in the economy and not as a flesh-and-blood individual,
he could not resist the temptation to speculate about the goals and characteristics of the
“entrepreneur,” thereby probably inspiring a lot of not very productive research (Gartner,
1988; Kilby, 1971). However, the “trait approach” in early entrepreneurship research
did not come out with a complete lack of findings (cf. Johnson, 1990). Personality has

<-----Page 47----->362

PER DAVIDSSON

also “bounced back” to some extent both in psychology proper and in entrepreneurship
research, showing that with better conceptualizations, sampling and measurement stronger
results can be obtained (Church & Burke, 1994; Gasse, 1996; Miner, 1996). However,
innate characteristics of individuals will no doubt remain a minor issue in explaining
entrepreneurial behavior and outcomes. Researchers who find it difficult to give up the
idea of attributing entrepreneurial processes to the entrepreneur have a tendency to end
up in circular reasoning (Ensley, Carland & Carland, 2000) or very strained definitions of
“individual” (Bruyat & Julien, 2000) when faced with the fact that between the original
identification of a “new to the world” business idea, and the successful exploitation of
that idea in a particular geographic market, we may find a series of different individuals
who assume various initiating, supporting, implementing and imitating roles, either
concurrently or sequentially (Gratzer, 1996). Shane and Venkataraman (2000) retain a
strong interest in the role of individuals – so much so that Venkataraman (1997) has been
criticized for precisely that reason (Schoonhoven & Romanelli, 2001). Cole (1969, p. 17)
admitted that the Harvard center he led for many years devoted considerable effort to
defining the “entrepreneur” – but without success. However, Shane and Venkataraman’s
(2000) interest in individuals concerns primarily the matching of individuals and venture
ideas (Shane, 2000b) and with a well chosen “by whom” – which could mean one or
more people who assume different roles in the discovery and exploitation processes;
concurrently or in a relay – they avoid most of the problems associated with such
an interest.
11. The observant reader may note that Shane and Venkataraman (2000) actually
distinguish between three processes, as the quote reads, “. . . discovered, evaluated,
and exploited . . . .” Venkataraman’s (1997) original reads, “. . . discovered, created, and
exploited . . . .” In Shane and Venkataraman (2000) separate sub-sections are devoted to
elaboration on discovery and exploitation, but none to evaluation. The same is true for
Eckhardt and Shane (2003). On this basis I think it makes sense to say that “discovery” and
“exploitation” are the two main processes, and that the possibility of “opportunity creation”
as well as the process of “opportunity evaluation” are captured within these two main
processes.
12. This has also led other scholars to adopt Gartner’s definition (Aldrich, 1999;
Thornton, 1999) although some would exchange “creation” for “emergence” thus
de-emphasizing behavioral and strategic aspects. While keeping behavior as the main
interest Gartner (1993) himself has later preferred “emergence” in order to de-emphasize
the planning and rationalistic connotations of “creation.”
13. For example, individuals are heterogeneous with respect to experience, skills and
cognitive capacity (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Shane, 2000a, b)
and also have heterogeneous motivations (Birley & Westhead, 1994). Two important aspects of organizational heterogeneity are governance structure (Coase, 1937; Foss, 1993;
Williamson, 1999) and resources (Barney, 1991; Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Collins &
Montgomery, 1995; Foss, 1993; Galunic & Rodan, 1998; Greene, Brush & Hart, 1999;
Penrose, 1959; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997). Whether or not a new venture evolves
within an existing organization the external environment in a broader sense will also be
heterogeneous (Baumol, 1990; Chandler & Hanks, 1994) and the characteristics of the
external environment may have profound effects on what venture ideas are attractive and
likely to succeed (Zahra & Dess, 2001). Heterogeneity also occurs over time. Individuals
and organizations learn and change over time and whether or not they choose to remain

<-----Page 48----->The Domain of Entrepreneurship Research

363

in the “same” environment, the characteristics of the environment are not stable, either
(Aldrich, 1999; Aldrich & Martinez, 2001; Miner & Mezias, 1996). It follows from all this
heterogeneity that the universe of perceptible and profitable opportunity is not the same for
all individuals or organizations, and that therefore they will come up with different venture
ideas and different exploitation strategies. Importantly, they will also have different views on
what constitutes a successful or acceptable outcome (Gimeno, Folta, Cooper & Woo, 1997;
Venkataraman, 1997).
14. Judging from other parts of their writings I think it is safe to say that Shane and
Venkataraman (2000) did not intend to suggest that entrepreneurship can only be studied
retrospectively. Disappointingly, though, they did not take the chance to sort this out in
the debate following upon the publication of their article (Shane & Venkataraman, 2001).
Both Shane and Venkataraman have subsequently been involved in manuscripts portraying
a more refined view of “opportunity” (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Sarasvathy et al., 2003)
but none that completely solves the problems with the “opportunity” concept discussed
here. At the root of the problem, I believe, lies that Shane and Venkataraman (2000) first
set out to delineate the scholarly domain of entrepreneurship, but then fail to uphold the
distinction between the scholarly domain and the societal phenomenon. I would argue
that it is entrepreneurship as a societal phenomenon in the sense discussed above that
Shane and Venkataraman (2000) have in mind when they adopt Casson’s (1982) definition of entrepreneurial opportunity. This definition fits with their first research question,
about why, when and how “opportunities” come into existence, and with their assertions
that “To have entrepreneurship, you must first have entrepreneurial opportunities” (p. 220)
and “Although the discovery of an opportunity is a necessary condition for entrepreneurship, it is not sufficient” (p. 222). When they argue (Shane & Venkataraman, 2000, 2001)
that ventures fail because opportunities were poorly exploited one might wonder by what
criterion we can determine that they were “opportunities” at all in Casson’s sense, and
thus that they belong in the scholarly domain of entrepreneurship? How difficult Casson’s
opportunity concept is to apply consistently is illustrated also by Shane and Venkataraman’s assertion that “many people exploit opportunities that are unlikely to be successful”
(Shane & Venkataraman, 2001, p. 15), which is not congruent with deﬁning opportunity as
profitable.
15. According to this perspective, although opportunities objectively exist “out there,”
it is impossible to know the universe of not-yet-discovered, viable venture ideas that are
within reach for a particular actor (cf. Sarasvathy et al., 2003). It is therefore reasonable
to think of each individual’s universe of viable venture ideas as infinite. Nonetheless,
because of perceptual and knowledge differences some individuals have easier access to
more viable ideas than have others. This statement may seem paradoxical but is no more
so than the fact that the universe of all positive integers and the universe of all positive
even integers are both infinite, and nonetheless the latter is “smaller” than the former.
16. We may still require, however, that it is an opportunity only if the entrepreneur (or
possibly an imitator) successfully convinces the world that this creation has value.
17. Eckhardt and Shane (2003) suggest there is a sequence from existence of opportunities, to discovery of opportunities, and further to exploitation. They hold that “While this
process may have feedback loops and certainly is not linear, we theorize that it is directional.
Opportunities exist prior to their discovery and opportunities are discovered before they are
exploited. The opposite direction is not possible because opportunities cannot be exploited
before they exist.” I do not think that even a directional hypothesis should be a basic

<-----Page 49----->364

PER DAVIDSSON

assumption for entrepreneurship as a scholarly domain. The problems inherent in starting
with the “existence of opportunity” have been dealt with above. Moreover, consider the following examples (note that Eckhardt and Shane admit that “discovery” does not necessarily
reflect “real” opportunity). Discovery without existence: any process that turns out a failure
because the actor was wrong about the perceived external opportunity; it did not exist. Discovery before existence: an entrepreneur develops a business concepts that becomes viable
only because of an external chock that happens after the idea was developed, and which was
unknowable until it occurred. Exploitation before discovery: Bhave’s (1994) result suggest
it is rather common that while trying to solve a problem for themselves, individuals engage
in what would be classified as exploitation behaviors and only afterwards do they come to
see their solution also as an idea for a business. Exploitation without discovery: a venture
may become successful “by mistake,” i.e. generate revenue by other means and from
other buyers than the intended ones. That is, the “discovered” opportunity did not exist,
but the attempt to exploit it successfully exploited another, existing but non-discovered,
set of external conditions (“opportunity”). Having said this, empirical results support the
notion that the process is – on average – directional, involving first an intention, which
over behaviors related to resource acquisition and boundary-creation lead to exchange
(Samuelsson, forthcoming).
18. Interestingly, this disproportionate interest in the individual is shared by diffusion
research, where only about one percent of the close to 4,000 studies have focused on the
characteristics of the innovation, whereas more than half of them focus on the individuals
who adopted them (Rogers, 1995). The categorization of innovations in diffusion research
along the dimensions relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, trialability and observability is nevertheless a source of inspiration for assessing venture ideas. The distinctions
imitation, competence-enhancing innovation, and competence-destroying innovation are
also likely to be useful (cf. Aldrich, 1999; Anderson & Tushman, 1990), as are Bhave’s
(1994) distinctions between different types of novelty: in product, in business concept or in
production technology.
19. Relative to the original, I have added “where” and “for whom” in question 1, and
changed “opportunities” to “opportunity.” In questions 2–4 I have substituted “venture
ideas” for “opportunities.” I have also generalized question 2 to any unit of analysis rather
than restricting it to the individual level. Note that the fourth question is not explicitly stated
by Shane and Venkataraman (2000) but derived from their domain definition as well as from
Shane and Venkataraman (2001) and Venkataraman (1997).
20. Shane and Venkataraman (2000) have a more narrow view on question 3, showing
a particular interest in why and with what consequences some venture ideas are commercialized as de novo start-ups, whereas for others an existing organization is used for the
launching. Acknowledging that this is a highly interesting and previously much neglected
issue in entrepreneurship research I have little to add to Shane and Venkataraman’s (2000)
treatment.
21. Note that the suggested two-stage sampling procedure will result in over-sampling
of team ventures. This can be corrected by post-weighing given that information exists on
the true proportions of team and solo start-ups.
22. For the Swedish study I have this information in the capacity of principal investigator
(cf. also Delmar & Shane, 2002). As regards the US effort I have the information from being
a member of its executive committee and from personal communication with the initiator
and co-ordinator of the project, professor Paul D. Reynolds.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The ideas presented in this chapter are an outgrowth of conceptual and empirical
work conducted within the “Program on Entrepreneurship and Growth in SMEs”
(PEG), which was funded mainly by the Knut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation,
and which involved a large number of Swedish and international scholars.
Forerunners to – and early drafts of – this manuscript have been presented at
several seminars and doctoral consortia. Colleagues have been generously sharing
their views on earlier versions, thus helping to shape my thinking, sharpening
my arguments, and clarifying the exposition. With the risk of forgetting someone
who has been really important I would like especially to thank PEG collaborators
Candida Brush, Gaylen Chandler, Jonas Dahlqvist, James O. Fiet, Veronica
Gustavsson, Scott Shane and Johan Wiklund, as well as Jerry Katz, Pramodita
Sharma, Ivo Zander and an anonymous reviewer for the RENT 2001 conference,
for their comments and suggestions. While their help has been invaluable and
certainly increased the quality of the end product, the responsibility for the views
put forward in this manuscript, and the remaining flaws, remains with the author.
