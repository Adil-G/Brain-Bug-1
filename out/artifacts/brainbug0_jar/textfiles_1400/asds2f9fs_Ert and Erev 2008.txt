Abstract
Previous studies of mixed gambles (gambles that yield gains and losses) reveal mixed results.
Whereas some studies show a tendency to reject highly attractive mixed gambles, other studies show
indiﬀerence between mixed gambles with an expected value of 0 and the status quo. The current
paper presents three studies that explore this discrepancy. The results highlight a strong sensitivity
to the format and the context of the choice task. People tend to reject attractive mixed gambles when
they are asked to decide whether to accept them, but tend to prefer these gambles over a sure payoﬀ
of 0 in a choice task. The tendency to reject mixed gambles is larger in a response to a hallway questionnaire than in the laboratory. This pattern can be summarized with the assertion that people
behave as if they use a ‘‘lemon avoidance heuristic’’ that can be described as an intuitive implementation of SPAM killer techniques.

1. Introduction
Samuelson (1963) notes that one of his colleagues prefers the status quo over a gamble
that oﬀers an even chance to win $200 or lose $100.1 Follow up studies suggest that preferences of this type are rather common (e.g., Redelmeier & Tversky, 1992; Tom, Fox, Trepel, & Poldrack, 2007; Wedell & Bockenholt, 1994). According to prospect theory
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) these preferences reﬂect loss aversion: The gamble is rejected
because the possible loss (of $100) looms larger than the possible gain (of $200) (see Tversky & Kahneman, 1991).
The robustness of the tendency to reject objectively attractive mixed gambles is highlighted in Redelmeier and Tversky (1992). In one of their studies participants were faced
with the following problem:
Problem ‘‘High EV’’ (Redelmeier & Tversky, 1992):
Imagine that you have the opportunity to play a gamble that oﬀers a 50% chance to win
$2000 and a 50% chance to lose $500. Would you play the gamble?
The results reveal that only 43% of the participants were willing to play the hypothetical
gamble although its expected value was much higher (+$750) than the status quo of not
playing.
In light of the clear results summarized above, the results of several recent studies (e.g.,
Erev, Ert, & Yechiam, 2007; Ert & Erev, 2007) have come as a surprise. Rather than indicating loss aversion, observed choices revealed indiﬀerence between mixed gambles with
an expected value of 0 and safer prospects with the same expected value. In one of these
studies, the participants (70 Technion students) were presented with the following hypothetical choice problem (the payoﬀs are in Sheqels, 4 Sheqels = $1):
Problem ‘‘Equal EV’’ (Ert & Erev, 2007):
Please choose between:
a. 0 with certainty

b. 1000 with probability of 0.5
1000 with probability of 0.5

Half the participants (50%) preferred the risky gamble, even though it had the same
expected value as the status quo option (i.e., the zero) and it was associated with a relatively high loss. This observation contradicts the common assumption that the typical
decision-maker behaves as if losses loom larger than equivalent gains.2 The main objective
of the current study is to explore the apparent contradiction between Redelmeier and
Tversky’s (1992) and Ert and Erev’s (2007) results. The starting point of the current investigation is the observation that the inconsistency can be a result of the format of the question. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that people exhibit aversion to mixed gambles when they
1

Samuelson original analysis focused on the diﬀerence between one-shot and repeated play. His colleague
rejected one-play but was willing to accept a repeated play of the same gamble. The current paper focuses on a
one-shot play.
2
This result was replicated in two other studies: one in which the outcomes were converted to real (and small)
payoﬀs, and another in which the problem was presented as part of a larger problems dataset (see Ert & Erev,
2007).

are asked to accept or reject them (the format used by Redelmeier & Tversky, 1992), but
not when they are asked to choose between two abstract prospects (the format used by Ert
& Erev, 2007). Experiment 1 tests this format hypothesis by comparing the two formats on
the same subject population using the same (objective) decision problem.
2. Experiment 1 – Direct evaluation of the format hypothesis
2.1. Method
Experiment 1 studies Problem ‘‘High EV’’, presented above, under two formats. In
Condition ‘‘Accept/reject’’ participants were presented with the original format studied
by Redelmeier and Tversky (1992). That is, they were asked if they would accept an opportunity to play Gamble ‘‘High EV’’ as presented in the introduction.
In condition ‘‘Choice’’ the problem was presented as follows:
Please choose between
a: $0 with certainty

b: $2000 with probability of 0.5
$500 with probability of 0.5

The two conditions were compared in a between-participants design. One hundred and
ten Technion students participated in the current study. Fifty-ﬁve of these participants
were randomly assigned to the accept/reject condition and the remaining participants were
assigned to the choice condition. The two conditions were run separately in two diﬀerent
rooms.3 The participants were given a description of the problem on a paper and then
marked their choice by circling their preferred option in the choice condition, and circling
‘‘Yes’’ or ‘‘No’’ in the accept/reject condition.
2.2. Results
The results reveal that 78% of the respondents preferred the gamble in the choice condition. In the accept/reject condition, however, only 55% of the respondents accepted the
gamble. This signiﬁcant diﬀerence [t(108) = 2.68, p < .01] suggests that the disparity
between Ert and Erev (2007) and Redelmeier and Tversky (1992) results can be captured
with the format hypothesis.4
3. Experiment 2: Hallway versus laboratory
Our favorite explanation of the format eﬀect, documented above, is based on ‘‘Email
analogy’’. Many of the Email messages that we receive propose trading opportunities that
3

Seventy participants responded to this problem after they completed an experiment on social choice (a
replication of Charness & Grosskopf, 2001) in two large rooms, one for each condition. The remaining 40
participants marked their preference in the laboratory after they completed a matching task in which they
compared a prospect of ($a, p; $b) with a prospect of ($c, p; $x) where a < c < b and x was systematically varied.
There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between these two groups.
4
The current result implies that participants violated the procedure invariance principle assumed under rational
choice. This result is consistent with previous studies that showed violations of this principle (e.g., with choice vs.
pricing; see Tversky, Slovic, & Kahneman, 1990 for a review).

<-----Page 3----->718

seem tricky; under Akerlof’s (1970) classical analysis these Emails are likely to sell ‘‘lemons’’.5 For example, while writing the ﬁrst draft of the current paragraph we received the
following message:
Are you interested in how you can increase your lottery chances by exactly 3,600%? Of
course. But make no mistake! Our e-LOTTERY ‘MULTI-WIN’ SYNDICATE SYSTEM is nothing like any syndicate you may have played in before. It’s unique!. . . Giving
you a fun, hassle-free way to play online every week and a huge, proven, mathematical
advantage over playing the lotteries on your own the normal way. In fact, so huge an
advantage you have a massive 702% greater chance of scooping a UK National Lotto
jackpot and an even better 3600% greater chance of scooping a EuroMillions jackpot!

Go now to: . . .’’
In order to avoid the temptation of lemons and to save time (and money) we usually try
to erase messages of this type without even reading them. Recently, our university applied
a ‘‘SPAM killer’’ rule to our Email system that tries to do this automatically. The SPAM
killer erases a message if it has features of a typical SPAM. Notice that rules of this type
use multiple criteria. For example, the algorithm is typically programmed to detect
whether the message or its headline include words such as ‘‘lottery’’, ‘‘win’’, or ‘‘success’’.
These and similar words are relevant because they appear in SPAM with high probability
(relative to non-SPAM messages).
We believe that a similar rule is used intuitively in many settings. The ‘‘Lemon Avoidance heuristic’’ implies that oﬀers that look like (have features of) lemons would be
rejected. Under this hypothesis, people are more likely to reject the mixed gamble under
the accept/reject format because this format includes more features of typical lemons. Speciﬁcally, we assert that the requirement to explicitly accept a gamble can trigger the lemon
avoidance heuristic.
Like SPAM killers, the hypothesized lemon avoidance heuristic can be triggered by
more than one feature of the environment. Experiment 2 focuses on one additional feature
of this type. It examines situations in which the decision-maker is approached by a stranger. Interestingly, it seems that we explicitly instruct our kids to use the lemon avoidance
heuristic in this setting: they should ‘‘never take a candy from a stranger’’. Thus, it is natural to hypothesize that oﬀers from strangers trigger the lemon avoidance heuristic.
3.1. Method
The experiment focuses on the two conditions of the problem ‘‘High EV’’, studied in
Experiment 1, in a diﬀerent physical environment. Instead of presenting the problem as
part of a structured experiment, the experimenter approached students casually in the faculty hallways, and presented them with one of the two conditions. Under the working
assumption of this experiment, the situation of being casually stopped by another person
and responding to her request (in this case to mark your preference for a gamble on a
5
Akerlof’s analysis suggests that rational individuals should avoid trades when the other side is likely to be
similar to them (in his valuation of the traded option), and have better estimation of this value. Product that are
traded in violation of this principle are likely to be ‘‘lemons’’ (i.e., likely to be realized as bad products).

719

paper) is a feature of a typical ‘‘lemon oﬀer’’. This situation is more similar (than the laboratory setting) to natural settings in which we are oﬀered tricky deals.
Under the lemon avoidance hypothesis (and the current working assumption), the tendency to prefer the mixed gamble in Experiment 2 is predicted to be lower than the tendency documented in Experiment 1.
One hundred and ten students participated in the current study.6 Fifty-ﬁve participants
were assigned randomly to the accept/reject condition. The remaining participants were
assigned to the choice condition. As in the ﬁrst experiment, the participants marked their
choice on papers provided.
3.2. Results
The proportion of people willing to play the gamble was 51% in the choice condition
and only 42% in the accept/reject condition. As predicted by the lemon avoidance hypothesis, the acceptance rate over the two conditions was much lower (46%) in the current
study than in Study 1 (66%). This diﬀerence is signiﬁcant [t(108) = 3.37, p < .001]. It
seems that when people are stopped casually in the hallway they are less willing to play
the gamble than when they evaluate it in a structured experiment.
It is worth noticing, however, that the proportions of gamble acceptance in each condition of the current study did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from 50%. Thus, an alternative explanation to the current results might be that people who are stopped casually in the hallway
might act randomly simply to be left alone as quickly as possible. Experiment 3 is designed
to evaluate this alternative explanation.
4. Experiment 3: Are people in the hallway conservative or indiﬀerent?
The current experiment is designed to address the alternative interpretations to the
eﬀect of the physical environment on choice as demonstrated above. The lemon avoidance
hypothesis suggests that people are less willing to play the gamble when they are stopped
casually than in structured experiment since the former situation is associated with lemon
dilemmas. According to the indiﬀerence hypothesis, however, the apparent decrease in the
peoples’ willingness to play the gamble in the hallway results from random responses that
reﬂect their disengagement with the task.
4.1. Method
In order to compare these two hypotheses, Experiment 3 studies the Equal EV problem,
presented in the introduction (and considered by Ert & Erev, 2007), in the physical environment studied in Experiment 2. To further examine the format eﬀect, Experiment 3
compares the two format conditions examined above: accept/reject and choice.
Recall that when the Equal EV gamble was presented in a choice frame and in a structured experiment (in Ert & Erev, 2007), the proportion of gamble acceptance was 50%.
Thus, the lemon avoidance hypothesis predicts that the proportion of people willing to
6

The experimenter approached students randomly in the hallways of one of the Technion buildings and asked
them to mark their preferences on a paper she gave them. Almost all students agreed to participate.

<-----Page 5----->720

play this gamble in the hallway will be lower than 50% in the choice condition, and even
lesser in the accept/reject condition. The indiﬀerence hypothesis, on the other hand, predicts that both proportions will not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from random choice.
One hundred students participated in the current study. Fifty participants were assigned
randomly to the accept/reject condition. The remaining participants were assigned to the
choice condition. The procedure was identical to the procedure reported in Experiment 2,
except that the current study focused on the Equal EV problem.
4.2. Results
The results reveal that the proportion of gambles acceptance in the choice condition
(38%) was again much higher than the proportion of gamble acceptance in the accept/reject
condition (22%). This signiﬁcant diﬀerence [t(98) = 1.76, p < .05, one tail] is similar to the
diﬀerences observed between these two conditions in the previous experiments. In addition,
the proportion of gamble acceptance over the two conditions (30%) was lower than the
overall choice in the High EV problem in Experiment 2 (46%), [t(103) = 2.46, p < .02].
Finally, the proportion of gamble acceptance in the choice condition was lower (though
insigniﬁcantly) in the hallway (38%) than the proportion of gamble acceptance in this condition when studied in class (50%). All these observations support the lemon avoidance
hypothesis. It seems that people are sensitive to the attractiveness of the gambles and do
not simply act randomly when they are approached in the hallway.
5. Discussion
The main objective of the current paper is to improve our understanding of the apparent inconsistency between previous studies of mixed gambles. Experiment 1 shows that this
inconsistency can be explained as a product of a format eﬀect: When deciding between
accepting and rejecting a mixed gamble, many participants (45%) rejected a highly attractive (expected value wise) gamble. This behavior that can be described as an indication of
loss aversion replicates previous ﬁndings by Redelmeier and Tversky (1992). However, the
tendency to prefer the status quo was reduced by half (to 22%) when the format of the
question was modiﬁed and the participants were asked to select between two options. This
behavior, that shows only weak indication of loss aversion, is consistent with the results
reported by Ert and Erev (2007).
Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that the format eﬀect can be a product of the usage of a
lemon avoidance heuristic. They show that increasing the similarity of the experimental
task to experiences with tricky oﬀers (lemons), by approaching the participants in the hallway, increases the tendency to reject the gamble.
The main shortcoming of the lemon avoidance explanation involves the ‘‘not even
wrong’’ argument.7 That is, it is hard to think about behaviors that cannot be explained
as a product of a usage of some reasonable heuristic.

7
A scientiﬁc concept is said to be ‘‘not even wrong’’ if it is not falsiﬁable in the Popperian sense, or if it is not
useful in predicting the physical world. The phrase is attributed to the physicist Wolfgang Pauli following a
remark he made about a piece of research that he was asked to evaluate (see Peierls, 1960).

<-----Page 6----->E. Ert, I. Erev / Journal of Economic Psychology 29 (2008) 715–723

721

We have three partial answers to this important critique. First, Experiments 2 and 3
demonstrate that it is possible to derive testable predictions from the lemon avoidance
hypothesis in the current context.
A second answer involves the observation that the reliance on SPAM killer is an example of an implementation of the lemon avoidance heuristic in computer programs. Thus,
there are important settings in which the usage of the lemon avoidance heuristic is explicit
and observable.
Finally, note that the hypothesized lemon avoidance heuristic can be naturally
described as a reﬁnement of the loss aversion hypothesis (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).
In order to clarify this assertion it is constructive to start with the distinction between
of two classes of explanations of behavioral decision phenomena. One class involves general (typically perceptual) phenomena. Our favorite example of an explanation of this type
is provided by the diminishing sensitivity assumption captured in prospect theory. A second class involves heuristics (see Gigerenzer & Todd, 1999; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974).
Heuristics are assumed to be cognitively simple rules that lead to eﬃcient outcomes in
many situations, but can lead to biases in some settings.
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) original abstraction of loss aversion treats this construct
as a general phenomenon. That is, loss aversion is captured with the same value function
that captures the diminishing sensitivity assumption. Note, that this function is assumed to
describe behavior in both formats that were studied here. The current results suggest that
the loss aversion tendency is less general. This tendency is better described as a heuristic:
People are likely to behave in accordance with loss aversion when the situation is similar to
an environment in which most oﬀers should be rejected.

5.1. Relationship to the status quo, omission, and commission biases
Previous research demonstrates that in many cases people deviate from rational choice
in the direction of favoring the status quo (see Samuelson & Zeckhauser, 1988) and of
favoring the omission of actions (Ritov & Baron, 1992). Both tendencies can be explained
as indications of loss aversion.
Whereas these biases are rather robust, the opposite biases are also observed in some
settings. For example, in the ‘‘Acquiring a company’’ exercise (see Samuelson & Bazerman, 1985)8 people deviate from the status quo (of not buying) when the status quo maximizes expected payoﬀ and avoids losses. Similarly, recent studies that highlight people’s
tendency to conform to established norms have showed reversals of the omission bias
(e.g., Bar Eli, Azar, Ritov, & Schein, 2007; Zeelenberg, van den Bos, van Dijk, & Pieters,
2002). The current analysis suggests a possible explanation to the concurrence of both phenomena. It suggests that problems that involve accepting/rejecting decisions (such as
deciding whether to accept or reject a proposed alternative to the status quo) facilitate
8
In the ‘‘Acquiring a company’’ task a potential buyer considers buying a company. The target company’s
value, v is known to the seller but not to the buyer. The buyer only knows that v is uniformly distributed between
0 and 100. The seller sells the company provided it is at a proﬁtable price. If the buyer purchases the company then
it’s value increases by 50%. In these conditions the ﬁnal price that a rational buyer should suggest is zero since the
selective acceptance implies negative expected returns to the buyer (see e.g., Samuelson & Bazerman, 1985 for an
explanation). Yet, the typical bid is approximately $50, and does not decrease even after experience with the task
(e.g., Bazerman & Neale, 1992; Bereby-Meyer & Grosskopf, in press).

<-----Page 7----->722

rejection. On the other hand, formats that are more related to choice tasks (as in the
‘‘acquiring a company’’ game) can reduce this tendency or even reverse it. Interestingly,
the results of recent studies that focused on diﬀerent variants of the ultimatum game
are also consistent with this hypothesis (see Larrick & Blount, 1997; Stahl & Haruvy,
2007).
5.2. Concluding remarks
The current paper shows that the inconsistency between Redelmeier and Tversky’s
(1992) and Ert and Erev’s (2007) results can be explained as a product of a format eﬀect.
The tendency to reject mixed gambles is larger when people are asked if they accept it, than
when they are asked to choose between two prospects. Moreover, approaching the participants in the hallway increases the tendency to reject the gamble. These observations suggest that the tendency to exhibit loss aversion is situation-dependent, and can be captured
with the abstraction of loss aversion as a product of reliance on the lemon avoidance heuristic. Under this abstraction the tendency to exhibit loss aversion is determined by the
psychological similarity of the choice environment to experiences in which this tendency
is reinforcing.
