A successful sale depends on a customer's perception of the salesperson's personality, motivations, trustworthiness, and affect. Person perception research has shown that consistent and accurate assessments of these traits can be made based on very brief observations, or "thin slices."
Thus, examining impressions based on thin slices offers an effective approach to study how
perceptions of salespeople translate into real-world results, such as sales performance and customer satisfaction. The literature on the accuracy of thin-slice judgments is briefly reviewed.
Then, 2 studies are presented that investigated the predictive validity of judgments of salespeople based on thin slices of the vocal channel. Participants rated 20-sec audio clips extracted
from interviews with a sample of sales managers, on variables gauging interpersonal skills,
task-related skills, and anxiety. Results supported the hypothesis that observability of the rated
variable is a key determinant in the criterion validity of thin-slice judgments. Implications for
the use of thin-slice judgments in salesperson selection and customer satisfaction are discussed.

As anyone who has ever applied for a job or gone on a date
could tell you, the importance of a first impression cannot be
overestimated. Whereas judgments of others may be formed
very quickly and often unwittingly, they may also be consequential and long-lasting. For instance, most job applicants
know that dressing the part and a firm handshake are critical
to being viewed as competent. Some dating services have
capitalized on first impressions, allowing individuals to
"date" several people for short periods of time in one evening. They bank on the notion that it will only take a few minutes to realize if there is any potential for a relationship.
First impressions are also essential in the realm of consumer decision making. Salespeople convey their personality,
affect, and motivations in the first several seconds of an interaction. perhaps even before any verbal contact, in the way they
approach or greet consumers. Consumers make judgments on

sity,

the spot, and the nature of the relationship may hinge on these
first impressions. Is the salesperson trustworthy? Is he or she
too pushy? Is he or she helpful and informative?
These rapidly made, often nonconscious, social judgments undoubtedly influence consumers' affect, behaviors,
and decisions. Research in social psychology has shown
that social information processing is expectancy driven and
that initial impressions strongly influence subsequent expectations and behavior (Jones, 1990). Not only are immediate impressions influential in person perception, interpersonal judgments, and social behavior, but they are also
surprisingly accurate. Research on perception accuracy has
revealed that under certain circumstances, perceivers are
able to make accurate judgments of others from brief observations, even in the absence of any personal interaction.
"Thin slices," or observations of behavior less than 5 min
long, can yield information about personality traits, internal
states, social relations, and interaction motives. This article
reviews recent work on thin slices, goes on to present two
thin-slice studies of salespeople, and then suggests future

sometimes provide more accurate information than the verbal message alone.

THIN SLICES

PREDICTION OF JOB PERFORMANCE

person perception research has demonstrated that observers
are not only able to make accurate judgments about others,
but that accurate judgments can be made even without any
personal interaction between the targets and raters (Albright,
Kenny, & Malloy, 1988). Furthermore, even impressions
based on very brief observations have been found to be predictive or accurate, especially for certain personality traits
(Funder, 1987; Kenny & Albright, 1987; Kenny, Albright,
Malloy, & Kashy, 1994). It may seem that larger slices provide more information, and thus, should be more reliable.
However, social perceivers are able to pick up a wealth of information about others through only brief exposure to their
expressive behavior. Therefore, a thin slice is defined as any
excerpt of dynamic information less than 5 min long. In this
research, it is important that expressive behavior is observed,
so static frames, such as photographs, do not qualify as thin
slices. Thin slices shown to research participants may be
sampled from any available channel of communication, including the face, the body, speech, the voice, transcripts, or
combinations of the aforementioned channels. Thin slices
preserve most of the dynamic, fluid information, whereas reducing or eliminating information from the ongoing verbal
stream, the past history of targets, and the global context in
which the behavior is occurring. Thus, thin slices force the
observer to focus on nonverbal cues without the influence of
the verbal message or information from previous interactions
or the broader context of the situation.
The person perception literature has shown that the display and management of emotions and feelings through nonverbal channels play an important role in conveying impressions (e.g., Sommers, Greeno, & Boag, 1989). Cues from
facial expressions, gestures, voice, and body movements may
reveal aspects of affect and emotions, personality, and behavioral intentions (Ambady, Bernieri, & Richeson, 2000).
Judgments based on nonverbal behavior take advantage of
some of the unique properties of nonverbal channels in comparison to verbal channels (DePaulo, 1992). First, nonverbal
channels are much harder to control than verbal channels, so
true feelings or intentions may be "leaked" through nonverbal behaviors. Further, nonverbal behavior is often more accessible to observers than to actors. For instance, people are
unaware of how their faces appear or their voices sound to
others. This can make it difficult for them to regulate their behavior in an online, instantaneous fashion. Finally, the expression of nonverbal cues is usually quicker than verbal expression. For example, it is easier for people to catch
themselves before verbally expressing emotions than preventing those emotions from appearing on their faces. Thus,
judgments based on nonverbal behaviors supplement and

Thin slices have been found to be predictive of performance
in a number of domains. For example, judgments of teachers'
personality characteristics from thin-slice clips accurately
predicted the teachers' end-of-semester ratings by students
and principals (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993). Three 10-sec
silent video clips of each of 13 university teachers were rated
by nine nayve raters on 15 variables: accepting, active, anxious, attentive, competent, confident, dominant, empathic,
enthusiastic, honest, likeable, optimistic, professional, supportive, and warm. Teacher effectiveness was appraised
through course evaluations at the end of the semester and was
correlated with a composite variable composed of 14 of the
ratings (all but anxious). Although the nai've raters were only
exposed to a total of 30 sec of each teacher, there was a significant correlation between the composite variable and higher
student evaluations. A second study confirmed these results
with schoolteachers as targets and the school principal's evaluation as the teacher effectiveness appraisal. Thus, judgments from thin slices showing only nonverbal cues have
been correlated to real-world performance appraisals.
Thin slices of the voice channel have also been shown to
predict job performance. For example, Hecht and LaFrance
(1995) found that thin-slice ratings of enthusiasm, sympathy,
confidence, professionalism, and friendliness in telephone
operators' voices predicted job performance, as measured by
the shortness of their calls. In addition, telephone operators
with faster calls were rated as significantly less monotonous
and as possessing clearer pronunciation. Likewise, DeGroot
and Motowidlo (1999) found that actual performance ratings
of managers in a news-publishing company were associated
with nai've raters'judgments. Ratings of 10-sec clips of interviews of 22 managers on liking, trust, competence, dominance, persuasiveness, influence, and willingness to help the
manager, when combined into a composite, were significantly positively correlated with job performance ratings by
their supervisors.
In contrast, a study on the vocal characteristics of direct
salespeople found a relation between certain microtraits
and actual sales performance, but no relation between
thin-slice trait judgments and actual sales performance (Peterson, Cannito, & Brown, 1995). Twenty-one direct salespeople gave audiotaped, scripted sales-pitch introductions,
which were five sentences and 64 words long. Speaking
rate, average pause duration, loudness variability, and fundamental frequency (the vibration rate of the vocal folds in
the throat) were measured and a sample of housewives,
who were representative of the target audience, rated the
salespeople on questions related to the salespeople's personality characteristics and rated their own receptivity to-

<-----Page 2----->ward the salespeople. The housewives were able to detect
differences in speaking rates, but this was not related to differences in their perceptions of the salespeople. In addition,
the housewives' judgments of attitude and receptivity were
not correlated with sales performance. Although these studies have mixed results, it does appear that very brief slices
of nonverbal behavior alone are able to supply raters with
enough useful information to predict future job performance, at least sometimes.
Employment interviews are an apparent setting in which
first impressions are important. One study looked at the reliability of thin-slice judgments of interviews by nalve raters
and found that they were highly correlated with evaluations
made by informed interviewers (Prickett, Gada-Jain, &
Bernieri, 1999). Individuals participated in mock "initial
screening" interviews intended to simulate the kind of
on-campus screening interviews conducted by large companies. Actual interviews ranged from 8 to 30 min, after which
informed interviewers evaluated personality traits, interpersonal skills, professional competencies, and overall employability. Slices were extracted from each interview, beginning
with the interviewee knocking on the door and ending 10 sec
after the interviewee took a seat, and shown to na'ive observers. Observers provided ratings of employability, competence, intelligence, ambition, trustworthiness, confidence,
nervousness, warmth, politeness, likability, and expressiveness. For 9 of the 11 variables, thin-slice judgments correlated significantly with the final evaluation of the actual interviewers. Thus, immediate impressions based on a
handshake and brief introduction predicted the outcome of a
structured employment interview.
Finally, nai've judges' ratings of thin slices have proven to
be successful in predicting outcomes in the health care field.
For example, thin slices have accurately predicted patient
satisfaction with their doctors (Hall, Roter, & Rand, 1981)
and doctor's effectiveness in their referrals of alcoholic patients (Milmoe, Rosenthal, Blane, Chafetz, & Wolf, 1967).
One study found that very brief clips of surgeons' voices extracted from physician-patient interactions predicted the
malpractice history of general practitioners and surgeons
(Ambady, LaPlante, et al., 2002). Twenty-sec thin slices of
both the full audio channel and the tone-of-voice channel
were rated on a variety of personality traits. Surgeons rated
higher on dominance were more likely to have been sued in
the past.
Another study examined the relation between thin-slice
judgments of physical therapists' behavior and the health
outcomes of geriatric patients (Ambady, Koo, Rosenthal, &
Winograd, 2002). In this study, ratings of silent video clips
were correlated with assessments from the time of admission
to 3 months after the time of discharge. Physical therapists'
behavior, as rated by nalve judges based on three 20-sec
video clips of each patient-therapist interaction, was found
to be associated with both short- and long-term improvements in patients' mobility. Therapists' distancing behavior

was strongly correlated with short- and long-term decreases
in their clients' physical and cognitive functioning. Distancing was expressed through a pattern of not smiling and
loolung away from the client. In contrast, facial expressiveness, as revealed through smiling, nodding, and frowning,
was associated with both short- and long-term improvements
in clients' functioning.
Thin slices can even distinguish between certain skills or
attributes required for different types of clinical settings.
Using 15-sec thin slices of occupational therapy students, it
was found that students who were judged as less nonverbally
responsive and more dominant were more effective in a pediatric rehabilitation setting, whereas less friendly students
were more effective in a physical rehabilitation setting
(Tickle-Degnen, 1998; Tickle-Degnen & Puccinelli, 1999).
Thus, the relevant personality characteristics or traits, and
even the desired magnitude of these traits, may vary even
among similar types of jobs or settings.
In summary, thin-slice judgments are demonstrably predictive of performance in a wide variety of arenas. Moreover,
various channels, including brief clips of full vocal content,
tone of voice, and silent video clips, have all shown to be reliable. More broadly, these studies suggest that our personality
is revealed through many different aspects of our behavior.
Even small variations in the highly scripted act of meeting an
interviewer, shaking a hand, and taking a seat, provide robust
clues to personality.

PERCEPTION ACCURACY
There are two ways to measure accuracy in thin-slice judgments. One is consensual accuracy or the agreement among
judges (Funder, 1995; Kenny, 1991; Kruglanski, 1989).
Some psychological constructs, such as hostility, warmth,
pleasantness, politeness, and likability are best defined from
the perspective of social perceivers (Ambady et al., 2000). If
all customers view a particular salesperson as rude or pushy,
then that behavior can be viewed as rude and pushy, regardless of the individual's motivations or internal states. In this
example, accuracy is measured by consensus. The second
type of accuracy is measured by a specific outcome, such as
sales effectiveness. In this case, all customers may view a
particular salesperson as unpersuasive, but he or she may still
have the highest sales numbers in the district. Both of these
criterion measurements have applications in the domain of
customer perceptions. The first type can answer questions
about impression management and customer satisfaction,
whereas the second type can be used to answer questions relating to sales performance.
Perception accuracy, based on consensus, varies depending on both the trait being judged and the type of task. In a
meta-analysis ofthin-slice judgments, it was discovered that
variables that are either highly observable (such as confidence) or highly affective (such as warmth) can be rated with

<-----Page 3----->THIN SLICES

fairly high reliabilities (Ambady et al., 2000). However, variables that are less observable and affective (such as being analytical) have relatively low mean reliabilities. This is convergent with most recent findings in personality and social
psychology, which suggest that judges agree more in their
ratings of dimensions such as sociability or extroversion than
they do in their ratings of intrapsychic or less visible dimensions, such as intelligence or neuroticism (Funder &
Dobroth, 1987; Kenny, Horner, Kashy, & Chu, 1992; Park &
Flink, 1989; Park & Judd, 1989).
The accuracy of thin-slice judgments, generally measured
in relation to a specific outcome, has also been found to be
task-dependent. Most studies have used either video or audio
clips from interviews, which tend to display traits related to
social behavior. A recent study measured accuracy and consensus for the Big Five personality traits and intelligence
based on thin slices of 15 different tasks, ranging from introducing oneself to pantomiming uses for a brick (Borkenau,
Mauer, Riemann, Spinath, & Angleitner, 2004). Whereas interpersonal traits were equally predicted from all of the tasks,
it was found that traits related to cognitive ability were accurately inferred only from certain tasks. For example, intelligence was most strongly correlated with judgments from thin
slices of targets reading short phrases aloud and openness to
experience was best measured by the pantomime task. Thus,
whereas certain traits may not be predicted by the typical thin
slices of interviews, thin slices of other tasks may tap into
traits that may be considered to be less visible.
Finally, the accuracy of thin-slice judgments also varies
by the level of abstraction of the criterion variables. For example, whereas trust may be observed through specific behaviors, such as keeping promises, it may also be gleaned
from a more abstract level. Customers can perceive attributes
related to trust, such as dependability, and they can also perceive a general overall trust. Thin-slice judgments are generally more accurate for more abstract, macrolevel criteria than
microlevel criteria. In this example, the thin-slice methodology will likely be especially useful in studying overall trust in
the salesperson-customer relationship.

AUTOMATICITY OF THIN-SLICE JUDGMENTS
What mechanisms underlie thin-slice judgments? According
to dual-process models of social cognition, person perception consists of an automatic stage and a controlled stage.
Processing in the first stage uses minimal cognitive resources, can co-occur with other tasks, and is not vulnerable
to informational load, time pressure, or distracters (Anderson, Krull, & Weiner, 1996; Bargh, 1994; Bargh &
Pietromonaco, 1982; Fiske & Neuberg, 1990; Neugberg,
1988; Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977; Srull & Wyer, 1979). In
contrast, processing in the second stage is characterized as
intentional, conscious, controllable, and effortful (Bargh &
Chartrand, 1999).

7

The initial, automatic stage is likely more relevant to
thin-slice judgments. Indeed, several lines of research have
supported the automaticity of these judgments (Ambady et
al., 2000). First, individuals are often unaware of the behavioral cues used in their intuitive judgments, and are often unable to articulate or control their processing (Smith, Archer,
& Costanzo, 1991). Second, cognitive overload, which impairs conscious and controlled processing (Wegner, 1992,
1994), does not affect thin-slice judgments. Ambady and
Gray (2002) found that cognitive load did not impede the accuracy of thin-slice judgments of teacher effectiveness or of
the relation between opposite sex dyads. Third, increased attention, which has been shown to disrupt automatic processes, also reduced accuracy of thin-slice judgments. Participants who were asked to supply reasons to support their
judgments were less accurate than controls or those under
cognitive load (Ambady & Gray, 2002). Thus, deliberate and
conscious processing interferes with making accurate
thin-slice judgments. Finally, the accuracy of thin-slice judgments does not appear to be influenced by effort. Bernieri
and Gillis (1994) found that accuracy in judgments was not
affected by fatigue or boredom, even after making 50
thin-slice judgments. Accuracy is also not improved by monetary incentives. Participants who were provided an incentive
of a $5 prize and a chance to win $100 did not perform better
than control participants (Bernieri & Gillis, 1994).
In summary, thin-slice judgments appear to be more of an
automatic than a controlled process. Individuals are usually
unaware of the cues they use in forming their impressions of
others. Thin-slice judgments are not altered by cognitive
load, incentives or effort, but are impaired by increased attention and deliberation.

PERSON PERCEPTION IN SALES
The salesperson-customer relationship has been characterized as the "most important element in marketing communications" (Weitz, 1978, p. 501). Just as the nonverbal channel
is important in most everyday social interactions, it is also
critical in many stages of the sales interaction, from establishing the salesperson-customer relationship (Leigh &
Summers, 2002) to negotiating the final price (van Kleef,
Drev, & Marstead, 2004). Nonverbal cues communicate intentions, motives, and feelings, but they may also be used in a
self-presentational manner. Both salespeople and customers
want to convey impressions to maximize their outcomes and
achieve particular goals. Salespeople want to convey trustworthiness and friendliness to make a sale. Meanwhile, customers may attempt to hide their desire for a product or feign
counterarguments to get a lower price.
Previous research has found that nonverbal cues affect
both perceptions of salespeople and sales performance.
Leigh and Summers (2002) experimentally manipulated several nonverbal cues in videotaped, role played, buyer-seller

<-----Page 4----->8

AMBADY, KRABBENHOFT, HOGAN

interactions to determine their influences on perception. Participants were professional buyers and were asked to visualize themselves as the purchasing agent in the videotape and
provide their impressions. The salesperson altered eye gaze,
speech hesitations, gestures, clothing, and posture in the dif. ferent conditions. It was discovered that steady eye gaze positively affected the believability of the sales presentation, and
speech hesitations negatively affected ratings of "interesting" and "persuasive." Thus, this study suggests that
microlevel adjustments of nonverbal behavior impact consumers' impressions of salespeople.
The literature on salesperson perception, thus far, indicates that there are several domains in which customers' perceptions of salespeople have a measurable impact on sales effectiveness. Associations have been made between sales
effectiveness and personality characteristics, perceptions of
affect, perceptions of trust, and specific nonverbal cues
(Leigh & Summers, 2002; van Kleef, 2004). However, these
links have not been thoroughly explored in real-world settings. The thin-slice methodology lends itself to the study of
person perception in the salesperson-customer relationship
in less contrived situations than have previously been examined (Leigh & Summers, 2002). Thin slices are especially
useful in predicting performance in jobs that require strong
interpersonal and affective skills. However, previous research has not yielded evidence for the predictive validity of
thin-slice judgments of salespeople. As a demonstration,
therefore, we present two studies of salespeople investigating
whether thin-slice judgments of vocal cues are reliable predictors of actual sales performance.
The goal of these studies was to examine the relation between judgments of thin slices of vocal cues and a key measure of organizational success: supervisor evaluations. The
vocal channel was chosen both for its sensitivity and for the
ease of obtaining vocal stimuli from audiotapes. Observer
ratings were divided into three dimensions: (a) interpersonal
qualities, such as sociability and extroversion; (b)
task-related variables, such as intelligence and perseverance;
and (c) anxiety. Based on previous research showing that
thin-slice judgments are more predictive of interpersonal
than noninterpersonal characteristics (Ambady et a]., 2000;
Funder & Dobroth, 1987; Kenny et al., 1992; Park & Flink,
1989; Park & Judd, 1989), we hypothesized that thin-slice
ratings of anxiety and the interpersonally oriented dimension
would be positively related to the criterion variable of performance evaluations of sales managers. In contrast, thin-slice
ratings of the noninterpersonal, task-related personality dimension were not expected to be strongly related to the criterion variable.

STUDY 1: JUDGMENTS BASED ON SALES
MANAGERS' TONE OF VOICE
The sample for this study consisted of 12 regional sales managers in a large American corporation. Thin slices of the tone

of voice, but not the semantic content, were created from interviews with the sales managers. Each manager was
classified as either "average" or "outstanding" by a task
group of upper management based on supervisors' evaluations and actual sales effectiveness. This classification was
validated by peer nominations.

Stimulus Preparation
Each sales manager participated in an interview with one
male and one female interviewer. Each interviewee was
asked the same general questions with additional probing by
the interviewers to elicit more information. The interview began with questions about the interviewee's educational and
career history. Interviewees were then asked to recount in detail two positive and two negative events from their sales experience to control for the influence of interviewee affect on
raters' evaluations. Three 20-sec clips were extracted from
each interview (one from the biographical question, one from
the recounting of a positive event, and one from the recounting of a negative event) by a research assistant who had no
knowledge about the hypotheses or the criterion ratings.
These clips were chosen by stopping the tape at a random
time after the question had been asked and taking a clip from
the first 20-sec of uninterrupted speech. The order of the 3
clips for each sales manager was randomized, and the 36
clips (3 from each of the 12 managers) were assembled and
rerecorded onto a master tape in a counterbalanced design.
This tape was then content-filtered, a process that removes
the high frequencies on which word recognition depends, but
preserves the sequence and rhythm of the speech.

Raters and Judgments
Twelve undergraduate students were recruited from the population of a large urban university to rate the 36 clips of the
managers. Raters came into the laboratory individually and
were greeted by an experimenter, who told them that they
would hear short segments of managers' speech and would
be asked to rate each clip on 19 traits, on a continuum ranging
from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very). The variables were chosen
based on previous research on judgments of tone of voice and
relevance to a job as a salesperson (Ambady et al., 2000).
These traits were combined into three composite variables
based on the intercorrelation matrix (Rosenthal, 1987). The
interpersonal composite contained nine variables: collaborative, cooperative, emotional, empathic, enthusiastic, perceptive, understanding, supportive, and warm. The task-oriented
composite contained nine variables: achieving, analytical,
confident, decisive, directive, influential, persevering, professional, and self-controlled. The final variable, anxious,
was analyzed separately.
Raters were provided with a definition of each of the variables (see the Appendix), and they familiarized themselves
with these definitions before starting the rating process. Evidence indicates that individuals make more accurate judg-

<-----Page 5----->9

THIN SLICES

ments when they have some prior information regarding the
dimensions that they are rating (McDonald, 1991). Before
the rating session began, raters listened to and rated 10 practice, content-filtered clips to familiarize themselves with the
somewhat unnatural sound of the content-filtered speech.
Other than these instructions, the raters received no training.
Previous research has demonstrated that naive raters are able
to reliably make such ratings without training (Blanck,
Rosenthal, & Vannicelli, 1986). Raters were instructed to listen to each segment once and only once. The experimenter
then left the room and each rater listened to the audiotaped
segments and completed the rating scales. After completing
the task, raters were paid, thanked, and debriefed.

STUDY 2: JUDGMENTS BASED ON SALES
MANAGERS' FULL SPEECH
The results of the previous study demonstrated that naive raters' judgments of sales managers on interpersonal traits
strongly correlate with supervisor nominations. This suggests not only that interpersonal skills are highly important
for success as a sales manager but also that the extent to
which individuals possess these skills is observable after
only a brief exposure. To investigate this effect further, another study was conducted in which judges were presented
with both the tone of voice and the original semantic content
of the speech. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare directly the criterion validity of judges' ratings based on
tone of voice cues to ratings based on the full audio channel.
This study was designed to determine whether interpersonal
skills and anxiety are still positively correlated to supervisor

nominations when the full audio channel is used in thin-slice
judgments.

Method
Twenty-second clips of the full audio channel, with the original speech content remaining, were presented to eight
judges, who rated the sales managers on the same 19 personality traits in a method identical to that described earlier.

Results
The reliabilities of the eight judges' ratings of the 19 variables were assessed, again, by intraclass correlations. The
reliabilities of the mean of the eight judges' ratings for Study
2 ranged from .49 to .78, with a mean of .63 (see Table 1).
The 19 personality traits on which judges rated sales managers were combined to form the same three composite variables as Study 1: interpersonal, task-oriented, and anxiety.
As in the first study, the within-composite intercorrelations
were substantially higher than the between-composite
intercorrelations for both interpersonal and task-orientation
composites (see Table 2).

Predicting the criterion variable. The correlations of
the three composite variables with the criterion variable
(nominations by upper management) are reported in Table 3.
Consistent with Study 1,judges' ratings of sales managers on
interpersonal-orientation traits were strongly correlated with
supervisor nominations as either "outstanding" or "average,"
r(6) = .59, p < .03. There was little relation between ratings of
task-orientation traits and supervisor nominations, r(6) = .22,
ns. Likewise, the correlation between judges' ratings of anxiety and supervisor nominations was not significant, r(6) =
.19, ns.

DISCUSSION
The results of these two studies demonstrate that thin slices
of the vocal channel can be used to assess sales effectiveness,
as measured by supervisor evaluations and actual sales.
Whether or not semantic content was included in the
thin-slice clips, na'ive judges' consensual ratings of interpersonally oriented dimensions of targets' personalities accurately distinguished highly rated sales managers from less
highly rated sales managers. Specifically, more highly rated
managers were also rated more highly on interpersonal qualities, based on brief audio clips from interview sessions. Remarkably, judges were able to make these distinctions solely
on the basis of three 20-sec audio clips.
These results are consistent with previous studies suggesting that the thin-slice methodology is more valuable for evaluating interpersonal skills than noninterpersonal, task-re-

lated skills (Funder & Dobroth, 1987; Kenny et al., 1992;
Park & Flink, 1989; Park & Judd, 1989). This may be due to
the greater observability of information relating to interpersonal skills through nonverbal channels, such as the voice, as
compared to task-related skills. However, as Borkenau et al.
(2004) demonstrated, varying the task may tap into different
traits, such that the task-related skills may be observed in thin
slices of activities other than an interview.
Another possible explanation for these findings is that
observability did not differentiate raters' ability to judge interpersonal skills in relation to task-related skills, but that the
"outstanding" groups simply did not differ from the "average" groups in the extent to which they possessed
task-related skills. This would explain the low correlations
between ratings of task-related skills and superiors' evaluations. Although there is no empirical support presented here
in support of this claim, support does come from a study conducted previously by Kelley and Caplan (1993). In this study,
measures of interpersonal and task-related skills were obtained from two samples of engineers: those nominated as
"stars" by their managers and peers and those nominated as
"average." Interestingly, the researchers found that the only
distinguishing difference between the two groups was the
stars' interpersonal and affective skills. Specifically, stars
were more skilled at developing rapport with coworkers and
building extensive, loose networks of reliable problem solvers. Perhaps the same phenomenon was at work in this study.
If it were primarily interpersonal skills that differentiated the
"outstanding" sales managers from the "average" ones, there
would be little correlation between task-related skills and the
criterion. This is exactly what we found.
The findings with regard to judges' ratings of managers as
anxious are also intriguing. In Study 1, when judges were
presented only with tone-of-voice clips, judges' ratings of
targets' level of anxiety correlated highly with superiors'
evaluations. This finding supports the work by Ambady et al.
(2002), who found that anxiety as inferred from the tone of
voice was a strong postdictor of the malpractice claims status
of primary-care physicians. Thus, surgeons who were judged
as more anxious were less likely to be sued than physicians
judged to be less anxious. This effect likely occurred because
anxiety as inferred from the tone of voice signals concern, an
important quality in physicians.
However, this effect was diluted when judges were presented with both the tone of voice and the semantic content of
the audiotaped interview. In this condition, judges' ratings of
managers' level of anxiety did not correlate nearly as highly
with consultants' supervisor evaluations. One possible explanation for this disparity could be that anxiety is more easily
observed through "nonverbally pure" channels of communication, that is, through tone, pitch, gestures, and so forth,
which are less subject to conscious control (DePaulo, 1992).
Thus, anxious sales managers who were attempting to appear
poised and confident while being audiotaped may have been

<-----Page 7----->THIN SLICES

able to manipulate their speech content and thus may have
led raters in the full audio condition to believe they were not
anxious. It is unlikely, however, that the sales managers were
able to control the underlying nonverbal vocal correlates of
anxiety, which were revealed to raters in the tone-of-voice
condition.

LIMITATIONS AND BOUNDARIES
Although judgments based on thin slices of expressive behavior as short as 1-sec have proven to be surprisingly accurate, there are clear boundary conditions for the use of
thin-slice methodology. As discussed earlier, the more observable the traits being judged, the more accurate are the
judgments (as in the comparison between interpersonal and
task-oriented ratings). Another element to consider is the abstraction level of the construct being judged. Judgments of
vague macrovariables, such as the judgment of "warmth," are
more accurate than specific microvariables, such as smiles or
gaze. One reason for this is that the same specific behavior
can mean very different things in different contexts. For example, a smile may indicate warmth, anxiety, or hostility, depending on the context (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993).
As the two studies presented in this article have demonstrated, the inclusion of verbal content may sometimes have a
negative effect on the accuracy of thin-slice judgments. Anxiety ratings were correlated with performance only in the
content-filtered condition, but not when the verbal information was available. This finding is convergent with other recent evidence. For example, Grahe and Bernieri (1999)
found that thin-slice judgments based on silent video clips
were more accurate than judgments based on video clips that
included verbal information. Additionally, Peterson,
Cannito, and Brown's (1995) study of direct salespeople
found that housewives' ratings of audio clips were not related
to sales performance. This contradictory finding may be due
to the inclusion of the verbal content in the thin-slice clips. In
contrast, Berry, Pennebaker, Mueller, and Hiller (1997)
found the opposite effect, such that key words in a dyadic
conversation communicated more accurate information
about competency, dominance, and warmth of the target than
did nonverbal cues. Thus, the inclusion of verbal content may
sometimes enhance accuracy, although impairing accuracy at
other times. This suggests that it is useful to create clips containing different levels of verbal and nonverbal cues, such as
the two studies presented here.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN SALES
AND MARKETING
Clearly, thin slices could be useful in the selection and
training of salespeople, especially in relation to interper-

11

sonal skills. Building on these findings, it would be
beneficial to incorporate the thin-slice methodology to further investigate personality correlates of sales effectiveness.
Future research might vary the task, the criteria, the rating
variables, and the channel to gain a more comprehensive
understanding of the predictors of effective sales. Following
Borkenau et al. (2004), thin slices from different types of
tasks may tap into different types of traits relevant to sales.
For example, the same methodology could be used with
real interactions with consumers, instead of staged interviews. In addition to a criterion variable of supervisor ratings, it would be informative to correlate thin-slice judgments with consumer perceptions, customer retention rates,
and measures of salesperson-customer relationship quality.
Finally, these studies demonstrated the predictive validity
of thin slices of the vocal channel for sales effectiveness,
but it is also worthwhile to investigate other channels such
as the face and body.
Thus far, we have considered sales personnel as the targets
in thin-slice judgments. We can also regard the sales personnel as the judges and the consumer as the target. Salespeople
must often adapt their strategy based on the type of consumer. Individuals who are better at diagnosing personality
traits, affect, and motivations would arguably be better at
adapting strategies and perform better. Social perception research has demonstrated that there are individual differences
in judgment accuracy. A meta-analysis by Davis and Kraus
(1997) found that people who are more intelligent, more
cognitively complex, less dogmatic, better adjusted, and
more interpersonally oriented tend to be more accurate
judges of others. Individual differences in accuracy may vary
extensively across judgment tasks and judgment contexts
(Ambady et al., 2000; Gesn, Bernieri, Gada-Jain, & Grahe,
1999). In another study, occupational therapy students' performance on a test of nonverbal sensitivity was correlated
with supervisor ratings of their clinical fieldwork. Judgment
accuracy of facial but not body cues was correlated with supervisor ratings in a psychiatric rehabilitation setting
(Tickle-Degnen, 1998). Thus, performance on different measures of person perception can vary by the role and context.
Future research might explore what types of thin-slice tasks
are good predictors of individual differences in sales effectiveness and strategy adaptation for use in salesperson selection. Furthermore, this perspective could inform training programs.
The thin-slice methodology can also be applied to research in consumer behavior, beyond the salesperson-customer relationship. For example, it may have significant
implications in the field of advertising, particularly in radio
and television ads. With only a short time to sell a product,
first impressions of the actors or models may be vital.
Through facial expressions, gestures, tone of voice, and
other nonverbal cues, actors may convey more than the verbal script intends.
