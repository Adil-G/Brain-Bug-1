The fundamental goal of science is to find invariants, such as conservation of
mass and energy and the speed of light in physics. In much of science the
invariants are neither as general nor as "invariant" as these classical laws. For
instance, the isotopes of the elements have atomic weights that are nearly

integral multiples of the weight of hydrogen. Some inheritable traits of plants
and animals observe the classical 1-2-1 ratio of Mendel. The number of
familiar information chunks that can be held in short-term memory is approx­
imately seven. It takes about 30 seconds to memorize an unpronouncable
three-consonant nonsense syllable, but only about nine seconds to memorize a
three-letter word.
Much biological knowledge is extremely specific, for biology rests on the
diversity of millions of species of plants and animals, and most of its
invariants apply only to single species. Because of inter-species molecular
differences, even the important general laws (e.g. the laws of photosynthesis)
vary in detail from one species to another (and sometimes among different
individuals in a single species). Only at the most abstract and qualitative level
can one find many general strict invariants in biology.
Moreover, some of the most important invariants in science are not quan­
titative at all, but are what Allen Newell and I (1976) have called "laws of
qualitative structure. " For example, the germ theory of disease, surely one of
Pasteur's major contributions to biology, says only something like: "If you
observe pathology, look for a microorganism-it might be causing the symp­
toms. " Similarly, modem molecular genetics stems from the approximately
correct generalization that inheritance of traits is governed by the arrangement
of long helical sequences of the four DNA nucleotides.
Finally, in biological (induding human) realms, systems change adaptively
over time. Simple change is not the problem, for Newton showed how we can
write invariant laws as differential equations that describe the eternal move­
ments of the heavens. But with adaptative change, which is as much governed
by a system's environment as by its internal constitution, it becomes more
difficult to identify true invariants. As a result, evolutionary biology has a
rather different flavor from physics, chemistry, or even molecular biology.
In establishing aspirations for psychology it is useful to keep all of these
models of science in mind. Psychology does not much resemble classical
mechanics, nor should it aim to do so. Its laws are, and will be, limited in
range and generality and will be mainly qualitative. Its invariants are and will
be of the kinds that are appropriate to adaptive systems. Its success must be
measured not by how closely it resembles physics but by how well it describes
and explains human behavior.
On another occasion (Simon 1979a) I have considered the form a science
must take in order to explain the behavior of an adaptive, hence of an
artificial, system. By "artificial" I mean a system that is what it is only
because it has responded to the shaping forces of an environment to which it
must adapt in order to survive. Adaptation may be quite unconscious and
unintended, as in Darwinian evolution, or it may contain large components of
conscious intention, as in much human learning and problem solving.

Taking the artificiality of human behavior as my central theme, I should
like to consider its implications for psychology. Moreover, since Homo
sapiens shares some important psychological invariants with certain nonbio­
logical systems-the computers-I shall want to make frequent reference to
them also. One could even say that my account will cover the topic of human
and computer psychology.
PHYSICAL SYMBOL SYSTEMS
An important law of qualitative structure underlies the information processing
paradigm in psychology. The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis (Newell &
Simon 1976) states that a system will be capable of intelligent behavior if and
only if it is a physical symbol system. A physical symbol system is a system
capable of inputting, outputting, storing, and modifying symbol structures,
and of carrying out some of these actions in response to the symbols them­
selves. "Symbols" are any kinds of patterns on which these operations can be
performed, where some of the patterns denote actions (that is, serve as
commands or instructions).
We are all familiar with the physical symbol systems called computers.
Computers store symbols in the form of electro-magnetic patterns of some
kind (quite different kinds in different computers); some of these patterns
serve to instruct the computer what to do next (the stored program), while
others contain numerical or nonnumerical information.
Information processing psychology claims that intelligence is achievable by
physical symbol systems and only such systems. From that claim follow two
empirically testable hypotheses: 1. that computers can be programmed to
think, and 2. that the human brain is (at least) a physical symbol system.
These hypotheses are tested by programming computers to perform the same
tasks that we use to judge how well people are thinking, and then by showing
that the processes used by the computer programs are the same as those used
by people performing these tasks. In making the comparison we use thinking­
aloud protocols, records of eye movements, reaction times, and many other
kinds of data as evidence.
The physical symbol system hypothesis has been tested so extensively over
the past 30 years that it can now be regarded as fully established, although
over less than the whole gamut of activities that are called "thinking." For
starters in reviewing the evidence, I would recommend Newell & Simon
( 1972), Simon ( 1979a, b, 1989a), and Anderson ( 1983). Readers can contin­
ue the survey with numerous references they will find in those sources. The
exact boundaries of our present knowledge need not concern us: The territory
in which the hypothesis has been confirmed is broad, encompassing many of
the kinds of activities that define human professional and scholarly work.

Some skeptics continue to regard thinking as something to be explained at

some unknown future date. Their imperviousness to the empirical evidence,
which shows that the main processes of thinking have already been accounted
for quite specifically, perhaps stems from the reluctance of human beings to
view themselves as "mere machines." Even some biologists who have long

treasured by humanistic, existentialist, Marxist, and Gestalt psychologists­
as intuition, insight, understanding, and creativity. A brief guide to the
literature that deals with these phenomena in terms of the physical symbol
system hypothesis will be found in Simon ( 1986). I will say no more about
these matters in this paper, but will simply use the present rather than the
future tense in describing the psychology of thinking.
What is the unfinished business? There is plenty of it, but I will mention
just two important research targets that remain. First, each kind of task to
which the human mind addresses itself may be regarded as defining a different
"species" of thought. A certain number of these species have already been

described in greater or lesser detail (e.g. solving puzzles like the Tower of
Hanoi or Missionaries and Cannibals, playing chess like a master or a novice,
making medical diagnoses, solving problems in elementary physics and
mathematics, making certain kinds of scientific discoveries, learning lan­
guage, using diagrams to solve problems, and understanding problem in­
structions). But since many other species of thought remain undescribed, a
vast work of taxonomy and empirical exploration lies ahead. We should avoid
thinking of this work as "mere" taxonomy, for it will unearth multitudes of
interesting and important phenomena and extend our repertory of explanatory
laws and invariants accordingly.
Second, in stark contrast to our complete understanding of the physical
underpinnings of the operation of computers, we have only the vaguest
knowledge today of how the symbol processing capabilities of the human
brain are realized physiologically. Information processing psychology ex­
plains the software of thinking, but says only a little about its "hardware" (or
"wetware"?). Information processing psychology and neural science are still
miles apart, with only slight indications of how a bridge will be built between
them-as it certainly will.
This situation is not without precedent. Organismic and cell biology made
extensive progress long before biochemistry could explain their structures and
processes. Nineteenth-century chemistry achieved substantial understanding
of the reactions am(mg molecules long before physics supplied any picture of
atomic structure that could account for the observed chemical regularities.

Science suspended from skyhooks is not new, nor is it limited to particular
disciplines. Contemporary physics provides a prime example of skyhook
science in its continual movement downward to ever more fundamental and
"elementary" particles, its greatest uncertainties lying always at the founda­
tions.

The separation of information processing from neural science presents an
important challenge to research, and a second great direction for exploration
in psychology. What arrangement of neurons or neuronal circuits corresponds
to a symbol? What is the physiological basis for the magical number seven?
By what mechanism does the presence of a symbol in short-term memory
initiate or guide a mental action? The agenda, containing these and many
other items, provides work for both neural scientists and information process­
ing psychologists, for the bridge will have to be built out from both banks
before it can link in the middle.

ADAPTIVITY
Let me now put aside biological questions and return to human adaptivity and
its implications for the laws of psychology. A look at computer adaptivity
may cast some light on the human kind. A computer, it is said, can only do
what it is programmed to do (which may be quite different from what the
programmer intended it to do). Generally, it is not instructed to do specific
things at all (e.g. to solve a particular linear programming problem), but to
adapt its behavior to the requirements of a given task chosen from a whole
population of tasks (e.g. to solve any linear programming problem lying
within given size limits). Then its behavior in response to each task is adapted
to the requirements of the task, and it behaves differently, in appropriate
ways, with each task it is given. In short, it is an adaptive system.
The adaptiveness of computers leads to a question that is the converse of
the one raised above. Can a computer be programmed to do anything? Of
course not. Upper limits are set by the famous theorems of Godel, which
prove that every symbol processing system must be, in a certain fundamental
sense, incomplete. It is a truth of mathematics and logic that any program
(including those stored in human heads) must be unable to solve certain
problems.

Computational Limits on Adaptivity
Far more important than the Godel limits are the limits imposed by the speed
and organization of a system's computations and sizes of its memories. It is
easy to pose problems that are far too large, require far too much computa­
tion, to be solved by present or prospective computers. Playing a perfect game
of chess by using the game-theoretic minimaxing algorithm is one such

infeasible computation, for it calls for the examination of more chess posi­
tions than there are molecules in the universe. If the game of chess, limited to
its 64 squares and six kind of pieces, is beyond exact computation, then we
may expect the same of almost any real-world problem, including almost any
problem of everyday life.
From this simple fact, we derive one of the most important laws of
qualitative structure applying to physical symbol systems, computers and the
human brain included: Because of the limits on their computing speeds and
power, intelligent systems must use approximate methods to handle most
tasks. Their rationality is bounded.
Reasoning Under the Optimality Principle
Historically, human adaptiveness (that is to say, rationality) has preoccupied
economists even more than psychologists. Modem mainstream economic
theory bravely assumes that people make their decisions in such a way as to
maximize their utility (Simon 1979a). Accepting this assumption enables
economics to predict a great deal of behavior (correctly or incorrectly) without
ever making empirical studies of human actors.
If we wish to know what form gelatin will take when it solidifies, we do not
study the gelatin; we study the shape of the mold in which we are going to
pour it. In the same way, the economist who wishes to predict behavior
studies the environment in which the behavior takes place, for the rational
economic actor will behave in whatever way is appropriate to maximize utility
in that environment. Hence (assuming the utility function to be given in
advance), this maximizing behavior is purely a function of the environment,
and quite independent of the actor.
The same strategy can be used to construct a psychology of thinking. If we
wish to know how an intelligent person will behave in the face of a particular
problem, we can investigate the requirements of the problem. Intelligence
consists precisely in responding to these requirements. This strategy has, in
fact, been pursued occasionally in psychology; the theories of perception of J.
J. Gibson (1966) and John Marr (1982) exemplify it, as do some of the recent
rational models of my colleague John R. Anderson (1989).
Why don't we, then, close up the laboratory, frequently a place of vexing
labors and unwelcome surprises, and build a psychology of intelligence by
rational analysis, as the economists have done? The answer, already sug­
gested, lies in the law that I have called the Principle of Bounded Rational­
ity (Simon 1989b). Since we can rarely solve our problems exactly, the opti­
mizing strategy suggested by rational analysis is seldom available. We must
find techniques for solving our problems approximately, and we arrive at dif­
ferent solutions depending on what approximations we hit upon. Hence, to
describe, predict and explain the behavior of a system of bounded rational-

<-----Page 7----->BEHAVIORAL INVARIANTS

ity, we must both construct a theory of the system's processes and describe
the environments to which it is adapting.

Computational Feasibility: Bounded Rationality
Human rational behavior (and the rational behavior of all physical symbol
systems) is shaped by a scissors whose two blades are the structure of task
environments and the computational capabilities of the actor.
The study of cognitive psychology is the study of computational capabili­
ties in the face of diverse tasks. It is not a trivial detail but a fundamental limit
upon computation that human short-term memory can hold only a half dozen
chunks, that an act of recognition takes nearly a second, and that the simplest
human reactions are measured in tens and hundreds of milliseconds rather
than microseconds or picoseconds. These basic physiological constants de­
termine what kinds of computations are feasible in a given kind of task
situation and how rapidly they can be carried out (Newell & Simon 1972;
Simon 1979a). They are among the most important invariants that cognitive
psychology has discovered, accounting for many phenomena observed in
thinking and learning.
Noting that computational limits must be a central preoccupation of cogni­
tive psychology does not exhaust the complications of the subject. We have
also to take into account that thinking capacities are a function of skill and
knowledge, stored neural structures in the brain. The expert can reach solu­
tions that are unattainable by the novice, using computations and knowledge
that are simply not available to the latter.
A lightning calculator carries out elementary symbolic processes no more
rapidly than a person with ordinary skills in arithmetic; empirical studies
reveal little or no difference in the speeds of their basic processes. Superiority
in computation derives almost entirely from superior knowledge of arithmetic
facts (e.g. knowledge of the multiplication table up to relatively large num­
bers, or of the table of squares, or of prime factors), combined with a superior
repertory of computational strategies that save steps and conserve short-term
and long-term memory capacity. In Chi et al (1988) the reader will find recent
papers on expert performance in a variety of tasks, including memory and
computational feats.
A major way to relax the limits of bounded rationality is to store in
long-term memory knowledge and strategies that reduce the computational
requirements of tasks. This would seem to add new plausibility to the
argument for studying the requirements of the task rather than the properties
of the actor. But the argument still fails. In tasks of any complexity, knowl­
edge and strategies do not allow the expert to find an optimal solution, but
only to find approximations that are far better than those available to "native"
(or naive) intelligence. A knowledge of the calculus allows its possessor to

solve many problems that could not be solved without it, but the domain of
differential equations that cannot be exactly integrated in closed form vastly
exceeds the domain of those that can be.

Rationality Without Optimization
Autobiographies by Nobel Laureates in Economics 2009.1:1-20. Downloaded from www.annualreviews.org
by University of Waterloo on 10/05/10. For personal use only.

The wide-ranging attempts since the Second World War to apply the optimiz­
ing tools of operations research (linear programming, integer and dynamic
programming, queuing theory, and so on) to the decision problems of man­
agement have underlined the computational complexity of real-world prob­
lems, even relatively well-structured problems that are easily quantified.
Using queuing theory, an optimum production schedule can be found for a
factory that manufactures one or two products, using one or two different
pieces of equipment. Adding even one more product or piece of equipment
puts the problem beyond computational bounds for the fastest supercomputer.
(An optimal class schedule for a university lies even further beyond the limits
of practical computation.)
Yet factories (and universities) are scheduled every day. We are forced to
conclude that methods other than optimization are used-methods that respect
the limits of human and computer rationality. Perhaps the feasible methods
are specific to each specific situation, in which case it is hard to see what
cognitive psychology should say about them.
On the other hand, it is possible that some common properties, deriving
from human bounded rationality, are shared by the approximating procedures
people use in many kinds of complex situations. If so, it is the task of
cognitive psychology to characterize these procedures, to show how they are
acquired, and to account for their compatibility with the known computational
limitations of the human brain.

MECHANISMS FOR RATIONALITY
Let me illustrate some of the mechanisms used by human bounded rationality
to cope with real-life complexity. I will give just three examples from a much
larger number that could be cited: processes used in problem solving by
recognition, processes of heuristic search, and processes for inducing sequen­
tial patterns.

Recognition Processes

We now know that experts make extensive use of recognition processes, based
on stored knowledge, to handle their everyday tasks. This recognition
capability, based (by rough estimate) on 50,000 or more stored cues and
associated knowledge, allows them to solve many problems "intuitively"­
that is, in a few seconds, and without conscious analysis. Recognizing key

BEHAVIORAL INVARIANTS

cues allows experts to retrieve directly from memory information for dealing
with the situations that the cues identify. Recognition processes have been
shown to play a major role, perhaps the major role, in such diverse tasks as
grandmaster chessplaying, medical diagnosis, and reading. Introductions to
the evidence will be found in de Groot (1978), Simon ( l979a) and Chi et al
(1988).
Computer simulation models like EPAM (Feigenbaum & Simon 1984)
provide explanatory mechanisms for recognition-based expertise, including a
learning mechanism for acquiring the stored chunks on which it is based.
Alternative models are being developed in the form of parallel, connectionist
systems (EPAM is a basically serial system). The theoretical explanations and
computer models assume processing speeds that are well within the known
human physiological limits, and EPAM, as least, predicts a wide range of the
phenomena that have been reported in the verbal learning literature (including
the times reported by Ebbinghaus for the learning of nonsense syllables). We
can regard intuition as a phenomenon that has been rather thoroughly ex­
plained: It is achieved through acts of recognition.
Heuristic Search
What about problems whose solutions are not provided by immediate recognition,
but which require analysis? Here also, a number of the principal processes have
been identified and simulated. Collectively, they are usually called heuristic (or
selective) search. When a great space of possibilities is to be explored (and
humans commonly balk at searching spaces when the possibilities number even in
the hundreds), search becomes very selective. It is then guided by various rules of
thumb, or heuristics, some of which are specific to particular tasks, but some of
which are more general (Newell & Simon 1972).
If the task domain is highly structured, the task-specific heuristics may be
very powerful, drawing upon the structural information to guide search
directly to the goal. For instance, most of us apply a systematic algorithm
when we must solve a linear equation in algebra. We don't try out different
possible solutions, but employ systematic steps that take us directly to the
correct value of the unknown.
If the task domain has little structure or the structure is unknown to us, we
apply so-called "weak methods," which experience has shown to be useful in
many domains, but which may still require us to search a good deal. One
weak method is satisficing using experience to construct an expectation of
how good a solution we might reasonably achieve, and halting search as soon
as a solution is reached that meets the expectation.
Picking the first satisfactory alternative solves the problem of making a
choice whenever (a) an enormous, or even potentially infinite, number of
alternatives are to be compared and (b) the problem has so little known
-

<-----Page 10----->10

SIMON

structure that all alternatives would have to be examined in order to determine
which is optimal. Satisficing also solves the common problem of making
choices when alternatives are incommensurable, either because (a) they have
numerous dimensions of value that cannot be compared, (b) they have
uncertain outcomes that may be more or less favorable or unfavorable, or (c)

they affect the values of more than one person. Then a satisficing choice can
still be made as soon as an alternative is found that (a) is satisfactory along all
dimensions of value, (b) has satisfactory outcomes for all resolutions of the
uncertainty, or (c) is satisfactory for all parties concerned, respectively.
Another weak mothod is means-ends analysis

noting differences between

-

the current situation and the desired goal situation, and retrieving from
memory operators that, experience has taught us, remove differences of these
kinds.
A small collection of heuristics, of which satisficing and means-ends
analysis are important examples, have been observed as central features of
behavior in a wide range of problem-solving behaviors where recognition
capabilities or systematic algorithms were not available for reaching solutions
without search. The prevalance of heuristic search is a basic law of qualitative
Structure for human problem solving.
Beginning with the General Problem Solver (GPS) in about 1958, a size­
able number of computer programs have been built to simulate heuristic
search in various task domains. With their help, a rather detailed account has
been given of human heuristic search, particularly in relatively well­
structured domains that call upon only limited amounts of domain-specific
knowledge (Newell & Simon 1972). With these programs as foundation,
other investigations have built processes that can create problem representa­
tions for simple situations, using natural language inputs to supply informa­
tion about the problem and task domain.

Serial Pattern Recognition
Ability to find patterns in sequences of numbers, letters, or geometric figures
is an important component of human intelligence (Simon & Kotovsky 1963;
Kotovsky & Simon 1973). The Thurstone Letter Series Completion Test and
the Ravens tests are examples of tasks aimed at measuring this component.
Laboratory studies of these tasks and computer simulations show that success­
ful human performance depends on a few basic pattern-recognizing and
pattern-organizing capabilities. In extrapolating sequential patterns, for ex­
ample, subjects notice when identical symbols recur, or when there are
subsequences of symbols that are successive items in a familiar list or
"alphabet. "
When subsequences repeat in a sequence, subjects can notice this fact and
treat the repetitive subsequences as unitary components in a higher-level

pattern. Thus, recursive or hierarchical patterns can be detected and ex­
trapolated. These capabilities can be shown to be adequate for detecting
pattern in complex pieces of music, and their sufficiency has been demon­
strated by simulation programs capable of carrying out nontrivial musical
analysis (Simon & Sumner 1968).
Procedural Rationality

Problem solving by recognition. by heuristic search. and by pattern recogni­
tion and extrapolation are examples of rational adaptation to complex task
environments that take appropriate account of computational limitations-of
bounded rationality. They are not optimizing techniques. but methods for
arriving at sati�factory solutions with modest amounts of computation. They
do not exhaust, but they typify, what we have been learning about human
cognition, and they go a long way toward explaining how an organism with
rather modest computational capabilities can adapt to a world that is very
.
complex indeed.
The study of human behavior in the face of difficult tasks shows why we
need a theory of processes (procedural rationality) as well as a theory of the
requirements of the task (substantive rationality). A theory based only on task
requirements could not tell· us how behavior depends on knowledge of rele­
vant cues or strategies. It could not explain why we satisfice instead of
optimizing, or how we solve most everyday problems by recognizing cues
that evoke their solutions. It could not give us a grasp of the range of
strategies that may be available for handling a particular task, or the differ­
ences between expert and novice performance on the task. All these phe­
nomena become understandable as we explore, by laboratory experiments and
computer simulations, actual human behavior in a variety of task environ­
ments.
THINKING AND REASONING
If we go back, say, to Woodworth's Experimental Psychology (1938), we
find that accounts of the human "higher mental functions" flow along two
quite different channels, representing different intellectual ties to the adjacent
disciplines. Woodworth devotes two chapters to complex cognitive tasks: one
to problem solving, the other to reasoning (but titled "Thinking"). Wood­
worth's own comment (1938, p. 746) is "Two chapters will not be too many
for the large topic of thinking, and we may make the division according to the
historical sources of two streams of experimentation, which do indeed merge
in the more recent work. One stream arose in the study of animal behavior and
went on to human problem solving; the other started with human thinking of
the more verbal sort." In particular, research on problem solving had its
origins in the disputes about trial-and-error versus insightful learning. Re-

search on reasoning derived from attention to theories of language and logic
as models of thought processes.
The problem-solving model, or metaphor, has generally been preferred by
Gestalt psychologists, with their common belief that insightful thinking is
nonverbal in nature, and by researchers in artificial intelligence, who have
from the beginning described thinking as heuristic search. The reasoning
model, or metaphor, has generally been preferred by linguists with an interest
in cognitive science and by philosophers who stray into this domain. They
describe thought processes in terms of propositions and logical manipulations
of propositions.
A study of mutual citations would show that communication between these
two streams of inquiry has been poor. This reveals itself also in the different
programming languages the two groups adopt when they simulate thinking
processes. The programming languages associated with heuristic search are
list-processing languages like LISP and production-system languages like
OPS5. The programming languages associated with reasoning are logic lan­
guages (languages adapted to theorem proving in the predicate calculus) like
PROLOG.
The division is further reinforced by disagreement about the respective

roles in thinking of sentences (or the propositions they denote) and imagery of
one or another kind. The reasoning metaphor views goals as described by
sentences, derived from other sentences by processes similar to the processes
of logic. The problem-solving metaphor views goals as achieved by se­
quences of moves through a problem space. (The very phrase "problem
space" suggests the importance that is attached to a visual or spatial
metaphor.)
When the reasoning metaphor is used, information is expressed mainly in
declarative sentences. A small number of rules of inference (like the rule of
syllogism in formal logic) are used to derive new sentences from old. The
research tasks most commonly employed to study human reasoning are tasks
of concept formation or tasks of judging the validity or invalidity of formal
syllogisms, the presumption being that human thinking consists in drawing
valid inferences from given premises or data.
When the problem-solving metaphor is used, information is expressed in
schemas, which may resemble interrelated sets of sentences or may resemble
diagrams or pictures of the problem situation. The problem situation is
modified by applying "move operators," which are processes that change a
situation into a new one. Nowadays, the move operators usually take the form
of productions-condition-action pairs, C � A. Whenever the information in
short-term memory matches the conditions of a production, the actions of the
production are executed. The execution of a sequence of productions accom­
plishes a search through the problem space, moving from one situation to
another until a situation satisfying the goal requirements is reached.

All of these differences can be seen by comparing the corresponding two
chapters, mentioned above, of Woodworth (1938), and chapters 8 and 10 of
Anderson (1985).
Determining to what extent human thinking fits the problem-solving
metaphor and to what extent it fits the reasoning metaphor stands high on the
agenda of cognitive psychology today. Of course, the answer may be "both of
the above," the processes of thought varying with the task domain and with
learned or innate differences among the thinkers. It is perhaps of interest that
Johnson-Laird, one of the leaders among those who emphasize the ties
between cognition and linguistics, has recently begun to describe thinking in
terms of "mental models," an approach that lies much closer to the heuristic
search paradigm than to the reasoning paradigm (Johnson-Laird 1983). But I
would hesitate to predict what this particular defection from the linguistic
camp portends for the future.
COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE
The whole congeries of mechanisms of human rationality must somehow be
organized in the human brain to work together in a coordinated fashion.
Today, a good deal of effort of theorists in psychology is devoted to specify­
ing the architectures that achieve this coordination. In this context, "architec­
ture" refers to description of the cognitive system at an abstract, usually
symbolic, level, and has little to say about the underlying biology of neurons.
Early information-processing architectures of cognition (e.g. Broadbent
1958) emphasized memory "boxes" and their interconnections. Today,
architectures specify organizations of processes as well as storage. Among the
proposals that enter prominently into current discussion are Anderson's
(1983) Act*, Newell's (1989) SOAR (both symbolic), and the connectionist
system of McClelland & Rumelhart (1986).
Confining our discussion to symbolic architectures, while there are signifi­
cant differences among them, none of them are incompatible with the recogni­
tion, heuristic search, and pattern-induction mechanisms described in the last
section. For many purposes, it is suf

o

Memories: A short-term memory of limited capacity (working memory), an associative
long-term memory, an EPAM discrimination net to index the long-term memory, and
smaller short-term memories associated with various sensory and motor modalities.

o

Sensory processors to extract features from stimuli.

o

Interpreters of motor signals.

o

EPAM: A discrimination net for sensory features that learns new discriminations and
"chunks" familiar stimuli patterns.

o

GPS: A problem solver that employs heuristic search, and that can be used by the leaming
subsystem.

solving problems.

This may appear to be a lot of baggage, but all of the processing systems
listed are implementable as production systems that can be stored in the
associative long-term memory. Moreover, examples of all of these com­
ponents have been simulated with computer programs, and their mutual
compatibility tested to some degree. For example, the UNDERSTAND sys­
tem (Hayes & Simon 1974) can encode natural language descriptions of
puzzles into internal representations that are suitable problem spaces for GPS.
The ISAAC system (Novak 1976) can encode natural language statements of
physics problems into internal images, and use these images to produce
algebraic equations, which it then solves.
From this we may conclude that, while many issues about architecture are
fluid at the present time, the knowledge we gain about architectures is
unlikely to invalidate, or require major revision of, the knowledge we have
already gained about component mechanisms like EPAM or GPS, or about
their roles in cognition.

LINKAGES TO OTHER PARTS OF PSYCHOLOGY
Contemporary information-processing psychology holds forth significant
possibilities for a greater unification among domains of psychology that are
now quite separate. It may be possible to forge stronger links of cognitive
psychology with the study of child development, with research on individual
differences, with psycholinguistics, and with social psychology.
There is already vigorous research in cognitive developmental psychology
that makes use of many of the constructs discussed here. Computational
linguistics and psycholinguistics also have proceeded along parallel-and
sometimes even intersecting-lines. Some researchers on individual differ­
ences [the names of Hunt (1975) and Sternberg (1977) come immediately to
mind] work within an information-processing framework. The linkages to
social psychology are somewhat more tenuous, but are beginning to form, as
we shall see. Without attempting a systematic review, I would like to offer
comments on several of these topics-in particular, individual differences,
social psychology, and psycholinguistics.

Individual Differences
Traditionally, the study of individual differences has employed psychometric
methods of research. It has been motivated by interest in the nature/nurture

controversy as well as by more practical concerns of predicting and explaining
school and job performance. L. L. Thurstone's Vectors of the Mind ( 1935),
which characterized each individual by a vector of weights for individual
traits and predicted individual performance on specific tasks from the correla­
tions between these weights and the importance of the corresponding traits for
the tasks, provides a template (or perhaps a caricature) for this view of
individual differences.
Thinking-aloud protocols, by providing rich information about the behavior
of individual subjects, have focused attention on the large differences in these
behaviors (Ericsson & Simon 1984). While protocol analysis has proved
much more receptive to the study of individual differences than experimental
designs that take averages over sets of subjects, it has been incorporated only
incompletely into the current literature on individual differences. For ex­
ample, Carroll's ( 1988) chapter on "Individual Differences in Cognitive
Functioning," in the new Stevens' Handbook of Experimental Psychology,
Volume 2, makes almost no reference to the new methods or the research on
expert-novice differences produced by them.
Attending to the processes that subjects use in performing complex tasks
has enabled us to characterize the differences between expert and novice
performance in many task domains. In all of these domains, differences in
knowledge (which must include learned skills as well as factual knowledge)
prove to be a dominant source of differences in performance (Chi et aI 1988).
Of course, this finding should not be taken to deny the existence of "innate"
differences, but rather to account for their relative (quantitative) in­
significance in explaining differences in skilled adult performance. No one
would argue that any randomly selected person could be trained to play
world-class tennis; but one could argue, on the basis of the evidence now
available, that most normal human beings could become reasonably good
players with sufficient training and practice, and that none could become
excellent players without extensive training and practice.
Knowledge includes knowledge of strategies. A good deal of the research
on expert-novice differences has been aimed at understanding the strategies
that experts acquire and apply, how these strategies can be learned, and to
what extent they are transferable from one task domain to another. Hence, in
the contemporary paradigms, the study of individual differences is closely
tied to the study of learning and transfer of training. These ties, in tum,
introduce a strong taxonomic aspect into the study of individual differences,
making clear that a great many task domains will have to be analyzed before
we can generalize safely about human skills.
The new connections between skills and processes affect not only our
understanding of complex performances, but also our interpretations of the
simple processes that underlie them. We are aware today of the centrality of
short-term memory limits to performance on· many, if not most, cognitive

tasks, and we have long used George Miller's seven chunks to characterize
those limits.
But a chunk is not an innate measure of storage capacity. A chunk is any
stimulus that has become familiar, hence recognizable, through experience.
Hence, the capacity of short-term memory is itself determined by leaming,
and can grow to vast size as individual acts of recognition access larger and
richer stores of information in long-term memory. Two EPAM systems
possessing the same basic structure can differ greatly in measured STM
capacity simply because one has a more elaborate differentiation net and
associated store of schemas than the other.

Social Psychology
Just as individual differences find a natural place in information processing
psychology, so do social phenomena. To the extent that cognitive peformance
rests on skill and knowledge, it is a social, rather than a purely individual,
phenomenon. Language skills and skills in social interaction can be
approached within the same theoretical framework as knowledge and skills
for dealing with the physical environment.
The recent work of Voss et al (1983) illustrates how cognitive and social
psychology can mutually reinforce each other. He has studied how people
who have different professional backgrounds and information approach the
same problem-solving situation. When asked to write an essay on agricultural
reform in the USSR, subjects who are experts in agronomy address them­
selves to entirely different variables and strategies than subjects who are
experts on Russian political affairs. And both of these groups of subjects
respond quite differently from novices. When we study expert behavior, we
cannot help studying the structure of professional disciplines in our society.
Cognitive psychology still has an important task of studying the domain­
independent components of cognitive performance. But since the perfor­
mance depends heavily on socially structured and socially acquired knowl­
edge, it must pay constant attention to the social environment of cognition.
Many of the invariants we see in behavior are social invariants. And since
they are social invariants, many are invariant only over a particular society or
a particular era, or even over a particular social or professional group within a
society. Social variables must be introduced to set the boundaries of our
generalizations.

CONCLUSION
Let me summarize briefly this account of the invariants of human behavior as
they are disclosed by contemporary cognitive psychology. The problem of
identifying invariants is complicated by the fact that people are adaptive

systems, whose behavior is highly flexible. The invariants must be sought in
the mechanisms that allow them to solve problems and learn: the mechanisms
of intelligence.
The Physical Symbol System Hypothesis, strongly supported by empirical
evidence, asserts that a system will be capable of intelligent behavior if and
only if it is a physical symbol system: if it can input, output, store, and
manipulate symbols. The hypothesis, and consequently information­
processing psychology, describes intelligence at a symbolic, "software,"
level, saying little about brain physiology. That fact need not impede our
progress, nor has it, toward understanding at this symbolic level how a
physical symbol system like the brain achieves intelligent behavior.
Because of the limits on their computing speeds and power, intelligent
systems must use approximate methods. Optimality is beyond their capabili­
ties; their rationality is bounded. To explain the behavior of a system of
bounded rationality we must describe the system's processes and also the
environments to which it is adapting. Human short-term memory can hold
only a half dozen chunks, an act of recognition takes nearly a second, and the
simplest human reactions are measured in tens and hundreds of milliseconds,
rather than microseconds, nanoseconds, or picoseconds. These limits are
among the most important invariants of intelligence.
A major strategy for achieving intelligent adaptation with bounded rational­
ity is to store knowledge and search heuristics in a richly indexed long-term
memory in order to reduce the computational requirements of problems.
Experts use recognition processes, based on this stored, indexed knowledge,
to handle their everyday tasks. When recognition does not suffice, because a
great space of possibilities must be explored, they resort to highly selective
search, guided by rich stores of heuristics.
When intelligence explores unfamiliar domains, it falls back on "weak
methods," which are independent of domain knowledge. People satisfice­
look for good-enough solutions-instead of hopelessly searching for the best.
They use means-ends analysis to reduce progressively their distance from the
desired goal. Paying attention to symmetries and orderly sequences, they seek
patterns in their environments that they can exploit for prediction. Problem
solving by recognition, by heuristic search, and by pattern recognition are
adaptive techniques that are compatible with bounded rationality.
Several cognitive architectures have been proposed to account for the
processes just described, but these architectures represent relatively modest
variations on a basic pattern that is widely accepted today. This basic pattern
involves some sensory processors that provide input into short-term and
long-term memory, a recognition process that discriminates the features
detected by the senses, a problem solver that employs heuristic search, a
pattern induction system, systems for handling natural language, sys-

terns for handling image-like representations, and learning mechanisms that
permit new processes and data structures to be constructed and stored in
memory.
The picture I have drawn of cognitive psychology and the invariants of
intelligence holds forth the promise of linking several parts of psychology that
now mostly go their separate ways. Developmental psychology has already
been strongly influenced by the cognitive revolution. The approach to in­
telligence and individual differences is beginning to be modified in an in­
formation-processing direction. But we are just beginning to see that, because
of the strong dependence of intelligence on stored knowledge, cognitive and
social psychology must be brought much closer together than they have been
in the recent past. When we have made these new connections solid, the
challenge will remain of bringing affect and emotion more centrally into the
picture.
