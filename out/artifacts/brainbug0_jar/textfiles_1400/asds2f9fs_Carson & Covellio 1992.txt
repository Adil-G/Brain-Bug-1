Discusses the emergence of
qualitative research in the
context of research at the
marketing/entrepreneurship
interface. Debates which
qualitative methods for data
collection and analysis are
relevant to research in this
area. In consideration of this,
discusses three topical
approaches to research:
applying the principles of
grounded theory; utilizing
computer software in data
analysis and theory development; and developing a
“stream” of research, combining various qualitative and
quantitative methods. Drawing on the logic of the
“stream” of research, offers
a radical approach which
reflects the intuitive research
process employed by entrepreneurs. Argues that this
might be adopted for qualitative academic research.

Background
As the marketing discipline moves to
strengthen its interdisciplinary ties, research
examining issues at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface has emerged as a rapidly
developing area. The marketing/entrepreneurship interface brings together researchers who have an affinity and understanding of the rich heritage of both marketing and entrepreneurship. While both literatures have their own distinctive characteristics, the interface recognizes substantial
commonality between the two.
Research at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface is typified by growth and interaction. This dynamic has been best manifested in literature such as the UIC/AMA
Research at the Marketing/Entrepreneurship
Interface Conference Proceedings, where,
between 1987 and 1994, 194 articles were published. These articles range from exploratory
to explanatory pieces and conceptual to contemplative. They form the core of the “stateof-the-art” research in the area.

marketing/entrepreneurship
interface

As discussed by Hofer and Bygrave (1992), the
entrepreneurial process involves a change of
state and discontinuity, and is holistic and
dynamic. It is said to be unique, involving
numerous antecedent variables, and generating outcomes that are extremely sensitive to
the initial conditions of those variables.
Given these characteristics, it is perhaps not
surprising that Hills and LaForge (1992) draw
a number of distinct parallels between the
entrepreneurship and marketing disciplines.
For example, both areas emphasize behavioural processes and innovation, share a
common underlying philosophy (pertaining
to the market and customer), and draw from
multidisciplinary theoretical foundations.

These commonalities suggest that research
models and processes appropriate to the marketing discipline may well be applied and/or
adapted to the area of entrepreneurship (and
vice versa).
The question then is raised: what is the best
way to conduct research in emerging areas
such as that of the marketing/entrepreneurship interface? According to Zinkhan and
Hirscheim (1992):
Science uses whatever tools, techniques,
and approaches are considered appropriate
for the particular subject matter under
study.

One approach to research at the marketing/
entrepreneurship interface focuses on confirmation and justification, following a deductive, deterministic model of inquiry. In support of this view, Wortman et al. (1989) call for
enhanced methodological rigour when studying the interface, involving improved hypothesis testing and representative sampling,
adequate sample sizes, and appropriate statistical treatments. Following from this, they
suggest that qualitative techniques such as
interviews are “costly, time-consuming, and
geographically constraining”, and should be
reserved for gathering supportive and corroborative data, or exploratory designs.
If, however, as Hills and LaForge (1992)
claim, research at the interface falls into the
“school of discovery”, the more appropriate
research approach involves qualitatively
seeking to identify suitable variables and
their relevant patterns and processes. From
this basis, the researcher may begin to
develop propositions and hypotheses concerning a “reality”, then lead to theory development.
This approach to research at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface is supported
by researchers who call for increased use of
qualitative and depth field work (e.g.
Churchill, 1992; Van de Ven, 1992) with
Aldrich (1992) stating:

... entrepreneurship research is still very
much a mono-method field, in spite of
repeated calls for the field to free itself from
dependence on mailed surveys and related
questionnaire-based methods.

To this end, Stewart (1991) suggests drawing
on anthropological research methods (e.g.
ethnography, grounded theory, and field
research) to help develop theory. Also, Morris
and Stenberg (1991) suggest that firms should
be examined in the context of their unique
setting, especially when there are multiple
influences on entrepreneurial processes.
Clearly, there is a wide variety of research
methods and tools available to researchers at
the interface, albeit most stem from social
science. If, as proposed by Hills and LaForge
(1992), interface researchers should be striving towards developing an integrated theoretical framework, researchers need to be aware
of which methods have been used to date, and
which are appropriate as they try to develop a
more integrated, holistic theory specific to
the marketing/entrepreneurship interface.
As summarized by Carson and Coviello
(1995), both deductive and inductive
approaches are in evidence, with the historical bedrock of interface research stemming
from the “school of justification”. That is, it is
concerned largely with validity and confirmation. As a result, much of the research has
been focused on reciprocal and replicating
studies, designed to test and confirm the
general literature pertaining to principles of
management and decision making, structures of management and organization, and
managerial processes, in the context of the
marketing/entrepreneurship interface and
entrepreneurial firms. This is perhaps a
reflection of the disciplinary focus and training of early researchers at the interface, in
that their aim was often to prove that entrepreneurial processes were “different”.
At the same time, there appears to be a
growing trend away from deductive
approaches, and towards inductive research.
As a reflection of this, there is an increasing
focus on research designs which are descriptive and case-study-based, and a decline in
designs seeking to prove, for example, cause
and effect relationships (Carson and Coviello,
1995). In the broadest sense, the interface
literature has begun to show an expansion in
the use of qualitative research, focused on
“understanding” phenomena and describing
both the meaning and implications of events.
While marketing/entrepreneurship interface
research has tended historically to focus on
the microdimensions of marketing and entrepreneurship at the level of the firm and the
decision maker, it now emphasizes “new

frontiers” related to firm behaviours and
relationships, industrial and social networks,
and entrepreneurial and marketing
competences.
As a result two distinct strands of research
activity at the marketing/entrepreneurship
interface have emerged, with research focusing on: validity and confirmation; or identifying new concepts, constructs, or paradigms.
In future, it is likely that both categories of
research will continue to develop as the
research area as a whole matures. It can also
be expected that there will be increasing
cross-fertilization between the two
categories, as well as the emergence of new
concepts and areas of interest. This will probably follow from literature developments in
other disciplines, combined with managerial
practice.
Methodologically, as research at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface develops,
there is opportunity to exploit the emerging
trend towards qualitative research. As the
use of qualitative research increases, so too
will the range and variety of qualitative
methods and tools. Generally, research methods from the social sciences will be employed,
ranging from ethnographic traditions to
clinical and grounded theory approaches.
Although arguments as to the “best” or
most appropriate approach will continue,
there is no doubt that qualitative methods
have much to offer researchers in this field,
particularly in terms of longitudinal and
cross-sectional studies. Hofer and Bygrave
(1992) state that:
The fact that the entrepreneurial process
involves changes of stage, discontinuities,
and dynamic, holistic processes suggests
that studies of these processes should be
longitudinal in character.

This is compounded by interface researchers
being driven by the need to be relevant, and
therefore pragmatic. The question therefore
remains, which methods for data collection
and analysis are relevant for research at the
marketing/entrepreneurship interface? Or as
captured by Zelditch (1962): “... what do you
do if you prefer data that are real, deep, and
hard?” While a variety of qualitative research
methods have been advocated in some areas
of marketing, principally and predominantly
in the field of consumer studies, it is not
widely, indeed even marginally, accepted in
research into mainstream marketing decision making and particularly at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface.
There are many qualitative methods
worthy of debate, but three approaches based
in the social science research literature have
been the focus of discussion at various

<-----Page 2----->David Carson and

symposia examining the marketing/entrepreneurship interface:
1 applying the principles of grounded
theory;
2 utilizing computer software for data analysis and theory development; and
3 developing a “stream” of research (combining qualitative and quantitative
methods).
Based on trends in the general marketing and
entrepreneurship disciplines, each of these
approaches has been suggested by
researchers as potentially useful at the interface. However, it is questionable whether or
not these approaches can in fact provide data
that are “real, deep and hard”, and truly
meaningful for both researchers and practitioners.
The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to
highlight and discuss each approach in the
context of marketing/entrepreneurship
research. In addition, a fourth approach is
offered as an alternative which acknowledges
the potential overlap between “academic”
and “practitioner” research. Each will be
discussed in turn.

Approach 1: applying the principles of
grounded theory
One social science research method which is
discussed increasingly in terms of possible
application at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface is that of “grounded theory”.
Introduced by Glaser and Strauss (1967), and
updated with some significant progression by
Strauss and Corbin (1990), grounded theory
has many attributes that are attractive to the
researcher. It is a qualitative method that
uses a systematic set of procedures to develop
an inductively derived grounded theory
about a phenomenon. As outlined by Strauss
and Corbin (1990), the grounded theory
approach enables the researcher to begin
with an area of study, and allows the “relevance” to emerge (rather than begin with a
theory and then prove it). Creativity is also a
vital component of grounded theory, in that
various procedures force the researcher to
“... break through traditional assumptions or
norms, and create a new order out of old”
(Strauss and Corbin, 1990).
Grounded theory in emerging research
areas such as that of the marketing/entrepreneurship interface would be developed from a
combination of the existing literature, professional and personal experience, and an analytic process. Thus, the process is sensitive to
the subtleties of both the data and the meaning of the data. The grounded theory method
also allows for theoretical sensitivity by
having the researcher periodically step back

from the analytical process to question “what
is going on?” The researcher is therefore
guided to maintain an attitude of scepticism
by: regarding all theoretical explanations as
provisional; and following clearly defined
research procedures.
Clearly, the grounded theory method has
many attributes conducive to sound research
in areas such as the marketing/entrepreneurship interface. However, there are a number
of issues that should be considered prior to its
application.
First, for a researcher to develop reliable
concepts and constructs from the data, s/he
must have considerable experience or knowledge in the topic area. It is this experience
which allows the researcher to evaluate data
correctly and effectively. If this premiss is
accepted, then the grounded theory method
would present considerable difficulty for the
researcher who has little or no experience
with a topic, and such a researcher would be
dangerously exposed to misinterpretation of
data. At the marketing/entrepreneurship
interface, researchers attempting to utilize
the grounded theory method will need, at the
very least, competency skills such as knowledge and experience of the interface. Otherwise, researchers may rely on either knowledge or experience in either marketing or
entrepreneurship and fail to address the
interface linkage. Knowledge and experience
are competences which were implicit in
Glaser and Strauss’s (1967) original research.
Although the approach was offered as a social
science method, the original research was
carried out in an environment about which
both authors were substantially knowledgeable and experienced.
Second, using the grounded theory
approach also requires the researcher to be
simultaneously open-minded and sceptical
regarding the data. Apart from the apparent
paradox presented by these two dimensions,
it is difficult to imagine how a researcher,
who has the necessary experience in a topic
area, can be entirely open-minded on data
issues. Being human, it is perhaps inevitable
that prior experience will lead to judgemental
interpretations based on his/her expertise.
Finally, a technical concern with the
grounded theory method relates to the rigidity of the coding system. This rigidity may
inhibit rather than facilitate data evaluation,
since it forces the “experienced” researcher
into unnecessary and restrictive steps (as
perceived by that researcher), and may in fact
suppress some of the richness of evaluation.
In addition, the coding procedures can sometimes raise unnecessary issues, especially for
the inexperienced researcher. This can lead
to overly complex analysis, causing the

[ 53 ]

<-----Page 3----->David Carson and
Nicole Coviello

issues at the marketing/
entrepreneurship interface
Marketing Intelligence &
Planning
14/6 [1996] 51–58

researcher to follow multiple paths or levels
of investigation which may not in fact be the
focus of the research. While it is recognized
that coding procedures introduce a laudable
rigour to the research method, it might be
questioned as to whether such rigour is necessary or appropriate in all qualitative
research, particularly when trying to understand the subtleties underlying, for example,
decision-making processes in a
marketing/entrepreneurship context.
In conclusion, it is acknowledged that the
grounded theory method may be useful in
qualitative research, particularly as it contributes a degree of research rigour. However,
it is a method which is perhaps best employed
by a qualitative researcher who is a phenomenologist by training, since such a researcher
will be comfortable with the logic of the
method employed. For those researchers who
are not phenomenologists by heart or nature,
it might be more productive to apply creative
or lateral thinking to data interpretation.
This may be especially relevant in the context
of researching entrepreneurs, who, it is recognized, are not susceptible to conformity
and rigour. Overall, it may be fundamentally
unnecessary and inappropriate to apply a
method with rigour (such as grounded
theory) in relation to a subject (such as marketing/entrepreneurship processes) which
may be inherently without rigour.

Approach 2: applying computer software
for analysis and theory building
It has long been recognized that the scourge
of qualitative research is the tedious and
sometimes monotonous analysis and interpretation of vast quantities of “soft”, largely
unstructured data. While various tools to
data analysis have been offered (Miles and
Huberman, 1994), advances in information
technology have led to the development of
innovative software packages designed to
facilitate data analysis (e.g. Ethnograph,
NUDIST, and Metamorph). The software
developed to date consists of both generic
packages and those specifically developed for
the needs of qualitative researchers. The
former simply function to retrieve keywords
or manage the text base, while the latter are
designed to “code and retrieve” data, build
theory, or develop conceptual networks. Some
programs are able to perform only the first
level of analysis, while others are capable of
much more (see Miles and Huberman (1994)
for a review of different packages).
Overall, software packages are particularly
useful where there is a large quantity of data
requiring coding, annotation, linking, search
and retrieval, development of data displays,
etc. However, there is a variety of practical

[ 54 ]

issues to be considered before making the
decision to use software in qualitative data
analysis.
First, to run in an effective and efficient
manner, certain packages need careful precoding of the data in order to identify and
recognize keywords, phrases, and passages.
Where there is a large amount of data, this
can be an extremely time-consuming process.
Second, the researcher needs to have an
intimate personal knowledge of the data, so
that appropriate trigger codes and responses
can be inserted at the outset of data interpretation. Such knowledge can best come from
personal involvement in the entire process,
from data collection through to analysis. If
there are multiple researchers located in
different locations (e.g. internationally), it is
also unrealistic to expect the entire research
team to have “intimate personal knowledge”
of all the data (including how the qualitative
data have been interpreted and transformed).
The question therefore arises as to whether
the software in fact aids data analysis or
simply adds another step in the process.
Overall, it is likely that computer-aided
analysis is at best a useful and sometimes
additional “first cut” evaluation of the data.
While it allows the researcher to organize the
data, confirm broad assumptions and identify
emerging patterns, it will not generate the
richness of interpretive understanding, necessary at the marketing/entrepreneurship
interface. This can come only from intimate
appreciation of the inherent nuances of
meaning.

Approach 3: developing a “stream” of
research
To combat methodological problems associated with entrepreneurship research, Davis et
al. (1985) suggest that a “... stream of
research” is needed. This implies that individual studies are carefully designed to build on
what has been learned in previous studies. In
this way, different methodological approaches
can be tested, avoiding the discontinuity provided by individual, isolated investigations.
Such a stream of research could be achieved
by integrating (for example):
• Case studies of successful and unsuccessful
entrepreneurial marketers.
• Small-scale exploratory or cross-sectoral
studies to test different methodologies.
• Large-scale survey research to study relevant marketing/entrepreneurship interface issues on both a cross-sectoral and
longitudinal basis.
• Controlled field studies to enable the study
of causal relationships.

Nicole Coviello
Qualitative research
issues at the marketing/
entrepreneurship interface
Marketing Intelligence &
Planning

The cornerstone of the “stream of research”
approach is that it allows the researcher to
combine the “best” and most suitable
research methods from the social sciences at
specific and appropriate stages of the
research. This approach therefore negates
many of the deficiencies of a single research
method, identified by Carson and Coviello
(1995) to be a major weakness in the interface
literature. At the same time, researchers need
to be cognizant of the differences associated
with managing comparative interpretation of
data, gathered by the different methods, perhaps over time.

Summary
The three approaches debated so far in this
paper have significant justification for use in
research. There are, however, some concerns
as to their appropriateness for research at the
marketing/entrepreneurship interface.
Whatever their appropriateness, the major
concern is: do they allow for the progression
of the knowledge and understanding of the
phenomena in question? (cf. Gibb and Davies,
1990).
Since, as stated earlier, much of the
research at the marketing/entrepreneurship
interface is about understanding phenomena,
the closer the researcher gets to the phenomenon, the clearer it is understood. In order to
achieve this, qualitative researchers might
employ a variety of methods that follow the
“stream of research” notion, but they should
view the research in a totally integrative
manner, rather than a step-wise progression
from qualitative to quantitative. Thus, the
researcher might simultaneously combine a
selection of methods such that a “pool” of
knowledge develops. This approach would
integrate and adapt a range of methods as
appropriate, thereby capitalizing on resource
and research synergy.
It might be argued that this is a triangulation of a sort, as propositioned by Deshpande
(1983), but the approach goes much further.
The proposition here is that no single method
of social science research is wholly appropriate in providing the depth, breadth and subtlety of information necessary for examining
the marketing/entrepreneurship interface.
Of course, any one method may allow the
researcher to reach meaningful conclusions,
but it is contended here that an integrated
combination of compatible and complementary methods will yield substantially more
satisfying results. If we can learn from marketing, the view of Zinkhan and Hirscheim
(1992) is relevant:
Too often in marketing we undertake
research projects to investigate the relationships between isolated variables and we do

not make an attempt to integrate our findings into an overall framework. If we are to
advance marketing knowledge, we must
make our theories and models explicit and
we must carry out integrated research programs with an aim to discover underlying
causal structures and generative mechanisms. We need theories that really explain,
rather than merely describe.

It will be observed that this integrated
approach resembles the process by which the
practitioner achieves a level of knowledge
and understanding acceptable to him/her.
For example, marketing practitioners, and in
particular entrepreneurs, intuitively practise
such a philosophy. They are not encumbered
by rules, rigours and restrictions when conducting research for their business and in
fact, collect and analyse information in a
“naturalistic” manner. This point is well
documented in the debates surrounding the
variances and even dichotomies between
academic marketing theory and marketing
practice. This leads to the question: what can
academic researchers learn from the
approaches used by practitioners? To answer
this, we offer a research approach which
acknowledges the potential to combine “academic” research with “practitioner” research.

Approach 4: linking academic research
with “artistic” practitioner research
The basis of the approach proposed here
stems from the long-running debate in many
academic circles, particularly so in marketing, about whether marketing is a “science”
or an “art”. It is not the purpose of this paper,
or the desire of the authors, belatedly to enter
into this debate.
The approach proposed here is not yet
another denouncement of scientific marketing philosophy in favour of the extreme postmodern marketer’s extolment of art and the
artisan as the panacea of marketing thought.
In fact, the proposal acknowledges the
strength and existence of a scientific marketing philosophy. However, it is contended that
“scientific” marketers/academics often display an arrogant disdain for marketing practitioners. An example of such disdain is ably
described by Brown (1996) when criticizing
marketing scientists for chasing the holy
grail of marketing scientific theory. Brown
argues that:
... the single-minded pursuit of this noble
aspiration has taken longer than we anticipated and, indeed, may take a tad more time
to come to fruition, but the ultimate fruits of
our labours – the bright shining Science of
Marketing – will make all the sacrifices
worthwhile. In the meantime, we can
attempt to mollify marketing practitioners
(and our cerebrally challenged academic

[ 55 ]

peers) by publishing periodic bulletins in
the burgeoning number of “managerially
orientated magazines”, the subtext of which
seems to comprise “we know you cretins
can’t understand a word of JMR, but lest
you conclude that cutting-edge marketing
thinkers have lost the common touch, here’s
the low brow, bullet-pointed, God-but-you’rethick version of where we’re at (p. 14).

Academic marketing research, whether from
the stance of realism or relativism, in some
ways acknowledges that there is a void
between marketing academics and marketing
practitioners. Indeed, Brown (1996) explicitly
acknowledges this when stating, “If anything,
our unending search for the impossible intellectual dream has only served to distance us
from, and diminished our standing in the
eyes of, those front-line foot-soldiers who
battle daily in the marketing management
trenches”. It is this “void” which this proposed “linkage” here attempts to address, in
the context of the marketing/entrepreneurship interface.
In relation to education, much of the foundation philosophy of marketing research
programmes in university education stems
from the rigour required by “academic”
social science research. A basic tenet is that,
if research is to be considered valid, it must
be “scientific” and carried out with a discipline and rigour which emphasizes objectivity and validity, and shows clearly cause and
effect. As a consequence, much of the teaching curriculum focuses on methodologies and
how they must be performed “correctly”.
Similarly, emphasis is often placed on the
“one best method” for a particular piece of
research, even to the point of underlining the
difficulties and complexities of using more
than one method.
However, marketing practitioners and particularly entrepreneurs and owner/managers
of small businesses do not carry out research
in this manner. Instead, they take a naturalistic, even artistic approach to gathering market information. The definition here of “artistic” implicitly acknowledges that artistic
observations and actions are, according to
Anderson(1983), “... always interpreted in the
context of a priori knowledge”, and similarly
supported by Kuhn (1970) when he states:
“What a man sees depends both upon what he
looks at and also upon what his previous
visual-conceptual experience has taught him
to see”. Therefore, “artistic” in this sense
relates to the notion that practitioner
research will be uniquely created by the individual and related specifically to his/her
company. Interpretation of findings (generally gathered haphazardly, spontaneously,
opportunistically and personally), will be

[ 56 ]

perceived in terms of significance and meaning, uniquely by that individual. As in art,
interpretation is individualistically in the
“eye of the beholder”, whether this is the
artist who created the piece or the viewer of
the piece.
This description and its variance from
“science” is more comprehensively described
by Eisner (1985) who, in an evaluation of the
differences between artistic and scientific
approaches to qualitative research, identified
and described ten key factors. These are
admirably summarized by Brown(1996) and
illustrated in Table I in order to underpin the
above arguments.
Practitioner market research will use any
method at its disposal, regardless of correctness and compatibility. Typically, a practitioner will gather information from a variety
of sources and in a variety of ways. The concepts of rigour and validity seldom enter into
the mind-frame. The practitioner will have a
“feel” for the value and usefulness of information and its source and will intuitively accept
or reject information as it is gathered. Much
of the information gathering (note the use of
the term “information gathering” as opposed
to market research) may well be unstructured
and without a single specific purpose.
Table I illustrates clearly the void in both
approach and thinking between academics
and practitioners. The question becomes:
how can marketing academics make research
more practitioner “real”, while not rejecting
the characteristics of “academic” social
science research, particularly its rigour and
validity? Can academic researchers accommodate the ethos of “practitioner” research?
This would require acceptance of the view
that interpretation of findings is entirely
personal for the purpose of understanding in
a business context and this understanding is
precisely personal, in terms of it relating to a
practitioner’s business. Equally, might academic researchers accept the approach of using
and/or adopting any research method with
which the researcher is comfortable and
which he/she chooses to use out of convenience or expediency? This is unclear
because social science research fails to recognize that market information is of a unique
value to an individual and his/her company.
However, if such a notion is accepted, what
might practitioner-related academic research
look like and what problems, if any, would
ensue? Since the research would reflect the
unique situation and context of the research
problem, its distinct characteristics are difficult to define, but if the uniqueness of such
research in practice is accepted, then this is
not an issue. Of course, this gives rise to concerns regarding the validity of the research.

If, however, the practitioner research
approach can be linked in some manner with
integrated, multimethod academic research,
some concerns may be overcome. This is a
particularly important issue at the marketing/entrepreneurship interface. Thus, the
onus is on academics at the interface to soften
current and established philosophies and to
encompass a “practitioner philosophy”
which is naturalistic and perhaps inherently
artistic. This is not an impossible notion;
after all, “art” may be based on forms and
structures, and on perspectives and views,
but the individual outcomes are still essentially singularly creative with unique
circumstances in mind.

Conclusions
This paper discusses a variety of qualitative
research approaches in the context of a

Creation of meaning and generation of
understanding; statements seek to alter
extant perceptions about the world

rapidly emerging area of research interest:
the marketing/entrepreneurship interface.
Application of the principles of grounded
theory, using computer software in data
analysis and theory building, and developing
a combined method/“stream” approach to
research are all discussed, and their relative
strengths and weaknesses noted.
Regardless of approach, the critical issue to
be addressed by researchers is one of integration, where both the research problem and
method are viewed holistically, in an effort to
allow for progression of knowledge and
understanding of the phenomena in question.
To this end, the paper introduces a radical
research approach, attempting to accommodate the intuitive practitioner research of the
entrepreneur with aspects of the academic
process. More specifically, it is recommended
that “real” research in emerging areas such
as the marketing/entrepreneurship interface,

should reflect the ethos of the practitioner’s
natural or “artistic” research method.
Enlightened educators have long recognized
