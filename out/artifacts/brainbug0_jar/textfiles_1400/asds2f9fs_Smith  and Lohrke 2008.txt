Abstract
An entrepreneur's network can provide a significant source of social capital, which, in turn, may increase a new venture's likelihood of
success. Entrepreneurship research has frequently examined how such networks develop, and reviewing extant studies suggests that trust plays a
significant role in this process. Despite its recognized importance, limited research exists examining how trust evolves during and interacts with
the entrepreneur's venture network development. Accordingly, we propose that an entrepreneur's reliance on exchange relationships based on
affective and cognitive trust will vary as the entrepreneur moves through the network development process. We conclude by discussing both the
model's implications and future research avenues.

1. Introduction
Entrepreneurs face daunting odds in successfully forming
new ventures, in part, because they often do not control all the
resources needed to start these ventures. This constraint is
compounded by the venture's limited track record and lack of
legitimacy, often termed its “liability of newness”, which create
difficulties in gaining needed support from important resource
providers (Stinchcombe, 1965). Consequently, success in both
overcoming this liability and, in turn, obtaining necessary
resources may depend heavily on the entrepreneur's ability to
create sustained exchange relationships with resource providers
(Katz and Gartner, 1988).
This focus on the relational nature of entrepreneurship stems
from the realization that it is an economic process, embedded
within a social context (Aldrich and Zimmer, 1986). Within this
context, entrepreneurs must continually develop both exchange

relationship structure and quality in an effort to obtain the
resources necessary to launch and sustain a new venture (Greve
and Salaff, 2003; Hite, 2005; Ritter and Gemünden, 2003).
Substantial research points to trust development as an essential
component in this process (e.g., Das and Teng, 1998; Lewicki
and Bunker, 1996). Despite its intrinsic importance, little
research, to date, has addressed how, and for that matter, why,
trust evolves during the entrepreneur's network development
process.
Accordingly, by incorporating trust literature into network
research, we seek to contribute to entrepreneurship research by
shedding light on what has been consistently identified as a
salient issue but, as yet, has received little theoretical
development. We begin by briefly discussing the importance
of an entrepreneur's network in providing social capital and
overcoming a venture's liability of newness. Next, we refer to
existing research to demonstrate why trust, particular two types,
affective and cognitive, plays such a critical role during the
entrepreneur's venture network development. Based on this
review, we develop a model and corresponding propositions to
explain how reliance on affective and cognitive trust evolves as
the entrepreneur and resource providers develop exchange
relationships. Specifically, the model proposes that as the entrepreneur's network structure changes from simple dyadic ties to
complex economic exchanges, so will the relational aspect of

affective and cognitive trust, in that the entrepreneur will
increasingly rely on relationships based on the latter rather than
the former. Lastly, we present important implications of the
model, discuss its limitations, and offer suggests for additional
research into trust's role in new venture network development.
2. Networks and social capital
During formation, new ventures require myriad resources,
from information and capital to symbolic support such as legitimacy (Singh et al., 1986). Given venture resource constraints,
entrepreneurs often form ties with outside entities in an effort to
provide many of these critical resources (Dubini and Aldrich,
1991; Hansen, 1995). Such ties form the entrepreneur's “social
capital”, or the sum of the actual and potential resources embedded within, available through, and derived from a relationship
network (Greve and Salaff, 2003; Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998).
Besides providing access to economic resources, social capital
derived from this network is important because it can provide the
entrepreneur access to useful, reliable, exclusive, and less redundant information, which, in turn, improves a venture's likelihood
of success (Brüderl and Preisendorfer, 1998). In addition, social
capital serves as both a product of the entrepreneurial network and
an enabler of continued network development, facilitating coordination and co-operation of network ties by bonding the parties
involved (Anderson and Jack, 2002).
Social capital has been taken to mean either the structure of
network ties, the quality of exchange relationships, or both. These
structural and relational views of social capital stem from
Granovetter's (1992) discussion of social embeddedness types,
which focuses on how the network architecture (e.g., centrality) of
exchange relationships influences economic activity (Uzzi,
1997). Accordingly, the structural view of social capital is concerned with the overall pattern or configuration of ties between the
entrepreneur and other individuals (Burt, 1992; Granovetter,
1973). In a purely structural view, a tie presumably provides both
necessary and sufficient conditions for transferring information
and resources that may aid in the venture's likelihood of success.
Focusing purely on network structure, however, may inadequately explain how exchange relationships function by assuming
that “a tie is a tie” (Uzzi and Gillespie, 2002).
In contrast, the relational view focuses more on information
and resources leveraged from personal and direct relationships
the entrepreneur has developed with others through a history of
interactions (Granovetter, 1992). This view, thus, includes many
aspects of the social context, such as social interactions and the
degree of trust in the relationships (Nahapiet and Ghoshal,
1998; Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998).
New ventures lacking these relationships generally face high
mortality risks, a condition that entrepreneurship research has
long referred to as the “liability of newness” (Stinchcombe, 1965).
This liability arises, in part, from the difficulty in gaining trust and
support from key resource providers, who perceive an “adverse
selection” risk stemming from the venture's limited track record
and lack of legitimacy (Akerlof, 1970; Singh et al., 1986). An
entrepreneur who can successfully overcome this liability by
convincing resource providers that a new venture is both viable

and legitimate will have a better chance of acquiring resources,
and, in turn, increasing the venture's success chances. Thus,
venture success may be predicated, in part, on an entrepreneur's
ability to proactively accumulate social capital, and, in turn,
assemble critical resources via a network of exchange relationships (Venkataraman and Van de Ven, 1998). For example,
investors are more likely to invest in new ventures when they have
a previously established direct tie to the entrepreneur than when
they do not because these ties generate a sense of obligation and
trust (Shane and Cable, 2002).
3. Importance of trust
We have invoked the concept of trust above in our discussion
of entrepreneur s' ability to use their networks to both derive
social capital and overcome liability of newness issues. This
follows logically considering that previous research has cited
trust between partners as a critical element of network exchange
that, when developed, enhances resource flows (Larson, 1992;
Lorenzoni and Lipparini, 1999). When parties trust each other,
they are more willing to engage in cooperative activity through
which further trust may be generated (Fukuyama, 1995). Trust
is, thus, “the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the
actions of another party based on the expectation that the other
will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party”
(Mayer et al., 1995, p. 712). This definition applies particularly
to the context of entrepreneurial network development in that it
recognizes a new venture's inherent risk characteristics for both
entrepreneurs and resource providers.
Specifically, early in venture's development, entrepreneurs
often face high risks resulting from limited protection for their
developing ideas. Resource providers also face risks from
information asymmetry, and, in turn, adverse selection, arising
from the entrepreneur's unwillingness or inability to fully communicate information about the new venture (Venkataraman,
1997). When trust exists, however, individuals are more willing
to give useful knowledge, when possible, or forego complete
knowledge (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998). As Aldrich and Fiol
(1994) noted, “trust is a critical first-level determinant of the
success of founding entrepreneurs because, by definition, there
is an absence of information and evidence regarding their new
activity” (p. 650).
Although trust can be instrumental in reducing uncertainty, it
would be unnecessary if exchange partners could undertake
actions with complete rational prediction that totally removed
risk (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Because it is impossible to
monitor every detail in most exchanges, however, entrepreneurs
must always have a minimum trust level that often evolves as
the partners interact (Das and Teng, 1998). Once established,
these trust-dependent interactions reduce time spent on
monitoring and bargaining over agreements (Dyer and Singh,
1998). Thus, without some level of trust in these circumstances,
economic exchanges would fail. Indeed, when asked what
protects young firms from exchange partner opportunism in the
absence of contracts, entrepreneurs often use the word “trust”
(Larson, 1992).

<-----Page 2----->D.A. Smith, F.T. Lohrke / Journal of Business Research 61 (2008) 315–322

3.1. Affective and cognitive trust
In examining a new venture's exchange relationships, Larson
(1992) found that trust centered around two dimensions: one
consisting of a social relations aspect and the other encompassing
an economic aspect. Larson's (1992) findings, thus, correspond
with research that has differentiated trust dimensions according to
whether they are rooted in human emotions or rationality (e.g.,
Luhmann, 1979). Scholars refer to the emotional, or social
relations, side of trust as “affective” (McAllister, 1995), “benevolence” (Mayer et al., 1995), “identification-based” (Lewicki
and Bunker, 1996), or “personal goodwill” trust (Hite, 2005). As
the name implies, affective trust develops when individuals
emotionally invest in relationships, resulting in genuine concern
for a partner's welfare and a belief in the relationship's intrinsic
virtue (McAllister, 1995). As such, affective trust resides at an
interpersonal level (Lewis and Weigert, 1985).
In contrast, researchers often label the rational, or economic,
dimension of trust as “cognitive” (Lewis and Weigert, 1985),
“competence” (Mayer et al., 1995), “knowledge-based” (Lewicki
and Bunker, 1996), or “social” trust (Hite, 2005). Cognitive trust
occurs when a person makes a conscious decision to trust based
upon the best knowledge he or she has (McAllister, 1995). When
relationships are based on cognitive trust, individuals choose to
trust based on evidence of trustworthiness (e.g., everything seems
in proper order or the other party appears to possess required
capabilities; Luhmann, 1979). Thus, cognitive trust tends to be
high when repeated interactions allow parties to come to know,
understand, and predict the routines and processes of the
interaction (Hite, 2005). Similar to affective trust, cognitive
trust can reside at an interpersonal level (e.g., between an
entrepreneur and a banker); however, with repeated interactions, it
can also develop at the institutional (i.e., organizational) level
(e.g., between a new venture and a supplier organization; cf.
Lewis and Weigert, 1985).
The two types of trust are not necessarily independent,
because, for example, a certain amount of affective trust can also
develop from repeated interactions. Neither are they mutually
exclusive, because both are likely present at some level in every
instance of trust (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). Research has shown,
however, that each may be more or less salient in particular stages
of a relationship (Lewicki and Bunker, 1996). We build on these
findings below.
4. Trust in the entrepreneur's network development
Considerable research attention has focused on how entrepreneurs develop their new venture networks over time (see Hoang
and Antoncic, 2003 for a recent review). This research suggests
that network structure and exchange quality change as an
entrepreneur searches for sufficient resources to ensure venture
success (Dubini and Aldrich, 1991; Hite and Hesterly, 2001; Hite,
2005; Larson and Starr, 1993). This network will often vary from
a stable tie of exchange partners, who maintain close social
relationships, to exchanges that take place through loose
collections of individuals, who maintain impersonal and
constantly shifting (e.g., market) exchange ties (Powell, 1990).

317

Such exchanges can vary from being relationally embedded,
strong ties to more arms-length, weak ties (Granovetter, 1973;
Uzzi, 1997). Two particular models of entrepreneurial network
development have provided insights into this process, and, as
such, serve as the basis for our model development.
First, Larson and Starr's (1993) stage network model of
organization formation explains how exchange relationship
transform from a set of relatively simple dyadic exchanges into
a dense set of stable, multidimensional interoganizational
relationships. Certain relationship are selected, added, dropped,
or allowed to evolve while the entrepreneur culls and grows the
range of possible critical resource providers for a new venture
(Larson and Starr, 1993). Specifically, the model details three
stages of entrepreneurial networking activity used to secure
critical economic and non-economic resources: 1) focusing on
essential dyadic ties, 2) converting dyadic ties to socioeconomic
exchanges, and 3) layering the exchange with multiple exchange
processes. Often used as a basis for other network development
research (e.g., Schutjens and Stam, 2003), the model has been
referred to as “the most complete piece of theorizing about
network processes in the entrepreneurial context” (Hoang and
Antoncic, 2003, p. 179).
Second, we draw from the insights provided by Hite's (2003,
2005) studies on the evolutionary process of relationally
embedded network ties in emerging entrepreneurial firms.
Specifically, she posits that entrepreneurial firms evolve
through three phases of relational ties: 1) personal, 2) dyadic
economic interaction, and 3) social.
4.1. Personal and essential dyadic exchanges
As a first step toward building an effective new venture
network, aspiring entrepreneurs evaluate and map their current
network ties (Low and MacMillan, 1988). During this process, the
entrepreneur erects a narrow network of strong ties from
previously established relationships (Steier and Greenwood,
1999). Entrepreneurs may first explore the possibility of starting
their own business within a small circle of close contacts (Greve
and Salaff, 2003), and often turn first to family and friends for
necessary resources (Birley, 1985; Larson, 1992). For example,
Jack (2005) found that as strong ties, family members were
instrumental in helping entrepreneurs recognize potential opportunities and providing continuing support. Even when these
informal network participants are less informed about a new
venture's potential, they are more likely to be accessible and give
advice based on their strong ties with the entrepreneur (Baier,
1986; Steier and Greenwood, 1999). A history of engaging in
social activities and interactions means that the parties involved
are aware of each other's needs and interests (Hite, 2003). In
addition, such ties are more likely to expend effort to ensure that
the entrepreneur sufficiently understands and can put into use
newly acquired knowledge (Krackhardt, 1992). The social support
of these strong ties results mainly from high frequency of contact,
strong emotional intensity, high intimacy, and mutual confiding
associated with the frequent interactions (Granovetter, 1973).
At this early stage of new venture network development, the
entrepreneur has determined who will receive relative degrees

<-----Page 3----->318

D.A. Smith, F.T. Lohrke / Journal of Business Research 61 (2008) 315–322

of trust, based on a history of past dealings inside or outside of a
business setting. As such, the entrepreneur's network has been
culled to consist primarily of strong ties that the entrepreneur
can trust. By their nature, these relationships will be based on
high trust levels and provide more emotional support than
weaker ties (Tsai and Ghoshal, 1998; Levin and Cross, 2004).
The trust that exists in this stage will be primarily based on an
affective aspect, which is typically high in primary group
relations, such as with family and friends (Lewis and Weigert,
1985). Accordingly, we expect that during this first stage, on
average, an entrepreneur will rely more heavily on relationships
based on affective rather than cognitive trust to secure
resources. This suggests the following proposition (see Fig. 1):
Proposition 1. Entrepreneur venture networks in the stage of
forming personal and essential dyadic exchanges will exhibit
greater reliance on relationships based on affective than
cognitive trust.
4.2. Dyadic socioeconomic exchanges
As entrepreneurs continue to cull and grow their respective
networks over time, they often shift from depending on ties
based primarily on affective or social support, and begin to use
their limited exchange relationships as vehicles for new venture
growth (Birley, 1985). Incorporating social exchange theory
(Homans, 1958), a type of “social contracting” develops
whereby the entrepreneur implicitly trades needed resources
for social commitments, usually in the form of favors and
obligations (Starr and MacMillan, 1990). The relationship, thus,
involves increasingly interweaving social and business
exchanges as the parties build, test, and refine a complex social
and economic contract seeking mutual economic advantage
(Larson and Starr, 1993). Once economic interaction is
established, the dyadic interactions of the ties will increase
over time, facilitating additional interaction, which, in turn, will
result in increased interaction ease and quality (Hite, 2005).
In addition to the changing interaction content and quality
among preexisting ties, a network structure that can most

effectively provide critical resources to the new venture may
also evolve. As the entrepreneur's primary group of family and
friends gains more knowledge about the new venture, and as the
entrepreneur proactively expands his or her network, an
increasing number of secondary group ties (e.g., bankers,
lawyers, and accountants) may enter the venture network. Thus,
network structure will often evolve to include an increasing
number of weak ties that are more arms-length or market-like
than socially embedded (Larson and Starr, 1993; Hite, 2003,
2005.) These weak ties benefit the entrepreneur because they
are more likely than strong ties to provide nonredundant
information, such as the most effective means for economic
support and market outlets (Brüderl and Preisendorfer, 1998;
Burt, 1992; Granovetter, 1973).
Increasing familiarity between network ties in this stage of
network development will also increasingly breed trust (Gulati,
1995), assuming exchange partners refrain from activities that
abuse trust. At this stage, however, trust is more likely to be
primarily cognitive in nature, which develops as partner competency becomes known and exchange relationships crystallize
(Hite, 2005). This trust will reduce the uncertainty that
repayment will take place in the future, paving the way for
exchanges to move from arms-length relations to close collaborative exchanges (Larson, 1992), facilitating the acquisition of
critical resources needed for the new venture. Previous research
has found that these exchanges built on cognitive trust will also
develop some affective component based on continuing positive
interactions (McAllister, 1995; Hite, 2005), which when
combined with previous affect-based trust relationships from
the first stage, suggests the following proposition:
Proposition 2. Entrepreneur venture networks in the stage of
dyadic socioeconomic exchanges will exhibit similar reliance
on relationships based on cognitive and affective trust.
4.3. Organizational exchanges
Additional transformation in exchange relationships takes
place as the venture moves from emergence to early growth.

Fig. 1. A stage model of cognitive and affective trust within entrepreneurial venture networks.

<-----Page 4----->D.A. Smith, F.T. Lohrke / Journal of Business Research 61 (2008) 315–322

Ties between the entrepreneur and the set of essential firm
relationships are less likely to be solely interpersonal, and the
exchange processes are no longer necessarily attached to
particular individuals, but rather based on repeated institutional
level exchange cycles between organizations seeking economic
gain (Katz and Gartner, 1988). These ties will support the new
venture's activity by becoming resource suppliers, business
generators, market expanders, and reputation enhancers (Jack,
2005). In addition, the proportion of socially based ties within
the network may decrease as the entrepreneur continues to seek
social capital needed to increase the new venture's likelihood of
success (Hite, 2003, 2005; Hite and Hesterly, 2001; Larson and
Star, 1993). Therefore, the network's structure should consist of
an even higher number of weak, rather than strong, ties.
Empirical support for this transition is provided by research
examining the evolution of young firm networks which found
that upstream (e.g., suppliers) contacts shifted from a social to
economic basis over time (Schutjens and Stam, 2003).
In this stage, the formal organization created from the new
venture, rather than the individual entrepreneur, per se, starts
to specify and form the boundaries for trust relationships with
critical resource providers (Baier, 1986). Cognitive trust
further develops as the network structure evolves to include
more weak ties, whose history of arms-length transactions
increases the knowledge of the parties' competencies and
provides evidence of trustworthiness. As a result, the entrepreneur will rely less on relationships based on affective trust
as the structure of the exchange dyads shifts in emphasis
from personal, strong ties to more organizational, weak ties.
It is worth noting, however, that these organizational exchanges still exist within a social context, lending to the
notion that an affective element of trust is still a necessary
condition (Lewis and Weigert, 1985). This suggests the following proposition:

319

Proposition 3. Entrepreneur venture networks in the stage of
organizational exchanges will exhibit greater reliance on
relationships based on cognitive than affective trust.
4.4. An illustrative example
As noted, we focus in the present paper on average trust
levels across all an entrepreneur's network within a particular
stage. The following example highlights this focus by employing two potential resource providers, an entrepreneur's fellow
MBA classmate and banker, representing an informal and
formal network contact, respectively (Birley, 1985). Although
the example is based on hypothetical values that require
empirical validation, it illustrates, based on the present model,
how different trust dimensions should vary in importance
during the entrepreneurial network development process (see
Fig. 2).
As shown in the figure, we posit that during a venture's
initial formation, an entrepreneur will rely more heavily on the
preexisting strong ties, and the resulting high affective trust,
with a classmate to gain resources than from weaker ties, such
as with a banker. The former would be more likely to provide
critical inputs (e.g., start-up capital) on favorable terms at this
stage whereas a banker would be less or even unwilling to do so
based on the venture's limited track record. Next, the entrepreneur's social capital increases through the second stage as
the venture demonstrates reliable behavior over time and initial
contacts between the banker and the entrepreneur become
repeated interactions allowing weak ties to come to know,
understand, and predict interaction routines and processes. As a
result, the banker should begin to develop cognitive trust in the
entrepreneur, and, in turn, be more likely to provide critical
resources to supplement those derived from an entrepreneur's
affective-based relationship with a classmate. By the third stage,

<-----Page 5----->320

D.A. Smith, F.T. Lohrke / Journal of Business Research 61 (2008) 315–322

repeated, arms-length transactions become the norm and the
liability of newness declines as the banker develops increasing
cognitive trust in the venture.
5. Model implications
Entrepreneurship research, in general, investigates the intersection of the individual entrepreneur and an entrepreneurial
opportunity (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). In examining how
trust facilitates this process, we employ a contemporary view of
trust, which assumes that individual actors can take an active role
in developing trust, rather than a more traditional view, which
implicitly assumes that trust develops as a more passive outcome
resulting from on-going interactions between partners (Williams,
2007). This deliberate action view also coincides with the
dominant view in entrepreneurship research characterizing the
entrepreneur as exercising strategic choice in many aspects of new
venture formation (Lumpkin and Dess, 1996).
As noted, like social capital, trust can both enable and
facilitate exchange relationships. In this sense, it is the “grease”
that starts the wheels rolling and keeps them moving. Viewed
thusly, our model has several important implications, especially
if one subscribes to the notion that “good” entrepreneurs proactively develop their exchange relationships so as to acquire
social capital and overcome liability of newness issues. Practical implications also exist for resource providers forming
exchange relationships with entrepreneurs.
First, given the nature of entrepreneurial endeavors, our model
posits that entrepreneurs will initially depend on higher affective
trust levels with exchange partners than might be necessary in an
established organization. However, as they develop their venture
network over time to a point characteristic of organizational
exchange, they should rely less on relationships rooted in affective
trust and begin relying more on ones based on cognitive trust.
Indeed, those who hang on to relationships based primarily on the
former might actually stifle both their network development and
creation of much needed social capital. Thus, the entrepreneurs
who can best develop and proactively build cognitive trust with
critical resource providers should have a higher success rate and
more quickly overcome any liability of newness issues.
Second, although affective and cognitive trust are somewhat
interconnected, different ways exist to build each type of trust.
For example, affective trust stems from an entrepreneur forming
emotional bonds that require genuine care and concern for
exchange partners' welfare and a belief in a relationship's
intrinsic virtues. Thus, understandably, based on these prerequisites, one can suggest that a concerted effort to build
affective trust would be difficult, to say the least. In contrast,
cognitive trust requires that the entrepreneur make a conscious
decision to trust based upon the best knowledge he or she has. In
this case, the entrepreneur can choose to trust based on evidence
of trustworthiness, such as whether he or she can rely on the
other party's capabilities. Therefore, the entrepreneur who can
best develop and build cognitive trust with critical resource
providers is one who makes a conscience effort to trust, acquires
knowledge about the exchange partner, and actively engages in
exchange relationships.

Third, resource providers vying even for arms-length exchange relationships with entrepreneurs early in the new
venture networking process will benefit from ensuring their
economic transactions are considered fair and equitable,
especially considering that cognitive based trust may be susceptible to break downs or repeated abuses when expectations
of avaricious actions result in distrust (Uzzi, 1999). By doing
so, resource providers can lay the foundation for the cognitive
trust that will enable and facilitate continued economic
exchange. These same resource providers should be aware,
however, that affective trust is a necessary criterion for
economic exchange, especially in the early stages of the
entrepreneur's network development (Larson, 1992). Although building affective trust will be a difficult task, resource
providers may benefit from recognizing and utilizing individuals that already maintain close ties with the entrepreneur,
such as family and friends. For instance, the banker in the
illustrative example might find it beneficial to communicate
his or her value to the MBA classmate, who already has a
relationship based on affective trust with the entrepreneur. This
line of thinking coincides with previous research suggesting
that the majority of ties enter the entrepreneur's network based
on personal relationships (Hite, 2005; Hite and Hesterly,
2001). Taken together, our model reaffirms the notion that the
entrepreneur and those that engage in exchanges with the
entrepreneur must recognize trust as a social asset (Starr and
MacMillan, 1990).
6. Limitations
Although our model incorporates trust issues into network
research, two possible limitations should be noted. First, the
evolution of affective and cognitive trust during the entrepreneur's network development is likely to be recursive, rather than
linear as our model suggests. That is, the structural changes in
ties as the process progresses will create varying reliance on
relationships based on affective and cognitive trust relationships. As noted in previous trust research, however, it is often
useful to employ a linear approximation of the process when
initially deriving research propositions (Boersma et al., 2003).
Discovering the exact recursive or interactive nature of trust and
new venture network development will require empirical
studies employing longitudinal research designs given that
extant research suggests that this process may evolve over
months or even years (Steier and Greenwood, 1999).
Second, in our particular context of new venture network
development, the strength and type of network ties reflect a
structural and relational variable of interest, respectively. By
only paying attention to these variables, however, we implicitly
downplay other network characteristics (e.g., centrality) that
could interact with trust, and, thus, affect the entrepreneur's
ability to generate social capital and overcome liability of
newness issues. We view incorporating these latter characteristics as a significant opportunity for future research attempting
to understand the interactive role that trust plays in the
entrepreneur's new venture network. We discuss other potential
future research avenues next.

7. Future research avenues
By incorporating the trust literature into network research, we
have attempted to contribute to entrepreneurship research by
shedding light on what has been consistently identified as a salient
issue but, as yet, has received little theoretical development. The
model and propositions we developed, thus, can serve to guide
future empirical investigations into the critical role trust plays in
an entrepreneur's network development process.
Beyond its general insights for entrepreneurship research,
the model also suggests at least three future research avenues.
First, one overriding theme in developing our model involved
how entrepreneurs overcome a lack of trust, and, in turn, a new
venture's liability of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965). One extension to our general discussion could be to investigate how this
liability, and, thus, the need for both cognitive and affective
trust, may vary across different contexts. For example,
Gounaris (2005) studied how firms targeting businesses rather
than consumers as their primary customers (B2B versus B2C
firms) built trusting relationships through mechanisms such as
service quality. In addition, Morse et al. (2007) posited that new
ventures employing e-commerce may be able to build potential
resource providers' trust by virtually embedding themselves in
critical on-line networks. Thus, these and other contexts may
provide fruitful avenues for investigating the current model's
propositions.
Second, we model trust building as a complete process with
the importance of cognitive and affective trust varying over
time. One intriguing research question would be what happens
to external resource provider s' trust levels in an entrepreneur if
a negative outcome (e.g., venture bankruptcy) interrupts the
process, particularly if it is the entrepreneur's first attempt at
new venture formation. Extant trust research suggests that the
circumstances surrounding the interruption could critically
impact current and future trust in the entrepreneur. For example,
if the negative outcome resulted from factors largely outside
(e.g., economic recession or adverse legislation) rather than
those within (e.g., an entrepreneur's deliberate action or
incompetence) an entrepreneur's control, we posit that external
resource providers would be more forgiving, which, in turn,
should reduce the deleterious impact the event has on their trust
in the entrepreneur (cf. Williams, 2007).
Third, extant trust research informs us that individuals may
vary in their initial disposition to trust in new relationships
(McKnight et al., 1998); thus, the starting point of an
entrepreneur's trust towards resource providers may vary. Having
a high general disposition to trust, however, could actually
produce some negative effects. For example, Yli-Renko et al.
(2001) found that relationship quality, as characterized by levels
of trust, was negatively related to knowledge acquisition. In such
cases, the relationship between the entrepreneur and resource
providers may suffer from “overembeddeddness” when concentrated exchanges with only a few network partners result in
redundant information and decreased social capital (Uzzi, 1997).
This issue of “overtrust” suggests that some distrust may be
functional in complex economic exchanges in that it dictates a
course of action based on suspicion, monitoring, and activation of

321

safeguards (Barber, 1983). Specifically, excessively high levels of
trust may act to stifle effective economic action if the social aspect
of exchange supersedes the economic action (Zahra et al., 2006).
Future research, thus, should investigate at what levels too much
trust hinders the development of new venture networks and the
creation of social capital, and if these levels differ depending on
affective versus cognitive based trust (cf. Goel and Karri, 2006).
8. Conclusion
The study of entrepreneurial networks has emerged as an
important area of inquiry within the conceptual domain of
entrepreneurship. A majority of network-based research has noted
the importance of both social and economic contexts of the new
venture creation process, and within these contexts, trust has been
consistently identified as an essential component to this process.
Despite its intrinsic importance, little research, to date, has
directly examined the role of trust in the entrepreneurial network
development process. To provide insights into this process, we
presented a model illustrating how the reliance of both affective
and cognitive trust varies as the entrepreneur moves through the
network development process. We have also suggested various
future research avenues that we hope will lead to a better
understanding of the role trust plays in an entrepreneur's network
development process.
