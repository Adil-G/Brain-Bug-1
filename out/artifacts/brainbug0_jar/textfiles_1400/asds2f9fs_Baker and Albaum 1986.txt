Modeling New Product Screening Decisions
Kenneth G. Baker and Gerald S. Albaum

A varie5 of systematic procedures have been proposed to manage the tusk of evaluuting potentiul new
products at various stages of the development process. Kenneth Buker und Gerald Albaum have
chosen to contrast theperformunce ofseveral diflerent types of screening models using the actual evuluutions of86 new product managers employed by 74
Fortune 500 compunies. Managers were briefed on
six lighting products uctuully developed by another
munnfucturer, and they evuluuted all six products
using 33 criteria. The screening models were used to
predict the success orfuilure of each of the product
concepts, and these predictions were compured to
the uctuul results experienced by the original munufacturer. Thus, the study provides insights on the
accuracy of screening models.

Introduction
Product innovation is a necessary part of business because even successful products ultimately progress
through the various stages of their product life cycle
and must be abandoned, replaced, or at least, reformulated. Other reasons that new products might be needed
are to gain a competitive advantage, to take advantage
of new technology, to more closely match consumer
demands, and to respond to newly identified market
opportunities. It seems clear that there is a continual
need for new products as they are the life blood of most,
if not all, business firms.
Due to costs associated with making an error, a company must ferret out potential new products and judge
their potential viability. Every new product idea should
be screened on some rational basis to minimize the
possibility of entering the marketplace with a product
that will not be successful, and at the same time, not
overlook an idea that might become a profitable product. The estimates of new product failure rates, which
have been reported in at least one instance to be higher
than 90% [4 I] would seem to suggest that this screening activity has not been performed as effectively as it
might be. There is some evidence, however, that the
failure rate for new products actually introduced into
the marketplace is much lower. For example, results
from a study by the Conference Board of 148 medium
and large-sized manufacturers,
which had launched
major new products during the previous 5-year period,
were that the typical failure rate for the major new
products was about one-in-three (231. A successful
product was defined as one that was put on the market
and which met management’s original expectations in
all important aspects. Additional studies are also more
optimistic [ 3,l 11.

The aggregate cost to society of product failure is
high. Moreover, the very survival of an individual business might hinge on the performance of a new product
in the marketplace. Obviously, the risk of introducing
new products or not introducing new products is high.
Any reduction in the failure rates would be beneficial,
and any method of improved early detection of potential failures and successes should be of interest to marketing managers.
In view of the increasing costs at each succeeding
stage in the new product development process, it would
seem prudent to screen out questionable product ideas
at the earliest stage possible. Because the first stage, the
ldea Generation stage, is really nothing more than a
“mining” operation [I], the earliest point to undertake
formal new product screening is the Idea Evaluation
stage.
This paper reports on a study that evaluated alternative types and structures of decision models which
can be used for screening potential new products. In
particular, the conjunctive, disjunctive, lexicographic,
and linear compensatory approaches are considered.
The context of evaluating new product ideas is where
an individual(s) is presented with many new product
ideas and must decide, usually without much information, quickly, inexpensively, and efficiently, if any of
the ideas have any merit. The philosophy of evaluating
new product ideas might be viewed as being similar to a
legal contest where all parties (new product ideas) are
considered innocent until proven guilty beyond a level
of reasonable doubt. Thus, these models were evaluated on the premise that all new product ideas should be
viewed as good or successful ideas unless it can be
demonstrated that they are not. Guilt or failure of a new
product would be based on gathered information that

33

indicates that the product is guilty (a failure) and should
be executed by not considering it any further. One additional assumption is that it is likely that one will have to
review a large number of new product ideas in order to
find a few good ones. Consequently, at the Idea Evaluation stage, emphasis in screening should be placed on
maximizing identifying products that will be WWCcessful. The rationale for this approach is that it is easier
to try to prove guilt (failure) than it is to prove innocence (success). It is obvious that no screening process
will catch all “guilty” products and that those ideas
that pass into the next and subsequent stages will be
subject to additional “trials” with the objective of
proving the product guilty. If the product cannot be
proven guilty during any stage, ultimately it will be
introduced into the marketplace, assuming it represents
a desirable opportunity for the company. Ideally, the
products that survive this process and later evaluations
will be successful because all those with noncorrectable
flaws have been identified and dropped from consideration. This conservative
approach means that even
though there are other methods, for example, ASSESSOR [34], that might be used after the screening
stage to eliminate failures, the primary focus should be
to identify failures as soon as possible in order to minimize nonproductive investments (sunk costs) as early
as possible and minimize actual loss of resources that
accrue from introducing a product into the market
which should not have been introduced. Because opportunity costs are often difficult to calculate and usually do not have the potential disastrous consequences
that actual money loses have, we believe that it would
be prudent to downplay this consideration. Nonetheless, it is desirable to develop a screening process that
would minimize both types of error costs, but this can
be done only to a point. There will always be some
necessary trade-off between the two error costs, and the
direction of this trade-off will vary with risk handling
preferences of decision makers as well as the extent to
which a company can absorb financial loss.

Screening Models

New product screening decisions are being made every
day, albeit with varying degrees of thoroughness. Even
though there are many approaches to managing and
evaluating new product ideas [6,12,27,31,40],
many

companies rely on an intuitive approach to screening
new products rather than completing a formal analysis.
There have been a number of normative approaches
proposed, which for the most part can be placed into
one of four general categories (251 t :
1. Ranking models that compare one product idea
against others on some specified set of evaluation
criteria-the
highest ranked product is selected

1181.
2. Scoring models use criteria considered critical to a

using these criteria and those that exceed a minimum acceptable score (when summed across all
evaluative criteria) are selected [20].
3. Economic models that are based on deterministic or
probabilistic payoffs, profits, R.O.I., etc.-the
product meeting some desired level is selected [5].
4. Optimization models that are based on selecting
products which maximize some identified mathematical function-linear
and dynamic programming are two approaches (51.
Of the approaches, the ones most widely used by managers are scoring models, usually in the form of a
checklist [8,24]. The checklist approach and scoring
models in general have been characterized as having
important flaws such as assuming raters have more
knowledge than they do, potential inconsistent application of criteria, criteria not independent, and problems
in interpretation of scores [33]. In addition, it has been
suggested that checklist type screening models are extremely insensitive to changes in the values of the variables, including any weights, which comprise a specific model [ 17). Finally, a purported problem is that
screening variables (and their relative weightings) have
not been empirically derived, although there have been
recent attempts to do this for industrial products 19,101.
Despite the problems, the fact that scoring models
are widely used cannot be ignored. Reasons for the high
incidence of use of a scoring model format are that it is
easy to use, easy to understand, and easy to communicate to others. Perhaps the problem is not with the
checkhst or scoring approach itself, but with the way in
which it is used and the data modeled.

‘A similar schema is portfolio models, benefit contribution
financial return models, and market research approaches [2,40].

methods,

The Present Study
The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of
alternative decision models that might be used in new
product screening decisions, in which the data have
been obtained by use of a scoring model. Specifically,
the following models were examined:
1. Conjunctive Model [ 3.51, which involves accepting
or rejecting a product based on passing or not passing all of the evaluative criteria. The product, in
order to pass, would have to meet or exceed a specified minimum value for each of the criteria used.
2. Disjunctive Model [ 7,13- 15)) which is based on
accepting a product that exceeds specified levels on
one or a few key criteria, regardless of its score on
the others.
3. Lexicogruphic Model [ 161, which is based on ranking the evaluation criteria in terms of their perceived
importance. New product ideas are compared criterion by criterion until there is an idea that is superior
to the others on a criterion.
4. Linear Compensatory Model [32,38], which is
based on multiplying a product’s score on a criterion
and the importance weight for each criterion and
then summing across all evaluative criteria. The
product with the highest summated score is selected, or those products with scores above some
cutoff value are selected, for further analysis.
Although there have been several comparative reports in the marketing literature of the effectiveness of
these types of models, in most cases such studies have
been concerned with consumer decision making and
have involved the use of students as research subjects.
Representative of these studies are those by Russ [30],
Wright [42], Pras and Summers [29], Perreault and
Russ [26], Brisoux and Laroche 141, and Grether and
Wilde [ 191.
The one study that has looked at screening new product ideas is that by Freimer and Simon [ 171. This study,
however, was limited to exploring the sensitivity of the
decision to market or not to market, to changes in a
linear compensatory model. The following research
questions were addressed in the present study:
1. Is each type of model equally accurate in ability to
correctly screen out unsuccessful products.
2. Will the level of accuracy of the models change
when a different number of criteria or weighting
schemes/scale values are used?

that was used for the research data collection?

tion [39]. The checklist includes evaluative criteria that
reflect the most important new product dimensions or
considerations presented in the literature and used by
current practitioners in new product decision making
(see Table 1). These criteria are the result of extensive
testing and the use of factor analysis in a somewhat
similar way to that used by Cooper and Brentani [lo].
Each of the 33 criteria is scaled (five-category) in order
to allow those who screen new products (i.e., evaluators) to indicate the extent to which a new product
idea is perceived to possess the attribute. The anchors
on these scales varied according to the nature of the
attribute. The instrument has been used to evaluate
thousands of varied new product ideas.
The product sample used for this study consisted of
six consumer-oriented lighting products.* Even though
these products are not generalizable to other product
categories, the products were considered to be simple
technology and thus would minimize the problem of
qualifying the technical expertise of the study’s participants. They were provided by a manufacturing company that markets its products nationally. The six products were classified into two categories: two products
were successful (i.e., they succeeded in the marketplace by meeting the company’s objectives); four
products were failures (i.e., they did not meet the company’s objectives). The product information that was
provided to the study participants was formatted to reflect the quantity and quality of information that the
company in question would normally make available at
the time a new product was to undergo its first evaluation. The information consisted of graphic representations of the products and about two pages of qualitative
information pertinent to the subject areas covered by
the checklist.
The sample of decision makers evaluating the products was selected on a judgmental basis. It consisted of
individuals who were new product managers, identified by the corporations contacted as the individual(s)
responsible for corporate new product decisions. All
the participating individuals were employed by Fortune
500 companies.
A total of 86 decision makers, representing 76 companies, was chosen. All data were collected by mail.
Every evaluator rated each of the products on the 33
criteria and, in addition, provided importance weights

for the evaluation criteria. Some study participants recognized the products and others considered themselves
not technically competent or not knowledgeable in the
product category. These people did not evaluate some
of the products, which left a total of 396 individual
product evaluations available for analysis. Each individual product evaluation was submitted to each model
type.

Results and Discussion

Analysis of the four types of models was based on
percentages correctly classified for each application,
for each model. Each model was tested 396 times and
the results were calculated on the percentage of correctly classified products, i.e., the product was either
classified as being a failure or not a failure. Obviously,
a high percentage of correctly classified failures and
successes is desirable.

Conjunctive Model

The Conjunctive Model analysis was based on using
several different values for the threshold (i.e., minimum acceptable) score. The values used were two,
three, and four (scale range was l-5). In addition to all
33 evaluative criteria, a lesser number of criteria was
used for the analysis. The following five criteria were
used: functional feasibility,
profitability,
potential
sales, need, and price. These criteria were selected by
the sample members as being the five most important
evaluative criteria, relative to the 33 criteria, that must
be considered when screening new products. Will the
product work? Can enough be sold to make a profit?
Will the product fill a need? Can we sell it at an acceptable price? The results of the analyses are presented in
Table 2. Assuming that the objective is to screen out as
many failures as possible, the most efficient application
is the approach using an attribute value of four ( range
of scale: 1=least amount to 5 =most amount) using 33
criteria. This application, unfortunately, is trivial because it correctly classifies 99.7% of the failures as
failures but correctly classifies 0.0% of the successes as
successes. This is very conservative, but fulfills no
purpose because there are no new products to develop.
The most conservative application is the five critical

criteria with an attribute value of four where 99.4% of
the failures are classified as failures and 2.6% of the
successes are classified as successes. These 2.6% correctly classified successes would continue on to the
next stage where more products would be screened out
as additional information is gathered.
It should be noted that the authors assume a very
high cost for a Type I error and a low cost for a Type II
error. If these cost were changed, then the application
deemed best would also change. For example, if the
cost of missclassifying failures was high and the cost
for missclassifying successes was high, then the best
application would be using a score of two with the 33
criteria where 65.2% of the failures are classified as
failures and 63.6% of the successes are classified as
successes. The remaining 34.8% of the missclassified
failures would hopefully be ferreted out in succeeding
stages.

Disjunctive Model

The Disjunctive Model analysis was based on using a
threshold value of four for the 33 and five evaluative
critical criteria approaches. The attribute value of four
was selected because this is the part of the five-point
scale that implies superiority. Generally, when an evaluation is undertaken which uses a subset of important or
critical evaluative criteria, it is implied that a disjunctive model is being used. In this case, the five
critical criteria would form this subset. This model
would be most useful if one is faced with many alternatives that must be reduced to a more manageable
level quickly and economically. As stated earlier, it is

assumed that many new product ideas will be screened.
This model, even though it will not normally yield a
single alternative, will allow a lesser number to be more
closely evaluated by a different model. Perhaps this
model should be viewed as a coarse screen with a subsequent model being applied as a finer screen model.
The most conservative application employs the five
critical criteria; 58.9% of failures are classified as
failures and 75.3% of the successes are classified as
successes (Table 3).

Model Results

Model

The Lexicographic Model analysis used the 33 criteria
and five critical criteria, which were rank ordered. The
rank ordering of the evaluative criteria was provided by
the sample members. Assuming that each new product
alternative is of equal merit, the alternatives are compared, using the first ranked or most important criterion, to determine if any one of the alternatives is superior to the others. If there is no superior alternative, the
next ranked criterion is used and so on until, hopefully,
only one alternative is left by the time all the ranked
evaluative criteria are considered. If there are more
than one alternative, then these alternatives could be
submitted to a different model for evaluation in order to
reduce the alternatives to only one. The results of the
analysis are shown in Table 4. The most conservative
application is using mean weights with 33 criteria
where 65.8% of the failures are classified as failures
and 79.3% of the successes are classified as successes.

Linear Compensatory Model
The Linear Compensatory Model analysis was based

63.6% of the failures are classified as failures and
72.7% of the successes are classified as successes.

Reliability
A final analysis is estimating the reliability of the measurements. This test is used to determine if the items in
a test, in this case, the evaluation instrument using 33
items (evaluative criteria), are homogeneous or not in
terms of how individuals responded to the items [22].
In order to determine the internal consistency of the
instrument, the most appropriate measurement was coefficient alpha. This approach overcomes the possible
bias of creating a unique split of the items by chance
when a split-half approach is used 1281. A reliability
coefficient summary is presented in Table 6. The results indicate that the utilized scale is reliable and consistent, which means that the instrument appears to be
appropriate for the data gathering and analysis activities. As shown, evaluations of successful products
had the highest internal consistency, followed by product failures.

Conclusions

In reponse to the research questions that underlied this
study, the following conclusions can be reached:
1. The models demonstrated different degrees of accuracy. The most conservative model overall was
the Conjunctive Model using the five critical criteria
with a cutoff value of four.
2. The level of accuracy changes for models with different criteria or weighting scale values. Differences are rather dramatic, especially with the
Conjunctive and Disjunctive Models and less so
with the Lexicographic and the Linear Compensatory models.
3. The measurement scale was shown to have high
internal consistency reliability when used to evaluate different products.
Based on the results of this study, it appears that a
fairly simple model, using a minimum number of evaluative criteria, might be a useful model for new product
decision making at the Idea Evaluation stage. Which
form the model might take could vary with the type of
product involved, and the nature of the company, its
existing product line, market, and goals/objectives.
Although the instrument used for data collection can be
viewed as one in which all criteria generally are applicable across products, such is not the case when a
smaller number of criteria can be modeled as being
critical. Specific criteria will vary in importance across
companies and product types. The most important as-

pect of this study suggests that a great deal of information might not be necessary for evaluating new product
proposals at the Idea Screening stage, (f the critical
criteria

can be identified.

The implications that can be drawn from this study
must be considered in the context of the particular research design used. There were a small number of related products evaluated by a nonprobability sample of
evaluators. In addition, there is no powerful statistical
test for determining the discriminating power of the
various models. This information might be useful but
perhaps misleading because the discriminating power
should be tempered by the cost of errors and the level of
risk acceptable to a company. Consequently, caution
must be exercised in attempting to generalize the results
to other types of products or situations.
Based on this study, there appear to be several important implications for new product decision makers.
One of the more important implications deals with the
cost of introducing new products. Using a model might
reduce the incidence of introducing new products that
will fail in the marketplace. This will, in effect, significantly reduce the overall cost of new product introductions. At the same time, however, emphasis on identifying potential failures might lead to higher opportunity
costs of dropping potential successful products. This
can be overcome by selecting the model and application
that best fits the risk tolerance of the company or decision maker and the cost of Type I and Type II errors.
A related cost savings is that there appears to be no
need for a great deal of information to be gathered in
order to screen out product failures. Collecting information is a costly process and thus the demonstrated
viability of the Conjunctive Model, in this study, indicates that this information gathering cost might be
reduced.
Because it takes many new product ideas to generate
a few viable new products, a simple model would greatly simplify the screening process by allowing many,
perhaps several hundred, new product ideas to be
quickly and inexpensively screened. The Conjunctive
Model, as applied in this study, is an example of how
this might be accomplished.
The use of a model will force the entire new product
decision process to be accomplished in a more systematic fashion. This will likely reduce the possibility of a
‘ ‘product champion’ ’ forcing a poor product through
the innovation process. In addition, the model will provide more objectively based rationale as to why a particular new product idea should not continue through
the premarket phase of the innovation process.

New product decision makers will have to carefully
review their own situation in order to determine which
model might be the most effective in screening out high
potential failures. This will not be a simple process but
the rewards of success will be great.
The authors believe that the next logical step in this
research project would be to develop multistage models
in order to determine if they might provide superior
results. One caveat to this step is that there appears to be
substantial resistance by new product decision makers
to use complex models that are not easily understood or
used.
