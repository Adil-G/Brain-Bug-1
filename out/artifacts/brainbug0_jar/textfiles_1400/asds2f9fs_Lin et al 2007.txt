Abstract
A more precise business failure forecast helps
to provide important judgment principles to
decision-makers. The logistic regression (LR)
model is a common evaluation model employed in
prediction of business failures. Fewer researches
focus on the threshold selection, which will
influence the final predicting performance. Besides,
it is very challenging to discover critical
information from these statements, although
financial statements reflect a certain degree of
firm‚Äôs business activities. However, selecting
predictor variables depends on their linear
searching characteristic, if applying traditional
statistical methods, such as stepwise and etc.
Genetic algorithm (GA) has been shown to be able
to select the variable set with population diversity
and to perform efficient search in large space. In
this paper, we combine both LR and GA to form a
new efficient business failure forecasting
mechanism which maximizes the forecasting
accuracy with minimum critical predictor variable
and optimal threshold. From our experimental
results, this approach effectively helps improving
the forecasting accuracy of traditional LR.

1. Introduction
Business failures means a business has
insolvency with loss to debtors (bank) and no
longer continue to trade until the financial problem
had been solved. The bank will also incur bad debt
crisis when loaner occurs business failures. Large
number of business failures even lead to the
national financial crisis.
Logistic regression model is a common
evaluation model used to measure credit risk.
Westgaard and Wijst [2] use LR to predict default
probabilities of bank credit portfolio. Laitinen and
Laitinen [13] applied the Taylor‚Äôs expansion to
approximate the parameters of LR which unable to
improve the prediction accuracy. Ko and Lin [6]
propose a hybrid evolutionary approach to forecast
financial distress which allows extracting the

critical financial variables. However, fewer
researches are interested in the optimization the
threshold of the LR model. The trial and error or
0.5 are commonly used approaches to determine
threshold.
Determining suitable predictor variables set
for logistic regression (LR) is another one of
critical task. Most of the traditional extracting
methodologies use linear approach essentially,
such as stepwise method [12], factor analysis [11]
and etc., to select predictor variables. Both
variables and threshold selection would influence
the forecast accuracy of the evaluation model
[2][3][4][5][6].
GA introduced by Holland in 1975[14], is a
well-known efficient search method in large space.
It‚Äôs proven to be suitable for feature selection
problems in past studies [15][16][17]. We
therefore combine the advantages of both logistic
regression and genetic algorithm to establish a new
efficient forecasting mechanism which maximizes
the forecasting accuracy based on the optimized
threshold.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
Our proposed approach and the functionalities of
each process are introduced in Section 2. The
experiments are implemented and proposed in
Section 3. We also compare the acquired results
with other methodology. Finally, conclusions are
made to our approach about business failure
forecast.

2. Threshold Logistic Regression model
In this article, an efficient Threshold Logistic
Regression (TLR) model with nonlinear searching
capability introduced by GA shown in Figure 1 is
proposed to predict more accurate business failure.
All of the predictor variables and optimized
threshold would be encoded into a chromosome
(individuals) in the TLR model. Each individual in
the newer population will be decoded and fed to
logistic regression model to evaluate its forecast
accuracy, which is denoted as the fitness value.

Each individual is encoded into 35 bits string

represent the presence (1) or absence (0) of the
corresponding financial ratio (xi), such as ROA(C),
employee fee, and etc., as illustrated in Table 1.
Let X={ x1, x2, ‚Ä¶, x25,}. The remaining 10 bits (bi,

2.2 Logistic Regression Model
The selected predictor variables set XÃÇ ={ xÃÇ1 ,
xÃÇ2 ,‚Ä¶ , xÃÇm } in each chromosome are extracted from
original X, whose bi=1. Let v={v1, v2, ‚Ä¶, vm}
denote the values of corresponding financial ratios
in XÃÇ . Assume the relation of yi* and vi is a
linear combination shown as below, where yi*
and Hi refer to the predicted output and error item
for i-th sample, respectively.

Finally, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(MLE) is used to estimate the parameters (E0,
E1, ‚Ä¶, Em) of logistic regression model.

To manifest the superiority of our approach,
we compare our results with Logistic Regression
based on the Stepwise method (LRS). The
forecasting accuracy of one quarter before failure
in the testing set is shown in Table 4. It is worth
noting that using TLR model to select the critical
financial ratios and optimize its threshold will
produce better forecasting accuracies than using
traditional LRS model. The number of wrong
prediction ≥ ”ß (ratio) of TLR and LRS are 16
(19.75 %) and 18 (20.99%), and the accuracy ratio
of TLR and LRS are 80.25% and 77.78%,
respectively.

There are 243 companies are selected to be
our analysis targets after eliminating some samples
without sufficient effective financial values since
1998 as shown in Table 2. These selected
companies are further divided into a
failures/non-failures set and training/testing set.
The ratio of failures to non-failures is near to 3:1
[1]. The detailed financial data of each company
are from Taiwan Economic Journal Data Bank
(TEJ). The parameters of GA are illustrated in
Table 3. To emphasize the capability of integrating
logistic regression, MLE and GA functions in our
implementations, all of the simulation programs
are written in Java programming language.

4. Conclusion
The more important to forecasting of business
failures is induced by the global economic
environment radical changing. It would provide
much more superior forecasting performance to
integrate the computational intelligence techniques
and conventional statistical methods. The
evolutionary algorithms especially provide
efficient optimization in the problem domain with
a non-linear searching capability. In this article, we
introduce a business failure forecasting approach
(TLR), which extracts efficient critical financial
ratio set and optimizes threshold for logistic

<-----Page 3----->regression based on genetic algorithm. Fewer
researches focus on the threshold selection of
logistic regression in the past. In our experiments,
optimizing the threshold will influence the final
predicting performance. In addition, it is
inconvenient for decision makers if considering
too many financial ratios simultaneously. Our
proposed TLR model effectively extracts minimal
critical financial ratios set and achieves better
forecasting accuracy than using conventional
statistical techniques ‚Äì the integration of Stepwise
and logistic regression.
