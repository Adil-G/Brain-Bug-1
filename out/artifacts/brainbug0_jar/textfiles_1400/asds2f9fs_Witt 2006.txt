Abstract From a theoretical perspective, staged financing of start-ups mainly
serves to reduce agency risks for investors dealing with founders. This risk
reduction is partly offset by the transaction costs caused by staged financing.
From the perspective of founders, staging can reduce the cost of equity, but it
also increases the share of external company and market risks they have to bear.
Our empirical study of a sample of German start-ups confirms the importance
of transaction costs and shifting external risk for staging decisions, but does not
support agency theoretical explanations of staged financing.

1 Forms and effects of staged financing: A survey of the existing literature
The terms and conditions of venture capital financing of start-ups have long
been a subject of academic studies in the U.S. (Sapienza 1989; Sahlmann 1990;
Bygrave and Timmons 1992; Sapienza and Gupta 1994) as well as in German
speaking countries (Albach 1983; Zemke 1995; Wupperfeld 1996; Schefczyk and
Gerpott 1998; Bascha and Walz 2002; Brettel 2002; Welpe 2004; Reißig-Thust

2003; Schefczyk 2004; Fingerle 2005). The term “staged financing” describes a
transaction in which outside investors provide in several installments the total
amount of external equity financing that a start-up needs to cover investments
and initial losses (Gompers 1995; Kaplan and Strömberg 2003). These outside
investors could be business angels, venture capitalists, corporate venture capital
firms, or large companies.
Typically, the management team of the start-up consists of the founders owning larger equity stakes in the company themselves. In this paper, we will only
investigate venture capital financing. Rather than paying out all the money
upfront, venture capitalists frequently agree with the management team of the
company on several payments over a certain time period, i.e., staged financing.
The staging of the total payment can take two different forms. The first form,
which is called “staggering” or “staging of payments per financing round”, refers
to the staggered provision of funds which have been agreed on in a single round
or contract of equity financing. The term “financing round” refers to a bundle
of contractual clauses that set the conditions for the provision of an equity
investment by a venture capital firm in a company. The second form, which is
called “staging”, indicates the existence of multiple rounds of start-up financing.
While payments per round could be paid out immediately and completely, the
venture capital firm provides the total amount of external equity in multiple
rounds, i.e., sequences of newly negotiated financing contracts. In a new round
of financing, both parties set separate, not previously fixed conditions for the
equity investment.
The basic idea behind staggering is to tie further payments of an equity
investment to milestones that the start-up has to reach before the venture
capitalist pays out the next installment (Block and Macmillan 1985, p 184).
Such milestones can be sales targets, stages of new product development, the
acquisition of customers, or the completion of the entrepreneurial team. A
similar mechanism works with staging. On the one hand, staging gives a venture capital firm real options. If a start-up fails to reach one or several of the
milestones that were agreed upon in the financing contract, the venture capitalist is entitled not to engage in another round of financing or to offer the
next round at less favorable terms for the start-up (larger equity stake per
Euro invested). On the other hand, if the start-up reaches the contractually
set milestones, it is not automatically entitled to a new round. Rather, the
milestones set a basis for the negotiations of terms and conditions of the next
round of financing, especially regarding the equity stakes that the founders
hand over to the venture capital firm in exchange for financial investments
in their company. In the empirical part of this paper, we will show descriptive evidence on both phenomena, staggering and staging. In the hypotheses to be tested, we will only investigate staging; i.e., the variable to measure
the extent of staged financing will then always be the number of financing
rounds.
So far, academic research on staged financing of start-ups has led to many
theoretical models but only few large-scale, multivariate empirical studies.

In one of those studies, Reißig-Thust (2003) investigated the investment controlling instruments and processes of 49 German venture capital firms. The
study was conducted in 2002. The author perceives staging as one possible controlling instrument for outside equity investors. Interestingly, only 42.1% of
all venture capitalists who took part in the survey actively used staged financing in their investment contracts, while almost all respondents said that staging was a good instrument to reduce agency problems and set performance
incentives for founder-managers in start-ups.
In the U.S., three studies with large samples and multivariate statistical analysis have been published so far. Gompers (1995) used data of the Venture Economics database. This database comprises 4,000 companies and is run by the
US National Venture Capital Association in collaboration with Venture Economics. The author analyzed a sample of 794 companies that received equity
investments from venture capital firms in 2,134 rounds of financing between
1961 and 1992. He investigated the relation between agency risks and staging.
The study used the age of the start-up as a proxy for information asymmetries and thus agency risks. The ratio of intangible to tangible assets served
as another proxy for agency risks, i.e., the extent to which a venture capital
firm can recoup its investments in a start-up in the case of failure. The study
found that the start-ups’ age indeed positively correlates with the volume of the
financing rounds. The extent of staging decreased with the perceived agency
costs. Similarly, the magnitude of potential revenues from liquidation had a
significant positive influence on the volume per financing round.
Shepherd and Zacharakis (2002) also investigated which factors determine
the volume of a financing round. For their empirical study, the authors also
made use of the Venture Economics database. The sample of Shepherd and
Zacharakis (2002) includes 9,214 rounds of financing. The authors use the number of earlier rounds to estimate agency risks – in this case the degree of trust
that has developed between the founders of the start-up and the outside equity
investors. Trust is assumed to reduce the agency costs of the financing contracts.
The results of the empirical analysis show that trust can indeed reduce costs; i.e.,
the volume of financing rounds increased with the number of financing rounds
that had been completed by the same partners earlier.
Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) empirically studied 213 investments of venture
capital firms in 119 start-ups in the U.S. Their focus is on the relation between
staging and other instruments to protect investors. The authors asked 14 venture
capital firms about the contractual details of their equity investments in startups. In particular, the study aimed to find out if and how contractual clauses
change in the process of proceeding from one round of financing to the next
one. Empirically, the authors can show that the investors’ control rights (e.g.,
board seats and information rights) significantly increase with their equity stake
in the portfolio company over the different financing rounds. At the same time,
the number of additional rights that mainly serve to protect the venture capital
firm from agency risks and external company risks (e.g., liquidation preferences,
exit clauses or veto rights for new investors) decreases.

2 Theoretical explanations for staged financing and formulation of hypotheses
2.1 Theories on sharing and shifting external risks
In each and every start-up financing transaction, venture capitalists have to
bear external risks, i.e., influences that originate from outside the firm and thus
cannot be reduced or fully eliminated either by the founders or by the investors. We will call them external company risks. Examples of such risks are the
non-approval of innovative products by official authorities like the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), the introduction of more efficient substitution technologies to the market by competitors, or macroeconomic recessions
leading to shrinking demand on many markets. All these influences are external in the sense that the company cannot control them. Staggering and staging
can both help venture capital firms to shift the external company risks, at least
partly, back to the founders of the start-up who typically also own part of their
company’s equity. By agreeing on multiple rounds of financing or by staggering,
venture capital firms can avoid fully bearing the individual company risks. They
get the opportunity to terminate investments in companies that are adversely
affected by external influences.
By staging the financing transaction, the venture capitalist can postpone the
decision as to which company should get most money. The value of the shares
it receives increases with the degree of staging. At the same time, the price to
be paid per share also rises. Therefore, the main effect is a reduction in risk.
The larger the perceived external company risks, the more staged financing
can improve the overall risk position of the venture capitalist. In case of a
successful development of the firm, a venture capital firm will ask for smaller
portions of the start-up’s equity in exchange for a certain amount of financing.
In case of a less successful development, the venture capitalist either terminates
the investment or pays less per share. In terms of option theory, the venture
capitalist receives a real option to abandon, i.e., the opportunity to invest only
in those start-ups that have been successful in earlier rounds of financing, and
a real option to shrink, i.e., to pay less money for a given investment. The
flexibility of these real options has a positive value that increases with the magnitude and the likelihood of external company risks (Kulatilaka and Trigeorgis
1994).
For the founders of a start-up, staged financing can also be beneficial. As it
reduces the amount of external company risks that are shifted to the venture
capital firm (or, from another perspective, increases the amount of external
company risks that the venture capital firm can shift back to the founders),
staging reduces the cost of equity. External company risks decrease over time,
some of them resolve completely. Equity financing by venture capital is less
expensive if founders raise it in the later stages of the development process of
the start-up because the risk premium that venture capitalists charge becomes
smaller. Brachtendorf and Witt (2004) have suggested a related inventory model
of venture capital financing.

2.2 Principal agent theories
In the literature on entrepreneurial finance in general and staged financing
in particular, applications of principal agent theory are common (see Admati
and Pfleiderer 1994; Hellmann 1994; Bergemann and Hege 1998; Neher 1999;
Cornelli and Yosha 2003). While there are other theories that can be applied
to staging, like the theories on sharing and shifting external risks as well as
transaction cost theories that we shall further explore in this paper, the major
reason for the prominence of principal agent type explanations for staging is the
obvious existence of information asymmetries and conflicts of interest between
the parties.
Both factors are the main building blocks for agency constellations. The venture capitalist is the principal who looks for protection against two types of
problems. A qualification risk refers to the risk of investing in the wrong teams
and companies. It occurs whenever the venture capitalist responds to an uncertainty about the qualification of the agent, i.e., the founders of the start-up that
the venture capital firm invests its money in, by offering low financial investments per share, thus systematically attracting less qualified teams. A behavioral
risk depicts the risk to suffer from losses due to opportunistic behavior by the
agent (Sapienza and Gupta 1994). Behavioral risks can occur because the venture capitalist cannot observe the actions of the founders when they run the
business. These actions cannot be inferred from the economic development of
the venture either, because this development is largely dependent on external
influences (Reißig-Thust 2003, pp 66–68; Welpe 2004, pp 64–65; Fingerle 2005,
105). So the risk of the venture capital firm is twofold. The founders could
either be less qualified to run the company and create value than the venture
capitalist expects (qualification risk) or they could pursue interests that deviate
from those of the venture capitalist, i.e., behave opportunistically (behavioral
risk).
Agency problems increase the risk premium that venture capital firms demand when they finance start-ups. In the field of entrepreneurial finance, a
multitude of behavioral risks exist (Bascha and Walz 2002, p 7). Real examples of opportunistic behavior by founders reducing the wealth position of
venture capitalists are technologically driven preferences to continue work on
economically worthless projects (Admati and Pfleiderer 1994; Hellmann 1994;
Bergemann and Hege 1998), the renegotiation of financing contracts with the
threat to exit from the management team in the start-up (Neher 1999), high
administrative costs for the founders’ perquisites (Bergemann and Hege 1998;
Reißig-Thust 2003, p 66), and the utilization of the start-up by founders to
build up management experience that they can later use to gain higher salaries
as employees after their start-up failed (Franck and Opitz 2001; Cornelli and
Yosha 2003).
To limit behavioral risks, venture capital firms typically demand information
and control rights. Examples are conversion rights for shares, veto rights for
investment decisions, covenants, and board seats (Hellmann 1998, p 54; Sapienza and Gupta 1994, pp 1620–1622; Fingerle 2005, pp 110–126). Venture capital

<-----Page 5----->190

P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf

firms may also give the founders additional financial incentives to align the
interests. From a theoretical perspective, staged financing is especially effective
in limiting opportunistic behavior by the founders of the start-up. If such behavior becomes visible or if the start-up misses milestones, the venture capitalist
can stop financing the company. This is a serious threat to the founders because
a failure to secure the next round of financing with existing investors frequently
leads to the liquidation of the start-up. Staging also mitigates potential holdup problems, i.e., founders threatening to leave the company and take all the
human capital with them. As the inalienable human capital of the founders
becomes alienable over time, i.e., gets more and more embodied into the startup’s physical assets, staging reduces the potential payoff of a hold-up strategy
for the founders (Fingerle 2005, p 125).
Qualification risks occur when venture capital firms finance start-ups that are
run by insufficiently qualified management teams. Despite personal discussions
with the founders and due diligence procedures, outside investors can never
perfectly screen the managerial expertise and the technology experience of the
founding team ex ante. As the founders of the start-up cannot cure their personal qualification deficits themselves, at least not in the short run, monitoring
instruments and incentive mechanisms are not feasible. One obvious thing the
venture capitalist can do is to use its board representation to replace unqualified
founder-managers by newly hired external managers, if possible. In a similar
way, staged financing can reduce the adverse effects of qualification risks for
the venture capitalist. If these deficits are the cause for the start-up missing
milestones, the venture capital firm can terminate all financing activities in the
respective firm, thus limiting its financial loss. Alternatively, it can improve the
conditions of the investment in a next round of financing for itself. Improved
conditions, typically a larger equity share for a given amount of financing, are
only helpful for the venture capitalist if the entrepreneurial team is qualified
enough to ensure the survival of the start-up and realize at least some increases
in the value of the shares.

2.3 Transaction cost theories
The process of financing a start-up with equity from a venture capital firm is
costly. In addition to the direct cost of equity, which corresponds to the number
of shares that the original owners of the firm give away to the venture capital
firm in exchange for new financial means, the process causes transaction costs.
Typical categories of transaction costs are search costs, preparation costs, negotiation costs, costs of obtaining legally binding agreements, control costs, and
adaptation costs. Transaction costs are not only relevant in theoretical models.
The process of preparing and finalizing equity investment transactions absorbs
financial resources as well as the time and effort of both the venture capital
firm and the start-up. As this process has to take place for each round of financing, staging produces higher transaction costs than equity investments in one
installment with just one contract.

<-----Page 6----->Staged financing of start-ups

191

There is a multitude of transaction costs for both the founders and the venture capitalist. Founders incur search costs to find a suitable venture capitalist
willing to finance the company and perhaps also willing to give advice and support to the management team. Search costs largely vary in practice, depending
on the type of venture capital firm (Reißig-Thust 2003, pp 66–70), the personal
networks of the founders (Witt 2004), and the start-up’s reputation. Costs for
the preparation of the financing transaction on the side of the start-up originate
from the writing, the sending, and the presentation of the business plan. Some
of the founders’ transaction costs are cash expenses, for example, for traveling
and meetings, for the services of lawyers and attorneys, or for due diligence
services provided by accountants. More difficult to measure in financial terms
are opportunity costs. In practice, it is not uncommon that the management
team of a start-up spends up to 80% of their time to close a deal with a venture
capital firm in the final negotiation phase. This time is lost for other managerial
duties and thus involves opportunity costs. In other words, the transaction costs
borne by the founders reduce the value of the shares of their company.
The venture capitalists bear the preparation costs for the inspection of the
business plan, first contacts with the founding team, and company presentations. The total amount of the transaction costs arising from negotiations and
concluding a legally binding contract depends on the duration and the complexity of the deal. Similar to the situation of the founders, one part of the venture
capitalists’ transaction costs are cash expenses; the other part are opportunity
costs. The total transaction costs translate into demands for a higher return on
the investment and thus into higher costs of capital for the start-up.
The more rounds of financing both parties agree on, the more frequent the
negotiations that have to take place, the more the required contracts and the
higher the transaction costs of the deal for both the parties. Expenses for a
due diligence of the start-up, e.g., by accountants or attorneys, also belong to
the transaction costs of finalizing an agreement. Even after the financing contract has been signed, additional transaction costs may emerge. Examples are
the costs of payment controls, the costs of monitoring the additional services
that the venture capitalist has promised to provide to the start-up, and the
costs for changes or amendments to the contract. Such amendments and the
corresponding renegotiations of the contract terms become necessary when
important external factors change or when one of the two partners has serious complaints about the fulfillment of the earlier contract (Kaplan/Strömberg
2003, p 275).
In the empirical part of this paper, we will focus on the transaction costs of
the founders assuming that the venture capital firm can shift most or even all
its transaction costs back to the start-up via reduced company valuations.
2.4 Formulation of hypotheses
All three theoretical approaches to staged financing that we discussed so far
are based on an institutional economics perspective on entrepreneurial finance.
Our goal is to use this perspective, which is very common in the theoretical

<-----Page 7----->192

P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf

literature as well as in existing empirical work on the subject, to derive four
hypotheses. These hypotheses refer to the correlation between some independent variables and the number of financing rounds as a proxy for the degree
of staged financing, our dependent variable. The hypotheses deliberately leave
out staggering and exclusively focus on staging.
In selecting the independent variables, we strictly relied on the three theories on staged financing presented above. In other words, we expect external
company risks, agency costs in the form of qualifications risks and behavioral
risks, as well as transaction costs to have an effect on the staging decisions taken
by venture capitalists or agreed upon in negotiations between a venture capital
firm and the founders of the start-up to be financed. We shall test the hypotheses with multivariate regressions on a cross-sectional data set. Whereas we
implicitly assume causal relationships between the independent variables and
the number of financing rounds, we shall only be able to test and empirically
measure correlations between variables, not causality.
Hypothesis 1 is directly related to the theories on sharing and shifting external risks. The staging of start-up financing is expected to be more attractive for
venture capitalists if the perceived external company risks are substantial. Staging allows equity investors to limit their exposure to external risks and to shift
parts of those risks back to the founders of the start-up. From the perspective
of the entrepreneurs, this risk shifting can also be attractive because it reduces
the cost of equity. We derive hypotheses 2 and 3 from the principal agent theories on entrepreneurial finance. From an agency perspective, we expect venture
capital firms to use staging to protect themselves against the qualification and
behavioral risks that potentially emerge when investing in start-ups. We expect
staged financing to be applied more frequently with higher perceived qualification risks of the management team and with increasing fear of the venture
capitalists regarding behavioral risks. Hypothesis 4 summarizes our discussion
of transaction cost theories on staged financing. Venture capitalists and founders
of start-ups should make use of staged financing less frequently the higher the
transaction costs of a contractually agreed new round of financing rise. The four
hypotheses are:
H1: The number of financing rounds increases with the external company risks.
H2: The number of financing rounds increases with the qualification risks of
the founders.
H3: The number of financing rounds increases with the behavioral risks of the
founders.
H4: The number of financing rounds decreases with the transaction costs of a
round of financing.
3 Empirical results
3.1 Design of the survey and sample
The empirical study this section will report on is based on a pre-tested questionnaire, which was sent out to 834 German companies that were founded

<-----Page 8----->Staged financing of start-ups

193

after the year 1993 (and which are thus, to our understanding, young enough to
still be termed “start-ups”). All firms that we contacted are legally registered in
Germany and have been financed by outside equity investors, mostly venture
capitalists. Other investors in our sample were corporate venture capital firms
and business angels. Earlier empirical studies on staged financing of start-ups
have typically chosen venture capital firms as their informants (examples for
this procedure are Schefczyk 2004; Reißig-Thust 2003), not the founders of the
start-ups.
Collecting data on staged financing from start-ups and not from venture
capitalists has advantages and disadvantages. The entrepreneurs’ perception of
agency costs or transaction costs to be borne by the venture capital firm may
be biased. If it is the venture capitalists who ultimately pay these costs, their
answers may be less biased than those of entrepreneurs. But we would argue
that start-ups pay the agency costs and the transaction costs of venture capital
financing because a venture capital firm can include them in its contract terms.
If this is the case, start-ups are better prepared to answer questions concerning
these costs. Ideally, empirical research on staged financing could use data from
both parties to check if there are significant differences in the perception of
external risks, agency costs, and transaction costs. Unfortunately, requesting
pairs of informants, i.e., the venture capital firm and the start-up it has invested
in, to answer the same questionnaire, largely reduces response rates and thus
sample size.
We identified the companies, the names of their founders, as well as the
founders’ e-mail addresses in a manual search of different databases. The starting point were the web pages of the German association of venture capital firms
(“Bundesverband der Kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften BVK”). Inspecting the
web pages of the venture capital firms that are listed as members of the BVK,
we could identify start-ups with venture capital investments. We completed the
results of this search with data from press reports and magazines (Handelsblatt,
Finance, Going Public, etc.), and from information on the web pages of start-ups
themselves.
After several pre-tests with industry experts, founders, and venture capitalists, we sent out the questionnaire in the form of a PDF file via personalized
e-mail to all 834 companies in our uniquely created data set. Respondents
could send back their answers to the questionnaire by fax or by regular mail.
The survey with all reminder mails took place from April to July 2002. In total, we received 90 completed and usable questionnaires, which is a response
rate of 10.8%. As the total set of German start-ups with venture capital backing is unknown, and the response rate is not too large, our sample may not
be representative . Still, we could find no significant non-response bias in the
sense of differences between the respondents who answered early and those
who answered late (Armstrong and Overton 1977). One start-up had reached
break-even shortly after foundation and, therefore, had no further need for
equity financing. We excluded this company from our sample. For the empirical analyses, data from 89 start-ups remained. The “key informants” of our
study according to their individual assessment (Bagozzi et al. 1991), which we

<-----Page 9----->194

P. Witt and G. Brachtendorf

validated by making spot checks by telephone calls to the companies, are
members of the founding team and individual founders who still serve on the
management board (75%) or members of the current management board who
did not found the company but joined later (25%).
3.2 Descriptive results
The 89 start-ups in our sample were founded between 1994 and 2001. Two
thirds of them were established in the years 1999 and 2000. At the time of our
survey, 52 of the companies in the sample were joint stock corporations under
German law (“Aktiengesellschaft”), two of them with a stock exchange listing.
35 had chosen the legal form of a German private limited liability company
(“GmbH”), and two were using mixed legal forms (“GmbH & Co. KG”). 84 of
the start-ups in our sample are legally and economically independent, i.e., do
not belong to a larger group. Four firms had been liquidated already or were in
the process of liquidation at the time of our survey. One sample firm had been
acquired by another company in a recent trade sale. If we split up the sample into the companies’ industries, a pronounced high-tech bias in the sample
becomes visible. Strongly represented industries are internet and software (20
firms), biotechnology (18 firms), as well as engineering technology and related
high tech products (16 firms). Other industries in the sample are IT services (12
firms), telecommunication (9 firms), medical devices (6 firms), as well as media,
financial services, industry, and others (2 firms each). 88 of the start-ups that participated in our empirical study were willing to answer questions concerning the
total amounts of external financing. In total, the start-ups included in this survey
had a total need for external equity financing of 922 million Euro. The average
total financing need per firm is 10 million Euro, the median is 6 million Euro.
The amount of equity provided by outside investors ranges from 0.15 million
Euro to 70 million Euro. Not surprisingly, start-ups from the biotechnology
sector have a significantly higher need for external funding. The number of
financing rounds that the individual start-ups realized ranges from one to five.
Most frequently, we find three rounds of financing (37 firms). The median for
the number of financing rounds per firm is three, the mean value is 2.7. With
respect to the number of rounds, there are no significant differences between
industries. Table 1 summarizes some of the major descriptive characteristics of
our sample.
For a total of 207 financing rounds, we received detailed data on the contents
of the contracts that were arranged by outside investors and founders. One
hundred and thirteen rounds of financing in our sample are pure equity transactions. In 27 rounds, a mezzanine type of investment took place, e.g., loans
to the start-up granted by shareholders. The remaining 67 transactions were
characterized by mixed forms of debt and equity financing. On average, over
all 207 rounds of financing, equity investments accounted for two thirds of the
financing volume. Just 5% of the financing volume was mezzanine.
Eighty seven companies in our sample were willing to disclose for their 196
rounds of financing how many payments were made per investment (staggering).

In 102 rounds (52%), the investors provided the capital in one up-front payment.
40 rounds were split up into two payments, 29 rounds used three payments and
22 rounds, used three payments and four. In our sample, we also have individual
cases where the staging of payments led to six, eight, and even ten installments.
The mean number of payments per round is 1.94; the median is 1. These descriptive results are interesting because they differ from earlier empirical evidence
of Kaplan and Strömberg (2003) for the U.S. In their sample, no more than 15%
of all financing transactions come along with more than one installment. Our
results indicate that staggering may be more common in Germany than it is in
the U.S.
For those contracts in our sample that actually included staged financing
based on specified targets, we find very different types of milestones. Most frequently, investors make new rounds of financing dependent on the progress in
the technological development of products (55.7% of all contracts with milestones). Similarly frequent, targets are set for sales as well as for the number
of customers or the number of letters of intent by potential customers. Less
important in our sample are milestones referring to patents that have been filed
or to the number of employees. Interestingly, this is also true for industries in
which patents are perceived to be of the utmost importance, e.g., biotechnology.
Under the heading “other milestones” we collected targets like completion of

3.3 Methodology of the empirical analysis
The variables being used in the hypotheses cannot be measured directly. Therefore, they need to be defined as constructs, or latent variables, that are measured

by a couple of directly observable indicators. All our constructs have reflective
indicators with 5 point Likert scales for each indicator variable. To perform the
confirmatory factor analysis, we used the software package AMOS 4.01.
To measure the external company risks of a start-up, we used three different latent variables: the intensity of competition in the industry, the dynamics
of the technological development in the industry (technology dynamics), and
the frequency of changes in customer needs (market dynamics). The respondents gave their subjective estimates for external company risks. As the three
variables measuring external company risk are constructs themselves, several
indicators measure each. In doing so, we relied on indicators that have been
proven valid in other empirical studies (Ernst 2001, p 182 Jaworski and Kohli
1993, pp 68–69).
We measured the construct “intensity of competition” by five indicators:
“competitors can offer everything that we can offer”, “the competition in our
industry is fierce”, “our industry is characterized by tough price competition”,
“we get to know new actions taken by competitors almost every day”, and “our
competitors are relatively weak” (reverse coding). After eliminating the first
indicator, the values for the validity of the total factor are good (Cronbach
alpha of 0.71). Only the value for the average variance included (0.41) lies
below 0.5, which is set as a minimum value by some authors (e.g., Homburg
and Giering 1996). Looking at the individual indicators, we get different results.
For two indicators, the reliability values are fairly low. We still refrained from
eliminating those two indicators because they have been used successfully in
other empirical studies and because a reduction of the number of indicators
included did not significantly improve the results.
For the factor, “technology dynamics”, we again selected five pre-validated
indicators: “in our industry, major technological changes are rare” (reverse coding), “it is difficult to forecast where our industry will stand in 2–3 years’ time”,
“in our industry, technologies change very rapidly”, “technological changes create large opportunities in our industry”, “many new products in our industry
only become possible after technological breakthrough innovations”. The measurement of construct validity showed that one indicator, the fourth one, had
to be excluded to get acceptable validity measures (Cronbach alpha of 0.72).
For the factor “market dynamics”, we used three pre-validated indicators.
Unfortunately, the factor analysis produced no satisfactory results for this construct. Eliminating indicators was not feasible either. Therefore, we decided to

<-----Page 12----->Staged financing of start-ups

drop the factor “market dynamics” and only measure external company risks
by the two factors “intensity of competition” and “technology dynamics”.
Qualification risks correspond to the level of experience in the entrepreneurial team. This experience can be managerial and technological. Relevant
technology experience stems from the founders’ previous jobs in science or
in the start-up’s current industry. Both are relevant for the start-up’s chances
of success. We measured qualification risk by the two indicators “managerial
experience” and “industry experience”, both counted in years per person as
assessed by the founders themselves.
To measure behavioral risks, we focused on conflicts of interest between the
venture capitalist and the founders. From previous studies on agency problems in entrepreneurial finance (Reißig-Thust 2003, pp 66–71), we derived five
potential goals of founders that deviate from the value maximization goal of the
venture capital firm and can therefore lead to conflicts of interest: high monthly
salaries for the management team, the collection of entrepreneurial experience
to later make a better career, fun, independence, and pursuing technological
hobbies. While the scales of the individual indicators are ordinal, we still calculated the mean of all five indicator variables to measure the construct “conflicts
of interest”.
To obtain a proxy for the transaction costs per round of financing, we decided
to use three indicators: real cash expenditures, opportunity costs of time for the
management team, and the founders’ subjective estimates of the total transaction costs on the side of the founders. On average, the start-ups in our sample
spent 68 top management workdays per round of financing and had average cash
expenses of 35,000 Euro per round. Particularly important are the subjective
estimates for total transaction costs because this subjective estimate largely
affects the decision to choose staged financing. In our empirical study, we aggregated the subjectively estimated founders’ transaction costs of several rounds
of financing per company to one mean value. To make the questionnaire easy
to answer for our respondents, we focused on the transaction costs of preparing
and finalizing an investment contract. A shortcoming of this approach is the
reduction of the measurement to ex ante transaction costs, i.e., costs for the
preparation and the realization of the financial transaction. Further components of transaction costs like cost of control, cost of adaptations, and cost to
terminate a transaction are left out, although they may be substantial in some
cases. The empirical analysis of the data showed high correlations between all
indicators to measure transaction costs. Therefore, we ran the regressions with
just one variable for the construct “transaction costs”, the subjective estimates
of total transaction costs. Figure 1 summarizes the measurement model and the
hypotheses.

methodological problems because negative estimation values may occur while
count variables always have to be non-negative integer. Therefore, a Poisson
regression model is better suited to test the hypotheses (Greene 2002, p 740).
In such a regression, the estimation function for the dependent variable is of
exponential form. The preferable estimation method for Poisson models is the
Maximum Likelihood method. To apply it, we need to specify the distribution
of the dependent variable, given the independent variables.
In its basic form, the Poisson regression assumes a Poisson distribution for
the dependent variable. As the means and the variances of the distribution
were not equal for our data, thus deviating from the assumption of a Poisson
distribution, we used Quasi-ML estimates and measured the validity of the
estimation with a Pseudo-R2 and a corrected R̄2 (Wooldridge 2001, p 653). An
analysis of the residuals allowed us to evaluate the overall validity of the Poisson
regression. To test the hypotheses, we checked whether the Pearson residuals
were normally distributed (Cameron and Trivedi 1998, p 145); Wald tests and
Quasi Likelihood Ratio (QLR) tests measured the goodness of fit of the estimation function (Greene 2002, p 742). To validate the individual regression
coefficients, we applied t-tests. As the standard assumption of equal means and
variances was violated for our data, we transformed the simple error terms into
GLM standard error terms (Greene 2002, p 484; Wooldridge 2001, pp 651–653).
For the Poisson regression, we used the software package EViews 4.0, and for
all other analyses the statistics software SPSS for Windows in version 11.5.1.
Table 3 presents the results of the Poisson regression.
The results of the Poisson regression indicate that the intensity of competition in the respective industry has a significant positive effect on the number

of financing rounds. More intense competition means more external company
risk, which induces more frequent utilization of staged financing. With respect to
technology dynamics, we can find no significant effect on the number of financing rounds. We conclude that the results of the empirical analysis give partial
support to hypothesis 1. In our study, the founders’ managerial and industry
experience measures qualification risks. The results show that neither of the two
has a significant impact on the number of financing rounds. Therefore, we have
to reject hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 also has to be rejected. Whenever conflicts
of interest prevail, the number of financing rounds is empirically higher than
in cases with no such conflicts of interest, but the differences are statistically
insignificant. Finally, the empirical analysis finds a clear and significantly negative relationship between the transaction costs of the start-ups and the number
of financing rounds. The more expensive the staging is in terms of transaction
costs, the less frequently do the investors and founders make use of it. We
conclude that our data support hypothesis 4.
The Poisson regression is characterized by a notable underdispersion. Therefore, an assessment of the validity of the estimates requires further tests. To do
so, we have conducted OLS regressions. Multicollinearity turned out not to be a
problem in the OLS regressions; the VIF values are all under three, and most of
them are clearly below two. The residuals are normally distributed. Due to the
logical ordering of the sample firms, autocorrelation can be ruled out. Table 4
shows the results of the OLS regressions.
The OLS regression produces similar results as the Poisson regression. Once
again, we see clear support for hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 1 does not have to be
rejected, but the relationship is slightly less significant than before. Just as in the
Poisson estimation, we have to reject hypotheses 2 and 3 in the OLS regression.
The empirical findings are interesting because they are only partly in line with
widely used and commonly accepted theoretical explanations of staging decisions. First, we do find a negative relationship between the amount of transaction
costs and the number of financing rounds. Second, the more (external) risks the
company faces, the more frequently do venture capital firms and founders rely

on staging. But third, principal agent theory fails to explain staging decisions in
our sample.
Although we strongly feel that these findings are important for the further
development of the theories on entrepreneurial finance, we need to point at
some methodological limitations of the empirical study presented in this paper.
First, the analysis is based on cross-sectional data; i.e., it uses a static approach
to explain the number of financing rounds being chosen in start-up financing
decisions. In our theoretical model, the relevant parameters determining the
number of financing rounds are set at the foundation date, i.e., at the beginning
of the financing process. In other words, the founders need to have laid out their
financing strategy very early. In practice, dynamic planning approaches may be
more common. In reaction to observable developments in company risks and
behavioral risks, founders may wish to revise earlier plans and financing decisions at later stages in the financing process. Our analysis does not capture these
dynamic effects.
The static approach chosen to formulate our hypotheses on staged financing
leads to a second methodological restriction. By asking our informants to make
subjective estimates on the competitive environment of their start-up at the
date of foundation, which may have been up to 8 years ago, we run the risk of
getting answers based on seriously biased individual memories. Another critical
assumption relates to the informational structure. Our theory implicitly assumes
that increasing the number of financing rounds is advantageous if the benefits
for all the parties involved are larger than the transaction costs incurred. This
approach does not take into consideration that new information could come
up in the process of financing the start-up. Then, more rounds of financing with
correspondingly smaller volumes per round may not be favorable to everyone.
Rather, the optimal number of the rounds could depend on the type and the
timing of new information.
4 Conclusions
Our empirical analysis using a sample of 89 German start-ups confirms the
importance of transaction costs and of external risk sharing motives for staging

<-----Page 16----->Staged financing of start-ups

decisions in entrepreneurial finance. But, rather surprisingly, our results do not
lend support to the commonly used and little disputed agency theories on staging. It seems that in German start-ups, investors mainly make use of staged
financing to shift some of their equity investment risk to the founders. In doing
so, they reduce the cost of equity, at least if the transaction costs of staging
are not so high that they offset the gains from lower risks. The venture capital
firms in our sample do not use staged financing to reduce the qualification risks
and the behavioral risks induced by an investment in a team of potentially illqualified or opportunistically behaving founders. This empirical finding could
simply indicate that the existing literature on entrepreneurial finance overstates
the importance of agency problems. In an alternative explanation, agency problems between venture capitalists and founders of start-ups exist, but instruments
other than staged financing, e.g., reporting systems and board seats for investors,
can eliminate them more effectively and cheaper.
In future studies on staged financing of start-ups, researchers could try to
conduct longitudinal studies or studies on panel data. This methodology would
make it easier to estimate the risk situation of a start-up and its changes over
time. Another potential extension of the work presented here is a dyadic design
of the survey. To estimate conflicts of interest, behavioral risks, and qualification risks, an empirical study could try to ask both parties involved in a deal,
founders and venture capital firms. After having compared the subjective estimates on agency costs, transaction costs, and external risks as perceived by
venture capitalists and founders, a more reliable measurement of the variables
becomes possible. We hasten to add that such a dyadic design is demanding. It
requires the identification of investor-start-up-pairs and the willingness of both
partners to participate in the survey. Our personal experience suggests that it
may be difficult to come up with a sufficiently large sample size using such a
methodological design.
