Entrepreneur Characteristics and
the Prediction of New Venture Success

(Received December 1985; in revised form March 1986)
Venture capitalists are experts who specialize in evaluating new business ventures. When asked how,
they stress the overwhelming importance of the entrepreneur. In this paper, entrepreneur characteristics are identified and then examined for predictive potential. Models are developed on the basis of

venture capitalists' judgments for these characteristics and for the level of venture success. A second
set of models is based on actual venture outcome as the criterion. Lastly, the performance of the models
and expert judgments are compared.

INTRODUCTION
NEW VENTURES present some unique problems in analysis and prediction. The very newness of these ventures implies no prior history.
And since prior corporate history is often conceded to be both base and yardstick for future
performance measurement, novel ventures
promise an environment with magnified uncertainty. In direct consequence, a group of investment bankers has emerged that specialize in
funding such ventures. Termed venture capitalists, they provide a unique financial service that
is not only the envy of other Western economies, but has been a catalyst in accelerating the
transfer of high technology from the laboratory
to practical use.
Precisely how venture capitalists select investments is an interesting question. When asked,
they repeatedly emphasize the entrepreneur over
any other aspect of the venture. In fact, many
often insist that given the right entrepreneur
these other aspects are corrected p e r se.
What then makes an entrepreneur? There is
considerable evidence (for example, Atkinson
[1], McClelland [25], McClelland and Winter
[27]) in support of a relationship between an
individual's need for achievement and entrepreneurial behavior as exemplified by business
dynamism and apparent risk taking. Achievement motivation has been examined extensively
[2]. And following a study on the occupational

choices of college graduates ten years after
graduation, McClelland [26] hypothesizes that
entrepreneurship can be ascertained by measuring achievement motivation. Palmer [3 l] too,
notes that individuals who score high on
achievement motivation tests are likely to end
up in the business world.
In contrast, dependency or high affiliation
needs imply approval-seeking behavior that is
contra-indicative of entrepreneurship [3, 15].
Similarly, fear of failure is another contraindicator [4].
The significance of achievement motivation
is also emphasized by venture capitalists,
who characterize it as the entrepreneur being
"hungry". And one of them has described it as
a "desire for success" [18]. Almost without
exception they consider it eminently important.
Yet when achievement motivation is compared
to organizational skill [14], a relationship is not
evident.
It is possible then that while certain correlates
of entrepreneurship exist, they may not all
extend directly to a causal relationship that can
suggest the outcome of the entrepreneur's venture. However, it may still be possible to develop models that sift through and select the
characteristics relevant for predictive purposes;
as a result one can then identify entrepreneur
characteristics that are truly reflective of the
success of the venture and at the same time

anticipate the level of that success with an
accuracy that can have the potential for a
decision aid in support of the venture capitalist.

RESEARCH STRATEGY

A questionnaire survey was to be used for
data collection. By far the vast majority of
venture capital firms happen to be private and
it became clear at the outset that they were
unwilling to divulge raw financial records. To
respect the confidential and sensitive nature of
the data, the responses were coded so that only
one person was aware of the identity of the
firms. And the information on the variables was
scaled to accommodate both differences in
investment size and confidentiality.
The first task was to select entrepreneur characteristics that would serve as the independent
variables. Interviews with a sample of prominent venture capitalists revealed remarkable
similarities as to salient entrepreneur characteristics though expressed sometimes in differing
verbal expressions. Thus the selection of entrepreneur characteristics has been based on
what venture capitalists in the real world consider to be a positive influence on a venture.
A detailed list of all the variables is given in
Table 1. These variables are scaled from 1 to 5,
where 1 is poor, 2 below average, 3 average, 4
above average and 5 excellent.
The success of the venture serves as the
criterion or dependent variable (Table 1) and is
considered both a priori and ex post facto. Thus
venture capitalists have provided data on expected investment outcomes, when the investment was made, as well as actual outcomes.
Both expected and actual outcomes are scaled
from 1 to 6, where 1 is a total wipe-out, 2 is a
loss, 3 below average profit, 4 average profit, 5

capitalists term a real winner. A zero is used
when an actual outcome is not yet known.
A sample of venture capital firms was selected
on the basis of recent investment activity--the
cut-off was a minimum of two investments in
the past y e a r - - f r o m Capital Publishing's Guide
to Venture Capital Sources. Respondents provided information on the independent and dependent variables for as many recent investments as they chose to. They also indicated
whether an investment was a startup or a later
stage financing. Out of 197 firms, there were
36 usable responses yielding 104 data points.
O f these, actual outcomes were known for 68
investments consisting of 35 startups and 33
nonstartups. The relatively low number of
usable responses was accounted for, in large
part, by the number of returns marked "out-ofbusiness" underscoring yet again the high risk
nature of such investments.
MODELS AND HUMAN JUDGMENT
Judgments of decision makers have been
modeled for diverse judgmental tasks by means
of actuarial models. In an extensive review,
Meehl [29] concluded that actuarial models of
judgmental situations were superior to human
judgment particularly when that judgment was
based on multiple factors. Hoffman [19] proposed the expression "a paramorphic representation" in cognizance of the fact that while the
model did not claim to replicate the actual
psychological process it could simulate the end
result. On the other hand, Little [24] introduced
the term "decision calculus" as an approach to
model building where a decision maker's implicit decision model is developed into an explicit model that can serve as a decision aid.
These cognitive techniques for constructing
decision models are based on the Brunswik [6]
lens model paradigm: the environment separated, by time or space, from the decision
maker's judgment is viewed through a lens,
consisting of decision cues, in arriving at a
judgment. Models can be developed to relate
the cues to environment (i.e. actual event) where
possible, and models can also relate the cues to
judgment [17].
Actuarial models have been used to model
human judgment in a wide variety of tasks.
Some examples: Bowman [5] and Kunreuther

<-----Page 2----->Omega, Vol. 14, No. 5

[23] developed models based on past decisions
for production planning purposes. Slovic [35]
modeled a stockbroker's decisions assessing the
attractiveness of common stocks. Hoffman, Slovic and Rorer [20], Goldberg [16] and Einhorn
[13] reported on clinical judgments in the medical field. Dawes [10] looked at graduate admission decisions. Joyce [21] examined internal
control judgments, in auditing, made by public
accountants. Little [24] and Mclntyre [28]
among others have applied the approach in
marketing.
Where a true judgment has been available for
comparison, these models of human judgment
have, in almost all cases, performed better than
the decision makers on whom the models were
based. For example, in Dawes' [10] model of the
decisions of a graduate school admissions committee, the true judgment could be represented
by subsequent student performance; measured
against this, the model was found to predict
better than the committee's judgment. This phenomenon where the model outperforms the
human decision maker has been called "bootstrapping". Lastly and most importantly, researchers have also found (for e.g. [10, 13] that
where true judgment (i.e. environmental or actual data for the dependent variable) has been
available, models based on such actual data
have proven to be even superior to judgment
models.
Attempts to explain the success of the model
have hinged on its consistency and reliability
[16] though some [11] have ascribed the phenomenon to the nature of the actuarial model
itself. It has also been suggested that actuarial
models are successful because it is difficult for
humans to absorb and process multidimensional nonsensory data. Simon [34] has
observed that, in a complex decision environment, humans tend to construct simplified models. Miller [30] has examined human limitations
in the number of conceptual items that can be
considered at any one time. And Payne's study
[32] confirms that in a complex decision problena, the human decision maker resorts to cognitive strain reducing strategies: he deliberately
simplifies what may be complex in an effort to
reduce the problem to manageable size. Payne's
results underscore human cognitive limitations
in processing multidimensional nonsensory
data. Thus the superiority of the model, coupled
with these human limitations, circumscribes the

367

role of the decision maker as more appropriate
to identifying and providing judgments for the
predictor variables [33], which can then be
weighted and combined in optimal fashion by
the actuarial model.
Three types of models are tried in this study.
These are (i) the linear model, (ii) the conjunctive model, and (iii) the disjunctive model. The
linear model is well known. Dawes [9] and
Coombs [8] have conceptualized the conjunctive
and disjunctive models; and Einhorn [12] has
proposed mathematical fucntions that approximate them.
The Linear Model This formulation is a
simple additive model,
Y= ~ aiX,
i--I

where the dependent variable Y is the criterion
or outcome of interest, and the independent
variables X~ represent the decision cues. The
model is compensatory, that is, a low rating on
one dimension can be compensated for by a
high score on another.
The linear model has exhibited remarkable
robustness and predictive success. Yntema and
Torgerson [39] and Slovic and Lichtenstein [36]
have described how well linear models can
approximate nonlinear functions. And T r r n [37]
has demonstrated a correlation coefficient of 0.5
with a linear model of a highly nonlinear (a 90 °
angle) curve. His only precondition is a conditionally monotone relationship of each predictor to the criterion.
The Conjunctive Model. This model implies a
multiple cut-off procedure with a minimum
evaluation function; thus certain minimums for
each attribute must be satisfied for an acceptable outcome. Under these conditions a low
rating on one attribute cannot be compensated
for, and so the model is termed noncompensatory. Einhorn's [12] mathematical approximation of this model for two variables can be
extended easily to n variables.
Y = f l X a~
i-I

or
log Y = ~ ai log X~
i-I

The parabolic type of response surface for this
function provides a high criterion when the Xi

<-----Page 3----->Khan--The

368

Prediction o f N e w Venture Success

value for any particular attribute is not too
small. Hence the implicit minimum evaluation
function.
The Disjunctive Model In contrast to the
conjunctive model, the disjunctive model represents a maximum evaluation function which
has to be satisfied by a very high value of at
least one attribute for an acceptable criterion. It
suggests a decision process that favors the selection of specialists. Again from Einhorn's [12]
functional approximation, the model can be
written as
n /"

1

Xxal

or

log Y = -- ~ ailog(c o -- Xi)
i=l

where the constant Co is set above the largest X~
to ensure that Y remains finite. Here the hyperbolic type of response surface means a high
criterion for a high value of just one X~ even
though the ratings of the other Xis may be low.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The first issue of interest that needs to be
explored is whether entrepreneur characteristics
play a significant role in the assessment of
ventures by venture capitalists. In other words,
can entrepreneur characteristic based models
replicate the venture capitalists' decision process? Table 2 showing the R 2 and F values for
the three models that were fitted to the expected
outcomes (venture capitalists' judgments) provides an affirmative answer. In the data set used
here, actual outcomes were not known, and so
the judgments could not have been tainted by
hindsight bias.
One can see from Table 2 that the conjunctive
model provides the best fit followed by the
linear and then the disjunctive model. Since the
conjunctive model comes closest to simulating
the decision process of the venture capitalists,
it implies that the latter intuitively adhere to

a certain minimum level of acceptability for
the different entrepreneurial characteristics included in the model.
The next table shows R 2 values for expected
outcome models where the actual outcomes are
known. As the data here are sufficient to do so,
separate models have been developed for
startup and nonstartup investments. Also an
overall model using both types of data has
been included. Model performance is sharply
attenuated from the prior case and is about the
same for all three models (Table 3). However,
the disjunctive model in both Table 2 and Table
3 is suspect for predictive purposes because the
coefficient estimates are not statistically
significant.
As the big difference in fit between Table 2
and Table 3, for both linear and conjunctive
models with overall data, hints at hindsight bias,
a simple test is devised. The Table 2 and
Table 3 overall data models are used separately
to predict all 104 data points and the predictions
are correlated. The correlation coefficients for
the two linear model predictions are 0.94 and
for the two conjunctive model predictions are
0.95. The disjunctive model is excluded because
of the unreliability of its parameter coefficients.
These high correlations appear to indicate an
absence of hindsight bias.
The models that have been developed so far
represent the judgment of the venture capitalist
and the results have confirmed the proposition
that they can indeed model such judgment. The
data set includes ventures where actual outcomes are known so that the environment also
can be modeled. In these models then, the
criterion becomes the actual outcome. The results (Table 4) show that the conjunctive and
linear models perform almost equally well, and
better than the disjunctive model. The particu-

larly poor performance of the disjunctive model
in the nonstartup case can be attributed to an
inability of the model to take advantage of the
additional valid information about the entrepreneur that is likely to be available in later
stage financings. This poor performance is reinforced by the fact that model coefficients for all
three disjunctive models are not statistically
significant.
The next question to address is the extent of
agreement between the judgments of venture
capitalists, as represented by the expected outcome ratings for ventures, and the actual outcomes. The first column of Table 5 presents
these correlations, and there is almost none! It
is cause for some concern that the a priori
assessments of these specialists are found to be
so unrelated to the final results, and it serves to
confirm the high level of risk undertaken by
them which in turn justifies the returns required
on such investments. For these reasons any
decision support system that reduces the odds is
first, likely to be most welcome, and second, will
in all probability lower the costs of such
financings.
As might be expected then, the models based
on these judgments of venture capitalists are not
exceptional predictors of actual outcomes either. However, as the correlations of the predictions of the expected outcome models against
actual outcomes (second, third and fourth columns, Table 5) show, these models perform
better than their human counterparts, thereby
confirming the "bootstrapping" reported by
almost all such studies of human judgment.
The correlations of the predictions from the
actual outcome models vs actual outcomes (last
three columns, Table 5), are also simply the
square roots of the values describing the fit of
the actual outcome models that are given in
Table 4. These correlations are more reassuring
and offer the potential of a decision support
system, with the exception, noted earlier, of the
disjunctive formulation.

A concern with such predictive models is the
intercorrelation of predictor variables. Given
the nature of these variables in this study,
namely entrepreneur characteristics that appear
likely to occur together, the issue has to be
examined carefully. However, the highest intercorrelations observed were 0.61 between X~
and )(3, and 0.60 between )(3 and X4. Since X3
appears as a problem common denominator, a
model without X3 is tried. This is found to show
almost no deterioration in fit. For example,
the R2 of the overall actual outcome conjunctive model is 0.329 (approximated to 0.33 in
Table 4) with all five entrepreneur characteristics and it reduces to 0.328 when X~ is
excluded.
The poor correlation of judgments with actual outcomes makes it interesting to compare
the coefficients of the judgment models with
those of the actual outcome models. This task
is made easier by the fact that each variable is
measured on the same 1 to 5 scale.
The closest representation of the judgments of
venture capitalists is provided by the conjunctive model for the case where actual outcomes
are not known (Table 2). Here the possibility of
contamination by hindsight does not arise, and
of the three models tested the conjunctive has
the best fit. Examination of Table 6 which
shows the variable coefficients together with
significance levels for this model, reveals that
the venture capitalist attaches the highest importance to the entrepreneur's desire for success
(X0 followed by tenacity/courage (X3). As we
have seen earlier, these two variables also
display a high degree of intercorrelation, and
together they constitute a personality trait
synonymous with an aggressive entrepreneur
that the venture capitalist finds attractive.
Unfortunately these general characteristics may
or may not be accompanied by the requisite
competence.

The coefficients for the model based on actual
outcomes (Table 7) are weighted very differently: the creativity/ingenuity of the entrepreneur (X2) has the largest weight and is highly
significant (1.4% level). This is followed by
enthusiasm and capacity for work (X4), and
then competence in field of endeavor (Xs). The
coefficient of variable X3 is not significant and
the coefficient of XI, while significant, is.actually
negative.
This pattern of weightings for the judgment
model and the actual outcome or environment
model, with the conjunctive formulation and
overall data set, is repeated in varying degree for
almost all the other models and data sets. It is
apparent that the venture capitalist emphasizes
the relatively amorphous and general characteristics XI and )(3, while the environment model
focuses on variables (X2, X4 and )(5) with a
closer link to the actual venture, which happen
also to be easier to measure because the entrepreneur's biodata and work habits provide a
reasonable guide.
A stepwise regression procedure also demonstrates the importance of these variables for the
predictive process. Thus Xl in the conjunctive
judgment model accounts for 89% of the total
R 2. In the actual outcome model, on the other
hand, )(2 is the most important single variable
and again in the conjunctive formulation accounts for over 74% of the R 2 for the startup
ventures and about 60% for overall data.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study, venture capitalists have served
as experts who have identified and selected
entrepreneur characteristics that they consider
to be positively related to a successful venture
outcome. To the extent that these expert specialists have developed an expertise, there is likely
to be some consistency in their judgment process, which models can attempt to capture. The
experts have provided judgmental measures of

the relevant variables for their own investments.
Based on these data, two sets of models are
constructed--judgment models, where the criterion is the expected outcome when the investment is made, and environment models, where
the criterion is the actual outcome of the investment.
The judgment models confirm the venture
capitalists' stated emphasis on achievement
motivation. And they are, in this sense, in
agreement with the social scientists who find a
significant linkage between achievement motivation and entrepreneurial behavior. The causal
relationship with venture success however, is
not clear, for the judgments themselves are
poorly correlated with venture outcome; in
consequence the judgment models, while displaying the bootstrapping effect, are only
marginal predictors.
Measured by the number of studies reporting
bootstrapping, the weight of evidence certainly
supports it. On the other hand, Chakravarti,
Mitchell and Staelin [7] have found, in a laboratory setting, that a group of executives using
Little's [24] decision calculus model performed
no better than an unaided control group. The
failure of the judgmental model in their experiment is attributed by the authors to the fact that
human judgment is frequently subject to systematic bias. They cite Tversky and Kahneman [38]
who have pointed out that humans frequently
use decision heuristics which, while often useful,
can also lead to systematic errors. Another
reason for model failure suggested by Chakravarti et al. is nonstationarity of the response
function over successive periods because of
carry-over effects. And Mclntyre [28] has demonstrated the success of judgment models when
a conscious effort is made to minimize bias and
nonstationarity problems.
In this study each investment is a separate
entity which obviates the nonstationarity problem. Thus it is possibly one reason why the
judgment models here are a modest success over
expert judgments. At the same time, the environment models based on actual outcomes outperform by a large margin, both expert judgments and judgment models. Not surprisingly
then, variable emphasis in the judgment and
environment models is found to differ markedly:
instead of achievement motivation, the most
significant correlate of venture success that
emerges is the creativity and ingenuity of the

<-----Page 6----->Omega, Vol. 14, No. 5

entrepreneur. So that while achievement motivation is a commonly perceived characteristic of
entrepreneurs, it cannot be regarded as a guarantor of success. In this analysis, product has
been omitted from consideration. However,
research [22] shows that the product variable is
a distracting influence and poor predictor.
The reasons for the superiority of the environment model are summarized nicely by
Einhorn [13] as follows:
(1) The [decision maker's] c o m b i n a t i o n m a y be
leaving o u t i m p o r t a n t c o m p o n e n t s ; (2) it m a y
be weighting the c o m p o n e n t s in n o n o p t i m a l
w a y s . . . ; (3) it m a y be t h a t the c o m b i n i n g rule
used by the [decision maker] helps him to
simplify the situation so t h a t he m a y be
ignoring a n d weighting variables in such a way
as to reduce cognitive strain. Related to this is
the possibility t h a t the c o m b i n i n g rule imposed
by the [decision maker] in c o m b i n i n g the
c o m p o n e n t s m a y n o t be the best rule t h a t
c o m b i n e s the c o m p o n e n t s with respect to the
criterion to be predicted (p. 88).

In common with most studies then, there is
here a hierarchy of decision proficiency, where
the environment model is the most effective,
followed by the judgment model, and lastly
expert judgment itself. This is not to diminish
the role of the expert, for while the model is
effective in combining and weighting the predictors, the expert is equally necessary for the
complementary task of selecting the predictors
and providing the inputs. And the results of the
environment models in this study indicate the
potential of such an optimal combination as a
decision support system for venture capitalists.
