<-----Page 1----->Abstract
In this article we study the market for entrepreneurial finance, and use entrepreneurs'
heterogeneity to explain the coexistence of different financiers like Venture Capital (VC) and
Angel investors. This issue has become increasingly important because i. New ventures are the
major source of growth in GDP and job creation, and ii. Some estimates suggest that Angel
investors are as important as VC in financing new ventures.
We capture entrepreneurial heterogeneity by assuming that entrepreneurs are motivated
by several motivational factors beyond the motivation provided by economic value
considerations. Motivational factors may include, for example, the entrepreneur's attitude
towards risk, his need for achievement, tolerance for ambiguity and benefits of control. The
difference between VC investors and angel investors is in their information acquisition
capabilities, as VC investors can better learn the probability of the venture success. It seems
natural that VC investors, being better informed, will dominate the market and will wipe out the
less informed angel investors. This would be true if entrepreneurs only cared about economic
value. With motivational factors, however, the outcome is different, as angel investors offer
entrepreneurs an avenue to better capture their motivational factor.
Our model yields several empirical implications as follows: 1. Angel investors will invest
smaller amount on average compared to VC investors. 2. If entrepreneurs switch financiers, they
will always switch from angel financing to VC financing. 3. The probability of liquidating a
venture is higher under VC financing than under angel financing. 4. An industry with more
attractive economic characteristics will exhibit more angel backed ventures. 5. Better periods in
the economic cycle will experience more angel backed ventures. 6. Geographic locations with
better entrepreneurial eco systems will experience more angel backed ventures.

In this article we study the market for entrepreneurial finance, and use entrepreneurs
heterogeneity to explain the coexistence of different financiers like Venture Capital (VC) and
Angel investors. This issue becomes increasingly important because i. New ventures are the
major source of growth in GDP and job creation (Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda 2009) and ii.
Some estimates suggest that angel investors are as important as VC in financing new ventures
(Goldfarb et al. 2007, Ibrahim 2008, Shane 2008, Sudek et al. 2008, Kerr et al. 2014).
We capture entrepreneurial heterogeneity by assuming that entrepreneurs are motivated
by motivational factors beyond the motivation provided by economic value considerations.
Motivational factors are attributes of the entrepreneur's personal characteristics that interact with
the venture characteristics, thereby affecting the entrepreneur's utility. Motivational factors may
include the entrepreneur's attitude towards risk (Shane and Venkataraman 2000), his need for
achievement (McClelland 1961), tolerance for ambiguity (Schere 1982), benefit of control
(Rotter 1966) and others. See Shane, Locke, and Collins 2003 for a detail description of these
factors1.
The conventional wisdom in new venture financing is that angel investors provide
financing at an earlier stage of the venture's life, have less funds, and are less sophisticated than
VCs2. In this article, we posit that VC and angel investors are similar in all aspects except for
differ their information acquisition capabilities. Specifically, VC and angel investors have
enough funds to finance any good venture and are rational in that they only finance ventures that

For example, an entrepreneur who values a clean environment will draw utility (beyond the utility from
economic value) from a venture that develops alternative energy. Another example may be of an
entrepreneur with a need for achievement (McClelland 1961) that derives utility from a successful
development of a treatment for a previously incurable disease.

Ibrahim (2008) writes: "Indeed, the conventional wisdom is that angels use simple contracts because
they lack the sophistication of venture capitalists â€“ in other words, they simply don't know any better."

VC obtains better information about the venture success3. We introduce two types of angel
investors: "general angels" that acquire no new information in the interim, and "expert angels"
that do acquire new information in the interim.
It is natural that the better informed  investors will wipe out the less informed angel
investors by offering better financing terms (smaller dilution) to entrepreneurs. Surprisingly, this
is not true in our model. Angel investors offer entrepreneurs an avenue to better capture their
motivational factors and therefore they coexist with  investors in equilibrium.
We consider a dynamic two-stage financing model with learning, where it takes two
stages to create a new venture. The first is the design stage and it requires an initial investment at
the outset. The second is the development stage and it requires additional investment. The
entrepreneur may raise the entire investment at the outset, or use stage financing where he raises
the initial investment at the outset and the additional investment after the design stage. Following
the completion of the second stage the venture's product is brought to the market and the venture
exit value is realized. The exit value can be either high or low. We refer to the probability of the
high exit value as the success probability.
After the design stage  investors learn whether the exit value will be high or low,
expert angels learn the success probability and general angels learn no new information. Value
maximization calls for a  financing, where  investors shut down the venture before the
development stage when they learn that the exit value is low (the option to abandon).
Nevertheless, since the entrepreneur also derives utility from his motivational factors, when the
3

The idea here is that a VC that employs market and industry analysts is able to collect better
information. In contrast, angel investors are wealthy individuals with some knowledge of the product and
technical issues, but with little or no knowledge of the market for the venture's products (see Haltiwanger,
Jarmin and Miranda 2009 Chaper 2).

3

<-----Page 4----->motivational factors are high enough, the entrepreneur prefers to deviate from value
maximization by giving up the option to abandon in spite the fact that doing so destructs value.
In this case, the entrepreneur will seek financing from a general angel that does not acquire new
information in the interim and therefore does not shut down the venture4.
The implications for the structure of entrepreneurial finance markets are revealing. First,
the "weak" investors - the investors with inferior information - will not only survive in the
market, but will also attract some of the best ventures. This is because their "weakness" in terms
of economic value is their "strength" in terms of allowing entrepreneurs to capture their
motivational factors5. Therefore, it follows from our model that angel investors are "weak" by
design. That is, even if angels could have learnt more information, they would still set up their
business in order to avoid learning in the interim about the exit value, so that they can appeal to
entrepreneurs with high motivational factors. In this way, the structure of the market for
entrepreneurial finance caters to the needs of heterogeneous entrepreneurs, as it provides
entrepreneurs with their investor of choice6.
Our model yields several empirical implications:
1. If entrepreneurs switch financiers, they will always switch from angel financing to
 financing.

4

An expert angel acquires partial information and, thus, will shut down the venture before the
development stage in some cases. The entrepreneur will resort to expert angel financing when the
motivational factors are high enough, a general angel that price protects itself aggressively is unwilling to
finance the venture and the better informed expert angel is willing to finance the venture. Otherwise, if an
expert angel is unwilling to finance the venture, the entrepreneur is forced to get  financing.
5
Note that as opposed to the conventional wisdom, the angels' weakness in learning information is their
strength in the market for new ventures financing.
6
There may be also a commitment issue, as it may be impossible for  investors to commit to not using
information they have already learnt. In this respect, the only way to implement financial contracts in this
market is via the market structure we identify here, that includes investors with different information,
each providing the specific contract they are best at.

4

<-----Page 5----->2. On average, angel investors will invest smaller amounts compared to s7.
3. On average, angel-backed ventures have higher values compared to VC-backed
ventures.
4. -backed ventures are more likely to be liquidated than angel-backed ventures.
5. An industry with more attractive economic characteristics, e.g., lower investments,
higher expected success probabilities and higher exit values is characterized by more
angel-backed ventures.
6. Better periods in the economic cycle in terms of higher expected exit values are
characterized by more angel-backed ventures.
7. Geographic locations with better entrepreneurial eco systems are characterized by
more angel-backed ventures.
The entrepreneurial finance literature in general abstracts away from the question of the
choice between angel and VC investors (exception is Conti et al. 2011) and focuses instead on
the real impact that early financing, angel or VC financing, have on ventures. The theoretical
literature (Admati and Pfleiderer (1994), BerglÃ¶f (1994), Bergmann and Hege (1998), Hellmann
(1998), and Cornelli and Yosha (2003)) identifies several areas of contributions for early stage
financiers, including help in organization and control, monitoring and alleviating potential
agency problem between the entrepreneur and institutional investors. The empirical literature
that investigates these affects faces the challenge of separating the effect of the sorting ability of
financiers (to select the best ventures) from their actual effect on performance. Hellemann and
Puri (2000), Puri and Zarutski (forthcoming) and Chemmanur et al. (2011) find that VC backed
ventures have better long-term performance, but they can only partially control for the sorting

7

Note that this result is endogenous in our model, and is not due to exogenous reasons like lack of funds.

5

<-----Page 6----->effect with the observed data they have. Other studies try to control for the sorting effect by
looking at some exogenous shocks to the industry of regions. For example, Kortum and Lerner
(2000) look at public policy changes, Samila and Sorenson (2011) look at variations in
endowment returns, and Mollica and Zingales (2007) look at differences in state pension funding
levels. A different approach was taken by Kerr, Lerner and Schoar (2011) who look at the voting
of angel groups to finance ventures. By considering ventures around a financing cut-off point,
they were able to identify ventures that are similar in their exogenous parameters, but some did
not get angel financing. Our focus is different, as we are interested in the sorting effect, although
from the reverse angel, and ask what are the characteristics of ventures/entrepreneurs that
different financiers will finance. The only real impact that the financiers may have is the VC
ability to exercise the value to abandon. However, adding additional roles in advising,
monitoring, etc, will not change the qualitative results of our paper.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. In section 2 we introduce the model. In
Section 3 we analyze the game where VC financing is the only option. In Sections 4 and 5 we
do the same for expert angel and general angel financing, respectively. In Section 6 we analyze
the simultaneous choice between VC, expert angel and general angel financing. In Section 7 we
discuss the impact of motivational factors on new ventures financing, in Section 8 we provide the
empirical implications of the model, and in Section 9 we conclude. All proofs are in the
appendix.

6

<-----Page 7----->2. Model
We envision a market for entrepreneurial finance consisting of many entrepreneurs and potential
financiers. Entrepreneurs develop new ventures and need to raise funds. For simplicity we
assume that entrepreneurs have no personal funds and need to raise the entire investment from
outside investors. We assume equity financing.8 New venture development consists of two stages
over three dates,  = 0, 1, 2, until the product is brought to the market, as follows. At  = 0 the
design stage starts and requires an initial investment 	
 . This is the pre-seed investment round. At
 = 1, the design stage ends and the product development stage starts and requires additional
investment 	 at  = 1. This is the seed investment round. The entrepreneur may raise the entire
investment 	 = 	
 + 	 at  = 0, or raise 	
 at the pre-seed investment round and 	 at the seed
investment round 9. At  = 2 the product is brought to the market and the venture value is
realized.
We assume that the venture exit value at  = 2 can be either high or low. While we
formally refer to the venture value at  = 2	as an exit value, our model equally applies to
situations where the venture continues to operate beyond  = 2 as an independent company, in
which case the exit value represents the expected value of all future cash flows at  = 2. We
normalize the low exit value to zero, and denote the high exit value by . We refer to the high
exit value as "success". The value  represents the estimate at  = 0 of what will be the venture
exit value upon success at  = 2.
The design stage that ends at  = 1 results in a probability  that the exit value at t=2 will
be . With probability 1 âˆ’  the exit value at  = 2 will be 0. We refer to  as the success
8

Other forms of financing like debt or preferred stocks will not change the main results of our model.
The investment 	 may be positive or negative. A negative 	 represents the case where there are
intermediate positive cash flows before the exit event at  = 2.

9

<-----Page 8----->probability. A higher success probability  corresponds to a more productive design stage. At
 = 0 the success probability  is unknown and is characterized by a distribution function ()
with an expected value .
We assume that entrepreneurs are motivated by both economic value considerations and
motivational factors. Value considerations imply that the entrepreneur's utility increases with the
venture's value. In addition, the entrepreneur draws utility from other aspects of the venture that
interact with his personal characteristics. We refer to these interactions as motivational factors.
For example, a venture that develops alternative energy increases the utility of an entrepreneur
who values a clean environment. Another example may be of an entrepreneur with a need for
achievement (McClelland 1961) that derives utility from a successful development of a treatment
for a previously incurable disease. In general, motivational factors may include the entrepreneur's
attitude towards risk (Shane and Venkataraman 2000), his need for achievement (McClelland
1961), tolerance for ambiguity (Schere 1982), benefit of control (Rotter 1966) and others. See
Shane, Locke, and Collins (2003) for a detail description of these factors. It is important to note
that some of these factors may create opposing effects. While benefit of control or need for
achievement will create positive value for an entrepreneur who develop a venture, intolerance for
ambiguity, risk aversion and fear of failure may create negative effects, and may require high
economic compensation to motivate a potential entrepreneur to become active.
As mentioned above, the actual utility that an entrepreneur draws from a venture depends
on the interaction of his specific motivational factors and the venture's specific characteristics.
For example, the same entrepreneur that care for the environment and draws high utility from a
venture that develop an alternative source of energy will derive low utility from a venture that
harm the environment. Clearly, to develop a venture like this, he will require a high economic

8

<-----Page 9----->value to compensate for the loss in utility.

Likewise, an entrepreneur with high need for

achievement will draw higher utility from a venture that put higher benchmark or higher
prestige. A "standard" venture will yield a much lower utility for him. For simplicity, we abstract
away from the issue of venture selection. We assume that each potential entrepreneur will have
a single potential venture. The interaction of the manager and the venture characteristics will
result in a single number  that represents the value of the entrepreneur's motivational factors,
 âˆˆ (âˆ’âˆž, âˆž). This number represents the utility to the entrepreneurs from the motivational
factors from developing the venture. We envision an economy with a large pool of entrepreneurs
with different motivational factors  and many ventures with different economic
characteristics. We assume that the cumulative distribution function of  across potential
entrepreneurs is () and that this cumulative distribution function is independent of the
distribution of ventures' economic characteristics.
The entrepreneur's utility consists of his share of the venture value and the level of
motivational factors he derives from the venture. For simplicity we assume that the
entrepreneur's utility function is additively separable and linear in the venture value and the
motivational factors as follows10
 =  + 	

where  is the entrepreneur's equity stake in the venture following the venture funding at  = 0
and  = 1, as explained below. The pre-seed round investor of  = 0 gets a stake 1 âˆ’ 	 of the

As described above, in general the entrepreneur's utility depends on the venture value  and a vector of
motivational factors, ( ,  ,  â€¦ . .  ) as follows:  = ( ,  ,  â€¦ . .  	, ). In this
respect,  of Equation (1) represents the utility the entrepreneur derive from economic value
considerations and  represents the level of utility he derives from the underlying vector of
motivational factors ( ,  ,  â€¦ . .  ) associated with the venture.

<-----Page 10----->venture at the time of its investment. The seed round investor of  = 1 gets a stake 1 âˆ’ 	 of the
venture at the time of its investment.11 The entrepreneur gets the remaining equity stake, 12.
The game evolves as follows. At  = 0 the structure of the game, , 	
 , 	 , () and 
are common knowledge to the entrepreneur and all potential investors13. The entrepreneur can
raise funds from three types of investors that differ in their information acquisition capabilities at
 = 1. The most informed investors learn at  = 1 if the venture will succeed or fail at  = 214.
The least informed investors donâ€™t learn new information at  = 1, and remains with the prior
beliefs (). The third type of investors learns at  = 1 the success probability , but does not
know whether the venture will ultimately succeed or fail at  = 2. We also assume that the
entrepreneur learns the success probability  at  = 1, thus he has the same information as the
third investor. In addition, once a pre-seed investment is made, the identity of the pre-seed
investor becomes public information.15
We refer to the most informed type as a "Venture Capital" () investor, and to the other
two types as "angel" investors. Further, we refer to an angel that learns  as an "Expert Angel"
( !), and to an angel that does not learn new information as a "General Angel" ("!). The
identification of the most informed type as a  investor is based on the fact that  funds
employ technological, product and market specialists that understand the product and its markets.
While the pre-seed investor gets 1 âˆ’ 	 at  = 0, it will be diluted at the seed round of  = 1 by 1 âˆ’ 	,
resulting in a final stake (1 âˆ’ 	).
12
Consequently, the claims on the final venture are , (1 âˆ’ 	), and 1 âˆ’  for the entrepreneur, the
pre-seed round investor and the seed round investor, respectively.
13
The analysis is identical if the entrepreneur motivational factors  are private information of the
entrepreneur.
14
A more realistic assumption would be that the most informed investor obtains an informative signal
about the probability of success that improves his information about the prospects of success or failure at
 = 2, relative to the success probability  obtained by the entrepreneur. Our simplifying assumption that
the most informed investor gets a perfect signal and knows the actual outcome that will prevail at  = 2 is
without loss of generality and was assumed for the ease of exposition.
15
In practice, the identities of all pre-seed investors are summarized in a "cap table" and are available for
current and future investors.

<-----Page 11----->An expert angel is a financier with some understanding of the product and its market, but his
knowledge is inferior to that of a VC, perhaps because it was involved in companies from the
same or closely related industry. A general angel is a financier with little or no knowledge of the
product and its market.16 We assume a competitive financing market with many "!#, !# and
#.
In what follows we solve the financing game by first analyzing the case where only 
financing is available in the economy (Section 3), where only ! financing is available (Section
4), and where only GA financing is available (Section 5). In Section 6 we analyze the case where
all type of financiers are available.

3. Venture Capital Financing
In this section, we consider the case where only  financing is available for the two
investments, 	
 and 	 . We first solve the seed financing problem at  = 1, taking the solution of
the pre-seed financing problem at  = 0, , as given. Recall that at  = 1 a  investor knows
whether the venture will succeed or fail at  = 2. Since ventures with 	 >  are not fundable,
the analysis that follows is constrained to ventures with  â‰¥ 	 	 . Consequently, a  investor
invests if the venture will succeed and does not invest otherwise. When the venture will succeed,
a  can recover its investment 	 , and thus it is willing to invest. When the venture will fail, a
 cannot recover its investment and thus it does not invest. Consequently, the entrepreneur's
expected utility at  = 1 after learning  but before approaching a  investor is

16

To focus on the implications of the structure of the entrepreneurial financing market on the matching
between entrepreneurs and financiers at the pre-seed and seed stages, we abstract away from the advising
and networking roles of start-up investors by implicitly assuming that all investor types have the same
contribution, so the exit value is independent of the financier type. This assumption is without loss of
generality and is made for ease exposition.

In Equation (2), the term  is the entrepreneur's expected share of the venture value.
It consists of the product of the entrepreneur's share of the exit value at  = 1, , and the
success probability . Similarly,  Ã—  is the expected value of the entrepreneur's
motivational factors. The assumption that financial markets are competitive implies that the 
share of the venture equals its investment 	 . Consequently,  is the solution to
(1 âˆ’ ) = 	 	 .

Rearranging Equation (3) yields

(4)

Substituting Equation (4) into Equation (2) yields that the entrepreneur's expected utility at  = 1
is

&'
= (( âˆ’ 	 ) + 	).

(5)

Equation (5) implies that the entrepreneur expects to obtain his share of the venture value before
the seed investment of  = 1, ( âˆ’ 	 ), plus the value of his motivational factors, , all
multiplied by the success probability .
Likewise, the pre-seed 's expected payoff at  = 1, before it learns whether the venture
will succeed, is

-&'

Equation (6) implies that the 's expected payoff at  = 1, before it learns whether the venture
will succeed, equals its share of the venture, (1 âˆ’ ), times the venture value before the seed
investment at  = 1,  âˆ’ 	 , times the success probability .

Equation (8) reveals that the venture is fundable by a  at the pre-seed round whenever

Substituting  from Equation (8) into Equation (5) and taking expectation with respect to 
reveals that the entrepreneur's expected utility at  = 0, provided that the venture is fundable, is

Equation (10) implies that the entrepreneur obtains the expected NPV of the venture plus his
expected value of his motivational factors.

4. Expert Angel Financing
We now consider the case where only ! financing is available for the two investments, 	
 and
	 . As before, we first solve the financing problem at the seed round, taking the solution of the
financing problem at the pre-seed round as given. Recall that at  = 1 an ! knows the realized
value of  but does not know whether the venture will succeed. Consequently, an ! invests at
 = 1 according to the venture expected value  Ã— . The ! invests if and only if  Ã—  â‰¥ 	 ,
that is, when he recovers his investment 	 . We define by ' the critical value of  above which
an ! will agree to fund the venture at  = 1. An ! breaks even if  Ã—  = 	 	 , implying that
+

' = ), .	 For any  < ' an

! does not finance the venture at  = 1, and the venture is

13

<-----Page 14----->liquidated. For  â‰¥ ' an ! finances the venture. In what follows we analyze this case. The
entrepreneur's expected utility at  = 1 after learning , provided that  â‰¥ ' , is

34
=  + 	.

(11)

The term  is the entrepreneur's expected share of the venture value. Similarly, 
is the value of the entrepreneur's motivational factors. The assumption that financial markets are
competitive implies that the ! share of the venture value at  = 1 equals his investment 	 .
Consequently,  is the solution to
(1 âˆ’ ) Ã—  = 	 	 .

(12)

Solving for  yields
=

0Ã—)*	+,
0Ã—)

.

(13)

Substituting Equation (13) into Equation (11) yields that the entrepreneur expected utility at
 = 1 is

34
= ( Ã—  âˆ’ 	 ) + 	.

(14)

Equation (14) states that at  = 1, the entrepreneur obtains his share of the expected venture
value net of the required investment 	 , plus the value of his motivational factors.
The pre-seed

! investor obtains its share of the expected venture value net of the required

investment of  = 1,17

.05 -34

(16)

Note that since the ! does not know whether the venture will succeed, there are two possible
inefficiencies at  = 1. First, when  < ' , the venture is not financed, resulting in value loss of the exit
value  when the venture would have succeeded. Second, when  â‰¥ ' , the venture is financed, leading
to a loss of 	 when the venture will fail.

17

14

<-----Page 15----->The LHS of Equation (16) represents the expected payoff to the pre-seed EA investor at  = 0
where expectation is taken over the success probability . For any  < ' the venture is

(17)

It follows from Equation (17) that the venture is fundable at the pre-seed round if


.05( Ã—  âˆ’ 	 ) /() âˆ’ 	 	
 â‰¥ 0.

(18)

Substituting  from Equation (17) into Equation (14) and taking expectation with respect to ,
implies that the entrepreneur expected utility at  = 0, provided that the venture is fundable at
 = 0, is




34
= .05( Ã—  âˆ’ 	 ) /() âˆ’ 	 	
 + (1 âˆ’ (' )).

(19)

Equation (19) implies that the entrepreneur's expected utility consists of the venture expected
NPV at  = 0 plus the expected value of the entrepreneur's motivational factors.

5. General Angel Financing
We now consider the case where only "! financing is available for the two investments, 	
 and
	 . Recall that a "! does not learn any new information beyond what he knows at  = 0.
Therefore, at  = 0 a "! has to decide whether to fund the entire investment 	 = 	
 + 	 	 or
refuse funding it. A "! funds the venture at the pre-seed round if the expected venture value at

 = 0, .
  Ã—  /() =  Ã—  is higher than the total investment:

: Ã— V â‰¥

(20)

The resulting expected utility at  = 0 for the entrepreneur is


: Ã— V âˆ’ 	
 âˆ’ 	 + .
<4

15

(21)

<-----Page 16----->Equation (21) implies that the entrepreneur obtains the expected NPV of the venture plus his
motivational factors. In this scenario, the entrepreneur obtains his motivational factors for sure
once he secures financing.

6. The Entrepreneur's Choice of Investor: Venture Capital, Expert Angel, General Angel
So far we considered  financing, ! financing, or "! financing in isolation. We now allow
the entrepreneur to choose the type of investor at each period. The entrepreneur will choose each
period the investor that provides him the highest expected utility. We first consider the case
where the entrepreneur chooses  financing at  = 0. Since the pre-seed  becomes an insider
of the firm, he learns at  = 1 whether the venture will succeed. This fact is common knowledge,
implying that if the entrepreneur approaches an angel investor at  = 1, the angel will infer that
the VC knows that the venture will fail and will not provide financing. Therefore, the only
remaining alternative for the entrepreneur is to seek  financing at  = 1. Consequently, the
analysis of this case is identical to that presented in Section 3 above. The entrepreneur obtains


 financing at  = 1 only when the venture will succeed, resulting in expected utility of &'

(see Equation (10)) to the entrepreneur at  = 0.
We now consider the case where the entrepreneur chooses

! financing at  = 0. The

analysis of this case is different from that of Section 4 above, as now the entrepreneur can also
seek "! or  financing at  = 1. "! financing is irrelevant at  = 1, as a "! will not finance a
venture that a better informed

! refuses to finance. Thus, we only need to consider the

entrepreneur's choice between  and

! financing at  = 1. If the entrepreneur chooses 


financing at  = 1, his expected utility is given by &'
of Equation (5)18. In contrast, the

! financing at  = 1 is given by 34
of Equation (14),

provided that	 â‰¥ ' . Otherwise, for  < ' the

! does not provide financing and the

entrepreneur's only option is to attempt a  financing. In this case, his expected utility is given
by Equation (5).
Finally, the solution of the case where the entrepreneur chooses "! financing at  = 0 is
equivalent to the analysis of Section 5, as the "! provides all funds necessary for periods  = 0
and  = 1, implying that the entrepreneur does not need to seek financing at 	 = 119.
Lemma 1 characterizes the entrepreneur's choice at  = 1:
Lemma 1
1. Suppose the entrepreneur obtains  financing at  = 0. Then, at  = 1 the entrepreneur
seeks  financing and obtains it iff the  learns that the venture will be successful.
2. Suppose the entrepreneur obtains ! financing at  = 0. Then, at  = 1, if  â‰¥ ' and
 âˆ’ 	 â‰¥ 0, the entrepreneur obtains

! financing. Otherwise, if  < ' or  âˆ’

	 < 0	 the entrepreneur seeks  financing and obtains it iff the  learns that the
venture will be successful.
Lemma 1.1 states that an entrepreneur that start with  financing will continue with 
financing at  = 1 as explained above. Lemma 1.2 states that an entrepreneur that starts with !
financing will continue with

! financing under two conditions: First, the

! is willing to

finance the venture ( â‰¥ ' ). Second, the entrepreneur prefers ! financing over  financing.
The benefit for the entrepreneur from  financing is from exercising the option to abandon at
 = 1 when the  learns that the venture will fail, saving 	 , out of which the entrepreneur's part
is 	 . In contrast,

! financing enables the entrepreneur to realize the motivational factors .

19

It is also possible that a GA will provide financing at t=0 for only the design stage, and the entrepreneur
will ask for VC financing at t=1. This possibility is similar to only VC financing, and thus, it is ignored.

17

<-----Page 18----->When the motivational factors are larger than the value to abandon,	 âˆ’ 	 â‰¥ 0, the
entrepreneur prefers angel financing.
We now consider the financing game at  = 0. There are two cases to consider, according to
the entrepreneur's preferences at  = 1:
Case 1:  âˆ’ 	 â‰¥ 0. In this case, the entrepreneur prefers ! financing. When the !
is willing to finance the venture,  â‰¥ ' , the entrepreneur obtains financing from an

!.

Otherwise, if  < ' the entrepreneur is forced to seek  financing. Consequently, the
entrepreneur's expected utility at  = 0 from ! financing is given by

The first integral in Equation (22) is the expected utility to the entrepreneur from 

Equation (23) represents the NPV of the venture under ! financing. The first integral is
the expected value under  financing at  = 1, while the second integral represents the
expected value under ! financing.
Case 2:  âˆ’ 	 < 0. In this case, the entrepreneur prefers  financing at  = 1. The
analysis of this case is equivalent to that of Section 3 where only  financing is available. The
entrepreneur's expected utility is given by Equation (10) and the venture is fundable if Inequality
(9) holds.
The Following proposition characterizes the equilibrium of the game:

18

<-----Page 19----->Proposition 1
1. Suppose Inequality (20) holds. Then,
a. If  > 	 , the entrepreneur obtains 	
 + 	 from a "! at  = 0.
+

b. If 	 >  > 	 âˆ’  + 01 , the entrepreneur obtains  financing at  = 0. At
 = 1 the entrepreneur seeks financing from a  and obtains it if the  learns
that the venture will succeed.
+

c. 	 âˆ’  + 1 > , the entrepreneur does not initiate the venture
0
2. Suppose Inequality (20) does not hold but inequality (23) holds. Then,
a. If  > 	 , the entrepreneur obtains

! financing at  = 0. At  = 1 the

entrepreneur obtains ! financing if  â‰¥ ' , and  financing if  < ' and the
 learns that the venture will succeed.
+

b. If 	 >  > 	 âˆ’  + 1 , the entrepreneur obtains  financing at  = 0. At

 = 1 the entrepreneur seeks financing from a  and obtains it if the  learns

venture will succeed.
+

b. 	 âˆ’  + 01 > , the entrepreneur does not initiate the venture.
4. Suppose Inequality (9) is reversed. Then, the venture is unfundable.
Proof â€“ See Appendix.
19

<-----Page 20----->In Proposition 1.1 all types of investors are willing to finance the venture at  = 0 and the
entrepreneur selects at  = 0 the type of investor that maximizes his expected utility. The benefit
for the entrepreneur from  financing at  = 0 is the value of the option to abandon the venture
at  = 1. This option saves the investment 	 when the  learns that the venture will fail. The
cost to the entrepreneur from the option to abandon is the loss of the motivational factors 
when the  learns that the venture will fail. Therefore, when the motivational factors 
exceed the investment 	 , the entrepreneur prefers angel financing. Since "! financing enables
the entrepreneur to capture his motivational factors with certainty, and

! financing has a

positive probability of losing the motivational factors, the entrepreneur selects "! over

!

financing at  = 0. In contrast, when the investment 	 exceeds the motivational factors , the
entrepreneur opts for  financing at  = 0, as long as his expected utility is positive. This
+

happens when ( +  âˆ’ 	 ) âˆ’ 	
 	 â‰¥ 0 or equivalently when  â‰¥ 	 âˆ’  + 1. Otherwise,
0

+

when  < 	 âˆ’  + 01 the entrepreneur does not participate in the entrepreneurship game, that
is, he does not initiate the venture20.
The difference between Proposition 1.1 and Proposition 1.2 is that under the conditions
of Proposition 1.2, a GA investor is unwilling to fund the venture. In this case, when the
motivational factors  exceeds the investment 	 , the entrepreneur opts for

! financing at

 = 0.
The coexistence of angel and  investors in the prtesence of entrepreneurs with  > 0
may be surprising at first because the "weak" investors - the investors with inferior information will not only survive in the market, but will also attract some of the best ventures. This is
Note that when 	 â‰¥ 0 the entrepreneur always initiate the venture, provided that he can secure
financing, which happens under the conditions of Proposition 1.1 â€“ 1.3. Only when  is negative
enough he does not enter the entrepreneurship game.
20

20

<-----Page 21----->because their "weakness" in terms of economic value is their "strength" in terms motivational
factors, as it enables entrepreneurs to capture their motivational factors with a higher certainty.
Perhaps paradoxically, this strength is due to the angels' weakness in learning the information,
and not due to exogenous advantages they may have.
Under the conditions of Proposition 1.3 only  investors are willing to finance the
venture at  = 0, and under the conditions of Proposition 1.4 no investor is willing to finance the
venture at  = 0.

7. The Impacts of Motivational Factors on New Venture Financing
Entrepreneurs' motivational factors heterogeneity is in the heart of our theory. We now use two
ways to gain insight about the impact of motivational factors on new venture financing. First, we
compare three hypothetical economies: one where  equal zero for all entrepreneurs, second
where  is positive for all entrepreneurs, and third where  is negative for all entrepreneurs.
Then we analyze changes in  in these hypothetical economies.
Starting with the hypothetical economy where  = 0 for all entrepreneurs, Proposition
1 implies that the more efficient financier, the , will finance all ventures. Moreover, in this
case, an entrepreneur participation decision and a  financing decision are fully aligned. If the
venture's > is positive, :
P Ã— (V âˆ’ 	 ) âˆ’ 	
 > 0, the entrepreneur wants to participate in the
entrepreneurship game and the  is willing to finance the venture. Otherwise, if the venture's
> is negative the entrepreneur is not interested in participating in the entrepreneurship game
and the  is not willing to finance the venture.
Contrasting the result above with the results of Proposition 1 when  can take positive
or negative values reveals the impact of motivational factors heterogeneity on new ventures

21

<-----Page 22----->financing. First, an entrepreneur with  > 0 prefers angel financing over  financing
whenever  > 	 . This alters the structure of the market for new ventures financing as it leads
to coexistence of both angel and  investors. In this respect, the market for new ventures
financing is structured to cater to heterogeneous entrepreneurs' needs. Second, an entrepreneur
with  < 0 and a positive > venture may choose not to participate in the entrepreneurship
game even though his venture is fundable.
We turn now to discuss changes in  in these hypothetical economies. Consider now
two entrepreneurs in an economy where all entrepreneur have positive . The ventures of the
two entrepreneurs have identical economic parameters but Entrepreneur 1 has higher  than
Entrepreneur 2. While the fundability conditions of the ventures are the same, regardless of ,
Entrepreneur 1 is more likely to secure angel financing as both ventures have the same 	 .
Consider now two entrepreneurs with identical ventures in an economy where all
entrepreneur have negative  and suppose that Entrepreneur 1 has higher  than
Entrepreneur 2. Each entrepreneur enters the market if the venture's positive NPV outweighs
their expected negative motivational factors, ? Ã— . Therefore, Entrepreneur 1 with the higher
 is more likely to enter the entrepreneurship game. Any entrepreneur that enters the
entrepreneurship game in this economy will be backed by a  investor. This discussion leads
to Proposition 2 below.
Proposition 2
1. Consider two economies where all entrepreneurs have positive  and the probability
distribution of  in the first economy, Q , stochastically dominates that in the second
economy, Q . All other venture characteristics are the same. Then, the fraction of angel

22

<-----Page 23----->backed ventures is higher in the first economy. Moreover, the total number of ventures
being financed is the same.
2. Consider two economies where all entrepreneurs have negative  and the probability
distribution of  in the first economy, Q , stochastically dominates that in the second
economy, Q . All other venture characteristics are the same. Then, more ventures are
being financed in the first economy. In both economies all ventures are financed by VCs.

Proposition 2 demonstrates that the effect of a change in the distribution of  have very
different implications to new venture financing depending on the specific entrepreneurial
environment. In an entrepreneurship oriented economy that is characterized by entrepreneurs
with positive , strong "animal spirit" etc., higher  for the entrepreneurs will not result in
more ventures being financed, but will tilt the financing towards more angel financing. On the
other hand, in an economy populated with potential entrepreneurs with negative  that are
lacking entrepreneurial aspiration or have entrepreneurial aversion, an upwards shift in  will
bring into the market potential entrepreneurs that were reluctant to enter. It is interesting to note
that the new incoming ventures in this case are not necessarily the economically marginal
ventures. It is plausible that a potential inventor with an innovation with a very high economic
potential will decide not to become an entrepreneur because of their highly negative .
Nevertheless, when  moves up enough, this inventor will decide to become an entrepreneur
and bring to the market his high economically potential venture.

23

<-----Page 24----->8. Empirical implications
Having characterized the equilibrium of the game, we now derive the empirical implications of
the model. The analysis of the equilibrium described in Proposition 1 reveals several empirical
implications that are summarized in Propositions 3 and 4 below.
Proposition 3
There are three possible sequences of financing a venture
1. Starting with an ! financing at  = 0 and either staying with ! financing or switching
to  financing at  = 1.
2. Starting with  financing at  = 0 and continuing with  financing at 	 = 1.
3. Financing the entire investment 	 at  = 0 by a "! investor.
Proposition 2 states that, whenever both  and angel investors finance early stage
ventures, the angel investor finances the pre-seed investment and the  finances the followup seed investment. This sequence of financing is consistent with the common wisdom that
angel investors tend to invest before  investors because, for example, angel investors don't
have enough resources to support both stages or that the pre-seed investment is "too small"
for  funds. In contrast, we obtain this result as an equilibrium outcome of the model where
we don't put any constraint on the resources available to angel investors and we don't have
"too small" investments for  investors.
Proposition 4 describes the implication of our theory to the likelihood that a venture will
be shut down at the seed round, depending on the identity of the pre-seed round financier.

24

<-----Page 25----->Proposition 4
Ventures that are backed by "! investors at 	 = 0 are less likely to be shut down at  = 1
than

! backed ventures, who in turn are less likely to be shut down than  backed

ventures.
GA backed ventures are never shut down in our model at  = 1 because GA investors
provide the entire investment at = 0. In the other extreme, VC backed ventures are shut down
whenever the VC learns that the venture will fail. EA backed ventures may be financed at	 = 1
even when the venture will ultimately fail whenever  â‰¥ ' .
We now consider the relations between new venture financing and the required level of
investment. We first consider a cross section distribution of the initial investment 	
 while
keeping other characteristics unchanged. Proposition 5 describes the empirical implications for
different values of the pre-seed investment.
Proposition 5
Suppose the only source of variation among ventures is the pre-seed round investment, 	
 .
Then:
1. "! investors finance ventures with a lower average initial investment 	
 and a lower
average total investment 	 compared to ! and  investors.
2. Angel investors, defined by the union of "! and ! investors, finance ventures with a
lower average initial investment 	
 and a lower average total investment 	 compared to
 investors.
We now consider a cross section distribution of the seed round investment 	 while keeping the
other monetary characteristics unchanged. Proposition 6 describes the empirical implications for
this case:

25

<-----Page 26----->Proposition 6
Suppose the only source of variation among ventures is the seed round investment 	 at  = 1.
Then:
1. "! investors finance ventures with a lower average initial investment 	 and a lower
average total investment 	 compared to ! and  investors.
2. Angel investors, defined by the union of "! and ! investors, finance ventures with a
lower average initial investment 	 and a lower average total investment 	 compared to
 investors.
We now turn to the relations between new ventures financing and the exit value by
considering a cross section distribution of the exit value  while keeping the other monetary
characteristics unchanged. Proposition 7 describes the empirical implications for this case:
Proposition 7
Suppose the only source of variation among ventures is the exit value . Then:
1. "! investors finance ventures with a higher average exit value  compared to ! and
 investors.
2. Angel investors, defined by the union of "! and ! investors, finance ventures with
a higher average exit value  compared to  investors.
Propositions 6-8 are the result of a simple feature of our model, namely, that the least
informed investor demands a higher stake in the firm, that is, he price protects itself against
inferior information. Consequently, angel investors will tend to finance ventures with higher
quality than the average quality of VC backed ventures. This has important implications to the
matching of ventures with financiers in different industries, at different points in the economic
cycles and for different geographical locations, as detailed below.

26

<-----Page 27----->1. Different Industries â€“ An industry with more attractive economic characteristics, e.g., lower
investment, higher average success probability and higher exit value, will exhibit a larger
fraction of angel-backed ventures and a lower fraction of VC-backed ventures.
2. Economic Cycles â€“ better periods in the economic cycle that exhibit higher expected or
perceived exit values will exhibit a larger fraction of angel-backed ventures and a lower
fraction of VC-backed ventures.
3. Geographic Locations â€“ geographic locations with better entrepreneurial eco systems will
experience a larger fraction of angel-backed ventures and a lower fraction of VC-backed
ventures.
It is conceivable that the idea that the needs of different entrepreneurs are catered by
different investor types may be implemented instead by financial contracts. This is not the case
in our model. Obviously "weak" investors cannot mimic the contract of "strong" investors, as
they do not have the required information. Therefore, the question is whether "strong" investors
() can offer contracts that mimic weak investors contracts. The answer is negative for the case
of an

! investors.  investors learn the exit value and have no idea what is the success

probability that ! investors might have learnt. Therefore, although  are better informed, they
cannot replicate ! contracts.
There may be also a commitment issue, as it may be impossible for  investors to
commit to not using information they have already learnt. In this respect, the only way to
implement financial contracts in this market is via the market structure we identify here, that
includes investors with different information, each providing the specific contract they are best
at.

27

<-----Page 28----->9. Conclusions
In this article we explain some important features of the market for entrepreneurial finance,
namely the use of both VC and angel financing, with the introduction of heterogeneous
motivational factors for entrepreneurs. These motivational factors affect entrepreneurs' decision
making beyond the effect of economic valuation, and seem to be important in this market.
Moreover, we argue that the market for new venture financing structures itself to cater for
different entrepreneurs. In this respect, heterogeneous entrepreneurs affect the structure of
financial markets.
We believe that our results are general and robust to changes and modifications of the
basic model, and, therefore, are applicable to many different economic environments. For
example, the exit value 	is viewed here as representing some distribution over the final value of
the venture, and assumed to be independent of the financier type. This reflects the assumption
that financiers have the same effect on ventures valuations. This can be easily extended to
accommodate different exit value distributions under different financiers, accommodating
additional role for the VC or the angel financier. The same is true regarding the probability of
success and its prior distribution.
It is an open question whether some of these results can be carried over to financial
markets of larger established corporations. Obviously, the dominant role that an entrepreneur
has over its venture is less pronounced than that of a CEO, dominant chairman, or controlling
shareholder of a large corporation. Nevertheless, in many cases managers, chairmen, or
controlling shareholders of large corporations are very important and powerful, and it is
conceivable that they have an influence over the corporate important decisions including
financing decisions in a way that affects the structure of the financing markets for large

28

<-----Page 29----->established corporations. In fact, some of the existing financial contracts may be viewed in this
fashion. For example, the choice between a bank loan and issuing public debt may depend on the
willingness of the manager to be monitored. This is not merely an agency issue, as some
managers will be more efficient if left unmonitored.
The existing agency literature takes the stance that there are different contracts or ways to
finance the firm, and the manger (or the shareholders) select the best one to suit their problem.
We suggest another way to look at it, namely, different financial contracts and institutions are
designed to cater for managerial needs. This distinction does not seem important when we
confine ourselves to agency issues alone. However, when we acknowledge the existence of many
different motivational factors, this approach greatly enhance our understanding of financial
markets, as we may be able to provide additional explanations to the existence of the various
institutions, contracts and financing strategies.

<-----Page 33----->Appendix â€“ Proofs
Proof of Lemma 1
1. Suppose the entrepreneur obtains  financing at  = 0. Then, from the discussion
preceding Lemma 1, an angel investor will not finance the venture at  = 1.
Consequently, the entrepreneur only option is to seek  financing, which he obtains if
the  learns that the venture will succeed.
2. Suppose the entrepreneur obtains

! financing at  = 0 and  â‰¥ ' . Then, by the

definition of ' , there is  âˆˆ [0,1] such that Equation (12) holds, and the ! is willing to
finance the required investment 	 at  = 1. Therefore, at this juncture, the entrepreneur


has to decide between ! and  financing. Comparing &'
of Equation (5) to 34
of

Equation (14), reveals that the entrepreneur prefers ! financing if  âˆ’ 	 â‰¥ 0. When
 âˆ’ 	 < 0, the entrepreneur prefers  financing. Since the  learns if the venture
will succeed before he finances the venture, the entrepreneur is only willing to provide
funding when he learns that the venture will succeed.
Suppose now that  < ' . Then, by the definition of ' , the ! does not finance the
venture. The entrepreneur's only option is to seek  financing, which he obtains if the
entrepreneur learns that the venture will succeed.
Q.E.D.

Proof of Proposition 1
1. Suppose Inequality (20) holds. It follows that Inequalities (23) and (9) also hold. Thus, all
investors are willing to finance the venture. The entrepreneur selects the investor that


maximizes his utility at  = 0. Consequently, it remains to compare &'
of Equation (10)




to <4
of Equation (21) and 34
of Equation (22).

There are two possibilities in this case.

 financing. This proves the first statement of part (1.b) of the proposition. The second

Proof of Proposition 3
The Proposition follows directly from Proposition 1.
Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4
The "! does not get any new information and, thus, he never shuts down a venture. The 
shuts down whenever he learns that the venture will fail. This happens with probability 1 âˆ’ :
P.
An ! backed venture is shut down whenever a  backed venture is shut down, except for the
case where  â‰¥ ' , in which case the ! finances the venture even when it will fail. Thus, the
probability that an ! investor shuts down a venture is lower than that of a .
Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 5
Let D+1 be the cumulative distribution function of

Consider all

investors. Inequality (A-1) implies that <4
> 34
if  âˆ’ 	 > 0 and inequality (A-2)




implies that &'

if  âˆ’ 	 < 0. Therefore, the entrepreneur will seek financing

from either a  or a "!. Since the distribution function  over  is independent of the
distribution function D+1 	over

region is (	 ) and of "! investment is 1 âˆ’ (	 ).
