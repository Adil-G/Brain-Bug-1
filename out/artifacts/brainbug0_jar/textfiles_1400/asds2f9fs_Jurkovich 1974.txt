<-----Page 1----->A Core Typology of
Organizational
Environments
Ray Jurkovich

Typologies of organizational environments have been essentially oversimplified representations of a complex phenomenon. This article presents a core typology consisting of 64
types which can be expanded depending on the user's
interest and problems. Different types of environments have
consequences for the planning of strategies, operations, and
tactics; coalition behavior; and decision making. Four hypotheses are used to describe organizational reactions to four
entirely different environmental situations. Some of the concepts have been drawn from frequently cited works and from
the author's analysis of case studies and management
journals. These together with a few concepts from systems
theory have been revised, defined, and discussed.

This article presents a typology of organizational environments and discusses the more relevant relationships. Although environments have been receiving increasing attention,
a set of widely accepted, related concepts which effectively
describe the subject has not been developed (Organ, 1 971).
Theorists, in discussing environments, tend to deal in vague
terms. A set of established, but more sharply defined terms
are presented here in a structured manner, resulting in a core
typology. This approach simplifies the subject area, avoiding
the case in which the number of possible relationships between phenomena is so large that central issues are obscured
by a mass of details.
Designing a typology under these conditions forces one to
emphasize the descriptive and deemphasize-or avoid-the
predictive features. Thus, a typology becomes an analytic
tool that may be applied as an instrument to stimulate thinking
on alternate directions in which decision makers can move
their organizations. The results might lead them to make
adjustments they would otherwise not attempt. Decision
makers, of course, do this anyhow, but a good tool can
facilitate the process. The next step is to develop predictive
statements which, if empirically supported, can make a
typology even more powerful.
The main effort here is not to create new concepts. A few
new notions are incorporated simply to provide analytical
distinctions that are felt to be of importance. In addition, a
lengthy review and comparison of the major terms is not
undertaken. Some relevant concepts are borrowed from the
most important works to date and these are modified for
greater clarity. Integration with other concepts is undertaken
for the purpose of broadening the current limited scope. Thus,
this article is essentially an excursion in broadening and
refining the existing parts of a conceptual puzzle and adding
a few others to contribute to a better understanding of the
whole.
THE EXTERNALENVIRONMENT
Two frequently cited works provide a basis for a general
description. Thompson's (1 967: 70-73) simple four-cell
typology and Lawrence and Lorsch's (1 967: 23-54) dichotomization of diversity and dynamic offer perceptions which
appear to be the same:

Both sets of authors discuss the problems of differentiation
between and adaption to directly related organizational components having different kinds of environments. Presumably,
the more disparate the environments with which two directly
related components are confronted, the more difficult it is to
integrate the components.
The typologies above are used here with revisions and additions. Homogeneity and heterogeneity, for instance, are included in the complexity continuum. Emery and Trist's
(1 965) typology is revised and incorporated in connection
with the change rate continuum. The end result is 64 types,
a list that can be further expanded by creation of additional
categories. The reason for working with the chosen variables
is that some of them occur persistently in the literature,but
they are presented in a very restricted context. Frequently,
attention has been concentrated on two major independent
variables when in fact others play an equally important role.
The terms used can be arranged to form the following matrix.

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
In designing action alternatives, decision makers or members
of scanning units must analyze a variety of environmental
factors or questions. Four major ones are (1 ) complexity
(2) the routineness or nonroutineness of a problem-opportunity state (3) the presence of organized or unorganized
sectors-elements or units of the environmental field (4) and
the issue of whether such sectors are directly or indirectly
related to the organization. Sectors refer to those elements
or units of behavior-human and nonhuman-in the environment that decision makers perceive as relevant for the organization. Environment is the total set of sectors outside of the

organizationwhich, in turn,is a role clusterbound together

381 /ASQ

<-----Page 3----->by a set of rules that prescribes behavior and establishes
sanctions when rules are violated.
COMPLEXITY
Child (1 972: 3) provides a definition of environmental complexity that can be used here: "Environmental complexity
refers to the heterogeneity and range of activities which are
relevant to an organization's operations." In other words, the
more diverse the relevant environmental activities and the
more there are, the higher the complexity. His meaning of
heterogeneity, however, is not clear. Duncan (1 972) deals
with environmental simplicity and complexity by considering
the variety of locations of decision factors, but just how the
various locations differ is assumed ratherthan explicitly stated.
Duncan's finding that heterogeneity has little effect on
uncertainty is hardly surprising if one interprets it on the
basis of Simon's (1 962) definition of complexity. Since in
Simon's terms complexity consists of simple pieces added
together, the effect of complexity on uncertainty will not be
significant. The way in which Buckley defines environment
perhaps offers another basis for the present purpose (1 967:
62, italics his):
The environment,however else it may be characterized,can be seen at
bottom as a set or ensemble of more or less distinguishable elements,
states, or events, whether these discriminationsare made in terms of
spatial or temporalrelations,or properties.Such distinguishabledifferences
in an ensemble may be most generally referredto as "variety."

Nevertheless, the meaning of variety is not simple. Complexity or noncomplexity is a question of perception and, as
Starbuck (1 973: 24) stated, "The same environment one
organization perceives as unpredictable, complex, and evanescent, another organization might see as static and easily
understood." Any inductively derived definition of complexity
results in a very abstract statement that is either too vague or
too trivial or both. In this article the terms complex and noncomplex refer to whether or not decision makers perceive
their environments as complex or noncomplex;' the terms do
not refer to any universal operational definition that might be
applied to a large sample of organizations.
Organizations dealing with noncomplex environments have
one advantage: there are fewer critically important information
categories necessary for decision making. When environmental sectors are essentially the same, the range of their
expected behavior, strategies and tactics, and formal goals
is easier to account for. Complex information systems are
not required for environmental monitoring, since the critical
information categories are limited even though the range and
size of the sectors can be large.
Organizations confronted with a complex environment must
come to grips with a memory problem. Since the human brain
has a limited capacity for retaining conscious information,
special units that can monitor individual or clusters of sectors
are required (Thompson, 1 967: 70). These units monitor the
activities of others and routinely report the behavioral patterns
to critical decision-making points that make decisions based
on that information and/or feed back requests for further
information and advice.
ROUTINE AND NONROUTINE PROBLEMOPPORTUNITY STATES
A decision maker can perceive parts of his environment as
posing a problem or offering an opportunity. The distinction
382/ASQ

<-----Page 4----->A Core Typology

between problems and opportunities need not be made here,
since problems can be perceived as opportunities and opportunities can quickly present their share of problems. Whatever
the case, decision makers can look at environmental problemopportunity states as being approachable as rountine or nonroutine activity. This idea is borrowed, with revisions, from
Perrow (1 970: 75-80) and March and Simon (1 958). A decision maker can approach an opportunity or problem by asking
whether his organization possesses the technologies, people,
cash reserves, and other resources to handle or solve a situation
without disturbing current activities. It can also be an uncertain
or risky adventure he thinks the organization can handle but
he is more speculative than realistic in his expectations.
Decision makers' perceptions of their environments depend
upon conditions in their own organizations, The process of
looking at the environment and comparing it with internal
resources can suggest alternatives permitting the organization
to take better advantage of opportunities it would otherwise
have to pass up.
Problem-opportunity states assume varying degrees of uncertainty. If decision makers approach a situation and find
that the analytical strategies resemble computational, judgmental or compromise, or inspirational strategies (Thompson,
1 967: 1 34), they know, at least subjectively, what degree
of uncertainty is attached to the problem. Computational
strategies assume a high degree of certainty; judgmental and
compromise strategies assume a moderate degree of uncertainty, but for different reasons; and an inspirational strategy
assumes a high degree of uncertainty. One can ascertain
quickly whether the organization can handle the situation as
a routine or a nonroutine activity on the basis of the strategies
which decision makers design.
The degree of routineness and nonroutineness might also be
determined by the state of the information problems. These
problems can take three forms: people complain that (a) they
cannot gain access to critical information, (b) they cannot
trust a significant portion of the information, or (c) the set
of information categories they need for decision making is uncertain. The higher the percentage of members with information
problems and the more severe those problems, the more
nonroutine the problem-opportunity state is.
Where noncomplex routine sectors dominate the environmental field, the basis for decision rests more on deductions
and inductions from the information itself. Specialists can
exchange opinions and arrive at a consensus much more
easily, rapidly, and completely and with greater certainty of
having made the right decision. Frequently, nonspecialists
can make the decisions, since there is an expected pattern
for which standardized or programmed decisions are available.
Faced with complex routine sectors, decision makers primarily devote their attention to the decisions themselves,
leaving the information gathering problems-mostly concerning quantity and range-to the decentralized monitoring
units. Manageability is a secondary problem.
Organizations with predominantly noncomplex, nonroutine
environmental sectors are faced with information problems
that cannot always be solved with a data bank. In this situation there is reliance on noncalculable judgments or advice
from specialists. Decision-making battles take place over
opinions. Information is uncertain or incomplete and reliability

and validitycannot be determined.
383/ASQ

<-----Page 5----->Faced with complex nonroutine sectors, decision makers
concentrate less on the decision and more on the information:
they must frequently negotiate, both directly and indirectly,
with those at the information source in an attempt to extract
better or more useful information than they have access to in
order to develop standardized decision program packages.
Experience in earlier but similar situations whose abstract
pattern resembles the current one is also an important resource here.
In this situation one indicator of managerial and executive
frustration could be their turnover rate or expressions of a role
occupant's continuous effort to establish alternative information sources in an attempt to reduce ambiguity in order to
survive or perform adequately. The interaction frequency of the
role occupant's information-monitoring units would be higher
and more intense in this case. This would be indicated partly
by the longer time involved and partly by a higher number of
conflicts. Finally, individuals would work with exceptions
more often than performing routine administrative tasks.
March and Simon (1 958: 1 51) and Ashby (1 968) have stated
that there appear to be limits to the amount of routine and
nonroutine activities and variety-complexity-that an individual can comfortably handle. This discussion suggests that
complexity and nonroutineness can impose limits on each
other. The amount of complexity might be limited by nonprogrammable activities and vice versa.
This notion may be equally valid when applied to the whole
organization. In other words, what are the limits of environmental nonroutine complexity an organization can handle
before entropy sets in? It could well be that the boundary of
entropy is expanded by such techniques as decentralization.
Centralization of large multigoal organizations requires much
more rule enforcement, and once faced with an uncomfortable
environment, it may be cheaper in the long run to allow
specific decisions to be made at lower levels. The whole is
greater than the sum of its parts. The boundary of entropy
can be expanded without changing the fact that the organization as a whole remains.
ORGANIZED AND UNORGANIZED SECTORS
Another important aspect of the problem is whether sectors
are organized or unorganized. Evan's (1 966) discussion of
organizational sets, an extension of Merton's role set, does
not include more cumbersome, unorganized situations.
Throughout this article the term sector is used to avoid excessive emphasis on interorganizational behavior. While
almost everybody has an organizational role, he also plays
nonorganizational roles. An important one, for instance,
comes under the category of customer. We are not organized
members of every organization. Almost everyone has only
one central organization in which he earns money to exchange for products and services produced by others. Frequently, we must satisfy certain kinds of criteria to receive
services-as patient or student, for instance-but customers
and clients generally do not perform any of the essential
activities of the supplying organization or strive for its goals,
nor do those organizations demand that they do so. An
organization's environment consists of more than organizational sets. Here, the term sector is used with a much broader
meaning: both organizational sets and categories which
represent unorganized individuals and groups are included.
Some organizations must concern themselves with the young,
384/ASQ

<-----Page 6----->A Core Typology

old people, or housewives; people in these categories are not
in an organizational role network in which interdependencies
are present.
An organized sector refers to another organization or cluster
of organizations covered by a formal rule set that is legitimate
only for the role set intended by those rules. An unorganized
sector refers to those actual or potential customers who use
the organization's goods and services but are not bound
together by formal or informal rules requiring patterned coordinated interaction to reach formally defined goals.
The most important distinction between the two is that
organized environments are generally easier to come to grips
with than unorganized sectors. For example, Rickson and
Simpkins (1972: 286) stated that "Firms are considerably
more secure in dealing with a work force represented by a
few unions than they would be if power among workers was
more dispersed and 'wildcat' strikes were common." Information about the limits of what an organized sector can do
and wants to do is more accessible and frequently is explicitly
stated in records or by official spokesman. An amount and
variety of information is generally available on a routine
basis that is not available from unorganized sectors. With the
latter, intervening organizations (for example, advertising and
market research agencies) or an intervening subsystem of the
organization is frequently required to conduct research to
assess the attractiveness or legitimacy of goals. Once a goal
has been assessed, decision makers can debate whether a
decision program should be chosen and, if so, which one,
after which they can discuss the necessary alterations or if
necessary, design new ones. The question is not whether
organized sectors exhibit more certain or uncertain behavior
than unorganized sectors; the problem is to locate the sources
of certainty or uncertainty in the exchange chain.
DIRECTLYAND INDIRECTLYRELATED SECTORS
The notion of directly related and indirectly related environments can contribute to the tracing of relevant problems.
Direct environments refer to those sectors with which the
organization exchanges without the use of intermediaries.
Indirect environments refer to those sectors which produce
goods and services or provide resources that must be acquired through intermediaries. An example of the latter is
found in government agencies, which contract out to an
organization which, in turn, contracts out to another to fulfill
contractual agreements beyond its own capacity. Such subcontracting firms cannot handle large projects, but specialize
in something that others do not. They can therefore get to
the resource base indirectly. Wholesalers are intermediaries
for retailers' organizations and retailers are often intermediaries
between wholesalers and customers.
Indirect sectors can also eventually function as direct sectors.
After an intervening market research organization has established which sectors have a need or desire for a particular
activity, the organization can work directly with those sectors.
This occurs frequently in multinational and intergovernmental
relations where two, three, and sometimes even more parties
are involved in negotiations. After the negotiations have been
successfully completed through indirect contact, formal, direct
relationships are often arranged. The fact that organizations
can design ways to get to indirect sectors is important since
there are all kinds of legal, political, ideological, and ethical
problems that can allow or disallow desired exchanges. For
385/ASQ

<-----Page 7----->instance, Perrow (1 970: 1 26) cited a case showing how
important it is to know the environment of a potential customer. A salesman from organization A wanted to sell something to C in a foreign country, but B was already doing so
and B was also supplying inputs into A that might have been
cut off had A decided to sell to C. Another good example,
provided by Sethi (1 972: 69-73), demonstrates the web of
direct and indirect relationships in which Coca Cola became
entangled between the United States and Israel when confronted with the decision to grant Israel a bottling franchise.
The notion of direct and indirect relationships might also
aid the theorist in defining the kinds of strategies and tactics
that organizations use to avoid conflicting spheres of
influence.
Finally, the more indirect an exchange sector is, the more
difficult it is to exercise control over or act upon that sector.
Identification of the interdependence series makes it possible
to design methods to alter the interdependencies in a desired
way. If the interdependencies cannot be altered or altered
only partially, knowledge of them can lead to ideas about
how the host organization could change its own structure,
policies, and goals to become at least more responsive.
ENVIRONMENTALCHANGE
Little has been said thus far about the movement of environmental sectors. On this point, Thompson (1 967), Lawrence
and Lorsch (1 967), Burns and Stalker (1 961), and Emery
and Trist (1 965) have made major contributions. Although
there are undoubtedly many ways in which an organization
might change, attention is limited here to formal goals, since
information about organizational goals can be obtained from
quarterly reports and other sources. This does not mean that
a study concerned with organization environments should
focus on goal changes. A change in the political situation,
law revisions, and even the weather might be more relevant
than goals. For example the 1 972-1 973 winter in the Netherlands was very mild and this just about put a few bootmaking
companies out of business. A study of formal goal changes
in environmental sectors might be relatively easy to conduct.
Unorganized sectors, however-made up of customers, for
example-have no such things as formal goals. One might
then examine needs, but this could also prove to be extremely
difficult to analyze. A more reasonable approach might be to
ask decision makers and boundary agents about the kinds of
ongoing changes that they perceive as the most relevant.
Environmentalchange-apart from internal influences-is an
important determinant of internal behavior. Organizations are
chiefly concerned with diagnosing changes, but they are no
less concerned with change rates and their own change rate
or timing capacity. One noticeable characteristic of the literature on organizational environments is the vagueness of the
discussion on the meaning of the term change rate. This
discussion attempts to bring operational clarity to the term.
Internalchange capacity is not explored here because the
body of literatureon the planning and the processes of internal
change lies mainly outside the scope of this article. The term
change rate will be used here in place of the notion of a
stable-shifting or dynamic environment. Change rate takes
into account the number of major goal alterations during a
given period. The higher the number of major goal alterations
over the same period, the higher the change rate; the lower
the number, the lower the change rate.
386/ASQ

<-----Page 8----->A Core Typology

Organizations can do one thing or a combination of things
in conjunction with their goals: add new ones, drop some,
and attempt to revise others. Consequently, change rates
should be defined to reflect this behavior. Even a rough
estimate of environmental change rates permits comparisons
that can facilitate diagnosis. For example, two competitors
may have completely different change rates, but the slower
organization may actually be doing better. It might be doing
the right thing at the right time, whereas the other may be
frantically trying to catch up or wildly seeking a better survival
base. Change rates are important indicators for the timing of
the delivery of new goals and services to the market.
At a more abstract, theoretical level, one can study the expansion and contraction between the types of goals-societal,
output, system, product, and derived-suggested by Perrow
(1 970: 1 26) and patterns between organizations. Knowing
what one's exchange units are doing and how they are
shifting can help an organization to keep up with its competitors.
Change rate can be dichotomized into low and high, with
these terms being defined relative to one another. Clusters of
organizations offering similar products and services may have
high change rates in comparison with other clusters, but
within clusters, too, there can be lows and highs, some of the
lows being closely equivalent to a high in another cluster.
Organizations should, however, be able to distinguish which
sectors and groups of sectors are moving rapidly, to avoid
competing with those whose pace could be difficult to equal.
Hage and Aiken (1 970: 33-38) have suggested that internal
complexity may lead to a high change rate, which implies
that at least two of the variables here are causally related. But
they speak of complexity among professional occupations
that could cause high change rates. They offer an explanation
for a certain type of situation. "However, the effect of this
form of complexity," to use Hall's (1 972: 1 51 ) words, "is
minimized when other organizational characteristics are examined." Interest in defining complexity is relatively new in
organizational theory. Hall's excellent summary points to the
variety of sociological approaches that have produced a
variety of results and interpretations, all of which are credible.
Stable and Unstable Change
Both low and high change rates can be dichotomized further
into stable and unstable rates. Stable rates occur in a situation
where most of the important factors influencing a situation
are changing predictably in value and where the set of critical
factors remains constant. Unstable rates take place when a
situation is loose and erratic. Here, both the value of important
variables-independent and intervening-and the kinds of
relevant variables in the set are changing unpredictably.
Instability can also be represented by an erratic step-function
and as Boulding (1 971 : 20) notes: "Many real systems are
governed by step-functions which at certain points display
changes in the relation of inputs to outputs, and because you
never quite know when steps are going to be taken, stepfunctions make the future terribly hard to predict." In addition, Ashby (1 954: 53) states, "Every stable system has the
property that if displaced from a resting state and released,
the subsequent movement is so matched to the initial displacement that the system is brought back to the resting
state." Thus, in unstable environmental conditions, unpredict-

abilityis increasing.Whileorganizationsmay be rational,
387/ASQ

<-----Page 9----->the participants can rationalize guesswork or speculate on
outcomes that are rationally induced. Participants may also
select information sets which, although originally perceived
as relevant, become the cause of tension and conflict as the
overlap between individual information sets diminishes. The
conflict frequently takes the form of debating about the use of
certain information units as well as about the outcomes.
The meaning of stability and instability is perhaps more problematic than organizational theorists are willing to admit. At
times stability is perceived as the opposite of movement or
change. Consider, for example, Thompson's stable-shifting
and Duncan's static-dynamic continua. A good example of
how theorists fuse the concepts of change rate and stable or
unstable environments is found in a recent article by Child
(1 972: 3) who referredto environmental variability as the
"degree of change that . . . in turn may be seen as a function
of three variables: (1 ) the frequency of changes in relevant
activities; (2) the degree of difference involved at each change;
(3) the degree of irregularityin the overall patterns of change
-in a sense the 'variabilityof change.' "
The first two variables are treated as change rate in the present
article. The third involves the stability or instability of an environment. This distinction is made so that the importance of
both can be appreciated.
There are four types of environmental movement: low, stable
change; high, stable change; low, unstable change; and high,
unstable change-all having different effects on an organization.
An organization with predominantly low but stable change
rate environmental sectors would be one in which the planning
of strategies, operations, and tactics can be expected to be
essentially trouble free, since predictability is greater where
uncertainty is low and fluctuates in a patterned way. Although
the environment changes, it does not change quickly and
long-range planning can be conducted without taking into
account any major environmental alteration during any
planned period.
Organizations with a low but stable change rate environment-the change rate remaining essentially constant but
tending to change-will be able to pursue their intentions,
but controlling the changing environmental factors becomes
more difficult. Internal buffer mechanisms become broader;
more roles are assigned to the filtering, coding, and interpreting of information; and current policies and technologies are
manipulated so that they can still be used. Older forms are
transformed into new versions under the mild threat of unfamiliar behavior. It is easier to rely on reformulated older
techniques than to invent new ones, especially when there
is a belief that they will work. In the absence of experience
with innovations, reformulation is about the only thing an
organization can resort to, and this is probably not dangerous.
Thus, with a low but unstable change rate, the planning of
strategies, operations, and tactics is not a serious problem.
It becomes more complex than dealing with a stable change
rate but not uncomfortably problematic. There are more kinds
of alternatives, the assumptions underlying each have to be
clearly outlined, and assumptions about when to switch to
other alternatives have to be more carefully examined.
Boundary role activity increases, too, in time and content;
the feedback interaction between boundary roles and buffer
units increases in number and time and the coordination of
388/ASQ

<-----Page 10----->A Core Typology

feedback loops must be given more attention. Finally, managerial coalitions are farther apart than in an organization with
predominantly low but stable changing environmental sectors.
Under stable conditions, conflicts can be resolved more
quickly and the resulting peace lasts longer. Under unstable
conditions, conflict resolution is more difficult and the subsequent period of cooperation is much shorter. The basis of
conflict lies in differences in the interpretation of information,
the use of different kinds of information, and the assignment
of different values, all of which appear appropriate. Political
activity increases but can be controlled. Subordinates demand
more responsibility in the form of contributing opinions. The
status of boundary roles also increases and threatens the
higher status role occupants unaccustomed to erratic environmental conditions.
High change rates and stable environments create difficult
problems for organizations, too, but for different reasons.
Since the change rate is increasing, timing and goal formulation-and reformulation-become crucial. Decisions about
what goals and services to add, decrease, or completely drop,
and how much of each and when, become frustrating. The
design of strategies, operations, and tactics can still be accomplished, but the design itself becomes a goal, that is, it
becomes a means of maintaining stability within the organization. Analytical methodologies gain in importance and both
routine and nonroutine search behaviors are instituted to find
newer or better methodologies offered in the environment;
more emphasis is devoted to searching for new ideas within
the organization.
Long-range planning is accomplished, but the plans become
more general. Incremental planning is adopted to reach the
alternative goals which have been generally outlined. The
question becomes one of what short-range alternative strategies, operations, and tactics are needed to reach every step
to every alternative goal and then when one step is completed, changes in the initially planned strategies, operations,
and tactics must be considered. Plans are held open and
subject to change, but they are not impossible to construct.
Conflict between coalitions arises not only over what and
when but also the methodologies considered and stability
within coalitions diminishes. Coalitions are loose and changing;
they resemble the intersector change rate and instability in
the environment (Cyert and March, 1 963: 39).
Because the change rate is high, the frequency of interaction
between occupants of boundary roles, decision-making
centers, and buffer units is high. Whenever efficiently possible,
information is sent directly to decision makers on a continuous
basis so that changes in the environmental change rates can
be detected with immediacy. Monthly and quarterly reports
become old news as the emphasis is on shorter intervals.
Decision makers often spend more time in familiarizing themselves directly with the sectors in order to better understand
and anticipate changes. To facilitate muddling through, they
attempt to assign subjective probabilities to possible changes
sometimes by using industrial spies but more often by establishing informal contacts with executives in other organizations and with relevant, indirect information channels within
sectors.
Organizations with environmental sectors characterized by
instability and high change rates live on the brink of chaos.
Rittel and Weber (1 973) discussed the problems encountered

in planningin this type of environment.Some of the following
389/ASQ

<-----Page 11----->ideas resemble many of those they developed. Situations
change rapidly and unpredictably. No matter how exhaustive
and reliable information is, it tends to increase the potential
for conflict. Strategies, operations, and tactics in environmental sectors reach such levels of generality and abstraction
that counter moves cannot be specifically defined over the
long run without allowing for radical, spontaneous revisions.
Methodologies are sought which provide a neater, more complete picture. The rise of PPBS-Planning, Programming,
Budgeting Systems-in the last 1 5 years represents an attempt to establish a more precise view of the general situation.
Intensive effort to reduce or transform complexity, in unpredictable, rapidly changing organized and unorganized environmental sectors, is intended to yield a more certain view
of the situation. Another indicator of the above is the growing
interest and application of General Systems Theory, in which
the study of wholes is stressed.
Organizations in this state design coping tactics, mainly in
the form of decentralization and multidisciplinary research
units, in the hope that more specific planning will emerge.
Because of increasing interaction, the boundary roles, roles
in buffer systems, and executive roles tend to fuse. This is by
no means a stable fusion. The structure of the fused roles
drifts in unstructured ways. Occasionally, boundaries are
temporarily closed to permit analysis of what has taken place
and to generate more standardized decision programs, however short lived they may be.
Frequently, when environmental sectors make impossible
demands on the organization, the organization does nothing
or repeats unsatisfactory, standardized behavior. When the
organization does nothing, decision makers fear the risk involved in the disparity between its means and the demands
made. A sort of cognitive dissonance develops and the
decision makers retreat to safe ground. When organizations
repeat standardized behavior, even though it is known to be
unsatisfactory to the sectors, they are reflecting trained incapacity. Is it any wonder that organizations are charged
with conservativism? In the face of instability and rapid
change in the environment-mainly in the unorganized sectors
of society-large investments or safe investments are made
to stabilize the organization.
Each decision maker uses his own model of the situation,
unrelated to the models of his peers, and consequent discussions become tense political debates. Internal and external
consultants are often called for analysis and advice in an
effort to keep the organization together. In the last few years
process consultation (Schein, 1 969) has been developed.
One important purpose of this method is the cooling off of
relations between people. This, of course, does not eliminate
the basis of conflict, but it at least contributes to the development of mutual understanding and thus enhances the growth
of the members' capacities for mutual tolerance.
When an organization is not afraid of its environment, it can
and does plan strategies, operations, and tactics, but frequently on a coping basis. Problem solving is replaced by
problem coping. Problems are never completely solved and
people are forced to learn to live with the consequences of
the unsolved aspects of problems. Some resources are always
kept in reserve for investment in initially high-risk goals that
start to prove themselves. New Venture Teams (Wileman and
Freese, 1 972) are set up solely to produce new ideas which
keep the organization going.

<-----Page 12----->A Core Typology

Organizations generally gravitate towards stability or at least
find it preferable. A highly unstable and rapidly changing
environment can be perceived as dangerous. Most organizations try to avoid it and if that proves impossible, they either
manipulate it to increase its stability or develop methods to
maintain or restore internal stability. On the other hand,
organizations may temporarily opt for a chaotic situation to
loosen crystallized-ultrastable-or boring situations to get a
larger share of a market, to create new ones, to extend
services to other sectors, and so forth.
This discussion of change and stability resembles in part the
notions offered by Emery and Trist (1 965), who develop a
typology consisting of four types: placid-random, placidclustered, disturbed-reactive, and turbulent. They stated that
the order of the four types constitutes an ascending order of
uncertainty. Nevertheless, for the first and fourth types, the
uncertainty seems to be about the same for different reasons.
A placid-random environment is characterized by discrete
sectors. There is no interdependency chain, but if there is, it
is temporary and changes randomly. With a turbulent environment, the rapid movement and the complexity of relations
are uncertainty sources.
There is a great deal of overlap between strategies and tactics
associated with the first type. The fourth type is characterized
as an environment in which general rules are substituted for
strategies, operations, and tactics. The more general and
abstract a discussion becomes, the more overlap there is
between categories, thus further supporting the suggestion
that the two types are similar. General rules and overlapping
strategies and tactics appear to be essentially the same. If
this is an ascending order of uncertainty, as the authors have
suggested, why have they suggested an ascending order of
more certain means to reduce the environmental uncertainty?
The ascending order of certain organizational means with
increasing environmental uncertainty applies only to the first
three types: type 1, intermingling of strategies and tactics:
type 2, development of strategies and tactics; and type 3,
strategies, operations, and tactics. Organizational means
become more complex in the face of environmental uncertainty, but not more certain. If one does not understand
the situation with which he is confronted, he can expect to
have problems in handling it (March and Simon, 1958: 140).
It is reasonable to assume that under conditions of uncertainty, goal setting and means are also more uncertain and
complex, since there is an obvious resemblance to the problems of handling increasingly difficult environments.
In spite of these difficulties, some of the terms offered here
suggest a revised scheme that makes use of a few of Emery
and Trist's (1 965) concepts.

<-----Page 13----->SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The following four propositions will serve to sum up the
extreme types of organizational environments discussed.
(See figure.)
(1) Organizationswith type 1 environmenthave relativelyminorinformation problems;can design long-range strategies, operations, and tactics
more easily-more rapidlyand in more detail-and implementthem
without majoralterations;have relativelylittle internalconflict potential;
possess a more mechanicalstructure;have clearlydefined and predictable,
graduallychanging coalitions; and have relativelyfew problemswith
their existing decision-making programswhen the environmentchanges.
(2) Organizationsconfrontedwith a type 49 environmentexperience the
same problemsas do those with a type 1 environment,but they experience
a higher degree of uncertaintyconcerning timing in the control of internal
problemstates.
(3) Organizationsconfrontedwith a type 64 environmenthave major
informationproblems;have very abstract,tentative sets of strategies,
operations,and tactics and cannot execute them without expecting major
alterations;have very vague coalitions that change unpredictably;and are
constantly redesigningdecision-making programsor constantly making
exceptions to existing decision-making programs.
(4) Organizationsconfronted with a type 16 environmenthave the same
problemsas are experienced by organizationswith a type 64 environment, but they are able to predictand control internalproblemstates
much more easily.

This typology is not a matrix of interdependencies; each cell
represents a different situation. It is offered as a core typology,
since other dimensions can be added. For example, the direct
category might be further subtyped to include friendly competitor, unfriendly competitor, neutral competitor, and the like
to obtain an even better idea of how organizations mutually
adjust their negotiating styles.1
In addition, a typology of environments may be useful in
bringing out the fact that certain classes or organizations more
rightfully belong to certain kinds of environments. If this is
true, a fresh start might be made with organizational typologies, arrivingat something considerably more powerful than
what is presently available. That is, more useful organizational
typologies might be derived by first examining the different
environmental situations organizations encounter and then
and only then, constructing an organizational typology with
types possessing internal organizational characteristics that
are reasonably unique to a particularorganization environment.
More than a decade ago Dill (1 962) noted that typologies of
environments were nonexistent. Even though the literature
on organization-environment relationships has been growing
and has added a great deal of useful informatin for both theory
and practice, a reasonably comprehensible typology has yet
to appear. The typology developed above can be seen as an
instrument to map the rates and direction of environmental
movements, that is, how different kinds of sectors in different
locations are moving with respect to each other.
I
A set of formal operationalized hypotheses
has not been developed here, because the
purpose was to theoretically establish a
descriptive core typology. Informalhypotheses have, however, been used to
demonstrate how organizations might react
to various kinds of environmental situations. Some of these informal hypotheses
were supported by examples, others by
reference to other studies, and a few by
speculative logic.

Knowing the environmental map or the direction of its movement may mean switching from one type of strategy and tactic
to another. The decision to cooperate, coopt, be coopted,
enter a coalition, drop out, or opt for conflict, could be
partiallydependent upon the environmental state (Thompson
and McEwen, 1958). Lammers (1974) has developed a
typology of strategies and tactics used by university authorities
to counter student opposition. These strategies and tactics
are applicable under certain kinds of conditions; mixed forms

The exchange currencies-power, status,
money-and their combinations are not
included, but it would be interesting to
see how organizations and their sectors
manipulate their resources and those of
others within various situations. The ideas
of llchman and Uphoff (1 969), Haas and
Drabek (1 973: 224-228), and Blau (1 966)
provide a set of theoretical notions which,
unfortunately, are too complex for this
article.

are also possible under mixed conditions and when the
conditions destabilize or change, the mixed forms should
congruently change.
General conditions can also influence environmental maps,
as Hall (1 972: 298-31 2) has pointed out. This effect is easily
observed in cross-cultural studies. For instance, anyone
familiar with the management journals knows that business
negotiations with the Chinese and Russians are prolonged,
detail-ridden exercises that appear to be attempts to keep an
agreement stable even if conditions should happen to change.
Recessions, inflations, changes in political regimes, and
cultural factors can all cause organizations to change relations
and alter the change rates. Even the possibility of an unfriendly political personality not yet formally in office can
influence the situation. George McGovern's candidacy, for
instance, was perceived by many people as one of the
principal causes of a drop in the stock market. The launching
of new products may be postponed because demand could
diminish during a recession. On the other hand, new or revised products may be created to exploit whatever limited
resources there are. Foreign investments may be curtailed in
countries where a political regime is considering a nationalization program and this may create a partial chain reaction with
directly and indirectly related sectors.2
Follett (Metcalf and Urwick, 1 957) pointed to a dialectical
phenomenon in organizational behavior: solved problems
create new ones. With the suggested typology, one may be
able to locate the source of problems to better study this
phenomenon and to design appropriate models of problem
states with a complex set of acceptable controls that could
prevent the ongoing succession of crises.
Pushing problems off on other sectors only removes the
symptoms from one sector and leaves the agony of treating
the causes to someone else which may, in turn, create even
larger problems for another sector. A good example of the
latter occurs when measures to prevent robberies and stealing
are instituted: it is hardly to be expected that criminals with
criminal skills will change to honest work just because one
kind of resource base has disappeared. Suppression of the
symptom does not cure the disease; the suppressed symptoms
simply appear elsewhere, compounding already existing
problems or forming a new set.
