Abstract
This six-year study of new venture growth continues renewed research about the effects
of entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics. I applied goal theory and social-cognitive theory to
propose that entrepreneurs’ personal traits and general competencies cause new venture growth
indirectly through situationally specific motivation mediators. Data about traits (passion and
tenacity), competencies (opportunity recognition and organization skill), motivation (goals and
self-efficacy), and new venture growth were collected in 1993. Performance data were also
collected in 1998 enabling a longitudinal study of 242 respondents from a single industry.
Structural equation modeling confirmed the mediation hypotheses.

Motivation Mediators of
Entrepreneurs’ Personal Characteristics and
New Venture Performance

Some traits and motives of successful entrepreneurs were identified in past
entrepreneurship research; however, the relationships with venture performance were weak
(Aldrich & Wiedenmayer, 1993; Begley & Boyd, 1987; Johnson, 1990). Although research
about entrepreneurs’ general competencies (general knowledge, skills, and ability) found
significant performance relations (Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Hood and Young, 1993),
organization and industry variables dominated the direct relationships with new venture
performance (Sandberg and Hofer, 1987).
These weak results for the effects of entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics are surprising
given the importance placed upon new venture founders’ traits and competencies by venture
capitalists (MacMillan, Siegel, & SubbaNarisimha, 1985). Indeed, reviewers of new venture
business plans value founding team complementary competencies and founder passion and
tenacity (Baum, forthcoming). Furthermore, personal theories about the importance of heroic
personalities for business success abound, even among successful entrepreneurs themselves
(Locke, 1997; Sexton, 2001).
Goal theory (Locke & Latham, 1990) and social-cognitive theory (Bandura, 1997) offer
an explanation of this anomaly. In part, these theories propose that personal characteristics are
determinants of goal-setting and self-efficacy, which in turn, affect performance. I applied this
viewpoint to the entrepreneurship case.
As shown in Figure1, I proposed a theoretical model wherein situationally specific
motivation (goals and self-efficacy) mediates the effects of entrepreneurs’ traits (passion and

<-----Page 3----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

4

tenacity) and general competencies (opportunity recognition and organization skill) upon new
venture growth. New venture performance was indicated by six-year sales and employment
growth. I chose growth as the dependent concept because entrepreneurship researchers point to
growth as the most used and most crucial indicator of new venture survival and economic gain
(Bygrave, 1995; Covin & Slevin, 1997; Lyon, Lumpkin, & Dess, 2000).

Thus, the overarching purpose of this study was to test whether motivation mediation
theory can explain why past entrepreneurship research had not confirmed experienced
practitioner and investor beliefs about the importance of entrepreneur’s personal characteristics
for new venture success. In addition, I wanted to contribute to renewed research efforts about
the effects of entrepreneurs' personal characteristics on their businesses (Baum, Locke, & Smith,
2001; Baron, 2001; Frese & Krauss, 2001; Rauch, 2001).
A contribution of this research is that it draws attention to the importance of
psychological concepts for understanding entrepreneurship. It also points to the usefulness of
studying indirect causal paths among psychological concepts that may be distant in terms of
causality from organization concepts. Furthermore, it may remind psychology researchers of
the opportunities within the entrepreneurship setting for exploring fundamental individual to
organizational relationships. Typically, new ventures are simple organizations that are
reflections of the personal vision, mission, values, strategies, and goals of the founders or new
venture teams (Baum, Locke, & Kirkpatrick, 1998.).

This longitudinal study is among the first to explore the relation of personal
characteristics and new venture growth with motivation mediators. Entrepreneur / CEOs of the
architectural woodwork industry were sampled; I only included active entrepreneur/CEOs who
had growth aspirations for their young (up to 8 years old) firms (Galbraith & DeNoble, 1992;
Shrader & Simon, 1997)
The contribution of the study is that results should help academics develop more
complete frameworks to explain entrepreneurship success. Furthermore, it offers guidance for
those who must evaluate the prospects of founders or new venture teams. The usefulness and
validity of the study is supported by (1) its six-year longitudinal design (1992 to 1998 data), (2)
verification of CEO reporting of independent variables with subordinate reports, and (3)
verification of CEO reports of financial accounting performance with Dun and Bradstreet
reports.
The paper begins with a discussion of goal theory and social-cognitive theory to support a
direct effects hypothesis about situationally specific motivation and venture growth. Traits and
competencies research is reviewed to explain the choice of concepts to represent these domains
and to support hypotheses that traits and competencies affect growth directly. The hypotheses
that traits and competencies affect motivation are derived from goal and social-cognitive
theories. Taken together, these hypotheses enable a test for mediation. Thus, research questions
for the test are: (1) Do traits and competencies affect motivation? (1) Does motivation affect
new venture growth? (3) Are the direct effects of traits and competencies upon new venture
growth reduced when the relation of traits and competencies with motivation is included in the
test? If all three are true, mediation is confirmed.

Theory and Hypotheses
Situationally Specific Motivation Affects New Venture Growth
Goal theory, which posits that specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than
other types of goals, has demonstrated more scientific validity than any other motivation theory
(Locke & Latham, 1990) and has the greatest scope (Landy & Becker, 1987). Task specific
performance goals have been found to affect performance across a wide range of tasks and
situations. Indeed, entrepreneurship researchers cite goals as an important factor in new venture
growth (Covin & Slevin, 1997; Krueger & Dickson, 1994; Shaver & Scott, 1991) and new
venture survival (Carsrud & Krueger, 1995; Greenberger & Sexton, 1988; Low & MacMillan,
1988; Scherer, Adams, Carley, & Wiebe, 1989).
Social-cognitive theory views motivation as involving a triadic reciprocal causality
among personal, environmental, and behavioral factors (Bandura, 1986). A core concept in
social-cognitive theory is self-efficacy, defined as task specific self-confidence (Bandura, 1986;
1997). Self-efficacy reflects not just past experience and attainments, but, more importantly, the
conclusions one has drawn about one’s capacity for performance attainment from these past
experiences. Entrepreneurship theorists have found that self-efficacy is relevant for
entrepreneurship research because it deals with conditions of uncertainty, risk, and challenge,
which are typical of the entrepreneurship situation (Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Chen, Greene, &
Crick, 1998; Krueger & Dickson, 1994; Scherer et al., 1989). Studies have found self-efficacy
to be a critical determinant of performance (Bandura, 1997; Scherer, Adams, Carley, & Wiebe,
1989). Indeed, self-efficacy plays a causal role in future performance independent of its relation
to past performance (Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998). Thus, I propose:

<-----Page 6----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

Hypothesis 1: The greater the entrepreneur/CEO’s situationally specific motivation in
terms of growth goals and self-efficacy, the greater the new venture growth.

Traits Affect New Venture Growth
Personality traits are dispositions that are relatively stable across time and setting.
Motives move people to action. As noted, some traits and motives of successful entrepreneurs
have been identified (e.g., need for achievement, locus of control, risk-taking propensity, and
tolerance of ambiguity); however, these concepts have typically produced weak relationships
(less than 7% of the variance) with venture performance (Aldrich & Wiedenmayer, 1993; Begley
& Boyd, 1987; Brockhaus & Horwitz, 1986; Low & MacMillan, 1988). Even recent statistically
sophisticated attempts to show the relevance of risk-taking and tolerance of ambiguity in direct
entrepreneurship performance relations have produced weak results (Teoh & Foo, 1997). To
minimize the possibility that the wrong traits have been studied (Carsrud & Krueger, 1995) we
looked for traits/motives:(1) that are referenced and/or tested repeatedly by contemporary
leadership researchers as important for success [(Entrepreneur – leader personality profiles have
similarities (Timmons, 2000)], (2) that fit the entrepreneurship context according to
entrepreneurship researchers, and (3) which have not been among the weak trait predictors in
past entrepreneurship studies.
With these guidelines in mind, we found that contemporary leadership researchers (Bass,
1990; House & Howell, 1992; Locke, 1997; Locke et al., 1991; Smith & Harrison, 1986, Yukl,
1989) have identified tenacity, passion, goal-striving, and self-confidence as characteristics of
successful leaders. We decided to study tenacity and passion as potential trait predictors of
venture growth because entrepreneurship researchers have pointed to their likely performance

<-----Page 7----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

8

implications and there were no discouraging empirical entrepreneurship studies. We decided to
treat goal-striving (goals) and self-confidence (self-efficacy) as situationally specific motivation,
a research domain that is distinct from the trait research domain (e.g., The concepts are measured
with respect to specific conditions, such as, “I want to achieve growth of 15% per year for the
next 3 years”, rather than as general predispositions, such as “I like to achieve goals”.).
Tenacity involves sustaining goal-directed action and energy even when faced with
obstacles; it is similar to persistence, and it involves endurance and determination. In addition to
being associated with effective leadership (Bass, 1990; House & Howell, 1992; Locke, 1997;
Smith & Harrison, 1986, Yukl, 1989), tenacity has been identified consistently as an archetypical
entrepreneurship trait (Gartner, Gatewood, & Shaver, 1991; Ronstadt, 1984; Sexton & BowmanUpton, 1991; Timmons et al., 2000). Indeed, Cooper (1993) pointed to tenacity/determination as
an understudied entrepreneurship trait that venture capitalists value highly when they make
investment decisions.
Passion for work, or love of one’s work (which is not necessarily independent of the
previous trait), has been identified by Locke (1997) as a core characteristic of business heroes
(i.e., great wealth creators) such as Walt Disney, Ken Iverson (Nucor), Sam Walton (Walmart)
and Mary Kay Ash (Mary Kay). House and Howell (1992) cite passion as a trait of successful
charismatic leaders. In addition, Smilor (1997, p 342) suggested that passion is “...perhaps the
most observed phenomenon of the entrepreneurial process.”, and Bird (1989, p 7-8) noted that
entrepreneurial behavior is “... passionate, full of emotional energy, drive, and spirit.” Passion
can be seen over time, in the long hours worked during venture start-up and growth phases and in
the tendency for entrepreneurs to experience their venture’s successes and difficulties as personal

<-----Page 8----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

9

events. To my knowledge, passion has not been measured in any quantitative studies of
entrepreneurship. Thus, I predicted:
Hypothesis 2: The greater the CEO’s traits, in terms of tenacity and passion for work, the
greater the new venture growth.

General Competencies Affect New Venture Growth
“Competencies” refers to the underlying individual characteristics such as knowledge,
skills, and/or abilities required to perform a job.1 I studied “general” competencies rather than
“specific” (i.e., specific industry knowledge or specific task skill) competencies because, like
general traits and motives, general competencies have exhibited weak and nonextant direct
relationships with new venture growth (Baum, Locke, & Smith, 2001). In contrast, specific
competencies such as task specific skill and industry skill have significant relations with
entrepreneurship performance (Baum, Locke, & Smith, 2001; Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Herron
& Robinson, 1990); however, other researchers have shown that even specific competencies are
dominated in direct effects studies by organization level concepts (Sandberg, 1986).
I surveyed the management/leadership literature, searching for general competencies that
have consistent support in management/leadership research as causes of business performance. I
also surveyed entrepreneurship theory and research to find competencies that have been
1

While not used as such in this study, firm-level “competencies” is a parallel concept

used by strategic management and economics researchers. In those fields, it represents tangible
or intangible bundles of firm resources, including organizational knowledge, skills, and abilities,
as well as financial and “real” resources. In addition, some researchers view traits and motives
as general competencies, but we treat traits and motives separately.

<-----Page 9----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

10

referenced repeatedly as likely causes of successful venture establishment and subsequent
growth, and which have been supported with empirical research in the entrepreneurship context.
Both management/leadership and entrepreneurship researchers have found that general
competencies predict business performance. Boyatzis (1982) performed a comprehensive study
of over 2000 managers and identified and assessed over a hundred potential competencies; he
found performance relationships for organization skills: oral presentation, decision-making,
conceptualization, diagnostic use of concepts, and use of power. Other theorists have presented
models of leadership and management that reveal general agreement with Boyatzis' (1982) array
of important “general” organizational skills (Locke et al., 1991; Yukl, 1989): communication,
network-building, conflict management, decision-making, and goal-setting.
Entrepreneurship theory and studies of entrepreneurship competency have developed
general skill/ability clusters that are similar to those found in management/leadership theory
(Bird, 1995; Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Herron & Robinson, 1990; Hood & Young, 1993).
However, opportunity recognition appears in these studies as an important additional skill. Thus,
I predicted:
Hypothesis 3: The greater the CEO’ competencies, with respect to organization skill and
opportunity recognition skill, the greater the venture growth.

Traits and Competencies Affect Motivation
Motivation theorists (Locke & Latham, 1990) have suggested that personality traits affect
goals. Indeed, Locke (in press) has shown that situationally specific goals mediate the effects of
general traits on organization outcomes. Furthermore, Bandura’s thesis that behavior and

<-----Page 10----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

11

personality are codeterminants suggests that the second motivation concept studied here, selfefficacy, is determined, in part, by personality traits and skills (Bandura, 1997).
Entrepreneurship theorists proposed that entrepreneur’s goals are reflections of their
personality (Bird, 1993; Naffziger, 1995) and entrepreneurial knowledge, skills, and ability
(Bird, 1989). Furthermore, they propose that self-efficacy is determined partly by personal
competency (Naffziger, 1995). Thus, I propose:
Hypothesis 4: The greater the CEO’s traits in terms of tenacity and passion for work, the
greater the entrepreneur/CEO’s situationally specific motivation in terms of goals and
self-efficacy.

Hypothesis 5: The greater the entrepreneur/CEO’s general competency in terms of
opportunity recognition and organization skill, the greater the entrepreneur/CEO’s
situationally specific motivation in terms of goals and self-efficacy.

Furthermore, I expect the direct effects of traits and competencies upon new venture
growth as hypothesized in H2 and H3 will be diminished when their indirect effects upon
motivation are also considered per H4 and H5. This condition will confirm that traits and
competencies are mediated by motivation (Baron & Kenny, 1986).
Hypothesis 6: The size of the direct effects of traits and competencies upon new venture
growth will be less when the effects of traits and competencies upon motivation are tested
simultaneously.

Controls
I included four controls to clarify the relations among traits, competencies, motivation,
and new venture growth. (1) A single industry was studied to avoid confounding by industry
type and industry-specific environmental conditions (Brush & VanderWerf, 1992). (2) Venture
age was controlled because age has related with venture performance in many entrepreneurship
studies (Low & MacMillan, 1988). (3) Venture size was controlled because hundreds of studies
have found that size can systematically influence organizational practices (Pugh, Hickson,
Hinings, & Turner, 1968). (4) And, past venture growth was controlled to provide a baseline for
analysis of the effects on the performance variable.

Method
Field Study Participants, Pilot Study, and Questionnaire
Firms that manufacture architectural woodwork in the United States were studied because
the first author was a member of the industry and has: (1) access to membership information, (2)
industry knowledge to help construct measurement items for a survey, and (3) links with industry
leaders who could encourage participation. Industry firms manufacture and install wood
products (doors, windows, stairs, cabinets, and trim) for high-end residential, commercial, and
monumental buildings (part of SIC 2431). Products are sold to general contractors, interior
designers, or directly to end users. Markets are geographically limited due to job site installation
and continuing service requirements. Typical firms employ highly skilled woodworkers,
production oriented high-tech machinery operators, carpentry installers, managers, and
salespersons. Compared with 1985, production and communication technology has dramatically

<-----Page 12----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

13

affected the design, manufacture, and marketing of products and has significantly increased the
investment required for start-up.
The survey population was the 849 architectural woodwork industry companies in North
America. The population was identified in member lists from the Architectural Woodwork
Institute, Centreville, Virginia and customer lists from three major suppliers of raw material. In
1993, the industry’s 849 CEOs were asked to return a response card if they were willing to
participate, and they were asked to identify a subordinate employee with whom they worked
directly. Participation in the industry-wide study was encouraged by trade association officers at
industry conventions and in trade journal advertisements that identified benefits for the industry.
I employed pilot testing with 31 of the industry’s entrepreneur/CEOs to develop test
measures for a questionnaire (Details are available from the author.) In 1993, after 2 written
requests emphasizing the importance of participation, I mailed a questionnaire to each of the 442
CEOs who agreed to participate and sent an adapted version of the questionnaire separately to
the 202 employee-participants (EP) whose CEO had also agreed to allow such EP participation.
The CEO questionnaire contained measures of the 6 predictor concepts studied here and 1991
and 1992 performance data (1991 data were collected to enable calculation of the “past venture
growth” control.). The EP version and the CEO version were identical except that references in
the CEO version to “you” and “your company” were changed to “the CEO” and “the company”
for the EP version. Only the CEO version collected year-end sales and employment data, and
self-efficacy was collected only from CEOs because self-efficacy is privately held. I received
414 CEO responses (49%) and 189 EP responses after follow-up reminders.
A second questionnaire was mailed in 1999 to the 1993 CEO participants. It was similar to
the 1993 questionnaire except that it collected 1998 performance data. I disqualified responses

<-----Page 13----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

14

from: (1) single employee firms, (2) CEOs who were not active owner/managers, (3) CEOs who
had not founded or purchased their businesses 3 to 8 years before 1993 (Galbraith & DeNoble,
1992; McDougall et al., 1992; Shrader & Simon, 1997), and (4) those who supplied incomplete
data. Fifty-eight (58) firms had closed. Thus, two hundred-forty two (242) responses from
entrepreneur/CEOs were used in this study (28% of the population). The average qualified
entrepreneur/CEO respondent had 15 employees and $1.6 M sales in 1992. The averages from
the 1998 data are: 28 employees and $3.8 M sales.
Ninety-three (93) responding EPs (11% of the population - 38% of the net qualified
entrepreneur/CEO sample) had worked with matching qualified entrepreneur/CEOs for two or
more years and had submitted complete data. The typical EP managed sales or production; all
EPs reported directly to the entrepreneur/CEO. The average EP had 7 years experience in the
industry and had worked for the entrepreneur/CEO for 2 years in 1992.
To test whether the 1993 respondents were representative of the population of 849
companies and to determine whether there was significant statistical bias, I performed a z-test of
the mean number of employees and mean sales volume of the respondents and the population.
The tests showed that the difference was not significant between the: (1) mean number of
employees (z = .32; p < .38), or (2) mean sales volume (z = 1.0; p < .16). Many respondents (71)
were not included in this study because in 1992 their ventures were only 1 or 2 years old (21) or
more than 8 years old (50). Since the average age of the respondent firms exceeded 8 years, the
sample firms that I studied are most likely smaller and younger than the average industry firm;
however, my sample should represent the firms that would remain after a similar truncation of
the population.

Measures
Table 1 shows the 9 measurement model concepts: venture growth, growth goals, selfefficacy, tenacity, passion for work, organization skill, opportunity recognition, age, size, and
past venture growth. Table 1 also shows the number of measurement items, format, LISREL 8.3
composite reliability (CR), and research source for each concept. CR is conceptually similar to
ALPHA (Cronbach, 1951); it should exceed .60 for exploratory model testing (DeVellis, 1991;
Van de Ven & Ferry, 1980).
Venture Growth. Venture growth was measured with two items: (1) the % change in
annual sales from 1992 to 1998 [(1998/1992) - 1.0], and (2) similarly, the % change in year-end
employment from 1992 to 1998. Objective measures were used rather than subjective measures
(e.g. respondents’ satisfaction with growth or respondents’ reports about growth relative to
competitors’), because objective measures are more fine-grained (Chandler & Hanks, 1993).
Furthermore, I believed that participants would report actual accounting data because: (1) Many
industry respondents had regularly supplied performance data to a confidential third-party data
service as part of the industry’s annual “cost of doing business” study. (2) I was able to promise
confidentiality for this study because I used the industry’s third-party data service. And (3)
Many industry members expressed interest in the results. Nevertheless, Rowe, Morrow, and
Finch (1995) and Slevin and Covin (1995) have shown that objective and subjective measures
point to the same unidimensional concept.

<-----Page 15----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

16

Despite follow-up efforts, 24 of the entrepreneur/CEOs who qualified for the sample in all
other respects had incomplete 1992 data. Seventeen (17) of these cases were completed with
1992 data supplied by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (1993), and the 7 remaining cases were omitted
from the sample. Similarly, follow-up phone calls and Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (2000) reports
were used to get 1998 performance data for 12 firms.
The accuracy of the raw performance data was evaluated by checking the agreement of a
random sample of 25 of the firms with Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (1993) reports about 1992
performance. Results of the correlation and t-tests of 21 of these cases, for which Dun and
Bradstreet, Inc. (1993) reports were available, reveal high correlation between the respondents
and Dun and Bradstreet’ reported sales (r = .94, p < .001). The difference between the means
was not significant (t = .96, p < .36).
The average sales and employment growth rate for the sample companies was 12% (The
compounding rate was calculated for 1992 to 1998). These results are consistent with industry
reports that industry recovery began in 1992 and that growth was “strong” and above
construction industry growth rates (6%) for the 6-year period studied.
Growth goals. The participants reported their goals for sales and number of employees
for 1993, and 1995 (CR=.71). The goals for 1993 were subtracted from the goals for 1995 and
the result divided by the 1993 goal to produce the two-year growth % goal for sales and number
of employees for each respondent. The results were divided by two to yield the average annual
% growth goal for sales and the average annual % growth goal for number of employees
(Gartner et al., 1992; Locke & Latham, 1990).
Self-efficacy . Entrepreneur/CEO self-efficacy was measured with 2 self-assessmentscale questions (one each for sales and number of employees) (CR=.86): “Thinking about your

<-----Page 16----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

17

skills, write a number from the confidence scale (0 = no confidence at all to 7 =complete
confidence) to show how sure you are that you can beat the % change in 1995 sales shown (the
respondents recorded their confidence beside rates of change from -25% to +100% or more).
The total of the confidence scale numbers for each performance variable (sales and number of
employees) formed the two measures of self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997; Chandler & Jansen, 1992).
Tenacity. Tenacity was measured with 5 LRF items (CR=.85) (Locke et al., 1991;
Timmons et al., 2000). Typical items were: “I continue to work hard on projects, even when
others oppose me.” “I persistently try to beat my past performance.”
Passion for work. Passion was measured with 5 LRF items (CR=.85) (Locke et al., 1991;
Smilor, 1997): “I frequently have to “tear myself away” from my work to satisfy other
obligations.” “I derive most of my life satisfaction from my work.”
Organization skill. Organization skill was measured with responses to 3 LRF items and
with responses to a decision scenario (CR=.74) (Boyatzis, 1982; Chandler & Jansen, 1992): “I
am more skilled as a salesperson or craftsperson than as an organizer and leader.”(R). “An
iterative decision scenario measured decisiveness; it presented a production problem caused by
faulty material. After each bit of new information, the respondent was given the opportunity to:
“use the material but withhold payment to the suppler, seek a replacement from the supplier,
switch to another supplier”. The item was scored as the number of information cycles before the
respondent decided to switch to another supplier (R) (Kirton, 1984; Wally & Baum, 1994).
Opportunity recognition skill. This competency was measured with 5 LRF items
(CR=.68) (Bird, 1989; Chandler & Jansen, 1992; Hood & Young, 1993; Long & McMullan,
1984): “I am able to search out new technologies, processes, or product ideas.” “I am able to see
unmet customer needs.“

<-----Page 17----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

18

Controls. Age was measured as the number of years from founding to 1992. Size was
measured with the number of full time equivalent employees at the end of 1992. Log
transformation was not used because the size range was not large and the distribution was not
highly skewed. The first measure of the control for past venture growth was the % change in
sales between 1992 and 1991 [(1992/1991)-1.0]. Similarly, the second measure was the %
change in employment between 1992 and 1991.

Results
LISREL 8.3 and PRELIS 2 were used to: (1) impute missing data, (2) evaluate concept
validity [i.e., “reliability” (including dual-source similarity), convergent, and discriminant
validity], (3) perform confirmatory factor analysis to verify the validity of the proposed
configuration of causal concepts, and (4) test the hypotheses. LISREL is particularly useful for
analysis of mediation models that have multiple measures of multiple concepts like the one
employed here. Univariate homogeneity testing (PRELIS 2 HT) and multiple sample analysis
(LISREL MSA) confirmed the similarity of the response distributions of the 93
entrepreneur/CEO-EP pairs, as well as the distributions of the entrepreneur/CEOs with EPs (n =
93 ) and without EPs (n = 149). Thus, I found that CEO’s with EPs were not rationalizing their
own performance as they made their reports, and that this validity extended to the full
entrepreneur/CEO data set (n = 242).
I used the following indices to guide conclusions about the measurement model and to
indicate the fit of data to hypotheses: (1) The X2 probability should be larger than <.05; however,
when n is large, as it is in this study, significant X2 are typical. Thus, I used the X2 difference
between the independence model and the LISREL solution model as an indicator of the model’s

<-----Page 18----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

19

explanatory power (Medsker, Williams & Holahan, 1994). (2) The goodness-of-fit index (GFI)
and adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI) should be near or better than .90. (3) The root mean
square residual (RMR) should be less than .100. And (4) the root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) should be less than .080 (Bollen & Long, 1993; Breckler, 1990;
Joreskog & Sorbom, 1999; Wheaton, 1987).
As shown in Table 1, the measurement model had 7 concepts with CR > .80, 2 concepts
with CR between .70 and .79, and 1 concept with CR between .60 and .69. All measure
coefficients were significant (t > 2.0; p < .05); thus, convergent validity was established.
Discriminant validity was verified by determining for each latent variable that the average
variance extracted by the latent variable’s measures was larger than the latent variable’s shared
variance with any other latent variable (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Common source bias was
checked with LISREL confirmatory factor analysis by linking a common latent variable with all
of the measures. The resultant coefficient LAMBDA = .10 (t = .29, p <.05) indicated that
common variance was less than 2%. Thus, there appears to be no threat that relationships were
inflated because one person provided information for all of the concepts. In summary, the
measurement model exhibited reliable measurement of the latent variables, convergence of the
measures of each concept, and divergence of the concepts.

competencies had a significant correlation with venture growth and traits did not. Both relations
are consistent with past entrepreneurship empirical research. The significant correlation between
the past venture growth control, 1991 to 1992 growth, and 1992 to 1998 new venture growth was
expected [The experimental treatments that are the focus of this study (entrepreneur/CEO traits,
general competencies, and situationally specific motivation) existed in the new venture since
founding which is not identical with the beginning of this study’s observation period. In
addition, the focal predictors for this study are not the only forces working to cause new venture
growth (Baum, Locke, & Smith, 2001)] In using the control for past new venture growth, the
significant relations found in this study point to long term effectiveness of the treatments studied.
The significant correlation between traits and motivation and competencies and motivation were
predicted by hypotheses 4 and 5. The significant relation between traits and competencies is
addressed in the “Discussion” below.

Figure 2 shows the LAMBDA coefficients for the direct effects structural equation model [X2 (40)

RMR = .059; RMSEA = .088]. Excepting the AGFI, the model is a good fit of the data. Motivation and
competencies are significant predictors of new venture growth, which confirms hypotheses 1 and 3.
Consistent with past entrepreneurship research and hypothesis 2, traits are not significant predictors of
new venture growth.

The results for the motivation mediation model are shown in Figure 3 [X2 (27) = 68.22
which is significantly better than the independence model X2 (41) = 1214.44; GFI = .95; AGFI =
.91; RMR = .048; RMSEA = .068]. Forty-three percent (43%) of the variance is explained. All
fit indices point to a good fit. Overall, the model is a better explanation of the data than the
direct effects model of Figure 2. Again, motivation is a strong predictor of new venture growth,
and hypothesis #1 is confirmed. Traits and competencies are significant predictors of
motivation, confirming H4 and H5. Neither traits nor competencies are direct predictors of new
venture growth in this mediation configuration, which disconfirms H2 and H3; however, the
mediation hypothesis (H6) is confirmed because the model that includes the indirect effects of
traits and competencies through motivation has reduced coefficients for the direct effects of traits
and competencies compared with the direct effects model. These results are not strictly
consistent with Baron and Kenny’s (1986) prescription for mediation because: (1) in the direct
effects SEM solution (Figure 2) the “traits” latent concept was not a significant predictor of new
venture growth, and (2) in the indirect effects solution, neither traits nor general competencies
were significant direct predictors of new venture growth. Nevertheless, mediation is indicated
because in both cases traits and general competencies exhibited positive direct relations with new
venture growth, and the inclusion of the indirect relation between traits, general competencies,
and motivation reduced these direct relationships.

Discussion and Conclusion
The most important finding of this study is that entrepreneurs’ traits and general
competencies are causes of new venture growth. Unlike past entrepreneurship research, this
empirical study supports entrepreneurs and new venture financiers who hold that even basic
personal characteristics affect entrepreneurship success. The causal relation is indirect through
personal goals and self-efficacy which are closer in the causal chain to organization-level
outcomes. The six-year duration of the study adds credibility to the proposition that the relation
is causal.
I used tenacity and passion for work as reflections of traits. Like those who studied
entrepreneurs’ locus of control, tolerance of ambiguity, risk-taking, and need for achievement
before, I found no strong direct effects for personal traits. However, my finding of significant
indirect effects may inspire research that revisits the study of entrepreneurs’ traits, but through
mediation models that test more complex causal chains. Indeed, this research supports those
who believe that study of the big five personality traits, including those that have been identified
as “entrepreneurial”, may be useful (Lumpkin & Dess, 2001; Mount & Barrick, 1995).
Specifically, my findings suggest that tenacity and passion deserve further study as indirect
causes of venture performance. “Passion” is particularly interesting because, to our knowledge,
this is the first managerial study ever to measure this variable.
Bird (1995) has promoted the need to research competencies, and this study lends support
to her view that entrepreneurial competencies are definable, measurable, and important for
venture success. I found that general competencies were direct causes of venture growth in
isolation (albeit, a weak cause); however, when the competency-to-motivation relation was

<-----Page 22----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

23

added to the prediction model, the importance of general competencies was not apparent. The
diminished significance of direct relationship is consistent with past studies that included
competing predictors. Nevertheless, the significant indirect relations suggest that entrepreneurial
skills may serve as sources of competitive advantage that rivals find difficult to identify and
imitate.
The opportunity for further research about competencies is rich; Bird (1995) has offered a
working list of over 50 likely entrepreneurial competencies. Chandler and Jansen (1992) studied
5 competencies and found significant correlations with growth and profitability, and we have
found venture growth effects for 2 competencies that are similar to those studied by Chandler
and Jansen. Neither this study nor the Chandler and Jansen (1992) study of established firms
explored the interesting question: “do competencies that contribute to venture growth also cause
successful founding?”
Although not the focus of this study, the motivation latent concept had strong direct
effects with venture growth, and growth goals and self-efficacy were strong reflections of the
latent concept. Thus, these findings are fully consistent with previous applied psychology and
social psychology research that important direct relations exist between goals and performance
and self-efficacy and performance (Bandura, 1997; Locke & Latham, 1990). In summary,
motivation concepts show considerable explanatory power in many settings, including the
entrepreneurship setting studied here.
The significant correlation between traits and competencies also deserves further study in
the entrepreneurship setting. Indeed, Boyatzis (1982) proposed that managers’ traits were
manifested in their competencies because traits affect behavior. For example, it would useful to
find out if tenacious entrepreneurs who have passion for their products, work harder and longer

<-----Page 23----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

24

thereby developing increased opportunity recognition and organization competencies. This
would be consistent with findings about the relation between personality and practice and skill
development (Ericsson, 1996).
Limitations
Analysis of a single industry provided control of industry effects and may have added
richness and clarity; however entrepreneurship researchers have found that industry
characteristics affect venture performance (Shrader & Simon, 1997).

Thus, these results may

not generalize to other industries. Furthermore, although I reviewed various literatures in search
of specific traits and general competencies to represent the traits and general competencies
research domains, I may have missed important candidates.
Recall that I chose to study venture growth to represent the force of dynamic capitalism;
however, there are other indicators of performance (personal satisfaction, survival, innovation,
intangible assets, personal goals, etc.) (Chandler & Hanks, 1993; Deeds et al., 1997) to which the
concepts that cause venture growth may not apply. In short, others may wish to explore these
relations with alternative indicators of performance.
This study did not deal with two definitional issues that confound entrepreneurship
research: (1) “Who is an entrepreneur?”, and (2) “Which firms are entrepreneurial?”. I simply
used a sample of young small businesses that were run by active owner/managers, regardless of
their mode of entry, to study the causes of technology adoption. Finally, I modeled the causes of
venture growth with linear equations rather than multiple-order equations because structural
equation modeling is not well suited to testing non-linear equations. Nevertheless, these possible
failures to specify the exact form of the relationships among all the concepts in our study do not

<-----Page 24----->Motivation Mediators, Personal Characteristics, and New Venture Performance

25

diminish the value of the primary finding of this study - that traits and competencies predict
motivation, which in turn, predicts venture growth.
In conclusion, this longitudinal study of motivation mediators of entrepreneurs’ personal
characteristics offers support for researchers who believe that an internal explanation of new
venture performance exists, and that traits and general competencies operating through goals and
self-efficacy are at the heart of the explanation. The finding that personalogical concepts matter,
opens significant opportunities for research exploration. Furthermore, “personality assessment”
and “skills and motivation training” may have a role in development of entrepreneurs.
Entrepreneurship education programs ought to teach organization skills such as goal-setting and
opportunity recognition skills such as “structured environmental scanning”. The study also
confirms the soundness of financiers’ interest in entrepreneurs’ personal characteristics.
