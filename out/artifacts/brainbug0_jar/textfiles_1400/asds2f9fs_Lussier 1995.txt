<-----Page 0----->A NONFINANCIAL BUSINESS SUCCESS
VERSUS FAILURE PREDICTION MODEL
FOR YOUNG FIRMS*
by Robert N. Lussier
Prospective entrepreneurs are concerned about the chance of success for
their proposed business. A success versus failure prediction model can help the
prospective entrepreneur more accurately assess the probability of the proposed business s success. Success versus
failure prediction research also benefits
existing entrepreneurs, those who assist, train, and advise them, those who
provide capital for their ventures, suppliers, and public policy makers (Altman
1983; Ballantin, Cleveland, and Koeller
1992; Cameron, Kim, and Whetten 1987;
D'Aveni 1989; Dugan and Zavgren 1989;
Koh and KiUough 1990; Pech and Alistair
1993; Storey, Keasey, Watson, and
Wynarczyk 1987).
While there has been much prior work
in this area, much is left to do. As
GaskiU, Van Auken, and Manning (1993)
state: "There are many studies to better
understand business success versus failure. However, there are many questions
still to be resolved that warrant additional exploration ... previous studies do
not provide a comprehensive or unified
explanation for small firm failure ...
*The author would like to acknowledge Dr. Frederick C.
Scherr, editor of the Journal of Small Busmess Management, for his helpful input to this article.

comparisons are needed between successful and failed small business owners." Prior empirical studies of failure
have concentrated almost exclusively on
financial ratio data, though studies of
failure usually cite managerial variables
as being critical (Scherr 1989). The usefulness of ratio-based business failure
prediction models has been questioned
(Alves 1978; Corman and Lussier 1991;
Gilbert, Menon, and Schwartz 1990;
Shelton 1986; Stockton 1989; Sommers
and Koc 1987). For example, El-Zayaty
(1986) found ratio models to be poor predictors of bankruptcy: in his research of
132 businesses predicted to fail, only 5
were discontinued over a five-year period. Storey et al. (1987) indicated that
qualitative data can provide at least as
good predictions as traditional financial
ratios.
This study is not based on financial ratios, but on the quantitative and qualitative managerial factors that may
contribute to success or failure. Tb date,
the author has found only a few major
nonratio empirical studies: Cooper et al.
(1990, 1991); Reynolds (1987); and Reynolds and Miller (1989). While these
studies are pathbreaking, more research
is needed. For example, the Reynolds
and Miller model cannot predict failure
of a business before it starts because the
age of the business and the first year

<-----Page 1----->sales are factors in the model to predict
failure.
The Cooper et al. study provides a
point of departure for this research. The
m^or differences between this study
and the Cooper et al. study are: (1) their
sample includes businesses 1 to 3 years
old whereas this sample includes ages 1
to 10; (2) their sample was limited to
members of the National Federation of
Independent Business (NFIB) while this
sample is not; (3) they do not survey
failed businesses while this study does;
and (4) their sample does not include
matched pairs whereas this design does.
They first surveyed existing firms; after
a year or longer, some of the firms failed.
At that time, they compared the responses of the failed firms and the surviving firms to analyze the differences
without ever questioning the failures to
ask them why they failed. Further, there
were no controls for size, industry, or location. The matched pairs design of this
study avoids comparing larger businesses to smaller ones, retailers to manufacturers or construction companies,
and businesses from different locations,
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY

considered business failures: they are
discontinued businesses. Tb be considered a success the business must make at
least industry-average profits. A young
firm is defined as being between 0 to 10
years old.
METHODOLOGY

There is no generally accepted list of
variables for use in forecasting business
success or failure. Prior research has reported different variables as contributing factors to success or failure. The two
most commonly stated distinguishing
variables are capital and management
experience. However, in 20 journal articles (see table 1) only 14, or 70 percent of
the articles, specifically state that these
two variables contribute to success versus failure, lb help clarify prior research
results, this study tests each of the 15
major variables identified in 20 journal
articles as contributing to success versus
failure. See table 1 for a comparison of
the 20 studies that support, do not suppori, or do not mention each variable,
and table 2 for an explanation of the 15
variables.
The Model Variables

The purpose of this research was to develop and test a generic nonfinancial
model that will predict a young business
s success or failure. The study also answers the question, "Do successful and
failed businesses start with equal resources?"
This study adopts Dun & Bradstreet's
(1993) definitions of failure and discontinuance. Business failures are defined
as firms involved in court proceedings or
voluntary actions which result in losses
to creditors. Chapter 7 and Chapter 11
companies are both considered failures
due to losses to creditors. Chapter 7
companies liquidate whereas Chapter 11
companies restructure their debt and
stay in business. Firms going out of business without loss to creditors are not

EXPLANATION OF SUCCESS VERSUS FAILURE VARIABLES
Capital (capt). Businesses that start undercapitaiized have a greater chance of failure than firms
that start with adequate capital.
Record keeping and financial control (rkfc). Businesses that do not keep updated and accurate
records and do not use adequate financial controls have a greater chance of failure than firms that do.
Industry Experience (inex). Businesses managed by people without prior industry experience
have a greater chance of failure than firms managed by people with prior industry experience.
Management Experience (maex). Businesses managed by people without prior management experience have a greater chance of failure than firms that are managed by people with prior management experience.
Planning (plan). Businesses that do not develop specific business plans have a greater chance of
failure than firms that do.
Professional Advisors (prad). Businesses that do not use professional advisors have a greater
chance of failure than firms using professional advisors.
Education (educ). People without any college education who start a business have a greater
chance of failure than people with one or more years of college education.
Staffing (staff). Businesses that cannot attract and retain quality employees have a greater
chance of failure than firms that can,
Product/Service Timing (psti). Businesses that select products/services that are too new or too
old have a greater chance of failure than firms that select products/services that are In the growth
stage.
Economic Timing (ecti). Businesses that start during a recession have a greater chance of failure
than firms that start during expansion periods.
Age (age). Younger people who start a business have a greater chance of failure than older people
starting a business.
Partners (part), A business started by one person has a greater chance of failure than a firm
started by more than one person.
Parents (pent). Business owners whose parents did not own a business have a greater chance of
faiiure than owners whose parents did own a business.
Minority (mior). Minorities have a greater chance of failure than nonminorities.
Marketing (mrkt). Business owners without marketing skills have a greater chance of failure than
owners with marketing skills.

gression model that best describes group
membership as success or failure. The
parameters of the model are estimated
using the 'maximum-likelihood method.
The significance level of each variable is
reported to determine which variables
do and do not significantly distinguish
between success or failure (Scherr
1989).
SAMPLING METHODOLOGY

The sample was limited to six New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
and Vermont, The failure sample was
generated from the bankruptcy court records. The population of failed businesses
includes Chapter 7 and 11 companies.
Due to difficulties in locating liquidated
business owners the questionnaire was

mailed to only Chapter 11 companies.
The questionnaire was first mailed to
each owner/CEO of a failed business in
the year in which they fUed for Chapter
11. A foUow-up mailing was made to initial nonrespondents. A matched sample
of nonfailed firms was also developed.
Matching was selectively based on size
(number of employees), age (all firms are
ten years old or less), location (same state
and city, or city close by), and industry
(same Dun & Bradstreet classification) to
ensure relevant comparisons. The questionnaire was then mailed to each failed
respondent's successful company match.
The combined response rate was 39 percent. A total of 216 usable questionnaires
were returned and analyzed: 108 from
failed and 108 from successful firm
owners.

<-----Page 4----->DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICAL RESULTS

The questionnaires returned included
approximately 20 percent from Connecticut, 5 percent Maine, 44 percent
Massachusetts, 19 percent New Hampshire, 9 percent Rhode Island, and 6 percent Vermont. The mean age of the
failed and successful firms was 5.5 and
5.8 years. The mean, median, and mode
of the number of employees for the
failed and successful firms were 25.33,
15.00, 5.00; and 22.22, 8.00, 2.00, respectively. Industry representation (as
classified by Dun & Bradstreet) includes
approximately: 2 percent agriculture, 14
percent construction, 17 percent finance, 10 percent manufacturing, 22
percent retailing, 3 percent wholesaling,
6 percent transportation and communication, and 25 percent services. For a
comparison of the descriptive statistics
and measurement of the 15 variables in
the model see table 3.
Sample Representation

Tb ensure that the sample represented
the population, a comparison was made
of the sample failure frequency distributions to the faUure population by state
and industry. The population figures include Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 failures
(Dun & Bradstreet 1993). Using chisquare tests, there were no significant
differences. In other words, businesses
in all six states, and all types of businesses, are represented by about the
same percentage in the sample as the
population from which they are drawn.
BIVARIATE STATISTICAL RESULTS
Reliability and Vaiidity

Tb increase reliability, the questionnaire was carefully developed through
four pretests. One of the major concerns
of the study was response rate. The
questionnaire's length was limited to increase the response rate; therefore, a
trade-off was made. Rather than having
several repeat questions, the question12

naire used one open-ended question to
check reliability. There was only one
nonreliable response; therefore, reliability is inferred.
Correlation analysis was run to assess
the degree of multicolinearity among
the 15 variables. The correlation matrix
(table 4) shows that most of the correlations are relatively low. While some of
the correlations are significant, of the
105 correlations only 2 are greater than
.50 and 13 are greater than .20.
Nonresponse Bias

Nonresponse bias was minimized in
this study by following up initial nonrespondents and by comparing statistically the initial nonrespondents' data to
that of the initial respondents to test for
significant differences. Approximately
10 percent of the sample is composed of
initial nonrespondents. Of the 15 variables tested in the model, no responses
were significantly different using t and
chi-square tests.
Test of Differences Between
Successfui and Failed Businesses

The two samples were compared for
significant differences on the 15 variables (see table 3). These variables were
largely measures of one or more of the
firm's resources, and this test can be interpreted as a comparison of the amount
of resources available to failed and nonfaUed firms. Successful and failed businesses did not have equal starting
resources for 4 out of the 15 variables:
use of professional advice (p = .064), education (p=.O44), staffing (p = .OOO),
and parents owned a business (p = .006).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The results of the logistic regression
analysis (goodness of fit of the model,
classification table, and parameter estimates) appear in table 5.

statistic shows that the model is significant at the .001 level. The model is statistically better than random guessing.
The -2 log likelihood (LL) is 252.639. This

Variables 5-8 are significant in the Model (p<,05),

cause the model fits the data. In other
words, the model wiU predict a group of
businesses as failed or successful more
accurately than random guessing over
99 percent of the time.
Classification Accuracy of the Model

How well the model classifies the observed data is a second way to determine how well the model performs. This
is done by examining how "likely" the
sample results are, given the parameter
estimates. The model was more accurate
at predicting failure than success. The

model correctly predicts 73 percent of
the failed sample and 65 percent of the
successful sample for an overall accuracy rate of about 70 percent. Since random guessing produces a 50 percent
correct classification, the model is approximately 20 percent more reliable at
classifying a specific business as successful or failed.
Parameter Estimates and
Significant Variables

The appropriate tests for significance
of individual variables in logistic regres-

January 1995

15

<-----Page 8----->sion are based on the parameter estimates. The parameter section of table 5
contains the estimated beta coefficients
(6) for all 15 variables. Tb test if each coefficient is zero, the Wald statistic (the
square of the ratio of the coefficient to
its standard error) was used. The significance level for the Wald statistics appears in the last column of the table. Of
the 15 variables in this multivariate test,
four are significant at the .05 level: planning, professional advisors, education,
and staffing. Note that parents owning a
business was close to being significant
(p=.0550).
Direction of the Relationship Among
Variabies

Reviewing the bivariate test of difference between the failed and successful
means or frequencies and contrasting
these with the multivariate results aids
in the understanding of the variables
that are significant, and the direction of
the relationship. Bivariate testing revealed that professional advice, education, staffing, and "parents" were
significantly different between the successful and failed businesses. In the
model, however, planning was significant and parents were not. Planning
may be significant because it is correlated with professional advisors (p < .001,
see table 4), parents may have dropped
in significance because it was collinear
with education {R= .16, p< .05).
In the bivariate tests (table 3), one
finds that education and staffing were
significantly greater for failed than for
successful firms. This was unexpected,
since it implies that failed firms have
greater resources in these areas than
successful firms. But the bivariate
results could have been reversed in multivariate analysis. These variables could
easily have a positive sign when combined with others. However, that is not
what happened. The signs are also negative in the multivariate analysis.
16

However, "significant" does not always mean "important." Statistical
results can be data artifacts, and included variables can be collinear with
left-out ones. The mean difference in
education is less than one year; the
mean failed level of education is greater
than three years of college (15.32 years)
whereas the successful mean is less than
three years of college (14.53 years).
Should one conclude that a potential entrepreneur should stop college after two
years? Perhaps not. This difference in
education may instead indicate the difference between a college graduate and
a college drop-out. Entrepreneurial research has revealed that many successful small business owners did not do well
in college, and that some drop out to
start a business. (Steve Jobs starting Apple Computer is one obvious example.)
While the negative sign for difficulties
of staffing was not expected, note that
while some might call staff "resources,"
overstaffing is clearly disadvantageous
as it increases the firm's fixed costs. The
level of difficulty of staffing was measured subjectively on a scale of 1-7, and
the difference of .76 may be due to
other factors which this study was not
designed to address. The following questions about staffing differences are subjects for future research. Are successful
businesses more selective in their hiring? Do they have greater turnover? Do
they use different recruitment methods
than unsuccessful businesses? Are they
more successful because they must
make do with the employees they have?
The negative sign for planning was expected because of coding of lower scores
indicating more detailed planning. The
successful firms in this study developed
more specific plans than did failures (table 3), and 11 other authors reported
planning as a contributing factor to success (table 1). Therefore, these results
support the hypothesis that business
planning contributes to success.

Journal of Small Business Management

<-----Page 9----->The positive sign for use of professional advisors was expected. The fact
that successful owners made greater use
of professional advisors supports the
need for government and university programs such as Service Corps of Retired
Executives (SCORE), Active Corps of Executives (ACE), Small Business Institutes (SBI), and Small Business
Development Centers (SBDC). The Small
Business Administration (SBA), which is
a government agency, is also a good
source of professional advice. In this research, this professional advice is associated with a decreased likelihood of
business failure.
USE AND LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL

There are at least seven groups that
can benefit from using the prediction
model developed in this study: entrepreneurs, investors, lenders, suppliers, educators, consultants, and public policy
makers. Entrepreneurs can assess the
probability of success or failure before
starting a business. Investors and
lenders may be able to avoid conducting
business with firms with a high probability of failure. Suppliers may decline
credit or limit it to high risk businesses.
Educators and consultants can make
these other groups aware of the model
and help them to use it. Public poUcy
makers can use the model when selecting assistance either to prevent failure
or to promote further growth.
When the seven groups use the model,
it is important to realize that the model
is not intended to replace existing default risk prediction techniques. The
model should be employed in coiyunction with the present techniques used by
investors, lenders, creditors, and other
groups to avoid default. The model does
not provide numerical guidelines for
variables distinguishing success from
failure. Judgment is needed when applying the model to assign a probability.
For example, the variable "planning"

states that people starting a firm with a
specific business plan have a greater
chance of success than people without a
specific plan. However, the model neither defines "specific" nor gives a sample business plan needed to be
successful.
The prospective entrepreneur must
look at the list of variables in the model
and subjectively assess the strengths of
the proposed business for each variable,
A system of assigning a rating of strong,
moderate, or weak to each variable can
be used. Then an overall rating of strong,
moderate, or weak can be assigned to
the probability of success. When a business is strong on some variables and
weak on others, the judgmental assignment of a probability of success is more
subjective. The more varied the
strengths and weaknesses among the
variables, the more subjective is the
judgment in assigning a probability of
success. With mixed strengths on variables, the other decision criteria previously used by investors, lenders, and
suppliers become increasingly important
when they assign a probability of success to a business.
IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER
RESEARCH

Some unanswered questions require
further research. Why are there inconsistencies within the literature and discrepancies between the literature and
this study? Almost each of the major
variables identified in the literature as
factors contributing to success or failure
have been rejected by one or more other
existing studies (table 1), Only 4 of the
15 variables were significant in this
study. Capital and management experience constitute two major areas of discrepancy between the literature and
this study. Fourteen of the twenty articles support these variables as distinguishing factors between success or
failure. However, these two variables

In this study, planning, professional
advisors, education, and staffing were
significant predictors of success or failure. Of the 20 journal articles reviewed,
only Cooper et al. (1990,1991), Reynolds
(1987), and Reynolds and Miller (1989)
developed nonfinancial empirically
tested predictive models. Planning was
the only consistently significant variable in both their models and this one.
The use of professional advisors was also
significant in the Cooper model, hut it
was not tested in the Reynolds model.
Level of education was significant in the
1991 Cooper et al. study, but not in the
1990 Cooper et al. study. In the Reynolds
model (1987) education was not tested.
However, in Reynolds and Miller (1989) it
was insignificant. Staffing was not
tested in the Cooper et al. (1990, 1991)
models, and it was not significant in the
Reynolds and Miller (1987,1989) models.
With the discrepancies among studies,
further model testing is needed to provide reliability and validity. This study
could be duplicated in other regions of
the country. Investors, lenders, and suppliers can conduct research to incorporate this model with their techniques.
They may be able to incorporate the
model into their default methods to improve the accuracy of their predicting a
business as successful or failed.
CONCLUSION

Do successful and failed businesses
start with equal resources? The answer
is no; successful and faUed businesses
did not have equal starting resources on
4 out of the 15 variables. Successful
firms made greater use of professional
advice and developed more specific
business plans; failures had more education and less difficulty staffing.
In this study, a generic nonfinancial
model was developed and tested. The
business success versus failure prediction model developed in this study wUl
18

reliably outperform random classification of a group of businesses as successful or failed over 99 percent of the time.
The model wUl accurately predict the
success or failure of a specific business
approximately 70 percent of the time.
The general implication of this study is
that through the use of the model the accuracy of predicting business success
and failure can be improved.
