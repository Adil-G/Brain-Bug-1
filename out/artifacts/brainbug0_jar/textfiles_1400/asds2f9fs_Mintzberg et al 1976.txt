<-----Page 1----->The Structureof "Unstructured"Decision
Processes
Henry Mintzberg, Duru
Raisinghani, and
Andre Theoret

A field study of 25 strategic decision processes, together
with a review of the related empirical literature, suggests
that a basic structure underlies these "unstructured"
processes. This structure is described in terms of 12 elements: 3 central phases, 3 sets of supporting routines,
and 6 sets of dynamic factors. This paper discusses each
of these elements in turn, and then proposes a general
model to describe the interrelationships among them. The
25 strategic decision processes studied are then shown to
fall into 7 types of path configurations through the
model.
How do organizationsgo about making"unstructured,"
"strategic"decisions? Researchers of administrativeprocesses have paid littleattentionto such decisions, preferring
instead to concentrate on routineoperatingdecisions, those
more accessible to precise descriptionand quantitative
analysis. As a result, the normativemodels of management
science have had a significantinfluence on the routinework
of the lower and middle levels of organizationsand almost no
influence on the higherlevels. But it is at the top levels of
organizationswhere better decision-makingmethods are
most needed; excessive attention by management scientists
to operatingdecisions may well cause organizationsto pursue
inappropriatecourses of action more efficiently.
Althoughthere is a body of normativeliteratureon techniques
for strategic decision making,for example, strategy planning,
models of the firm,cost-benefit analysis, the evidence from
empiricalstudies of their applicationindicates that alltoo
often these techniques have made little realdifference in the
decisional behaviorof organizations(Grinyerand Norburn,
1975; Hall,1973; Whitehead, 1967). These techniques have
been unableto cope with the complexityof the processes
found at the strategy level, about which littleis known.
This paper defines a decision as a specific commitment to
action (usuallya commitment of resources) and a decision
process as a set of actions and dynamicfactors that begins
with the identificationof a stimulus for action and ends with
the specific commitment to action. Unstructuredrefers to
decision processes that have not been encountered in quite
the same form and for which no predeterminedand explicit
set of ordered responses exists in the organization.And
strategic simply means important,in terms of the actions
taken, the resources committed, or the precedents set. This
paper uses empiricalresearch to suggest a basic framework
that describes unstructured,strategic decision processes.
The suggested frameworkembodies the results of our own
study of 25 such decision processes, as well as evidence
from publishedempiricalstudies.

of helpfulcomments he made as discussant for an earlierversionof this paper

1.INTRODUCTION
TO STRATEGICDECISIONMAKING
Published Research on Decision Processes
Most of the empiricalliteraturecan be neatly classified into
three groups: research by cognitive psychologists on individualdecision makingin game situations, research by social
psychologists on group decision makingin the laboratory,and

research by management theorists and politicalscientists on
organizationaldecision makingin the field.
The research on individualdecision making,perhaps best
represented by the Newell and Simon book HumanProblem
Solving (1972), relies largelyon elicitingthe verbalizationsof
decision makers'thought processes as they try to solve
simplified,fabricatedproblems, such as in cryptarithmeticor
chess. These are then analyzedto develop simulationsof
their decision processes. This research indicates that, when
faced with a complex, unprogrammedsituation,the decision
makerseeks to reduce the decision into subdecisions to
which he applies general purpose, interchangeablesets of
proceduresor routines. Inother words, the decision maker
deals with unstructuredsituations by factoringthem into
familiar,structurableelements. Furthermore,the individual
decision makeruses a numberof problemsolving
shortcuts-"satisficing" instead of maximizing,not looking
too far ahead, reducinga complex environmentto a series of
simplifiedconceptual "models."
Thus, we can conclude from the studies of individualdecision
makingthat decision processes are programmableeven if
they are not in fact programmed:althoughthe processes
used are not predeterminedand explicit,there is strong evidence that a basic logic or structureunderlieswhat the decision makerdoes and that this structurecan be described by
systematic study of his behavior.
Much of the large body of research on group decision making,
carriedout primarilyin the social psychology laboratory,is of
littleuse to us here, for two reasons. First,it is concerned not
with the structureof the decision process so much as with
the interactionsamong the participants.Second, because the
structureof the strategic decision process is determined by
its very complexity,oversimplificationin the laboratoryremoves the very element on which the research should be
focused.
Infield research on organizationaldecision making,an early
study of an unstructuredbusiness decision process by Cyert,
Simon, and Trow (1956) at Carnegie-MellonUniversitystimulated some follow-upstudies that have produceda numberof
insights. Cyertand March(1963) reportedon 4 decision processes; 2 were furtheranalyses of parts of the EDPequipment decision process described in the Cyert,Simon, and
Trow study, while 2 were new studies. Carter(1971a and
1971b) analyzed3 decision processes relatedto computer
equipment and 3 relatedto acquisitions,all in one firm. In
Australia,Duftyand Taylor(1962) studied in detail the decision process of a transportationcompanythat had to transfer
certainemployees after a merger; while in West Germany,
Witte (1972) analyzedthe documentaryevidence from 233
decision processes involvingthe acquisitionof data processing equipment.

Inthe publicarena, Gore (1956) analyzedthe processes of 33
decisions made by federal field offices in the state of
Washington,while Snyderand Paige (1959) examined "the
U.S. decision to resist aggression in Korea."Finally,Pfiffner
(1960) reportedon the study of Nicolaidis(1960) of 332 "policy" decision processes in the publicsector. A ninthstudy
247/ASQ

<-----Page 3----->(Soelberg, 1967), not strictlyorganizationalbut nonetheless
importantin its results, analyzedhow a groupof candidates
for master's degrees decided what job to take after graduation.
Research on 25 Strategic Decision Processes
This paper reportson empiricalevidence collected over the
span of five years by more than 50 teams of four to five
students takingcourses in management policyat the master's degree level. Eachteam studied an organizationfor
three to six months. One assignment was to isolate one
strategic decision made by the organization,describe the
decision process in narrativeform, and then "program"it.
The assignment read in part: "By 'program,'the instructor
means describe the steps includedin the decision in enough
detail so that you can represent the decision in flow chart
form as you would a computer program."The groups were
given a list of guidingquestions, which eventuallynumbered
21, to encourage them to view the decision process comprehensively.Typicalquestions were: What was the source
of the initialstimulus?Were stimulifrequent and/orintense?
Were specific constraintsand objectives established early?
Where did management seek solutions? Were many alternative solutions proposed or did management "satisfice" by
takingand testing alternativesone at a time? To what extent
was each step or subroutineprogrammed?
Students were also exposed to some of the field literature
cited above, but were encouraged to reject or extend the
theory as they saw fit. Manychose to do so. The teams
typicallyconducted structuredinterviews based on the guiding questions, with a numberof the decision makers and
other people involvedin the process; the interviews took
place either after the decision was made or near the termination of the process. Some groups also analyzeddocumentation when available.At the conclusion of the series of interviews, the teams reconstructedthe decision processes and
drew general conclusions vis-a-vis the theory. A typicalreport
comprised 2,500 words plus figures, althoughmanywere far
longer.
How reliableis such a data base for research?The strategic
decision process may be researched by observation,by study
of organizationalrecords,and by interviewor questionnaire.
Investigationof records is often impossible because strategic
decision processes seldom leave reliabletraces in the files of
the organization.1As Barnard(1966: 192-193) noted:
Not the least of the difficultiesof appraisingthe executive functionsor the
relativemeritsof executives lies in the fact that there is littledirectopportunity to observe the essential operationsof decision. It is a perplexingfact that
most executive decisions produceno directevidence of themselves and that
knowledge of them can only be derivedfrom the cumulationof indirect
evidence. They must largelybe inferredfrom general results in which they
are merely one factor,and from symptomaticindicationsof roundabout
character.

I

The studies by Snyderand Paige (1958)
and Witte (1972)are interesting
exceptions.

Observationis certainlya powerfuland reliablemethod, but
extremely demandingof research resources because
strategic decision processes typicallyspan periods of years;
often forced to study the process after completion,therefore,
the researcheris obliged to rely heavilyon interviewing.The
best trace of the completed process remainsin the minds of
those people who carriedit out.

<-----Page 5----->Tappingthe memories of the decision makers could introduce
two forms of error,distortionand memory failure.There is no
reason to suspect any systematic distortionin this study, and
we feel that the possibilityof randomdistortionwas reduced
in many cases by multipleinterviewing.As for memoryfailure, there is no doubt that some informationon false starts or
unsuccessful steps duringthe decision processes went unreported. However, it should be noted that the decision processes chosen for study were typicallyrecentlycompleted ones;
they were selected because they were interestingto the
managers involvedand the laterparts, at least, remained
fresh in the managers' minds. Ingeneral, this research proceeded on the premise that what the student teams captured
reallyhappened, but that not allthat happened was necessarily capturedby the student teams.
Ourown analysis of the data of these student reportsproceeded iteratively,in three steps. The first involved28 decision processes and sought to determine the basic structure
of the strategic decision process. The second focused on 20
other decision processes reportedby student teams in later
courses, typicallyin more detail. Here the initialstructurewas
elaboratedand a numberof hypotheses were tested. The
finalstep examined more intensively25 decision processes
of the first two studies, 9 from the first and 16 from the
second. Two researchers independentlyreduced each decision process to a sequence of routinesand dynamicfactors,
and data were generated that supporteda numberof the
hypotheses advanced in this paper.The criteriafor includinga
decision process in the finalstudy were clear indicationsthat
the outcome was perceived as strategic, that is, important,by
the organizationthat producedit and that the descriptionwas
sufficientlycomplete and detailed for the purpose of the
study.
Characteristics of Strategic Decision Making
Certaincharacteristicsof strategic decision makingare indicated by analyzingthe 25 decision processes. Table 1 shows
these decisions categorized in variousways. Six were made
in manufacturingfirms, 9 in service firms, 5 in quasigovernment institutions,and 5 in government agencies. Typically,the processes spanned long time periods-B lasted less
than one year,-7 one to two years, 2 two to fouryears, and 6
greater than fouryears; time data could not be inferredaccuratelyfrom two reports.The decisions variedwidely: an airline choosing new jet aircraft,a radiostation firinga star
announcer,a consultingfirm negotiatinga merger after losing
its majorclient, a hospitalinstitutinga new form of treatment
after intense politicalactivity,and so on. Most decisions involved some kindof new equipment or facilityor a venture
into a new market,product,or service.
These 25 descriptionssuggest that a strategic decision process is characterizedby novelty, complexity,and openendedness, by the fact that the organizationusuallybegins
with little understandingof the decision situationit faces or
the route to its solution, and only a vague idea of what that
solution might be and how it will be evaluated when it is
developed. Onlyby gropingthrougha recursive,discontinu2501ASQ

ous process involvingmany difficultsteps and a host of
dynamicfactors over a considerableperiodof time is a final
choice made. This is not the decision makingunderuncertainty of the textbook, where alternativesare given even if
their consequences are not, but decision makingunderambiguity,where almost nothingis given or easily determined.
Decisions Categorized by Process, Solution, or Stimulus
The decisions studied here were categorized (a) by the stimuli
that evoked them, (b)by their solutions, and (c) by the process used to arriveat them. Allthree provedto be important
for this study.
Decisions may be categorized by the stimulithat evoked
them along a continuum.At one extreme are opportunity
decisions, those initiatedon a purelyvoluntarybasis, to improve an alreadysecure situation,such as the introductionof
a new productto enlarge an alreadysecure marketshare. At
the other extreme are crisis decisions, where organizations
respond to intense pressures. Here a severe situationdemands immediate action, for instance, seeking a mergerto
stave off bankruptcy.Thus, opportunityand crisis decisions
may be considered to form the two ends of the continuum.
Problem decisions may then be defined as those that fall in
between, evoked by milderpressures than crises.2 The 25
decisions were categorizedas follows: 1 crisis decision, 5
opportunitydecisions, and 9 problemdecisions; 4 decisions
were categorizedas problem-crisesand 6 as opportunityproblems. Duringthe development of a solution, a given
decision process can shift along the continuumbecause of a
delay or a managerialaction: an ignoredopportunitycan later
emerge as a problemor even a crisis, and a managermay
convert a crisis to a problemby seeking a temporarysolution,
or he may use a crisis or problemsituationas an opportunity
to innovate.
Decisions may be classified by solution in four ways. First,
the solutions may be given fully-developedat the start of the
process. Second, they may be found ready-made,that is,
fully-developed,in the environmentduringthe process, as in
the case of purchasingjet aircraft.Third,custom-made solutions may be developed especially for the decision, for example, constructionof a new headquarter'sbuilding.Finally,the
solution may combine ready-madeand custom-made
features-ready-made solutions are modified to fit particular
situations, such as adaptingequipment for special-purpose
application.The 25 decisions included4 given, 2 ready-made,
14 custom-made, and 5 modifiedsolutions.
The thirdmethod of categorizingdecisions is by the process
used to arriveat them. A categorizingscheme of process is
discussed at length in the finalsection of the paper.

One decision can be evoked by another,
for examplea new buildingmust be found
to house a new project.Such derivative
decisions may be thoughtof as problem
decisions by ourdefinition.

The Phases of Decision Making
A numberof frameworkshave been put forwardto describe
the phases of decision making.In 1910, John Dewey
suggested five phases of reflectivethought: (1) suggestion,
wherein the mind leaps to a possible solution; (2) intellectualizationof the felt difficultyinto a problemor question; (3)
development of hypotheses; (4) reasoningor mental elabora251/ASQ

<-----Page 7----->tion of these; and (5) testing of the hypotheses (Dewey,
1933: 107). Using this as a cue, variousother frameworks
have been proposed, with the numberof phases rangingfrom
three to eight or more. Perhaps most well known is Simon's
intelligence-design-choicetrichotomy(Simon, 1965: 54).
In his research, Witte (1972) addressed the issue of the
"phase theorem," seeking to discover whether distinct
phases do exist and whether they follow a simple sequence
as suggested in most of the literature.He found that the 233
decision processes dealing with data processing equipment
did indeed "consist of a numberof differentoperationsthat
occur at differentpoints in time" (p. 166), with an average of
38 and a maximumof 452. The sequence of five phases,
however, problemrecognitionto gatheringof informationto
development of alternativesto evaluationof alternativesto
choice, was not supportedfor his whole sample or even for
the subsample of the most efficient decisions. Witte found
that the decision process consisted of a pluralityof subdecisions, and when he tested the phase theorem in terms of
the subdecisions, he again found no support for the sequence.
Witte carriedout his tests by dividingthe decision processes
into 10 equal time intervalsand then notingthe level and type
of activityin each. He did not test problemrecognitionwhich
by definitionstarted the process. He found that communication activitydominatedevery time intervaland that the total
level of activitypeaked at the beginningand end of the whole
process, but was lower in the middleperiods. He also found
that the numberof choices peaked at the end. Witte concluded (p. 180):
We believe that humanbeings cannotgather informationwithout in some
way simultaneouslydevelopingalternatives.They cannotavoidevaluating
these alternativesimmediately,and in doingthis they are forced to a decision. This is a packageof operationsand the succession of these packages
over time constitutes the total decision-makingprocess.

The frameworkused in this paperagrees with Witte's basic
conclusions. We find logic in delineatingdistinct phases of
the strategic decision process, but not in postulatinga simple
sequential relationshipbetween them. Ourcentralframework
resembles the Simon trichotomy,althoughwe define the
phases differently,using the terms identification,development, and selection. We describe these three phases in
terms of seven central"routines."In addition,we note the
existence of three sets of routinesthat supportthe central
phases, decision control,communication,andpolitical,as well
as six sets of dynamicfactors that help to explainthe relationship among the centraland supportingroutines.Together,
these constitute the 12 basic elements of the strategic decision process. Eachis discussed below together with its
treatment in the literature,the data yielded in our study, as
well as some hypotheses generated and some anecdotal
materialfor illustration.
11.ELEMENTSOF THESTRATEGICDECISIONPROCESS
The Identification Phase in Strategic Decision Making
The identificationphase of decision makingcomprises two
routines in the frameworkof this paper:decision recognition,
in which opportunities,problems, and crises are recognized
252/ASQ

<-----Page 8----->Decision Processes

and evoke decisional activity,and diagnosis, in which management seeks to comprehendthe evoking stimuliand determine cause-effect relationshipsfor the decision situation.
Decision Recognition Routine
Most strategic decisions do not present themselves to the
decision makerin convenient ways; problems and opportunities in particularmust be identifiedin the streams of
ambiguous, largelyverbaldata that decision makers receive
(Sayles, 1964: 163; Mintzberg,1973: 67-71). The need for a
decision is identifiedas a difference between informationon
some actualsituationand some expected standard.Ina study
of these differences, Pounds (1969) found that these standards were based on past trends, projectedtrends, standards
in some comparableorganization,the expectations of other
people, and theoreticalmodels.
Inat least 18 of the 25 cases in the present study, the
decision processes were evoked by many stimuli,originating
both inside and outside the organization.In many cases, low
amplitudestimuliwere collected, cumulated,and stored over
a periodof years-in one case, 25 years-before a more
intensive signal finallyevoked action.
Problem,opportunity,and crisis decisions are most clearly
distinguishedin the recognitionroutine.The opportunitydecision is often evoked by an idea, perhaps a single stimulus,
althoughit may remaindormantin the mindof an individual
untilhe is in a position to act on it. Therewere 6 clear cases
of this in the 25 decision processes. Crisisdecisions are
typicallytriggeredby single stimuli.They present themselves
suddenly and unequivocally,and requireimmediate attention,
as in the cases, for example, of a fire or a bankruptcy.Problem decisions typicallyrequiremultiplestimuli. Decision makers, presumably,wish to read the situationbefore taking
action.
An interestingphenomenon in recognitionis that of matching.
A decision makermay be reluctantto act on a problemfor
which he sees no apparentsolution; similarlyhe may hesitate
to use a new idea that does not deal with a difficulty.But
when an opportunityis matched with a problem,a manageris
more likelyto initiatedecision makingaction.
What exactly determines the moment of action?The determiningfactor may be viewed as the relationshipbetween the
cumulativeamplitudeof stimuliand an action threshold.The
amplitudeof each stimulus depends on a numberof factors,
includingthe influenceof its source, the interest of the decision makerin it, the perceived payoff of takingaction, the
uncertaintyassociated with it, and the perceived probabilityof
successful terminationof the decision. WhTen
stimuliare
cumulated,we would expect their combined amplitudeto be
a functionof the amplitudeof each, as well as their pattern
and frequency of occurrence. We can hypothesize that the
perceived amplitudeof an unattendedstimulus decays over
time; that quickreinforcementof one stimulus by another
magnifies their perceived combined amplitudes;and that the
greater the frequency, clarity,or consistency of related
stimuli,the greater their perceived combined amplitude.
253/ASQ

<-----Page 9----->Ourstudy reveals littleabout threshold levels, but Radomsky
(1967) found that a manager'sthreshold level shifts continuously accordingto his workloadand the numberand type of
decision processes in his active inventory.A managerfaced
with a numberof crises presumablydoes not look for problems, while one faced with only a few mild problems is likely
to search activelyfor opportunities.Thus, there is the need to
reassess the increasinglypopularpoint of view in the descriptive literaturethat organizationstend to react to problems and
avoid uncertaintyratherthan seek riskyopportunities(Cyert
and March,1963; Braybrookeand Lindblom,1963). Based on
our evidence, a more balancedand supportableconclusion
would be that strategic decision makingcomprises both the
exploitationof opportunitiesand the reactionto problems and
crises, perhapswith the latterbehaviormore prevalent.Of 25
decisions chosen for study, 5 could be termed pure opportunities, and 6 opportunity-problems.
The remaining14 were
categorizedas problems, crises, or problem-crises.
Diagnosis Routine
Once a cumulationof stimuli reaches a threshold level, a
decision process is initiated,and resources are mobilizedto
deal with it. At this point,the decision makeris faced with an
arrayof partiallyordereddata and a novel situation. No
strategic decision situationcomes to him preformulated.We
hypothesize that the first step following recognitionis the
tappingof existing informationchannels and the opening of
new ones to clarifyand define the issues. This behavioris
prevalentin our study, with evidence reportedfor 18 of the
25 decision processes. Such behaviorrepresents a first step
in the diagnosis routine.
It is difficultto imagine strategic decision makingwithout
some form of diagnosis. Nevertheless, substantive discussion
of this routineis almost totallyabsent in both the descriptive
and normativeliterature.Two exceptions in the normative
literatureare Bonge (1972) and Emoryand Niland(1966: 50,
66). Also, Drucker(1971) argues that a carefulattentionto
diagnosis is one factor that distinguishes Japanese from

Diagnosis need not be a formal,explicitroutine.We find
evidence of a formaldiagnostic step, for example, the creation of an investigatingcommittee or task force or the request
that consultants analyzea new issue, in 14 of the 25 decision
processes. Inthe remaining11 cases, diagnosis was presumably an informalor implicitactivity,simply not reported.There
is some evidence from our study that formaldiagnosis is
most common in the mildproblemrange of the opportunityproblem-crisiscontinuum.An explicitdiagnostic step is reported in the case of 2 out of 5 opportunitydecision processes, 4 out of 6 opportunity-problems,7 out of 9 problems, 1
out of 4 problem-crises,and 0 out of 1 crises. Perhapsopportunities do not requiremuch investigation-there is nothingto
correct, only something to improve-while intense problems
and crises may producetime and cognitive pressures that
discourage the use of formaldiagnosis.

<-----Page 10----->Decision Processes

The Development Phase
The heart of the decision-makingprocess is the set of activities that leads to the development of one or more solutions to a problemor crisis or to the elaborationof an opportunity. Ourevidence supports the hypothesis that the
greatest amount of decision-makingresources are consumed
in the development phase of the strategic decision process.
In22 of the 25 cases, there was considerabledevelopment
activity,and this activityappearedto dominate the other two
phases in 21 of the decision processes studied. In only 3
cases did the organizationsbegin with fully-developedsolutions, and in one of these, the organizationwas drawn into
development activity-redesign of its structure-to effect acceptance of its proposed solution.
Development may be described in terms of two basic
routines, search and design. Search is evoked to find readymade solutions; design is used to develop custom-made
solutions or to modify ready-madeones. This distinctionis
fundamental-the difference between what psychologists call
convergent and divergentthinking.It is one thing to find a
needle in a haystack,quite anotherto write a fugue (Reitman,
1964).
Search Routine
Evidenceof search is found in 13 of the 25 decisions, with a
total occurrence of 25. Based on evidence of this study and
that in the literature,four types of search behaviorscan be
isolated. (1) Memorysearch is the scanning of the organization's existing memory, human or paper. (2) Passive search is
waiting for unsolicitedalternativesto appear.Cyertand March
(1963: 80) note that "not only are organizationslookingfor
alternatives;alternativesare also lookingfor organizations."
(3) Trapsearch involves the activationof "search generators"
to producealternatives,such as letting suppliers know that
the firm is lookingfor certainequipment (Soelberg, 1967). (4)
Active search is the direct seeking of alternatives,either
throughscanning a wide area or focusing on a narrowone.3
There is considerablesupportfor the contention that search is
a hierarchical,stepwise process. Ingeneral, one would expect the decision makerto begin with memory and passive
search, and some convenient forms of trapsearch as well.
Cyertand March(1963: 120-1 22) hypothesize that search
begins in-localor immediatelyaccessible areas, with familiar
sources. Numerous examples of this appeared in our study.
Initialfailurein search leads presumablyto use of more active
search proceduresand to search in more remote and less
familiarareas. There is clear evidence of this in 8 of the 25
cases. Finally,it seems reasonableto hypothesize that faced
with repeated failurein search for an acceptable ready-made
solution, the organizationturns where possible to design of a
custom-made solution.

Newell and Simon (1972)discuss a
numberof combinationsof scanningand
focusing, including"scan-search,"
"depthfirst,""breadthfirst,"and "progressive deepening."

Design Routine
Use of the design routineis reportedin 20 of the 25 decision
processes. These decisions fall into two groups: those with
255/ASQ

<-----Page 11----->4

Reitman(1964),Klein(1962),and Manheim (1966)discuss design in terms simihowever,
larto these. Unfortunately,
there has been almost no attentionto the
design routinein the literatureof administration.

custom-made solutions and those with modifiedsolutions,
where search was used to narrowdown the available
ready-madealternativesand then design was used to modify
these for special application.
The results of this study suggest that the design of a
custom-made solution is a complex, iterativeprocedure,
which proceeds as follows: the designers may begin with a
vague image of some ideal solution.They factor their decision
into a sequence of nested design and search cycles, essentiallyworkingtheir way througha decision tree, with the
decisions at each node more narrowand focused than the
last. Failureat any node can lead to cyclingback to an earlier
node. Thus a solution crystallizes,as the designers grope
along, buildingtheir solution brickby brickwithout really
knowingwhat it will look like untilit is completed.4
Sixty-threeinstances of design activities, many of these
themselves nested, are reportedin the 20 cases where some
design was present. Fordecision processes with custommade solutions, design is reportedan average of just over
three times, while for those with modifiedsolutions the average is 2.4.
The hypothesis with the strongest supportin our study is that
the organizationdesigns only one fully-developedcustommade solution. Forall 14 decision processes that led to
custom-made solutions, althoughchoices from among competing alternativeswere sometimes made at single nodes, in
every case only one decision tree was followed to its ultimate
conclusion. Thatis, only one solution emerged from the design process. Snyder and Paige (1958: 320) supportthis
finding,notingthat "the decision makers were confronted
[in this case at majornodes] with single sets of proposed
courses of action ratherthan conflictingalternatives."In contrast, organizationsthat chose ready-madesolutions typically
selected them from among a numberof alternativesand in
the five cases of modifiedsolutions, that is, search followed
by design, two organizationsproducedonly one fullydeveloped solution. Inthe other three cases, all their decisions
involvingmodificationsto standardelectronicequipment, developed two full solutions. Apparently,because design of
custom-made solutions is expensive and time consuming,
organizationsare unwillingto spend the resources on more
than one alternative.In contrast,the cost of generating extra
alternativesduringthe search routineis small, and when
relativelylittledesign is involved,as in modifiedsolutions,
organizationsare preparedto fullydevelop a second solution
to compare it with the first. (Soelberg (1967) discusses the notion
of a "confirmationcandidate.")
The Selection Phase
Selection is logicallyconsidered to be the last step in the
decision process: however, because the development phase
frequentlyinvolves factoringone decision into a series of
subdecisions, each requiringat least one selection step, one
decision process could involvea great numberof selection
steps, many of these intricatelybound up with the development phase. Witte (1972) found an average of 6, and a
maximumof 51 distinct choices in the decision processes he
studied. These were distributedthroughoutthe 10 equal time
256/ASQ

<-----Page 12----->Decision Processes

periods, althoughthey occurredmore frequentlyin the last
period.
The normativeliteraturedescribes the selection phase in
terms of three sequential routines:determinationof criteria
for choice, evaluationof the consequences of alternativesin
terms of the criteria,and the makingof a choice. In reality,
selection seldom allows a neat delineationof these three
routines,and our study suggests that it is more appropriateto
describe it in terms of screen, evaluation-choice,and authorization.
Ourstudy and those in the empiricalliteraturesuggest that
selection is typicallya multistage, iterativeprocess, involving
progressivelydeepening investigationof alternatives.Multistage selection appears in virtuallyeveryone of the 20 cases
of our study where selection was described in some detail.
Two multistagepatterns of the three routines occur in our
study. First,the selection routinesare appliedsequentiallyto
a single choice. Screening is used first to reduce a large
numberof ready-madealternativesto a few feasible ones;
evaluation-choiceis then used to investigate the feasible alternatives and to select a course of action; finally,authorization is used to ratifythe chosen course of action at a higher
level in the organizationalhierarchy.Inthe second pattern,a
single selection step is itself multistage or nested. An alternative may be evaluated in a general way, then in succeedingly
more intense ways, or one choice can be subjected to authorizationat successively higherlevels in the organization.
Inthe 25 decision processes, evaluation-choiceactivityis
noted in 83 instances, and authorizationin 33. Hence, each
decision process averaged almost 5 selection steps, 4.8 for
custom-made solutions, 6.4 for modifiedsolutions (more than
half of these authorization),2 for ready-madesolutions, and
2.8 for given solutions.
Screen Routine
The screen routineis evoked when search is expected to
generate more ready-madealternativesthan can be intensively evaluated. Screening is discussed in the literatureby
Cyertand March(1963: 80), Cyertand MacCrimmon(1968:
580), and Soelberg (1967). It is a superficialroutine,more
concerned with eliminatingwhat is infeasiblethan with determiningwhat is appropriate.Screening appears to challenge
the appropriatenessof alternativesthat have never been used
before and to reduce the alternativesto a numberthat can be
stored and laterhandledby time-constraineddecision makers. The 25 cases reportlittleevidence of screening, in all
likelihoodnot because there was an absence of screening but
because it was an implicitpartof search: as ready-made
alternativesappeared,they were quicklyscreened and either
rejected immediatelyor stored.
Evaluation-Choice Routine
By far the largest partof the literatureon the strategic decision process has focused on the evaluation-choiceroutine.
This is rathercurioussince this routineseems to be far less
significantin many of the decision processes we studied than
diagnosis or design. Particularlyin the case of the custommade solution, evaluation-choiceoften appearedto be a kind
257/ASQ

<-----Page 13----->of trimmingon the process, a ratificationof the solution that
was determined explicitlyduringdesign and in partimplicitly
duringdiagnosis as well.
The evaluation-choiceroutinemay be considered to use three
modes: judgment, bargaining,and analysis.5Injudgment, one
individualmakes a choice in his own mindwith procedures
that he does not, perhaps cannot, explain;in bargaining,
selection is made by a group of decision makerswith conflicting goal systems, each exercising judgment; and in analysis,
as described above, factualevaluationis carriedout, generally
by technocrats, followed by managerialchoice by judgmentor
bargaining.

5

This representsa modificationof
frameworkspresentedby Marchand
Simon (1958: 213) and by Thompsonand
Truden(1964).

Ourstudy reveals a numberof interestingfindings about
these three modes. Judgment seems to be the favored mode
of selection, perhaps because it is the fastest, most convenient, and least stressful of the three; it is especially suited to
the kindsof data found in strategic decision making.Bargaining appears in more than half of the decision processestypicallywhere there was some kindof outside controlor
extensive participationwithin the organizationand the issues
were contentious.
The normativeliteratureemphasizes the analyticmode,
clearlydistinguishingfact and value in the selection phase. It
postulates that alternativesare carefullyand objectively
evaluated,theirfactualconsequences explicitlydetermined
along variousgoal, or value, dimensions and then combined
accordingto some predeterminedutilityfunction-a choice
finallymade to maximizeutility.A more pragmaticrenditionof
this view sees the analyst presenting his factualanalyses of
the consequences of variousalternativesto the managerwho
determines the value trade-offs in his head and thereby
makes a choice.
Ourstudy reveals very littleuse of such an analyticapproach,
a surprisingfindinggiven the importanceof the decision
processes studied. Of the 83 instances of evaluation-choice
activity,in only 18 could evaluationbe distinguishedfrom
choice. (These cases occurredtypicallyin large business organizationsand concerned technical decisions; surprisingly,
analysis was not more prevalentin the opportunityrange.)In
the typicalsituation,therefore, evaluationand choice are inextricablyintertwined.The raw data, presumablyfacts and values, indistinguishablyare plugged into a mindor a meeting,
and a choice lateremerges.
The other empiricalstudies also providelittle evidence to
supportthe prevailingnormativeviews of decision making.
Those who have addressed the issue of utilityfunctions,
notablySoelberg (1967) and Carter(1971a and 1971b) find no
evidence to supporttheir existence. These two researchers,
as well as Cyert,Simon, and Trow (1956), note ratherthat the
criteriaused in decision processes are multipleand noncomparable.No study finds that even weightings on individual
goal dimensions are established in advance of making
choices; ratherthe weights are determined implicitly,in the
context of makingchoices. Soelberg goes one step further
and describes a confirmationperiod before the announcement of a decision duringwhich the decision maker
rationalizesto himself his implicitchoice as well as the goals
258/ASQ

<-----Page 14----->Decision Processes

it represents. Here the determinationof criteriain effect follows the makingof the choice.
Virtuallyevery student of actual selection procedures agrees
that the selection of strategic alternativesrequiresconsideration of a great numberof factors, most of them "soft," or
nonquantitative;as a result they find that the evaluationchoice routineis in practicea crude one. A plethoraof value
and factual issues, few of them concrete, many involving
emotions, politics, power, and personalitymust be considered. This is furthercomplicatedby dynamicfactors and uncertainty.Thus, the evaluation-choiceroutinegets distorted,
both by cognitive limitations,that is, by informationoverload,
and by unintendedas well as intended biases. This has been
found to applyto all the modes of selection, including
analysis. (See Snyderand Paige, 1958; Pfiffner,1960; Cyert
and March,1963; Feldmanand Kanter,1965; Soelberg,
1967; Whitehead, 1967; Stagner, 1969; Carter,1971a and
1971b; Kakar,1971-72; and Newell and Simon, 1972.)
How do decision makers cope with the cognitive strainof
selection? A numberof researchers suggest variousproxy
means of choice, such as using imitationor tradition(Pfiffner,
1960: 130) or assessing the sponsor of an alternativeinstead
of the alternativeitself (Carter,1971b; Mintzberg,1973: 89).
Both Soelberg (1967) and Carter(1971a and 1971b) propose
elaborateschemes to describe how strategic choices are
actuallymade. Soelberg, for example, distinguishes primary
goals and secondary constraintsin a theory that combines the
notions of maximizingand satisficing. Soelberg believes that
scaling is essentially disjoint:each alternativeis evaluated
independentlyalong independent goal dimensions. On some
criteria,the decision makerseeks merely satisfactoryperformance. On others, usuallyone, never more than three in
Soelberg's view, he seeks to get as much as possible. In
screening, the secondary constraintsare used to reject alternatives. The alternativesthat remainare then ratedas acceptable, unacceptable,or marginalin terms of the primarygoal's
dimensions. The acceptable ones enter into an "active roster" where they are latercomparedwith each other, unless
an "outstanding"alternativeis found, in which case search is
terminated.In makingthis comparison,the decision maker
prefers a dominantalternative,one that is best along all the
primarygoal dimensions. If none can be found, he uses crude
internalscales such as "significantlybetter" and "a little
better," to compare alternatives.
Authorization Routine
Decisions are authorizedwhen the individualmakingthe
choice does not have the authorityto commit the organization
to a course of action. The decision must follow a tiered route
of approvalup the hierarchyand perhaps also out to parties in
the environmentthat have the power to block it. Typically,
authorizationis sought for a completed solution, after final
evaluation-choice;but, we also found instances of the seeking
of authorizationto proceed with a decision process, either at
the outset or duringdevelopment.
Authorizationis common in strategic decision making;it is
reportedin 14 of the 25 cases uniderstudy, for a total of 33
259/ASQ

<-----Page 15----->instances. Of the 11 cases where authorizationis not reported, 6 were business decisions made in autonomous organizationsby the chief executive, and 4 were local decisions
involvingsmall resource commitments made by the top management of subsidiaryorganizations;the remainingcase, decision 20, almost certainlyinvolvedauthorizationalthoughit is
not reported. Inthose cases where authorizationtook place
and is reported,it involvedthe approvaleither of top management, in 12 instances; the boardof directors,in 6 instances; a parentfirmor owner, in 4 instances; a higher level
of government, in 6 instances; and outside agencies, in 5
instances. Authorizationwas most common in government
and institutions,appearingin 8 of 10 cases fora total of 21
instances; it is reportedin only 6 of 15 manufacturingand
service organizations,with a total of 12 instances.
Authorizationappears to be a typicallybinaryprocess, acceptance or rejectionof the whole solution. Acceptance leads to
presentationof the solution to the next highest level if necessary; rejectionleads to its abandonmentor redevelopment. In
a few cases, conditionalacceptance occurred,leadingto a
recyclingof the solution throughthe development phase with
every attempt made to overcome the objections without altering the essential features of the solution.
The authorizationroutineexperiences difficultiesbeyond all of
those found in evaluation-choice.The time for it is typically
limited;at this level the decision must be considered in the
lightof other strategic decisions and overallresource constraints; outside politicalforces are often broughtto bear on
the decision at the point of authorization;and the authorizers
generallylackthe in-depth knowledge that the developers of
the solution have. In capitalbudgeting as well as in less
formaltypes of authorization,a majorproblemis presented by
the fact that the choices are made by people who often do
not fullycomprehendthe proposals presented to them. Thus,
in authorizationthe comparativeignoranceof the manager is
coupled with the inherentbias of the sponsor (Carter,1971a
and 1971b; Pettigrew, 1972). This explainswhy empirical
studies of capitalbudgeting have shown it to be a somewhat
distorted, politicalprocess, far less analyticalthan the normative literaturesuggests (Carter,1971a and 1971b; Bower,
1970).
Three Sets of Supporting Routines
Studies of strategic decision processes suggest that three
sets of routinessupportthe three centralphases. Decision
controlroutinesguide the decision process itself; communication routinesprovidethe inputand output information
necessary to maintaindecision making;and politicalroutines
enable the decision makerto work his way to a solution in an
environmentof influencingand sometimes hostile, forces.
Decision Control Routines
Faced with a decision situation,not only does the decision
makerexecute the steps leadingto a solution, but he also
plans his approachand allocates the organizationalresources
to get there. This metadecision making,decision making
about the decision process itself, is analogous to program
controlin a time-shared computer system.
260/ASO

<-----Page 16----->Decision Processes

Decision controlactivities are difficultto study because they
tend to be implicitand informal,takingplace in the mindof
the decision maker,and to leave littletrace of themselves.
Nevertheless, a numberof researchers note their existence,
includingNewell and Simon, who referto problemplanning
"to guide action in exploringa problemspace" (1972: 82),
and Cyert,Simon, and Trow (1956: 247). We consider decision controlto comprise two basic routines-decision planning and switching.
In a few of the cases in our study, explicitreference is made
to decision planningor to the existence of informaldecision
plans. When faced with a new decision situation,the decision
makerpresumablyattempts to establish some preliminary
bounds on the decision space. He may determine a rough
schedule for solution, a development strategy, and an estimate of the resources he is preparedto commit to developing
the solution; he may establish some preliminaryconstraints
and perhaps develop an image of an ideal solution as well
(Soelberg, 1967: 210). But like so much else in strategic
decision making,these decision plans typicallyappearto be
informaland flexible, modifiedand clarifiedas the decision
process progresses.
Broadplanninghas to be converted into specific action. Inthe
switching routine,the decision makerdirects his attentionto
the next step, to choosing the appropriateroutinesuch as
diagnosis or search, to determiningwhat resources to commit to it, and to evokingthe actual routine.Subsequently, he
monitorsthe results to update his decision plan.
Decision Communication Routines
We have alreadyseen evidence of an active stream of communicationthroughoutthe decision process: scanningthe
environmentfor stimuli,searching intensivelyfor diagnostic
informationand for informationabout alternativesand their
consequences, transmittinginformationup the hierarchyto
facilitateauthorization,and monitoringthe progress of the
decision process itself. Witte (1972) found that communication activitiesdominated every phase of unstructureddecision
making.
Three communicationroutinescan be delineated. The exploration routineinvolves the general scanning for information
and the passive review of what comes unsolicited. It is likely
used to identifydecision situations, to buildconceptual models, and to develop a general data base for decision making.
The investigation routineinvolves the focused search and
research for special-purposeinformation.Investigationappears to be used to find or confirminformationduringdiagnosis, search, and evaluation-choiceactivities.There is evidence that investigationin strategic decision processes relies
largelyon informal,verbalchannels of communication(Aguilar, 1967; Snyderand Paige, 1958: 373; Mintzberg,1973:
38-44, 70). We hypothesize that investigationis most active
duringdiagnosis and the earlierstages of development, and
again duringthe earlystages of evaluation-choice.In 15 of our
cases, informationcollection appearedto be most active during development, and in a further5.5 cases, duringdiagnosis.
In 1.5 cases it appeared most active duringselection. (In
261/ASQ

<-----Page 17----->some cases, two phases appearedto be equal, and in 3, we
could draw no obvious conclusion from the data.) Cyert,Simon, and Trow (1956: 247) found that the largest share of
manhoursin the decision process they studied was devoted
to gatheringinformationto determine the consequences of
alternatives,and Witte (1972) found that communicationfollowed a U-shaped curve, most active towardthe beginning
and end of the decision processes.
The thirdcommunicationroutineis dissemination. We find
evidence that the greaterthe numberof persons involvedor
interested in the outcome of the decision, the more time the
decision makers spend disseminatinginformationabout its
progress. This relationshipwas especially evident in six cases
in our study where many individualswere involved,notably
where authorizationwas a significantpartof the selection
phase ratherthan a formality.We also find anecdotal evidence that the furtheralong the decision process, the greater
the disseminationof informationabout it. In effect, the clearer
the solution becomes and the more committed to it is the
decision maker,the greater is his propensityto communicate
informationabout it to ensure its eventual acceptance.

6

Anotherformof bargainingtakes place in
decision making,between the organizationand its suppliers,and concernsthe
priceand arrangementsfor inputs.Such
bargaining-perhapsit shouldbe called
negotiatingto distinguishit-is not inherently politicalin nature.

Political Routines
There is considerableevidence that politicalactivities are a
key element in strategic decision making:Pettigrew (1972),
Carter(1971a and 1971b), and Bower (1970: 68) emphasize
the internalpoliticalactivities for strategic decisions in business organizationswhile Gore (1964: 290-291) and others
point out the sources of internaland externalpoliticalpressures in publicorganizations.Politicalactivities reflect the
influence of individualswho seek to satisfy their personaland
institutionalneeds by the decisions made in an organization.
These individualsmay be inside or outside the organization;
what ties them to the decision process is their belief that they
will be affected by the outcome. Theirpoliticalactivities serve
to clarifythe power relationshipsin the organization;they can
also help to bringabout consensus and to mobilizethe forces
for the implementationof decisions. We find eight cases in
our study that involvedintense politicalactivityand a number
of others involvingsuch activityof a less intense nature.Our
study suggests a relationshipbetween such activityand the
durationof the decision process. By conservative estimates,
assuming the decisions lasting longerthan 4.0 years averaged
5.0 years and those of less than 1.0 year averaged .8 years,
these eight decisions averaged 3.6 years whereas the others
averaged 1.6 years.
Politicalactivitygenerallymanifests itself in the use of the
bargainingroutineamong those who have some controlover
choices.6 We found two cases where bargainingoccurred
earlyin the decision process, when principalswithinthe organizationsdisputed the need to recognize the issue in the
first place. One of these cases led to long delays untilthe
issue was resolved and the other led to a rearrangementof
the power structureby the chief executive to eliminatethe
sources of resistance, in effect a politicaldesign activity.In
two other cases, intensive bargainingamong insiders took
place duringdevelopment and selection; in four cases, bargainingtook place between the organizationand outsiders
262/ASQ

<-----Page 18----->Decision Processes

when the latterconfrontedand temporarilyblocked proposed
decisions late in the finalselection phase. Apparently,when
concerned centers of power are disregardedduringdevelopment, they are likelyto confrontthe organizationlate in the
selection phase. Inthree cases, such confrontationresulted in
renewed development activityintended to modifythe solutions in line with the objections, while in the fourthcase, the
organizationdirectlyresisted the pressures to change its solution.
Organizationssometimes try to preempt this resistance late
in the selection phase by disseminatinginformationabout the
solution duringthe development and earlyselection phases or
by invitingthe potentialdissidents to participatein the development phase. Gore (1964), Carter(1971a and 1971b),
Bower (1970), and Pfiffner(1960) referto one or both of
these behaviors,which we call, respectively, the persuasion
and the cobptation routines. Ingeneral, we may conclude that
the more importantand contentious the outcome of a decision and the more the influence over choice rests outside the
organization,the greaterthe emphasis on selection and
communicationprocesses in general and the bargainingand
persuasion routinesin particular.
Dynamic Factors
The delineationof steps in almost any strategic decision process shows that there is not a steady, undisturbedprogression from one routineto another; rather,the process is
dynamic,operatingin an open system where it is subjected
to interferences, feedback loops, dead ends, and other factors. "One gets the pictureof everythingchasing after everything else, trying to adjust to it . . ." (Diesing, 1967: 186).

These dynamicfactors are perhaps the most characteristic
and distinguishingfeatures of decision processes that are
strategic. It is therefore surprisingthat they are hardlymentioned in the literature.
We find in our study that dynamicfactors influence the
strategic decision process in a numberof ways. They delay it,
stop it, restartit. They cause it to speed up, to branchto a
new phase, to cycle withinone or between two phases, and
to recycle back to an earlierpoint in the process. We shall
discuss six groups of dynamicfactors: interrupts,which
are caused by environmentalforces, scheduling delays and
timingdelays and speedups, which are effected by the decision maker,and feedback delays, comprehensioncycles, and
failurerecycles, which are largelyinherentin the decision
process itself.
Interrupts.Of the 25 decision processes, 15 are reported
to have experienced a total of 36 sudden events that interruptedthem and caused changes in pace or direction.In7 of
the cases, unexpected constraintswere met, typicallylate in
the selection phase, causing delays and usuallyforcingthe
organizationsto cycle back to the development phase. One
firm,for example, met a capitalrequirementdifficultyand had
to reworkits capitalstructure,while anotherfaced the sudden expropriationof the plantthat it had just bought.
In 16 cases, the decision processes encountered political
impasses that caused temporarydelays. Typically,these took
263/ASQ

<-----Page 19----->place late in the decision process when inside or outside
groups blocked proposals in the selection phase. Inone case,
civic groups-used legal actions and government legislationto
block a new airportrunway,while in another,a conservative
staff group in a hospital repeatedlyblocked acceptance of a
new form of treatment. Ina numberof these cases, the
decision makers cycled back to development to modifythe
solution, to find another, or to engage in politicaldesign
activityto remove the dissidents from positions of power. In
other cases, bargainingtook place, or the decision makers
simply delayed untilthe blockingforces disappeared.
Insix cases, decision processes encountered unexpected
new options, proposalsthat stimulated new development or
selection activity.Thus, some new options caused delays, by
interruptinga process nearingtermination,while others
caused speedups, because the new option appearedto be so
good that design was terminatedand finalevaluation-choice
begun. Infour cases, new options were accepted in place of
those under consideration;in the remainingtwo cases, the
new options were developed but not ultimatelyselected.
Finally,there were seven cases where interruptsresulted in
a speedup of the decision process. Five of these came in
response to the delayinginterruptsdiscussed above: two
removed unexpected constraintsand three responded to
politicalimpasses. The two other cases, one involvinga strike
and the other the discovery of a competitoraction, resulted in
a speedup in the selection of proposals.
A numberof interruptswe have described led to other interrupts; in effect, one interruptspecificallyevoked another.
Thus, we find 36 interruptsin 15 decision processes, an
average of 2.4 each, and we hypothesize that interruptsbeget
interrupts.
Interruptsappearto be most common in high pressure
environments.We find them in 4 of the 5 problem-crisisand
crisis decision processes, a total of 15 times, but in only 11 of
the 20 opportunityand problemdecision processes, a total of
21 times. They were also more common in the publicor
quasi-publicorganizations,appearingin 8 of the 10 government and institutionalorganizations,a total of 20 times, compared with 7 of the 15 business organizations,a total of 16
times.
Here again we find a strong relationshipwith duration:decision processes without interruptsaveraged 1.3 years, while
those with delayinginterruptsaveraged 3.6 years. This is
presumablyrelatedto the earlierfindingthat durationand
politicalactivityare related,since delayinginterruptsand politicalactivityare often found together. Hence we hypothesize
that interruptsof a politicalnaturesignificantlydelay strategy
decision processes.
Scheduling delays. Because managers are severely timeconstrained,they factor complex decisions into manageable
steps; this enables them to introducescheduling delays so
that they can attend to the multiplicityof tasks that always
await theirattention (Mintzberg,1973: 31-35, 80-81). Hence,
every step of the strategic decision process is separated by
264/ASQ

<-----Page 20----->Decision Processes

significanttime delays; presumablyas a result, only 8 of 23
decision processes had a reporteddurationof less than one
year.
Feedback delays. Duringa feedback delay, the decision
makerawaits the results of the previousaction taken. Each
step in the strategic decision process involves a certain
time-consumingactivity;in addition,many steps requirereaction. And in creativedesign processes, there may be a period
of incubationbefore insight occurs (Lonergan,1967). Thus,
we would expect especially complex decision processes involvingoutsiders to span long time periods.
Timing delays and speedups. Timingis apparentlya major
factor in strategic decision making,yet it has hardlybeen
studied, perhaps because it is almost always effected in one
manager's mind. Hardwickand Landuyt(1966: 283), for
example, surveyed 183 books in the area of administration
and found only 10 that even mentioned timingor surprise.
Managersmay purposelyspeed up or delay a decision process to take advantageof special circumstances, to await
supportor better conditions,to synchronizeaction with
another activity,to effect surprise,or to gain time. Ingeneral,
managers try to time the initiationof decision steps to facilitate their smooth execution. In competitive and hostile environments,where the issues are contentious, we would
expect to find a greater incidence of timing speedups and
delays. Inour study we find examples of speedups to beat a
competitorto a marketand delays to wait for resistance to
subside. Inthe study of crisis decision processes,
Schwartzman(1971) found that managers sought delays that
would reduce the pressures; they triedto "buytime" by
stalling,bluffing,or findingtemporarysolutions.
Comprehension cycles. Throughoutthis paper,strategic decision makinghas been described as a groping,cyclicalprocess. Inherentin it are factors causing the decision process to
cycle back to earlierphases. Pfiffnernoted that "the
decision-makingprocess is not linearbut more circular;it
resembles 'the process of fermentationin biochemistryrather
than the industrial assembly line' . . ." (1960: 129). By cyciing

withinone routineor between two routines,the decision
makergraduallycomes to comprehenda complex issue. He
may cycle withinidentificationto recognize the issue; during
design, he may cycle througha maze of nested design and
search activitiesto develop a solution; duringevaluation,he
may cycle to understandthe consequences of alternatives;
he may cycle between development and investigationto understandthe problemhe is solving (Diesing, 1967: 187); he
may cycle between selection and development to reconcile
goals with alternatives,ends with means. The most complex
and novel strategic decisions seem to involvethe greatest
incidence of comprehension cycles. We found specific evidence of cyclingand recyclingin all 25 decision processes,
with a total of 95 occurrences. Two took place within the
identificationphase, 14 withindevelopment, and 25 within
selection. In 1 case, there was recyclingfrom development
back to identification,in 50 cases from selection back to
development, and in 3 cases from selection all the way back
to identification.

<-----Page 21----->Failure recycles. Decision processes are sometimes blocked
for want of an acceptable solution. Solutions may be rejected
in evaluation-choiceas havingtoo low a payoff; they may
meet constraintsthey cannot satisfy; they may simply not
appeal to those expected to authorizethem. Faced with no
acceptable solution, the decision makermay simply delay
untilone appears or he may change his criteriaso that a
solution previouslyrenderedunacceptablebecomes acceptable. A more typicalfindingin our study, however, is that
organizationsfaced with failurein findingor designing an
acceptable solution cycle back to the development phase. We
find 13 cases where the decision processes either entered a
special design branchto remove a constraint,or developed a
new solution or modifiedan existing one by following a new
path from an earliernode of the decision tree. In some cases,
a previouslyrejected alternativewas reintroducedunderthe
new conditions.Giventhe failureof a solution, it would appear that the decision makerfirst tries to branchto remove a
constraintand thereby make the solution acceptable; if that is
infeasible, he tries to recycle to the development phase to
modifythe solution; if that is not possible, he tries to develop
a whole new solution; finally,if resources will not permitthis
or if he meets with continuedfailure,the decision makerwill
accept a previouslyunacceptablesolution.
Ill.A GENERALMODELOF THE STRATEGICDECISION
PROCESS
The elements of the strategic decision process can now be
broughtto a common base. We have developed a general
model of the process shown in Figure1, that comprises the
seven basic routines,as well as some of the dynamicfactors
discussed in this paper.We believe this model can be used to
illustratethe structureof each of the 25 decision processes
studied.
The "mainline"throughthe center of the model shows the
two routinesthat must be a partof any decision process,
recognitionof the situationand the evaluation-choiceof a
solution.The three modes of the evaluation-choiceprogram
are shown atX3. Intheory, therefore, the most basic decision
process involves simply the recognizingof a given solution
and then the evaluationand choice of it. Needless to say, we
encountered no case quite that simple.

<-----Page 22----->Decision Processes

Most decision processes involvedevelopment activityafter
recognition.Hence, atX2, there is a branchoff the main line
into the search (andscreen) routineto find a ready-made
solution or into the design routineto develop a custom-made
solution. Invirtuallyall cases, in fact, development was a
nested activity;hence, atX4 the model contains a branch
from the evaluation-choiceroutineback to the development
phase atX9 to initiateanothersearch or design cycle. Modified solutions, as noted earlier,first follow one or more
search cycles to find a ready-madesolution, and then a series
of design cycles, to modify it. In additionto nested development, nested selection also occurredfrequently;hence atX4
andX8 there is a loop from the evaluation-choiceroutineback
to itself.
Any decision process may or may not involveformaldiagnosis or authorization.Hence, the model shows branches at
X1 andX5 which take the process off the main line and later
returnit there when completed. In addition,authorizationmay
be tiered, hence the loop atX6 andX7, and authorizationto
proceed may be sought after recognitionor duringdevelopment, resultingin a branchfrom the authorizationroutineat
X6 back to development atX9. And there is evidence that the
decision process may branchfrom selection atX4 orX6 all the
way back to diagnosis to allow for reconsiderationof the
whole decision situation.Allof these branches also represent
the comprehension cycles for example, cyclingwithin
evaluation-choiceatX4 andX8 and the failurerecycles, from
the evaluation-choiceroutines atX4 or the authorization
routineatX6 backto redevelopmentatX9 to modifyan unacceptable solution or develop a new one, or back to the
evaluation-choiceroutineatX8 to modifycriteria.
Manystrategic decision processes involve interruptsof one
kindor another.The three most common ones are shown in
the model. AtX10are internalor politicalinterruptsin the
identificationphase, where there is disagreement on the
need to make a strategic decision. Such interruptscome from
withinthe organizationand may lead either to cycling in the
recognitionroutine,to resolve the disagreement by bargaining
or persuasion, to delays, untilthe resistance subsides, or to
politicaldesign activity,to remove the resistance. AtX12are
external-interruptsduringthe selection phase, where outside
forces blockthe selection of a fully-developedsolution. These
interruptstypicallylead either to modificationin the design to
bringit in line with the difficultyencountered, to complete
redevelopment of a new solution if necessary, or to bargaining to confrontthe resistance directly.AtX11are new option
interrupts,which typicallyoccur late in development or during
the evaluation-choiceroutine.These lead the process either
back to design, to elaborateor modifythe new option, or
directlyto evaluation-choiceto select or reject it immediately.
Finally,the model shows an inherentdelay, in the form of a
brokenline, at the end of each of the routines.This reflects
the fact that scheduling,feedback, and timingdelays separate
every step in the strategic decision process. This model does
not show the supportingroutines,except for bargainingas a
mode of selection; but decision control,communication,and
267/ASQ

<-----Page 23----->politicalroutinescan occur together with any of the routines
shown in the model.
Ourfinalanalysis led us to describe the 25 decision processes in terms of this model. Eachwas translatedinto a
sequence of events, consisting of the centralroutines,interrupts, branches, and cycles. (Decision controland communicationroutinesas well as scheduling and feedback delays were excluded as these occurredalmost regularly.Timing speedups and delays were difficultto reporton.) Because
the narrativeswere not always consistently specific and because of some difficultiesin interpretation(forexample, is
any deep probe to be called diagnosis?),such descriptionwas
at times difficult.However, two researchers so described
each process independentlyand we then assured ourselves
that the two descriptionsagreed in basic form and shape,
even if not in every detail.
We found that all 25 decision processes could be represented
in terms of the basic model, with minoradditionswhich do
not appearto be common.7We found furtherthat decision
processes fell into seven groupingsaccordingto the path
configurationsthroughthe model. These appearedto depend
in large parton the type of solution and the natureof the
dynamicfactors encountered. Interestingly,four of these
seven types reflect the specific natureof the decision outcome (forexample, all decisions of Type 4 involvednew
equipment).The seven path configurationsare discussed below, more or less in orderof complexity.
Type 1. Simple impasse decision processes. Decision processes 1 and 2 were the simplest of the study and the
closest to the main line of the model. They involvedno
development activityat all. Both, however, met interrupts
which complicatedthe flow of events.
Decision process 1 is shown in Figure2. Here, a small manufacturingfirmthree times considered institutinga policyof
mandatoryretirementat age 65; twice the proposalwas
blocked in debate at the senior executive level, and a third
time 10 years later in a periodof recession, it was accepted.
Type 2. Political design decision processes. Decision processes 3 and 4 were similarto those of type 1 in that they
were evoked by given solutions, but different in that the
impasses were more difficultones, and in both cases the

Thereis one consistent differencebetween the reportsand the model. Insome
cases, developmentactivitywas reported
withoutselection activityfollowingit. We
assumed this to be an omissionin the
reports,and in the examplesbelow, we
always show developmentactivityfollowed by evaluation-choiceactivity,unless there was an interrupt.

new hospital treatment

organizationsfound it necessary to branchinto extensive
politicaldesign activity.Together, these two decision processes encountered 9 interruptsand involved9 development
and 12 selection steps.
Decision process 3 is shown in Figure3. Inthis case, a
preeminent hospitalfinallyaccepted a new form of treatment,
involvinga majorshift in its philosophyafter much political
activity.The decision process began when a new director
was appointed.He recognizedthe need for the new treatment and investigated it (diagnosis).However, after repeatedly meeting resistance from a groupof conservative
doctors, he engaged in a series of politicaldesign activities.
First,he hiredfour doctors experienced with the new treatment, but was again blocked (interrupt).Subsequently, the
head of nursingwas replaced(politicaldesign) and other
pressures builtup, includingan accusation of malpractice
from a medicalassociation (interrupt).A reporton implementationwas then prepared(design)and agreement was
reached to implementthe treatment in one publicward
(evaluation-choice).Eighteen months later,there was a strike
(interrupt)and because the new treatment was more effective under conditionsof reduced staff, it was allowed in a
second publicward (evaluation-choice).Withincreasingnumbers of the new staff favoringthe treatment,there was a
sudden demand for full implementationand a threatto resign
by one highlyrespected member of staff (two interrupts).
Two doctors sympathetic to the treatment were then promoted to senior executive positions (politicaldesign) and the
treatmentwas finallyaccepted in the privatewards (final
evaluation-choice).
There are a numberof intriguingfeatures about this decision
process. First,all the design activities except one were political, initiatedto change the power structure.Second, it is
difficultto distinguishevaluation-choiceand recognitionactivity in this decision process. Was debate over the desirability
of institutinga new form of treatment the recognitionof the
need to make a decision or was it the evaluationof a solution? (We took the point of view of the director,who recognized the need early,and accordingly,we treated the debate
as evaluation-choiceactivity).Third,should this be treated as
an opportunity,problem,or crisis decision process? Here
especially we can see that opportunities,problems, and
269/ASQ

<-----Page 25----->crises are to some extent in the eyes of the beholder. One
groupfelt a threatto the hospital's reputation;the other saw
no need for a questionable opportunity.Fourth,despite one's
perceptionof the stimuli,it is clearthat over time the pressures increased, forcingthe issue from the opportunitytoward the crisis end of the continuum.
Type 3. Basic search decision processes. In decision processes 5, 6, and 7 the organizationswere able to establish
relativelyclearguidelines for solution at the outset, and development consisted simply of finding,in one or two nested
search steps, the best availableready-madesolution.8These
were relativelystraight-forwardprocesses, involvingonly two
interrupts,six search steps, and nine selection steps. Two
of the processes lasted less than one year, and the other
between one and two years.

jets for regional airline

Decision process 7, shown in Figure 4, is the most interesting
of the three. A regional airline, having expanded into charter
service, was forced to consider the acquisition of jet aircraft.
Search was conducted, and a choice was made. But the
board, out of concern over the choice made, brought in a new
chief executive. He quickly cancelled the contract (interrupt),
and began active search again. At the same time, he was
approached by salesmen. A number of alternatives were rejected (screen). The remaining alternatives were investigated
more
intensively forI performance and possible financing
270/ASQ~~~~I
(evaluation), and for the availabilityof used aircraft of the
preferred model types (search). There remained three feasible
alternatives for new aircraft, and negotiations for financing
now began. Suddenly, a foreign airline went into receivership,
and two used aircraft of the desired type became available at
a good price with attractive financing (new option interrupt).
The president acted quickly to purchase them (evaluationchoice).

of the students' choice of jobfit intothis
category.

The decision processes studiedby Witte
(1972)and by Cyert,Simon,andTrow
(1956)fit intothis groupingas well.

Type 4. Modified search decision processes (equipment).
Four of the 25 decision processes were characterized by
development activity in which ready-made alternatives were
modified through limited design activity. Interestingly, all 4
dealt with the purchase of systems of sophisticated technological equipment.9 All 4 processes entailed extensive cycling
in development, between 3 and 5 instances, and together
they had 7 search and 9 design steps. All 4 required the
authorization, for a total of 13 instances.

Figure 5. A modified search decision process (equipment) new electric
switching equipment (decision process 9).

In decision process 9, shown in Figure 5, a telecommunication organization found it necessary to automate one of its
switching functions. Requirements were drawn up (design),
and two broad options were considered, electromechanical
and computerized (search). Fifteen manufacturers were then
contacted (search) and 13 were eliminated (screen). The 2
remaining manufacturers then developed specific systems
and bids (nested design), and 1 was selected (evaluationchoice). The decision was then authorized at three successive
levels of the hierarchy.
Type 5. Basic design decision processes (marketing). The
most common processes, found in eight cases, involved extensive design activity, which typically led to complex and
innovative custom-made solutions. There is little evidence of
interrupts, only three instances, or of political activity. All
processes were evoked by opportunities or relatively mild
problems, and all were of relatively short duration. Most interesting, every case dealt with a marketing issue: four new
products or services, three new markets, and a new promotional program. Seven of the eight organizations were private
firms, while the eighth involved a container terminal built by a
government-owned port authority. Clearly these were commercial decisions taken by business, or business-like, organizations, and measurable factors of profit clearly outweighed
any political considerations.
Decision process 17, one of the simplest cases, is shown in
Figure 6. A hotel found itself with a large, vacant room in the
evenings. Because kitchen staff had to be maintained for
another restaurant, it was decided to do something with the

room. This proposalwas authorizedby the owner of the
hotel. One executive of the hotel decided that a supper club
should be opened (design).Anotherexecutive favored a
Britishpub, but the supper club idea prevailed(evaluationchoice). The decision process then involveda series of nested
design cycles, many followed by authorizationby the owner.
Type 6. Blocked design decision processes (public works).
Two processes were identicalto type 5 decision processes
untilthey entered the finalstages of the selection process.
Then both proposed solutions met strong resistance from
outside groups. Both were publicworks projects developed
by government agencies, and both were resisted by groups
of citizens who protested the disruptionsthese projects
would cause.
Decision process 20 involvedresistance to a neighborhood
redevelopment plan, and decision process 21, resistance to
an extended airportrunway.Indecision process 21, shown in
Figure7, the runwayextension was necessary if the airport
was to maintainits status. The announcement of the completed design was the signal for a series of attacks on the
organizationand its proposal.Firsta civicgroup proposed an
alternativeplan, but that was found unacceptable.Then, bills
were introducedin the legislatureto blockthe originalproposal. Finally,law suits were institutedto renderthe proposal
illegalon a technicality.The organizationchose to meet most
of these threats throughdirect confrontationbargaining.(At
the time of the study, the decision process was not yet
completed.)
Type 7. Dynamic design decision processes (facilities).
The dynamicdesign decision processes are the most complex of the decision processes encountered. Processes 22 to
25 followed a basic design or modifiedsearch pattern,but all
four encountered multipleinterruptswith the result that the
flow of activities became very complicated. None took less
than a year, and two took more than fouryears. One was
categorizedas a problemand three as problem-crises.Again,
most interestingly,allfour cases involvedthe same type of
output, new facilities:a new plant,new college building,new
universitylaboratory,and bank headquartersbuilding.We
conclude that the dynamicnatureof these facilitiesdecisions
reflects (a)the relativelylarge investment needed, (b)the
complex design activityinvolvedin such facilities,and,
paradoxically,(c) the likelihoodof new option interruptsbecause of the availabilityof ready-madestructures.

Decision process 24 is diagrammedin Figure8. Here a small
manufacturingfirmwas faced with a series of pressures that
indicatedthat its plantwas obsolete. A proposalto sell the
buildingwas developed (design),and a realestate agent then
contacted (search),but no buyers were found. Itwas then
realizedthat the city might expropriatethe land (interrupt),
and an agent was hiredto negotiate a good price should that
occur. Meanwhile,a neighboringfirm moved out, and their
adjoiningparkinglot was acquiredto provideroom for expansion or to increase the expropriationvalue of the property

proposalsas too expensive (evaluation-choice).At the same
time, the firmemployed architects to investigate two alternatives, but rejected both proposals as too expensive

employees were polled and roadnetworks investigated
(evaluation).One area provedto be the most desirable,and
when an existing facilitywas found there at a good price
(search),it was identifiedas a favoritecandidateand purchased (evaluation-choice).The company plannedthe modification of the building(design),and commenced the alteration.
Two months later,however, the provincialgovernment expropriatedat the same time both the old plantand the new
and gave the firma short time to vacate (interrupt).Now the
firmfaced a crisis. It did, however, have a considerable
source of funds from the expropriationand could consider
buyinglandand buildinga new plant. Onlyone area was
investigated,and a suitable site was located (search).The
firmobtained rezoningsanctions from the municipalgovernment, a mortgage from the bank (design), and the assurance
that this propertywould not be expropriated(authorization).
The.site was purchased(evaluation-choice),and the engineering department,in consultationwith the architect,prepared
buildingplans, (design); the plans were quicklyfinalized
(evaluation-choice).To summarize,what started as a basic
design decision process, type 5, revertedto a dynamicdesign
process, type 7, because of a governmentalinterrupt.
CONCLUSION
In this paperwe have triedto show at the same time that
273/ASQ

<-----Page 29----->strategic decision processes are immensely complex and
dynamicand yet that they are amenable to conceptual structuring.We believe we have been able to capturesome of the
flavorof their structurein our study of 25 of these processes.
In makingthis statement, we are encouraged by the facts
that one model describes much of what we observed, that
the decision processes fall into distinctgroupingswithinthe
model, and that the decisions of each of four of these seven
groupingsinvolvedsimilaroutcomes.
We have, however, barelyscratched the surface of organizationaldecision making.Littleis known about the most important routines, notablydiagnosis, design, and bargaining.Diagnosis is probablythe single most importantroutine,since it
determines in large part,however implicitly,the subsequent
course of action. Yet researchers have paidalmost no attention to diagnosis, preferringinstead to focus on the selection
routines,which often appearto be just a trimmingon the
overalldecision process. Furthermore,while we have addressed ourselves to the question of how organizationsmake
single strategic decisions, we have not looked at the interrelationships among such decisions over time in the same organization,in effect the process of strategy formulation.The
empiricalstudy of strategy formulationhas also been neglected in the literature.Anothermajorgap in the literatureis
the relationshipbetween decision process and structure.The
literaturestill lacks a single acceptable theory to describe how
decision processes flow throughorganizationalstructures. In
fact, it does not even providea helpfultypology of the kinds
of decisions made in organizations,especially of those decisions that are found between the operatingdecisions of the
bottom of the hierarchyand the strategic decisions of the top.
Allof these gaps in the literatureseriously block us from
achieving even an elementary understandingof how organizations function;all are greatlyin need of empiricalresearch.
