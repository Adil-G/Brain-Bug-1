ommercializing knowledge involves transfer from discovering scientists to those who
will develop it commercially. New codes and formulae describing discoveries develop
slowly—with little incentive if value is low and many competing opportunities if high.
Hence new knowledge remains naturally excludable and appropriable. Team production
allows more knowledge capture of tacit, complex discoveries by ﬁrm scientists. A robust
indicator of a ﬁrm’s tacit knowledge capture (and strong predictor of its success) is the number of research articles written jointly by ﬁrm scientists and discovering, “star” scientists,
nearly all working at top universities. An operationally attractive generalization of our star
measure—collaborative research articles between ﬁrm scientists and top research university
scientists—replicates the impact on ﬁrm success. In panel analyses, publications by ﬁrm scientists with stars and/or top 112 university scientists increase the number and citation rate
for ﬁrm patents. Further, star articles increase these rates signiﬁcantly more than other top
112 university scientists’ articles. Cross-sectional analyses of products and employment show
a similar pattern of positive effects on ﬁrms’ success of collaborations with stars or top university scientists, but estimates of differential effects are nonrobust due to multicollinearity.
Venture capital funding has signiﬁcant, usually positive effects on ﬁrm success.

Introduction

Our research program over the past 10 years has
focused on the use of basic science knowledge in
commercial ﬁrms and the impact of that knowledge
on ﬁrm performance. In our earlier research, we
have found substantial consistent evidence that top
academic science, speciﬁcally the star scientists who
make most of the deﬁning discoveries, provides intellectual human capital that deﬁnes the technology of
the ﬁrm—at least following scientiﬁc breakthroughs.
Although there are likely to be considerable spillover
effects when knowledge is created or employed (Jaffe

Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002 pp. 138–153

1986, 1989), and perhaps also an important symbolic
and legitimating function of high quality science for
commercial activity (Stephan and Everhart 1998), our
empirical work identiﬁes the main and robust empirical effects due to real scientiﬁc labor contributions of
star scientists to performance of the ﬁrm.
To “detect” stars and quantify their labor contributions to ﬁrms, we identiﬁed 327 “star” bio-scientists
worldwide based on their publications of geneticsequence discovery articles up to early 1990 before
gene-sequencing machines were in widespread use.
Stars were those cumulatively reporting more than
40 genetic-sequence discoveries or on 20 or more

articles reporting any genetic-sequence discoveries in
GenBank (1990). We identiﬁed every “star” article on
which the star, or (more frequently) a co-author, was
afﬁliated with a ﬁrm. The numbers of these articles
was our measure of the depth of star involvement in
the ﬁrm.
Before turning to new results reported in this article, a brief summary of our prior results will be useful
for readers not already familiar with our work:
• Location of top, “star” scientists predicts location of ﬁrm entry into new technologies (both new
and existing ﬁrms), shown for the United States and
Japan in biotechnology (Zucker, Darby, and Brewer
1998, Darby and Zucker 2001) and replicated for the
semiconductor industry in the United States (Torero
et al. 2001).
• Ties that involve actual work at the science bench
between star scientists (mostly academics) and ﬁrm
scientists consistently have a signiﬁcant positive effect
on a wide range of ﬁrm performance measures in
biotechnology (Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998,
Zucker and Darby 2001) and in semiconductors for
number and quality of patents (Torero 1998). Ties to
stars also shorten the time to IPO (ﬁrms are younger)
and increase the amount of IPO proceeds (Darby
et al. 2001).
• As the quality of an academic star bio-scientist
increases and his/her research becomes more relevant to commercialization, the probability increases
that the scientist conducts joint research or moves
to a ﬁrm. As expected scientiﬁc returns increase—
measured by citations to other local star scientists
working with ﬁrms—the probability that the next star
will begin working with a ﬁrm also increases (Zucker
et al. 2001). Quality is also positively related to working with ﬁrms in Japan, but only number of articles predicts signiﬁcantly with this smaller sample
(Zucker et al. 2000).
Our ﬁndings on the importance of basic university science to successful commercialization of important scientiﬁc discoveries are conﬁrmed in other
research, especially the importance of intellectual
human capital (Di Gregorio and Shane 2000). Faculty
are a key resource in creating and transferring early,
discovery research via commercial entrepreneurial
behavior (Yarkin 2000). Jensen and Thursby (2001)
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

conﬁrm that active, self-interested participation of
discovering professors is an essential condition for
successful commercial licensing of university inventions. Thursby and Thursby (2000) ﬁnd that the sharp
increase in university-industry technology transfer
has not resulted so much from a shift in the nature
of faculty research as from an increased willingness
of faculty and administrators to license and increased
interest on the part of ﬁrms.
In this article, we continue our research program
on the economic value of knowledge, especially tacit
knowledge at the time of commercially relevant scientiﬁc breakthroughs. We compare the real effects on
the performance of biotech ﬁrms of two overlapping
groups of academic scientists who collaborate with
ﬁrm scientists: the stars who made signiﬁcantly more
genetic sequence discoveries, and all relevant scientists (including the bulk of the stars) employed at
one of the top 112 U.S. research universities ranked
by federal research funding. Our overall results again
support the strong effects of academic science on the
success of ﬁrms. Both science measures have strong
positive independent effects on most performance
measures. The patent panels show that the labor effort
of the stars has a signiﬁcant incremental impact on
ﬁrm performance above and beyond the effects of all
scientists from top research universities working with
the ﬁrm. In cross-section estimates, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant
positive effects from either star or top 112 faculty linkages but efforts to enter both sets of variables in the
same regressions are confounded by multicollinearity. We conclude that affordable bibliometric measures
are good but not perfect substitutes for the costly-toconstruct star measures.
The article is organized as follows. In §2 we develop
our theoretical approach to (a) the sources and implications of the information advantage—common to
most scientiﬁc breakthrough knowledge—held by the
discovering scientists, (b) the difﬁculties inherent to
the transfer of tacit knowledge that lead to joint
research, and (c) the amount of knowledge capture necessary for ﬁrms to offset sunk commercial development costs. In §3 we sketch the history of scientiﬁc
development and the rise of the biotech industry,
focusing on the ties between academic science and
139

<-----Page 2----->ZUCKER, DARBY, AND ARMSTRONG
Commercializing Knowledge

commercial ﬁrms. Since data are the plural of anecdote, we present qualitative evidence of the importance of ties to star scientists for the performance of
the most successful ﬁrms. In §4 we brieﬂy review the
variables and their sources and then present and discuss the empirical results. We estimate Poisson regressions (and linear-least squares for employment) that
explain the performance of a panel of biotech ﬁrms
for patents and citation-weighted patents, and crosssections for products in development, on the market and employment. In these regressions, we systematically test the predictive power of science (stars
and top 112 university scientists tied to the ﬁrm via
co-authoring of scientiﬁc research, as well as all local
academic scientiﬁc publishing by stars), venture capital, and other ﬁrm characteristics such as use of the
dominant technology (rDNA or genetic engineering).
In §5 we offer our conclusions. Details on the data set
and supplementary analyses are compiled in a separate appendix, which is cross-referenced and available
from the authors on request.

The Real Effects of
Knowledge Capture

Academic-to-industry technology transfers may be
rare, but we believe they can still account for the
bulk of technological progress. These are not pure
“transfers,” but necessarily knowledge captures to
the degree necessary to offset sunk development,
marketing, and other costs invested in moving a
discovery into a commercial innovation. Many fundamental industry transformations or technological
breakthroughs can be traced to speciﬁc advances in
science. While the industries experiencing technological discontinuity are a distinct minority in our economy, we argue that a distinct minority of ﬁrms within
this distinct minority of industries account for a large
part of the aggregate technological progress conventionally measured in productivity studies (Harberger
1998, Darby and Zucker 2002).
Knowledge and the Market for Information
Our argument starts from the classic Stigler (1961)
observation that information is a valuable and costly
resource and that individuals are thus motivated
140

to adopt strategies, such as search, that weigh the
expected costs and beneﬁts of acquiring information. For example, if individuals’ search involves
unique goods, then costs of search are sufﬁciently
high that transactions are commonly localized as a
device for identifying potential buyers and sellers.
Stigler pointed out that medieval markets were an
example of actual localization; advertising is an example of a “virtually” localized market.
We argue that another mechanism of “virtual”
localization is a profession, or more commonly, a
subspecialty within a profession.1 Here, the buyers
and sellers of knowledge, including new or “breakthrough” discoveries, are brought together in a highly
balkanized market in which the participants share
a reasonably similar endowed knowledge base that
makes the new knowledge potentially understandable
and useable. The size and geographic distribution of
that knowledge base determines the extent of initial
demand for the new knowledge. For the purposes of
our argument here, information and knowledge are
equivalent.
From Tacit to Codiﬁed Knowledge
New information tends to be produced in tacit
form, increasing in tacitness as a function of distance from prior knowledge (hence, especially breakthrough knowledge), and requires resources to codify.
Tacit knowledge tends to be highly personal, initially
known only by one person (or a small team of discovering scientists) and is difﬁcult to transfer to others
(Polyani 1962, Schutz 1962).
As knowledge increases in complexity, the probability increases that deviation from “textbook” description of action will be required (Nelson 1959, Nelson
and Winter 1982). For example, internal bleeding during surgery requires decisions about whether and
how to deviate from the textbook that cannot be
fully prescribed in advance. This kind of complexity
1
Most commonly, there are multiple virtually localized markets
organized around competing perspectives or models employed
within the subspecialty. There is also geographic localization within
the professions, with advantages to universities or cities with a
“critical mass” of scientists who can interact. Thus, UCSF with
its critical mass of molecular biologists and related sciences, and
nearby strong universities, was “ripe” for a breakthrough.

Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 3----->ZUCKER, DARBY, AND ARMSTRONG
Commercializing Knowledge

leads to knowledge remaining tacit longer, perhaps
remaining an “active task” that changes its nature
in response to contingencies in contrast to an “inert
task” such as a secretary typing a letter written by
his/her boss (Scott et al. 1967).
Knowledge becomes shared (intersubjective) to the
extent that codes or formulas are borrowed from
pre-existing knowledge and/or are newly created.
Relevance to earlier knowledge allows borrowing of
codes, mathematical expressions and relations, and
even machines that “embody” those codes/math.
Such knowledge is cumulative and can be easily
understood and transferred, relying on references to
the well-understood prior scientiﬁc literature.
But new knowledge that cannot be readily grafted
on old is likely to offer more opportunities. Opportunity can shift incentives—increasing them along a
continuum from incremental change to breakthrough
discoveries (Klevorick et al. 1995). Increased incentives to enter arise from these greater opportunities.
Discovering scientists become important in technology transfer when a new discovery has both high
commercial value and a combination of scarcity and
tacitness that deﬁnes natural excludability, the degree
to which there is a barrier to the ﬂow of the valuable
knowledge from the discoverers to other scientists.
Tacit, complex knowledge provides partial natural
protection of information, both separately and jointly
with more formal property rights. Those with the
most information about breakthrough discoveries are
the scientists actually making them, so there is initial natural scarcity. To the extent that the knowledge is both scarce and tacit, it constitutes intellectual
human capital retained by the discovering scientists,
and therefore they become the main resource around
which ﬁrms are built or transformed (Zucker, Darby,
and Brewer 1998; Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong
1998). Hence, tacit knowledge can be viewed as at
least partially rivalrous and excludable information
and thus “appropriable” as long as it remains difﬁcult
(or impossible) to learn it.
As tacit knowledge becomes increasingly
codiﬁed—or translated into “recipe knowledge”
as Schutz (1962) terms it—tacitness decreases and
knowledge transfer is easier. But signiﬁcant barriers
stand in the way of codiﬁcation. Relevance between
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

old and new knowledge can be difﬁcult to determine
(Schutz 1970), increasing the demand for social construction of new codes, formulae, and machines. The
greater the discontinuity, the more difﬁcult it is to
anchor in prior systems of knowledge.
Until there is a reliable indicator of the value of the
new knowledge, the size of the market for codiﬁcation is unlikely to be large enough to cover the cost
of developing the new codes. Paradoxically, once the
value is known,
• If the value is low relative to alternative uses of
scientiﬁc talent, then there are few incentives to codify it.
• If it is high, those few scientists who hold the
new knowledge will have to weigh returns to codiﬁcation against returns to time invested in scientiﬁc research, a trade-off that pits knowledge transfer
against knowledge creation.
— Hence, the average scientiﬁc discovery is never
codiﬁed, and valuable discoveries experience a signiﬁcant codiﬁcation lag that tends to increase with
their value.
Knowledge Capture via Team Production
Knowledge that is cumulative builds on an existing
set of words and symbols, and hence involves less or
no barrier to communication: Listening to a lecture or
reading a text can sufﬁce. But tacit knowledge often
requires that one of those already holding that knowledge works with the novices to teach them in a handson process. For example, 81% of the new authors
enter GenBank by writing with old authors, and new
authors write exclusively with new authors a significant 36% less than “old,” experienced authors write
exclusively with other “old” authors after excluding
all sole authored papers (Zucker et al. 2001). Transfer may be very effective—there are well-documented
effects of cumulative experience on performance
improvement (Pisano et al. 2001)—but it is slow and
requires the active participation of the holder of the
tacit knowledge.
Discovering scientists are typically willing to transfer knowledge primarily in the context of their ongoing laboratory work. At the extreme, when tacitness
is high, it is their collaborators on their research team
who are the recipients of this knowledge; others are
141

<-----Page 4----->ZUCKER, DARBY, AND ARMSTRONG

Figure 1

excluded through lack of access. Thus, the initial cost
of entry is high. But entry cost tends to decline over
time, and the probability of an error in the initial discovery also declines as others replicate it, thus reducing risk to the new entering scientist.2
This restricted process of transfer will more often
than “normal science” lead to sufﬁcient knowledge
capture to justify the cost of commercial development by a ﬁrm. Knowledge capture explains why tacit
knowledge tends to be highly localized: It will be concentrated geographically around where the discoveries are made (or where the discoverers move). As
shown in Figure 1, there is considerable concentration
of patented inventions, as well as human therapies
and vaccines, in development and on the market. Just
two states, California and Massachusetts with 14%
of the U.S. population, have a disproportionate share
2

Note that when multiple teams are racing for a “ripe” discovery and publish their results almost simultaneously, we have much
more rapid conﬁrmation/validation of the discovery, which promotes faster learning by others. Gina Durante, graduate student at
the Anderson School at UCLA, suggested this point.

142

especially of U.S. products in development (49%) and
on the market (58%). Patenting is somewhat less
concentrated; since patenting is both an input and
an output of the innovation process, this may suggest a lessening of geographic concentration, perhaps
as the discoveries mature and are codiﬁed. Generally
patents provide a useful incentive to the codiﬁcation
of knowledge, but in the case of patented cell lines,
a novel technique—deposit in an approved depositary to be publicly available on patent expiration—
acknowledged the difﬁculty in codifying exactly how
the new organisms could be created.
Understanding the role of scientiﬁc teams in tacit
knowledge transfer extends the arguments for team
production: (a) Team organization makes routine the
transfer of tacit knowledge from the discoverer to
other team members, and if team members cross
organizational boundaries, then tacit knowledge is
efﬁciently transferred—in the present case, most interestingly from university discovering scientists to ﬁrm
scientists (Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong 1998). (b)
Through team organization, more productive cooperation is often achieved via specialization than possible
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

<-----Page 5----->ZUCKER, DARBY, AND ARMSTRONG
Commercializing Knowledge

through the linking of individual efforts across impersonal markets (Demsetz 1995, p. 17).
The greater the labor effort of the discovering
university scientist(s) with teams containing ﬁrm
scientists, the greater the amount of tacit knowledge
transfer. In bench level collaboration, you can actually
see how the science is done. As tacit knowledge transfer increases from the discovering scientists, the success of the ﬁrm also increases. Thus, managers of high
tech ﬁrms have incentives to hire the top-discovering
scientists if their discoveries have commercial value.
Discovering scientists also have incentives to found a
new ﬁrm. In sharp contrast, in industries where “normal science” reigns, hiring of below average, acceptably competent scientists at a low wage is the typical
practice (Kornhauser 1962). Obviously, each can be a
market-value–maximizing strategy for the ﬁrms facing different knowledge frontiers.

Scientists’ Leadership
and Industry Success:
Commercializing Knowledge

Biotechnology is a preeminent example of an industry
undergoing very rapid growth associated with radical
technological change initiated in academe and based
on basic science breakthroughs. The key attributes can
be summarized concisely:
• Breakthrough discovery: Professors Stanley Cohen
(Stanford) and Herbert Boyer (University of
California–San Francisco) reported the basic technique for recombinant DNA, also known as rDNA,
genetic engineering, or gene splicing (Cohen et al.
1973).
• University scientists: We identiﬁed star bioscientists based on genetic sequence discoveries
reported in GenBank (1990), an online reference ﬁle,
and in this article introduce bio-scientists identiﬁed
in ISI’s electronic ﬁle of research articles written by
at least one author located at one of the top 112
U.S. research universities.3 Star articles are (nearly) a

subset of top 112 articles (U.S. stars not in a top 112
university and conference papers—less than 1% of the
total star articles—are not included in the ISI article
ﬁles).
• Links/collaborations with ﬁrms: Articles that are
co-authored by ﬁrm employees and top scientists,
including “stars” and the top 112 university scientists,
indicate the intensity of involvement with the ﬁrm’s
research effort.4 Most of these scientists “wear two
hats,” one as professor at a university and one as a
leader or lab head at a ﬁrm (conﬁrmed through interviews at universities and ﬁrms on both coasts).
Firm Success and Knowledge Capture
The degree to which an open scientiﬁc literature can
produce such strong apparent “knowledge capture”
effects on ﬁrm success rests on (a) characteristics of
tacit, complex knowledge that lead to natural excludability, and (b) selection by ﬁrms of discoveries for
which the degree of knowledge capture is likely to
offset sunk costs incurred in making the scientiﬁc discovery a commercial innovation.
To provide some intuition for our regression results,
we ﬁrst brieﬂy review examples of the prominent
positions that top academic scientists are given in the
most successful biotech ﬁrms, identify their copublishing with the ﬁrm, and ﬁnally explore the impact
that top scientists’ copublications with ﬁrm scientists
have on success.

board prominent university professors from UCLA,
CalTech, and Stanford, all members of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Table 1 shows that 40% of these top 10 biotech companies reported at least one star on their team when
going public, while 70% had linked articles (star copublishing with at least one ﬁrm employee). Not surprisingly, because of the much broader coverage of
both scientists and universities, these top 10 biotech
companies reported a higher percentage of top 112
university scientists: 80% reported at least one top 112
scientist on their team when going public, and 90%
had core collaborations with one or more of these scientists. The advantage of the publishing measure is
that it weights the amount of involvement of the scientist: For example, Centocor had only 1/20 as many
core collaborative research articles as Genentech.
IPOs listed many former or current university professors as company founders, ofﬁcers, directors or key
members of scientiﬁc advisory boards (see Appendix
Table A1). Almost every scientist holding a top management position had done so since the company’s
founding. These scientists were not brought in as part

of the preparation for the IPO to merely “signal” the
ﬁrm’s success, contrary to a suggestion in Stephan
and Everhart (1998).

Capitalists

Is Success in the Stars?
Certainly, scientists in high-ranking positions in these
now public ﬁrms provide scientiﬁc control and are
important for ﬁrm success. However, the majority of
ﬁrms in our sample do not go public before the end of
our time period. In any case, we are interested in the
actual work that top scientists do that is joint with the
ﬁrm. We measure this joint work by the cumulative
number of collaborative articles.
Using the total number of joint articles, drawing
on both of our science measures, we can take a preliminary look at our ﬁndings by graphing the mean
values of the cumulative number of tied articles: for
the stars, articles that involve a star scientist and a
ﬁrm scientist (where the star can also be an employee
of the ﬁrm) and for scientists at the top 112 universities, articles that involve joint work by at least one
university and one ﬁrm scientist. These values are
shown in Figure 2a. The differences are particularly
striking at the 10+ article level. The mean success by
tied star articles is consistently and markedly higher
than for top 112 university scientists across our major
success measures: patents, products in development,
and products on the market.
Figure 2b presents the comparable data on venture capital funding (data from Venture Economics).
The amount of venture capital funding is less consistent in its effects compared to tied/linked science results. While increasing cumulative amount of
venture ﬁnancing generally increases both patents
and products in development, the magnitude of differences is small relative to the tied/linked science
effects shown in Figure 2a.
Concentration of Success
Darby and Zucker (2002) argue that much if not most
of technological progress is accounted for by relatively few ﬁrms operating in relatively few industries
undergoing rapid change. We will just touch on examples of concentration here:
• Industry Success Concentration: Top-decile biotech
ﬁrms account for accounted for 64% of the total number of human therapies and vaccines in development
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

(485 as of 1991), 43% of all patents, and dominated
human therapies and vaccines on the market (82%).
(See Appendix Figure A1.)
• Geographic Concentration: 64% of the total products in development are concentrated in the top ﬁve
states (Appendix Table A2); 58% of the total products
145

<-----Page 8----->ZUCKER, DARBY, AND ARMSTRONG

on the market are concentrated in those same ﬁve
states (Appendix Table A3).

Empirical Results

The Data
The Zucker-Darby star-scientists/articles database
has been a powerful tool for exploring the coevolution of life sciences and biotechnology. However, that methodology involves an expenditure of
resources justiﬁable only for pioneering academic
efforts or sophisticated ﬁnancial institutions. As the
ISI databases are increasingly available, the extent
to which electronic bibliometry can substitute for
hand coding and specialized technical knowledge is
a question of practical importance to both academic
researchers and industry practitioners.
Here we use the basic tool of copublishing between
academic and ﬁrm scientists as a detector of joint
research and (often two-way) university-industry
technology transfer. The Institute of Scientiﬁc Information (ISI 2000) U.S. University Science Indicators
database on CD-ROM has extensive information on
all the scientiﬁc articles with at least one author at
any of the top 112 U.S. research universities.
Table 2 deﬁnes all the variables used in the empirical estimates and provides summary sample statistics
for each. As in Zucker, Darby, and Armstrong (1998),
we classify each article in GenBank of which a star scientist is an author relative to each ﬁrm as afﬁliated
with the ﬁrm, as linked to the ﬁrm if the star is unafﬁliated but writing with the ﬁrm’s employees, and
otherwise as untied to the ﬁrm. Aggregating over all
stars and time for each ﬁrm gives the ﬁrst six variables in Table 2. The “local” in local untied articles
refers to articles by stars afﬁliated with universities or
research institutes in the ﬁrm’s functional economic
area (metro area plus exurbs as deﬁned by the U.S.
Bureau of Economic Analysis).
We attempted to ﬁnd all articles written by any
employee of each of our biotech ﬁrms in the ISI (2000)
database; these article also must have at least one top
112 university author to be included. Among these
joint articles, we focus on the “core collaborations”
in the four central biotech ﬁelds catalogued by ISI:
biochemistry and biophysics, cell and developmental
146

biology, molecular biology and genetics, and microbiology. To control for variation in quality of the collaborators, we also collected the number of citations
in ISI-indexed journals in the current plus next four
years for each article.
The ﬁrm characteristics and the last ﬁve dependent
variables were mostly collected from paper directories and industry studies used by industry participants when looking for suppliers and customers. This
methodology is tedious, but it is one of the few available for analysis of large numbers of privately (as
well as publicly) held ﬁrms. As described in other
papers referenced in Table 2, considerable effort was
expended in ensuring that uniform coding procedures
were applied to obtain quantitative variables from
text records.
The primary exception was the venture-funding
data obtained by licensing the Venture Economics
database and deﬂating dollar amounts by the GDP
deﬂator. We also had the list of licensees of the UC–
Stanford Cohen-Boyer patent as an alternate indicator
of the use of recombinant DNA technology. We bought
our list of biotech patents from CHI Research, Inc., in
1997. We ensured that the CHI list included all those
on U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce (1993) and appropriate others. Counts of
citations to date by other patents were included.
The Estimates
In a technology-intensive industry like biotechnology,
patents are a crucial measure of success. Patents serve
as a measure of output from a ﬁrm’s “knowledge production function” (Griliches 1990). The patent permits
knowledge capture by establishing ownership rights
to the invention’s commercial rewards until the patent
expiration date and even beyond expiration to the
extent the ﬁrm establishes brand recognition. Patenting success also impacts the ﬁrm’s ability to raise public equity capital.8 Because patent acquisition is key to
both ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial measures of success
and citations data are available with which to qualityadjust a ﬁrm’s patents, the patenting success models
are a key testing ground for the electronic version of
our star methodology.

Table 3 reports standard Poisson regression estimates for panel data on U.S. patenting by U.S. biotech
ﬁrms. The standard errors are corrected using the
procedure of Wooldridge (1991).9 Models a and e in
Table 3 indicate that simple ﬁrm characteristics avail9

The signiﬁcance of key variables in these regressions is generally not sensitive to the Wooldridge correction, but to achieve an
estimate of the variance-covariance matrix that is not restricted by
ﬁrst-moment parameter estimates, we apply the Wooldrige method
as we did in the California study. An alternative would be to
implement a binomial speciﬁcation, but as explained in Wooldridge
(1991), this procedure may bias both ﬁrst- and second-moment estimates, whereas the Poisson process potentially biases only the second moment parameters.

able for both private and public ﬁrms do a good job of
explaining patenting. Entrants are generally at a disadvantage, experience helps, and use of the dominant
technology (recombinant DNA or genetic engineering) is a positive factor for both quantity and quality
of patenting. As always with forward-looking ﬁnancial variables, the positive effect of the cumulative
amount of venture capital investment may confound
real R&D productivity of the investments with forecasting the effects of other, omitted variables.
Firms that have many articles with star scientists
also tend to have many articles with top 112 university faculty—indeed nearly all the linked star articles are also included in the top 112 core collaboraManagement Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

tions count of joint faculty-ﬁrm articles. If one adds
either the star variables used in Zucker, Darby, and
Armstrong (1998) or core collaborations and their
mean citations (a quality measure) as in Models b
and c or f and g, we see that either set of indicators improves the explanatory power of the models.
In the current case of patents and patent citations,
the ﬁt is a little better with the new variables than
with the star-based variables, but we will see below
that just the opposite is true for all products and for
human therapeutics and vaccines on the market. The
failure of local untied star articles to enter signiﬁcantly positively reafﬁrms our (1998) result that localized knowledge impacts of universities on industry
are associated with market transactions rather than
uncompensated spillovers from the ivory tower. The
coefﬁcients on cumulative venture capital investment
are only mildly reduced by inclusion of either (or
both) of the star-or top 112-based measures of the
ﬁrm’s science base. This suggests that venture capitalists in the 1980s were not discriminating much among
biotech ﬁrms on the basis of scientiﬁc depth, so we
obtain independent effects on research productivity of
both intellectual and ﬁnancial capital. The signiﬁcance
of the knowable science-base information implies that
the capital markets were not fully incorporating it in
allocating capital.
Models d and h in Table 3 experiment with adding
both sets of science indicators at once. Since linked
star articles are generally included in the top 112 core
collaboration counts, the coefﬁcient on linked articles measures the additional impact of stars on ﬁrm
research output over and above that of the “average” joint authorship with a professor from a top 112
university. The coefﬁcients for all core collaborations
and their mean citations as well as this additional
star impact are positive and signiﬁcant for patents
and patent citations. The negative coefﬁcient on afﬁliated star scientists in these full regressions appears to
reﬂect the special circumstances of one or two ﬁrms
that have the bulk of afﬁliated articles.
Unfortunately, the smaller samples for the crosssection results in Tables 4, 5, and 6—comparable
patent cross-sections are in the appendix available on
request—seem more confounded by the near multicollinearity of the science variables observed cumulatively up to 1990: For the full Models d and h, where
Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 1, January 2002

both the star and top 112 article faculty-ﬁrm coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant they have opposite signs. We
would prefer panel estimates for products in development and on the market and employment also,
but each observation is very costly to obtain from
old paper directories for these predominantly private
start-up ﬁrms. As with the patent panels, we get generally signiﬁcantly positive coefﬁcients for linked and
afﬁliated star articles (Models b and f in Tables 4, 5,
and 6) or for top 112 core collaboration articles and
their mean citations. Employment is the one dependent variable without many zeroes; in Table 6 we
estimate the log of 1994 employment in accord with
Gibrat’s Law (Sutton 1997).
In summary, the empirical work strongly supports the central message that university-ﬁrm technology transfer for breakthrough discoveries generally involves detectable joint research between top
professors and ﬁrms that they own or are compensated by. We have shown that our electronic bibliometry provides good but imperfect substitutes for
the more costly to obtain and difﬁcult to operationalize star measures. In particular, in large samples
where we can obtain separable impacts, star linkages
appear to have a signiﬁcantly larger effect on ﬁrm
research productivity than the average article written
jointly by top research university professors and ﬁrm
employees.

Conclusions

Breakthrough discoveries in gene splicing set off
a revolution in bioscience and created the biotechnology industry. These discoveries set the stage,
then, for increased opportunity and increased incentives to enter. But signiﬁcant natural barriers to the
communication of new knowledge often exist. New
knowledge tends to be developed in tacit form and
requires resources to codify. New codes and formula to describe discoveries develop slowly—with
insufﬁcient incentives if value is low and too many
competing opportunities if the value is high. Hence
new knowledge tends to remain uncodiﬁed, difﬁcult to obtain except through hands-on learning at
the lab bench, and hence naturally excludable and

appropriable. Our basic argument is that knowledge
close to breakthrough discoveries needs to be transformed into words, codes, and/or formula before it
can be easily transferred.
Difﬁculties inherent to the transfer of tacit knowledge lead to joint research: Team production allows
more knowledge capture of tacit, complex discoveries
by ﬁrm scientists. A robust detector of tacit knowledge capture by the ﬁrm (and strong predictor of
ﬁrm success) is the number of research articles written jointly by scientists working at a ﬁrm and the
discovering, “star” scientists, nearly all working at
top universities. For ﬁrms to commercialize new discoveries, there must be sufﬁcient knowledge capture
by the ﬁrm to offset sunk commercial development
costs.

We ﬁnd the results reported in Zucker, Darby, and
Armstrong (1998) to be replicated to a major extent
in the whole United States. The principal ﬁnding
in our earlier paper, covering only California ﬁrms,
was that research collaborations between ﬁrm scientists and university star scientists (the ties) had a
robust signiﬁcant positive effect on ﬁrm performance.
The local pool of bioscience knowledge generated by
nearby but noncollaborating scientists had no positive
effect, providing further evidence for embodied technology transfer through markets rather than “knowledge spillovers.” But this article is not simply a replication and scale-up.
In this article we add a generalized form of our star
measure: the collaborative research articles between
ﬁrm scientists and top U.S. university scientists. In

panel analyses, ﬁrms whose scientists collaborate
with stars and/or top 112 U.S. university scientists
have more patents and more highly cited patents. Further, star articles have an incremental positive effect
above top 112 university scientists’ articles on the
number and quality of patents. Our cross-sectional
analyses of products and employment show a generally similar pattern of positive effects on ﬁrms’ success of collaborations with stars or top university
scientists, but the incremental effects are less systematic. This nonrobustness appears to be due to multicollinearity. As predicted, untied star articles are
either nonsigniﬁcant or oscillate between signiﬁcant
positive and negative effects. Venture capital funding amounts were always signiﬁcant and usually
positive.

The overall importance of ties, compared to lack
of signiﬁcance or instability of untied star effects,
suggests that working jointly at the lab bench is a
crucial transfer mechanism when knowledge has an
important or large tacit component. Further, our ﬁndings suggest that, as we predicted, tacit knowledge is
embodied in individual, discovering scientists. Telephone interviews conducted by Jeff Armstrong of
university star scientists revealed that their relationships with ﬁrms were governed by tight contractual
arrangements, academic scientists typically being
“vertically integrated” into the ﬁrm in the sense of
receiving equity compensation and being bound by
exclusivity agreements. This evidence that star scientists were either fully employed by ﬁrms or were
governed in their relationships with ﬁrms by explicit

contracts supported our conclusion that ﬁrm success
was not the result of a general knowledge “spillover”
from universities to ﬁrms but due to star scientists
taking charge of their discoveries.
