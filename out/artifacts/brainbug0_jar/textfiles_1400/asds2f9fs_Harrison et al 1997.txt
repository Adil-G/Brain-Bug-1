P4: the greater the perception of competence, the greater the possibility of trusting, cooperative behavior.

A PROTOCOL FOR IDENTIFYING TRUST AND COOPERATION
Based on this discussion it IS now possible to summarize the protocol developed for the
analysis of trust in the informal investment domain and indicate how trust concepts have been
operationalized in the empirical analysis that follows (Table 2). This protocol covers both of the
key elements in the understanding of trust relations developed above: trust criteria, including
calculus-based trust (characterized by intimations of difference between individuals), knowledge-based trust (characterized by intimations of agreement between individuals), and identification-based trust (based on intimations of the mutual sharing of values); and cooperation criteria, which are consistent with the factors identified as important in the informal investment
decision-making process, including utility (potential economic value), importance (potential
non-economic value), risk (potential loss), competence (professional ability of another individual), and coordinator judgment (the coordinating partner's ability to select potential investment opportunities). In addition, a residual 'other' category was included to cover any aspects
of the proposal or opportunity that were not otherwise codable.
The data used in this paper were collected as part of a wider study of the decision-making
process of business angels (Mason & Rogers, 1997). The focus of this study was on the initial
screening stage when business angels first become aware of an investment opportunity and
decide whether it is worth considering in detail. The study used verbal protocol analysis, a
methodology that captures decision making in real time and has been used successfully to
examine the decision-making processes of venture capitalists (Sandberg et al., 1988; Hall &
Hofer, 1993; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1995). This methodology involves asking respondents to
'think out loud' while they perform a particular task, and is based on the assumption that the
vocalization of thoughts has the form of inner speech (Ericsson & Simon, 1980; 1993).
Previous applications of the technique confirm that although the decision-making context is
artificially constructed for research purposes, the results are no less reliable or valid than those
obtained from 'recall' survey methods, such as questionnaire surveys or interview schedules
(Hall & Hofer, 1993; Zacharakis & Meyer, 1995).
Respondents in this study were shown an investment opportunity featured in a recent issue
of Venture Capital Report (VCR), the leading national business angel introduction service in
the UK, which they were seeing for the first time (Cary, 1995). This opportunity featured a
company seeking £100,000 in exchange for 20% of the equity to finance the marketing of a
rowing training machine using a patented water flywheel to simulate resistance during the rowing stroke (see Mason & Rogers, 1997). The entrepreneur had negotiated exclusive selling
rights throughout Europe for the product, which was manufactured in the USA by the company that had developed it. However, he believed that the machines were expensive and supply
was unpredictable, and so decided to begin to manufacture the product in the UK, incorporating some of his own design improvements. Start-up finance was raised from two external
investors. The company pays a royalty to the US company, which owns the patent for the
machine, for every machine it sells. The new funding was sought to significantly increase marketing expenditure.
As part of a wider study of the decision-making processes of business angels (Mason &
Rogers, 1996) a total of 19 business angels, drawn from respondents to previous surveys
(Mason & Harrison, 1994) or Identified by business angel or other contacts, were asked to
review three such business opportunity profiles. Ten investors, all of whom were active
investors (with an average of 6.4 investments made over the past five years), reviewed this par-
