' ((Who
a

Is an
Entrepreneur?"Is the
Wrong Question
WilliamB. Gartner

Entrepreneurshipis the creationof organizations.Whatdlfterentiatesentrepreneurs
trom non-entrepreneursls that entrepreneuns
createorganizations,whil-e.non-entrepreneursdc not. In behavioralapproachesto the study of entrepreneurshipan entre
preneur is seen as a set of activltiesinvolvedin organizationcreation,while in tralt
approachesan entrepreneurls a set of personalitytraits and characteristics.This
gager argues that tralt approaches have been unfrultful and that behavioral ap
proaches will be a more productive perspectivefor future'research in entrepreneurship.

My own personalexperience
wasthat for ten yearswe ran a researchcenter
in entrepreneurial
history; for ten ye:trs
-had we tried to definethe entrepreneur.
We nevlr succeeded.iEicnof us
somenotion of it-what he thought
was, for his purposes,
a Geful definition.And I don't think you'regoingto
get fartherthanthat.(Cole, 1969,p. 17)
How can we know the dancerfrom the dance?(Yeats,1956)
Arthur Cole's wordshavetakenon the deepertonesof prophecy.Recentreviews of the entrepreneurship
literaturehavefoundfew changesin this dilemma
in the sixteenyearssinceCole's statement.Brockhuasand Horwiu's (1985)
review of-tie psychotogyof the entrepreneur
concludedthat "The literatureappearsto supportthe argumentthat thereis no genericdefinitionof the entrepreneur,or if thereis we do not havethe psychological
instruments
to discoverit at
this time. Most of the attemptsto distinguishbetweenenrrepreneurs
and small
businessownersor managershavediscoveredno significantdiffercntiatingfeatures." (pp. 4243) Otherscholarshaveconcurredthat a commondefinitionof
the entrepreneur
remainselusive(Carsrud,Olm and Edy, 1985;Sextonand
Smilor,1985;Wortman,1985).
Cole's early doubtsaboutwhetherthe entreprcneur
could be definedhavenot
stoppedresearchers
from attemptingto do so. Much rcsearchin the entrepreneurship field has focusedon the personof the entrepreneur,
askingthe question,
Why do certainindividualsstartfirms whenothers,undersimilarconditions,do
not? Asking why hasled us to answeringwith who: Why did X starta venture?
BecauseX hasa certaininnerqualityor qualities.This focuscanbe identifiedin
any researchwhich seeksto identify traits that differentiateentrepreneurs
from
(Komives, 1972;McClelland,1961;
non-entrepreneurs:
needfor achievement
McClellandand Winter, 1969),locusof control(Brockhaus,1980a;Brockhaus

(Brockhaus,
1980b:
Hull. Bosley,andUdell,1982;Liles,1974;Mancuso.
1975:
Palmer,l97ll, values(DeCarloandLyons, 1979:Hornaday
andAboud. l97l;
Hull, Bosley,and Udell, 1980;Komives.1972),age(Cooper.1973;Howell,
1972:Mayer and Goldstein,196l) are but a few examples.X startsa venture
becauseof qualitiesthat madeX who (s)heis. Entrepreneurship
researchhas
long asked,"Who is an entrepreneur?"
I believethe attemptto answerthe question"Who is an entrepreneur?,"
whichfocusses
on the traitsandpersonality
characteristics
of entrepreneurs,
will
neitherleadus to a definitionof the entrepreneur
nor help us to understand
the
phenomenon
of entrepreneurship.
This searchfor characteristics
andtraitsof the
entrepreneur
is labeledin this articleas the trait approach.In this approachthe
entrepreneur
is the basicunit of analysisandtheentrepreneur's
traitsandcharacteristicsare the key to explainingentrepreneurship
as a phenomenon,
sincethe
entrepreneur"causes" entrepreneurship.
The purposeof the frst part of this
article is to look at researchbasedon the trait view of entrepreneurship
and to
showthat this view aloneis inadequate
to explainthe phenomenon
of entrepreneurship.Anotherapproachis neededto help us refocusour thoughtson entrepreneurship.That approach-the behavioralapproach-will be presentedand
the two approaches
will be comparedand contrasted.

THETRAITAPPROACH
ln the_trait approachthe entrepreneuris assumedto be a particular personality
type, a fixed stateof existence,a describablespeciesthat one might find a picture
of in a field guide, and the point of much entrepreneurshipresearchhas been to
enumeratea set of characteristicsdescribing this entity known as the entrepreneur. One indicationof the tenacityof this point of view-i.e., once an entrepren9ur, always an entrepreneur,since an entrepreneuris a personality type, a state
of being that doesn't go away-can be seen in the selection of samplis of "entrepreneurs" in many well-regardedresearchstudies (Table l). In many studies
"enE€preneurs"
are sampled many years after having started their firms. Hornaday and Aboud (1971), for example, chose to study individuals who headed
neurs" were interviewed anywherefrom two to sixteen years after startup. Is the
owner/manager_o!-anongoing firm two or ten or even fifteen years aftei startup
an entrepreneur?If this individual is included in a sample of entrepreneurs,what
does that imply about the researcher'sdefinition of the entrepreneur,and what
will the resulting data reflect?
Table I is an attempt to organizeconcisely much of the major literanureon the
entrepreneurand entrePreneurship.It representsa succumbingto the grand temptation that haunts many writers and researchersin the entrepreneurshipfield: if
we could just systematicallygo back and extract, categorize,and organize what
has already been discovered about the ennepreneur, we will return with the
pieces of a puzzle which we can then fit together into the big picture, and the
entrepreneurwill aPPeardefined on the page. Table I is most emphatically nor
the big picture. lnstead Table I shows:
( l) that many (and often vague)definitionsof the entrepreneurhave beenused
..
(in many studiesthe entrepreneuris never defined);

<-----Page 11----->Although the behavioralview of entrepreneurship
is not ne\r,.it seemsthat it
hasalwaysbeena difficult view to maintain(Peterson,l98l). As we haveseen.
the entrepreneurhas long seemedto many researchersto be a special person
whosequalitiesneedto be investigated.In 1980Van de Ven issueda warningto
entrepreneurshipresearchersnot to be tempted into studies of traits and characteristics:
Researcherswedded to the conceptionof entrepreneurship
for studying the
creation of organizations can learn much from the history of research on
leadership.Like the studiesof entrepreneurship,
this researchbegan by investigatingthe traits and personalitycharacteristicsof leaders.However, no
empirical evidencewas found to support the expectationthat there are a finite
number of characteristicsor traits of leadersand that thesetraits differentiate
successfulfrom unsuccessfulleaders.More recently,researchinto leadership
has apparently made some progress by focusing on the behavior of leaders
(that is, on what they do insteadof what they are) and by determiningwhat
situational factors or conditions moderate the effects of their behavior and
performance.(p. 86)
Jenks(1950) and Kilby (1971) have also stronglycriticized researchwhich seeks
to develop personality profiles of the entrepreneur;both have encouragedresearchersto study the behaviorsand activities of entrepreneurs.In empirical research(Brockhaus,1980;Brockhaus& Nord, 1979:Sexton& Kent, l98l) have
found that when certain psychological traits are carefully evaluated, it is not
possibleto differentiateentrepreneursfrom managersor from the generalpopulation basedon the entrepreneur'ssupposedpossessionof such traits.
The trait approach to entrepreneurshipresearchis understandablypersistent.
Entrepreneursoften do seem like special people who achievethings that most of
us do not achieve. Theseachievements,we think, must be basedon some special
inner qualiry. It is difficult not to thir* this way. But let us rry to srepoutside this
way of thinking. We can illustrate this point with a srory. What if the United
Statessuddenly found itself unable to field a team of baseballplayers that could
win in world competition?One responseto such a problem might be to do researchon baseballplayers to learn "Who is a baseballplayer?," so that individuals with baseballplaying propensitycould be selectedfrom the population.
Such studies might determinethat, on average,baseballplayers weigh 185
pounds.are six feet tall, and most of them can benchpressover 250 pounds.We
could probably develop a very good personalityprofile of the baseballplayer.
Basedon upbringingand experiencewe could documenta baseballplayer's locus
of control, need for achievement,toleranceof ambiguity, and other characteristics that we thought must make for good baseballplaying. We could then recruit individuals with this set of characteristicsand feel confident once again in
our comP€titiveedge. Yet, this type of researchsimply ignores the obviousthat is, the baseballplayer, in fact, plays baseball.Baseball involves a set of
behaviors-running, pitching, throwing, catching, hitting, sliding, etc.-that
baseballplayers exhibit. To be a baseballplayer means that an individual is
behaving as a baseballplayer. A baseballplayer is not somerhingone is, it is
somethingone does, and the dehnition of a baseballplayer cannot stray far from
this obvious fact without getringinto difficulty.

From the previousdiscussion,focusingon the inrentionalityof the individual
in order to determinewhether that individual is an entrepreneuris just another
variation on the trait theme, and requiresus ro investigatethe psychologyof the
entrepreneurand establisha psychologicalprofile of the enrrepreneurialentity.
Furthermore,even if we take the definitions at face value, we are immediateiy
aware that the definitionsraisemore questionsthan they answer.If by definirion
a small businessowner establishesa businessto further personalgoals and an
entrepreneurestablishesa businessfor profit and growth, then what do we do
with the individual whose personalgoal is to establisha businessfor profit and
growth? (Are the goals of profit and growth to be consideredimpersonll goals?)
How do we distinguish personalgoals from goals of profit and growth? Are we
not, then, embroiled in another dilemma of distinguishing?When you define
small businessowners as having a businesswhich is their primary source of
income and will consumethe majority of their time, do you nor thereby imply
that entrepreneursstart organizations that wtll not be their primary source-of
income, and wlll not occupy the majority of their time and resources?(Are we to
assumethat the entrepreneursare off spendingthe majority of their time pursuing
personalgoals, which, by definition, cannot be related to their organizations?)Ii
small businessowners perceive the business as an extension of their personalities, intricately bound with family needsand desires, as opposedto entrepreneurs who do not perceivetheir firms in this w8y, then isn't this definition of
small businesslikely to include such family run organizationsas Marriott, Best,
and Nordstrom, leadersof their industriesin both profits and growth? To suggest
that -entrepreneurialstartupsare not intricately bound up wit[ the personaliiy of
the founders is to suggest that organiiarions such as Apple, Hewlett-Packard,
Lotus, and Microsoft are not entrepreneurial.
The last part of the Carland et al. entrepreneurialdefinition ties the state of
being 1n entrepreneurto innovative behavior and strategic managementpractices. Carland et al. use a Schumpeteriandefinition of innovative-behavior1p.

goods, (2) introduction of new methods of producrion, (3) opening of new
markets (4) opening of new sourcesof supply, and (5) industrial ieorginization.
Conelatingentrepreneurship

and seemsto take more of a behavioralviewpoint, leadsto the problem oi iOentifying which firms in an industry are the innovative ones. wouid the first entranr

How are we to determinethe degreeof Oifference betweenone product and anothersimilar product which constitutesinnovation? Do new methodsof manufacturing/markeiing/distributingthe product count
as innovative, and, again, what is the degree of difference-betweenthe truly
innovative and the not so innovative?Among the fifty or so personal.ornput.t

Operationalizingthese definitions-pinpoinring who is :rn entrepreneur-becomes more and more difficult as van de ven (1980) warned.

like the most effective way to proceedin attempting to reach a definitioi of who
ls an entrepreneur(although it is hoped that my own Table I has shown that such
a mega-tableis not the answer|. On setting up the table, however, it becomes
immediately clear, as Carland et al. admit, that the studieswhich investigated
thesecharacteristicsand anributed them to entrepreneurswere not all empiical,
and more importantly, as Carland et al. point out, the researchsampleswere by
no means homogeneous.As discussedearlier, the authorsof thesepast srudies

OF ORGANIZATIONS
Organization.creation(Vesper, 1982), I believe, separatesentrepreneurship
from other disciplines.Studiesof psychologicalcharacreristics
of enrrepreneurs,
sociologicalexplanationsof entrepreneurial
cultures,economicand demographic
explanationsof entrepreneuriallocations,etc., all such investigationsin thg entrepreneurshipfield actually begin with the creationof new organizations
. Entrepreneurship is the creation of new organizations.The purposeof this paper is not
to substituteone highly specific entrepreneurialdefinition for another. "Entrepreneurshipis the creationof new organizations" is not offered as a definition.
but rather it is an attempt to changea long held and renaciousviewpoint in rhe
entrePreneurshipfield. If we are to understandthe phenomenonof entrepreneurship in order to encourageits growth, then we need to focus on the processby
which new organizationsare created.This may seem like a simple refinement of
focus (i.e., look at what the entrepreneurdoes, not who the entrepreneuris), but
it is actually a rather thoroughgoing change in our orienration. From this perspective,other issuesin the field might be seenwith new'clarity.
An example of such an issue: if entrepreneurshipis behavioral, then it can be
seen that these behaviors cease once organization creation is over. One of the
problems in the enrepreneurship field is deciding when entrepreneurshipends
(Vesper, 1980). (Actually, the Carlandet al. attemptro distinguishentreprlneurs
from small businessowners might be approachedmore fruinrtty if looked at
from the behavioral perspectiveof entrepreneurshipending.) Th; organization
can live o_npast its creation stageto such possible stagesas growth, miturity, or
decline (Greiner, 1972;Steinmetz,1969).From the piocesslie*poinr, the individual who createsthe organization as the entrepreneurtakes on other roles at
each stage-innovator, manager,small businessowner, division vice-president,
et9: Eluepreneurs, like baseballplayers, are identified by a set of behaviors
which link thernto organizationcreation.Managers,small businessowners,etc.,
are also identified by their behaviors. As long as we adhere to the behavioral
approachand view entrepreneurshipas something one does and not who one is,
then we can more effectively avoid the Carland et al.-type definitional dilemmas.
But once we are tempted to view the entrepreneur,the manager,the small businessowner, etc., as statesof being, we becomeembroiledin trying to pin down
their inner qualities and intentions.This approachmay not compiete-lyresolve the
question of when entrepreneurshipends, but it makesus look ai the organization,
rather than the Person,for our answer. Entrepreneurshipends when the creation
stage of the organizationends.

IMPLICATIONS
FORRESEARCH
ON THEENTREPRENEUR
Reorientationtowarda behavioralapproachto entrepreneurship
beginsby
askingthe primaryquestion,"How do organizations
comeinto exisiencJ?"W;
shouldthink of entrepreneurs
in regardto the role theyplay in enablingorganizationsto comeinto existence
(Jenks,1950;Kilby, l97l; peterson,196l; Van de

<-----Page 16----->yen. 1980). The focus will be on researchquestionsthat ask (among other
to come into existence.rather
rhrngs)whar individualsdo to enableorganizations
than on the traits and characteristicsof theseindividuals.
Enrepreneurshipresearchshouldfollow the path of researchtaken in managenal behiviors (Minuberg,.l973).The issuesthat Mintzbergarticulatedregarding
managersare the issues which also confront entrepreneurship.Substitute the
rrordlnrepreneur for manager. and entrepreneurialfor mana-eerialin Mintzberg's statementof the purPoseof his study:
We must be able to answera number of specific questionsbefore we can
expect managerialtraining and managementscienceto have any real impact
on Practice:

What variations exist among managerialjobs? To what extent can basic
differences be attributed to the situation, the incumbent, the job, the organization. and the environment?
To what extent is managementa science?To what extent is the manager's
work programmed (that is, repetitive, systematicand predictable)?To what
"reextent is it programmable?To what extent can the managementscientist
program" managerialwork? (Mintzberg, 1973:3)
I believe that researchon entrepreneurialbehaviors must be based on field
*'ork similar to Mintzberg's study of managerialwork. Researchersmust observe
enrrepreneursin the process of creating organizations. This work must be descnbed in detail and the activities systematizedand classified. Knowledge of
enrepreneurialbehaviorsis dependenton field work.
The rinrlrs of this field work should also be able to answer additional quesrlons. What are the specific organization creation skills that an entrePreneur
needsto know? (Palmer, 197l) If we've given up the perspectivethat tells us that
:rn enrepreneur is born with theseskills and abilities, then we must ask how are
rhese skills acquired?Some researchsuggeststhat entrepreneurialskills are
"learn-as-you-go" (Collins & Moore, 1970;Gartner, 1984). Entrepreneurswho
have started one organization seem to be more successfuland more efficient in
the srartup of their second and third organizations(Vesper, 1980). If this is
usually true, then what expertise,what specialknowledgedo theseentrePreneurs
garn from doing their first stanup?One skill they might learn is how to identify
and evaluateproblems.A new organizationis confrontedby many problems,and
some problems are more important than others. It would seem that the more
successfulentrepreneursdevelop expertisein judging which problemsneed immediateattention(Hoad & Rosko, 1964;Lamont, 1972).
The processof team formationneedsto be studied(Timmons, 1979).How and

CONCLUSION
How do we know the dancerfrom the dance?When we view entrepreneurship
from a behavioral perspectivewe do not artifically separatedancer from dance,
we do not attempt to fashion a reassuringsimplicity. The behavioral approach
challengesus to develop researchquestions,methodologies'andtechniquesthat
will do justice to the complexity of entrepreneurship(Gartner, 1985). The creation of an organization is a very complicated and intricate process, influenced
by many factors and influencing us even as we look at it. The entrepreneuris not
a fixed stateof existence,rather entrepreneurshipis a role that individuals undertake to create organizations.
