Analyzing Sequential Categorical Data on Dyadic Interaction:
A Comment on Gottman

Recent theoretical developments emphasize that social interactions are dynamic
and reciprocal, and this has led to widespread use of time-series data on behavior
in two-person systems. In principle, such data allow one to separate the influences
of two actors on each other, Statistical methods currently being used, however,
are deficient in several respects. In this article, we show that a statistic proposed
by Sackett and later "proved" by Gottman is incorrect. We also show that the
failure to control for autodependence can produce misleading results. Finally,
we introduce new procedures that are based on both traditional and more recently
developed methods for the analysis of contingency tables. Using these procedures,
we show how to test for dependency, how to measure dependency, how to test
for differences in dependency across subgroups, and how to test for dominance
in reciprocal behavior sequences.

Recent theoretical developments have
shifted research attention from static, crosssectional snapshots of social relationships to
dynamic, reciprocal models of interaction
sequences. For example, early work on childhood socialization viewed parent-child relationships as static and unidirectional; parents were thought to influence but not be
influenced by their children. An emerging
life-span perspective on child rearing recognizes that parents affect, and are affected
by, their children in an evolving, reciprocal
relationship (Bell & Harper, 1977; Lerner
& Spanier, 1978). Similarly, marital relationships have been viewed primarily in
static terms that rely on concepts like relative power, role, and marital satisfaction.
John Gottman's pioneering work on Marital
Interaction (1980b) is the first systematic
attempt to measure and characterize patterns of interaction sequences in distressed
and nondistressed couples. Gottman developed dynamic concepts to characterize common marital patterns such as positive and

negative reciprocity and marital dominance.
This theoretical shift from a static to a
dynamic framework has been accompanied
by a shift in the kinds of data collected. In
particular, there has been increased reliance
on sequential observation data (see Burgess
& Huston, 1979; Clarke-Stewart, 1973;
Gottman, 1980b; Mishler & Waxier, 1966;
Patterson, 1980; Schenkein, 1978; Wright,
1967) and on sophisticated methods for coding these data to capture both verbal and
nonverbal behavior. Unfortunately, statistical expertise in analyzing these rich, carefully coded interaction sequences has not
kept pace with the development of the conceptual apparatus and coding schemes. To
analyze his data, Gottman made extensive
use of a statistic proposed by Sackett (1979)
and later derived rigorously by Gottman
(1979) himself. Unfortunately, both Gottman's proof and the original statistic are in
error. Even if the statistic were correct,
moreover, many of Gottman's applications
would still be problematic.
In this article we describe the problems
with Gottman's statistical methods, and we
propose alternative procedures based on recently developed methods for the analysis of
categorical data. These methods can be used
to estimate and test the degree of lagged
dependence of the behavior of one actor on

<-----Page 1----->394

PAUL D. ALLISON AND JEFFREY K. LIKER

the behavior of another. Tests are also proposed for determining whether one actor
dominates the other. Wherever possible, we
illustrate the methods with data reported by
Gottman (1980b), and we compare our results with his.
A Test For Lagged Dependence
A basic aim in the analysis of sequential
interaction data is to estimate and test for
lagged dependence in the behavior of the two
actors. Let us suppose that we observe the
behavior of a married couple at a sequence
of n points in time (t = I , . . . , «), and we
wish to test for the dependence of the husband's behavior at time t + k on the wife's
behavior at time t. We define the variables
//, and W, to indicate the husband's and the
wife's behavior, respectively, and, for the
moment, we consider only the case in which
both variables are dichotomous, taking on
values of 1 or 0 at each point in time. Due
to the lag of k time units, the data consist
of a set of pairs (W,, Hl+k) for t = 1,
. . . , « — k. Thus, the last k values of W
and the first k values of H are not used in
the analysis.
Gottman (1979, 1980a, 1980b) argued
that the hypothesis of no dependence corresponds to the statement that the conditional probability of the husband's behavior
given the wife's behavior is the same as the
unconditional probability, that is,
Pr[Hl+k= \\W,= \} = Pr(Hl+k = 1].

To test this hypothesis, Gottman used a statistic proposed by Sackett (1979). To discuss
this statistic, we need some additional notation. Let pH\wand pH be the observed proportions corresponding to the conditional
and unconditional probabilities in the null
hypothesis. That is, pmw is the proportion
of times that the husband s behavior is coded
1 given that the wife's behavior k units earlier is coded 1. Let pw be the proportion of
times that the wife's behavior is coded 1.
Sackett (1979) took the usual approach
of constructing a z statistic by dividing the
difference between the observed proportions
Pmw ~ PH by the estimated standard error
of that difference, under the assumption that
there is no autodependence for H, and W,

(i.e., that H, and W, do not depend on their
own values at previous points in time). The
statistic he obtained is
z, =

Pn\w ~ PH
(n - k)pw

which should have an asymptotically normal
distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one (a standard normal distribution).
Unfortunately, the denominator of this statistic is not the correct standard error of the
numerator. It would be correct only if pH
were the true probability and not merely an
observed proportion subject to sampling error. It can be shown that a correct statistic
is given by
z\ =

Pn\w~ PH
- Pw)
(n ~ k)pw

which does have, asymptotically, a standard
normal distribution. In more recent work,
Gottman (1980a) himself advocated the use
of Zi rather than zs.
It is apparent that this statistic is always
greater than Sackett's (1979) statistic, specifically,

The difference can be substantial. In one
analysis Gottman (1980b, p. 228) reported
pH = ,70, pmw = .76, and zs = 1.57, which
is not significant at the .05 level (all significance levels mentioned here assume a twotailed test). Because pw = .70, however, the
correct statistic is z\ = 2.87, which is significant at beyond the .01 level.
The correct statistic z, also happens to be
identically equal to two other statistics that
are much more familiar. One is the test of
a difference between two proportions estimated from two independent samples
(Blalock, 1979, pp. 232-234). Suppose we
divide the pairs (W,, Hl+!c) into two groups:
those in which W, = 1 and those in which
W, = 0. We let mi be the number of times
that W, = 1 and w0 be the number of times
that W, = 0. Within each group we calculate
the proportion of times that //,+t = 1. These

<-----Page 2----->SEQUENTIAL DATA ON DYADS

two proportions are denoted bypHn andpH\0.
The test statistic is then
Pun J_
m}
O
m

The equality of this statistic and the one
based on conditional and unconditional proportions is proved in the Appendix. Intuitively, the reason they are equal is that they
are testing exactly the same null hypothesis.
If the conditional probability is equal to the
unconditional probability, it necessarily follows that the two conditional probabilities
are equal to each other, that is,
Pr[Hl+k=

Conversely, if the two conditional probabilities are equal, each of them must equal the
unconditional probability.
A third statistic is obtained by viewing the
data as a 2 X 2 contingency table. For example, for Gottman's data described above,
it is possible to reconstruct approximately
the 2 X 2 table:

w,

A natural way to test for dependence in such
a table is to apply the usual Pearson's chisquare statistic after first calculating expected values under the hypothesis of independence. It is well known (e.g., Fienberg,
1980; Kendall & Stuart, 1961) that Pearson's chi-square test for a 2 X 2 table is identically equal to the square of the z test for
the difference between two proportions. For
these data X2 = 7.63 with a square root of
2.76 (the difference between this and the
previously calculated value of z, = 2.87 is
due to rounding error incurred by reconstructing the table from the given proportions). As we shall see, the advantage of the
contingency table approach is that it can be
easily generalized to more complicated situations.

395

A Measure of the Strength of
Lagged Dependence
We now have appropriate statistics for
testing the null hypothesis that there is no
relationship between the wife's behavior at
time t and the husband's behavior at time
t + k. Suppose that the null hypothesis is
false,1 that the husband's behavior does in
some way depend on the wife's past behavior.
One then needs some measure of the strength
of that dependence in order to make comparisons with other kinds of couples, other
experimental treatments, and so forth. In
essence, what is needed is a measure of association for a 2 X 2 table. Bishop, Fienberg,
& Holland (1975) reviewed the extensive
literature on this topic and concluded that
a key distinction is between those measures
that are sensitive to the marginal totals and
those that are not. An example of a measure
that is sensitive to the marginal totals is the
difference between the conditional and unconditional probabilities
Pr[Hl+k = 1\W, = I] - Pr[H,+k = 1],

which was proposed by Gottman (1980b, p.
31) to measure reduction in uncertainty.
Clearly, if the marginal probability
Pr[H,+k = 1] is very high or very low, the
range of this difference is greatly restricted.
As a consequence, comparisons such as those
between distressed couples with moderate
rates of negative behavior and nondistressed
couples with relatively low rates of negative
behavior may be questionable. The same
criticism applies to the difference between
the two conditional proportions:
= \\W,=

-Pr[Ht+k=
which is commonly used under the name
"percentage difference" (Davis, 1971).
A measure that is invariant to the marginal totals can be obtained by first taking
the logit transformation (Berkson, 1944;
Fienberg, 1980) of each of the two conditional probabilities and then taking the difference. The logit transformation of a probability p is just logit(p) = loge [p/(\ ~ p ) ] .
Thus, the measure we shall use here is defined to be

<-----Page 3----->396

PAUL D, ALLISON AND JEFFREY K. LIKER

= \Qgii[Pr(Hl+k =
- \ogit[Pr(Hl+/t =

It has a range of from minus infinity to plus
infinity and is zero when the two variables
are independent.
The measure /? is better known in the statistical literature as the logarithm of the
cross-product ratio (or odds ratio). The reason is that if the expected frequencies in a
2 X 2 table are given by
F3

F4>

then jS = loge (F[F^/(F2F3). Moreover, if
fi are the observed frequencies in the 2 X 2
table, the maximum likelihood estimator of
/? is just loge (/i/4)/(/2/3). An alternative
way of expressing the definition of /9 is
log(l[Pr(Hl+k = l\W,)] = a +

which may be thought of as a "logit-linear"
model. As we shall see, this form is convenient for generalizing to additional variables.1
Comparing Dependency Levels
Across Groups
We turn now to the problem of comparing
the degree of dependency across two or more
groups. Consider the contingency table in
Table 1, which is reconstructed (approximately) from data in Gottman's (1980b)
Table 12.5. The two groups are distressed
and nondistressed couples, and the aim is to
determine whether the dependence of the
wife's behavior on the husband's behavior
is stronger for one group than for the other.
Gottman's approach is to compute Sackett's
z statistic within each group and then compare the statistics across groups. Using the
correct z statistic, we get a highly significant
3.26 for distressed couples and a nonsignificant .51 for nondistressed couples, suggesting that dependency is much stronger for the
former group.
There are two possible flaws in this procedure. One is that test statistics are highly
sensitive to sample size. As a result, differ-

ences in sample size could produce major
differences in the test statistics for different
groups even when the degree of dependence
is identical. A second problem is that Gottman has no statistical test for the difference
between the test statistics. It is well known
that one statistic can be highly significant
and another nonsignificant without there
being a significant difference between
the two.
These difficulties can be avoided by testing the null hypothesis that our measure of
association /3 is the same in each group.
When there are only two groups, the easiest
procedure is to estimate /3 in each group,
take the difference between these estimates,
and divide by the standard error of the difference. This yields a z statistic given by
Fienberg (1980, p. 37):

2•^ f
1
Those who are unfamiliar with /3 may find its values
somewhat difficult to interpret, especially because it
ranges from minus infinity to plus infinity. An intuitive
interpretation is facilitated by focusing on exp (f!),
which is the odds ratio. In this context, the odds ratio
is interpreted as the odds that Hl+k = 1, given W, = 1,
divided by the odds that H,+t = 1, given W, = 0. Thus,
if exp (/S) = 2, we can say that the odds that H:+k =
1 are doubled by W, shifting from 0 to 1. Alternatively,
for those who prefer a measure that varies between
-1 and 1, a simple transformation of/3 produces Yule's
2, a familiar measure of association first proposed in
1900. The transformation is

e«-\

6 = e"+ 1

<-----Page 4----->SEQUENTIAL DATA ON DYADS

The /, are simply the eight observed cell frequencies in the two 2 X 2 tables. As _explained in the previous section, each /3 is
computed by taking the logarithm of the

.651

observed cross-product ratio in each table.
Under the null hypothesis, this statistic has
an asymptotic standard normal distribution.
For these data, we have

-.141

1
1
1
1
A/1 ,
V ? 6 ' 79 ' 100 ' 200 ' 80 ' 43
which is not significant at the .05 level. Thus,
the evidence is insufficient to conclude that
there is a difference between the two groups.
An alternative approach is especially useful when there are more than two groups to
be compared. Instead of viewing the data as
two two-way tables, we can treat them as a
single three-way table with the additional
variable AT, which equals 1 for distressed and
0 for nondistressed couples. The null hypothesis can then be expressed as a logitlinear model:
\Ogit[Pr(Wl+l = \\H,, X)] = a + 0H, + yX.
The key feature of this equation is that there
is no interaction term for X and H,, expressing the fact that /3 is the same for both
groups. This model may be fit to the data
by the method of maximum likelihood using
programs such as GLIM (Baker & Nelder,
1978). If a logit program is unavailable, one
can make use of the fact that all logit models
for contingency tables are special cases of
log-linear models for which estimation programs are widely available (e.g., ECTA, MULTIQUAL, FREQ). For this logit model, the
equivalent log-linear model is one that specifies no three-way interaction.
Once the model is fit, the hypothesis is
tested by comparing observed cell frequencies to predicted frequencies using either
Pearson's chi-square statistic or the likelihood-ratio chi-square statistic. For the data
in Table 1, Pearson's chi-square is 2.235, and
the likelihood-ratio chi-square is 2.230, both
with one degree of freedom. These values
may be compared with the z test simply by
taking the square root, which yields 1.495
and 1.493, respectively. Although all three
tests give virtually identical results in this
case, they are not identically equal. For one

397

H

^ ~H 3 9

thing, the z test cannot be computed when
any of the cell frequencies is zero, but this
does not necessarily prevent the logit-linear
model from being fit.
To compare more than two groups, the
logit-linear model is modified to include a
dummy variable for each of the groups less
one. Thus, if there are four groups, the
dummy variables could be X\ = 1 for Group
1 and zero otherwise, X2 = 1 for Group 2
and zero otherwise, and X3 = 1 for Group
3 and zero otherwise. The model is then fit
by the method of maximum likelihood and
the null hypothesis tested with either of the
two chi-square statistics. The number of degrees of freedom for these tests will be one
less than the number of groups. Again the
logit-linear model is equivalent to a log-linear model with no three-way interaction.
This same approach offers the possibility
of estimating ft, the effect of the husband's
behavior on the wife's behavior, while statistically controlling for other variables. Indeed, the /3 in the logit-linear equation above
is a partial /3 controlling for group membership. If one has sequential data on many
different couples differing on such characteristics as race, religious preference, or social class, one could construct a multiway
contingency table and fit logit-linear models
(or the equivalent log-linear models), which
include additional dummy variables to represent the other characteristics.
Using a somewhat different fitting procedure (Hanushek & Jackson, 1977; Nerlove & Press, 1973), one can even include
control variables such as age, income, or
years of schooling, which are measured as
continua. The resulting analysis is very much
like the analysis of covariance. Finally, one
can adjust for all differences between couples

<-----Page 5----->398

PAUL D. ALLISON AND JEFFREY K. LIKER

by pooling all the data for all couples but
including a dummy variable for each couple
(less one), a procedure that Gottman (1980b)
recommended in a somewhat different context.
The Problem of Autodependence
All of the tests discussed so far assume
that an actor's behavior at any time does not
depend on the same actor's behavior at any
previous time (i.e., there is no autodependence). This assumption makes it possible to
treat each pair of observations (H,, W,+k) as
though it were independent of all other pairs
from the same couple. Although this greatly
simplifies the construction of statistical tests,
it is obviously not very realistic. Moreover,
the violation of this assumption can produce
very misleading results.
Consider, for example, the data in Table
2, which gives frequencies for the three-way
cross-classification of H,, W,, and W,+i.2
Suppose we wish to test for the dependence
of W,+i on H,. Following the procedures
given earlier, we can test for dependence by
first collapsing the table over W, to get the
H, X Wl+i table and then computing a chisquare test for independence. The Pearson
chi-square for this collapsed table is a highly
significant 27.64 with one degree of freedom,
and the estimated value of /3 is .404. This
test fails to take account of the fact that both
H, and WM are strongly associated with W,,
which may be seen by looking at the W, X
WM table and the W, X H, table. The former
collapsed table has an enormous chi-square
of 1,184.7, whereas the latter has a chisquare of 62.35 (both on one degree of freedom). These interrelationships suggest that
the apparent dependence of WIJr\ on H, may

be a consequence of the fact that both of
these variables depend on W,. To rule out
this possibility, we can estimate and test the
effect of H, on Wl+1 controlling for W,.
There are several equivalent ways to do
this, but all require analysis of the full threeway table. The null hypothesis can be expressed as
Pr[Wl+l = \\W,, H,] = Pr[W,+ l = 1 W,]

for all values of W, and H,. In essence, this
says that W,+[ may depend on W, but not
on H,. The easiest way to test this hypothesis
is to treat Table 2 as two 2 X 2 tables, one
table for each value of W,. The test is performed by computing a chi-square test for
independence in each of these subtables and
then summing the two values. For these
data, the resulting Pearson chi-square is 5.91
with two degrees of freedom — not quite significant at the .05 level. Thus, when the autodependence is partialed out, the cross-dependence is greatly attenuated. 3
Again, an alternative approach is to fit a
logit-linear model by maximum likelihood
methods. In this case, the null hypothesis is
expressed by the model
\o&i[Pr(Wt+l = \\Wn H,}} .= a +
If Pearson's chi-square is used to evaluate
the fit of this model, the result will be iden2
These data are taken from Coleman (1964, p. 168).
For consistency with the rest of the article, the variables
have been labeled H, and Wn but actually these refer
to variables measuring "membership in the leading
crowd" and "attitude toward membership in the leading
crowd" at two different times.
3
This test has been criticized for lack of power (Cochran, 1954). A more powerful test having a single degree
of freedom was proposed by Mantel and Haenszel
(1959) and is described by Bishop et al. (1975). An
alternative test with one degree of freedom is described
in Footnote 4. Both of these tests assume that H, and
W, do not interact in their effects on W,+, (i.e., the effect
of H, on WHt is the same at both levels of W,). Before
applying either of these tests, one should test for interaction using the methods described above for comparing
dependency levels across groups (here the two groups
correspond to W, = 1 and W, = 0). The z2 statistic for
these data is 2.39, suggesting that there is an interaction,
and, hence, the single degree of freedom tests are inappropriate.

<-----Page 6----->SEQUENTIAL DATA ON DYADS

tical to the test described above.4 The advantage of this approach is that it can handle
much more complicated forms of autodependence. For example, we could allow for
autodependence up to lag 3 by fitting the
model
= l\HH Wn W,.lt W,-2}}
to the five-way table for Wl+l, W,, W,^, W,-2,
and H,. The hypothesis that W,+\ does not
depend on H, is then equivalent to the null
hypothesis that jS, = 0. Gottman (1980a)
suggested even more complicated models for
interval-level data; completely analogous
models for categorical data can be estimated
by the methods outlined here. For futher
details of the fitting and testing procedure,
see Goodman (1970), Bishop et al. (1975),
Fienberg (1980), or Haberman (1978).5
Testing for Dominance
Gottman (I980b) gave the following definition of dominance: "In a dyad, if B's future behavior is more predictable from A's
past behavior than conversely, then A is said
to be dominant" (p. 71). To test for dominance, Gottman used a procedure that was
based on spectral analysis, which unfortunately did not control for autodependence.
He has, however, since proposed a method
suitable for interval-level data that does control for autocorrelation (Gottman & Ringland, 1981). We now describe an analogous
method for categorical data.
A naive approach would be to compute a
z test for the dependence of Hl+k on W, and
another z test for the dependence of W,+k on
H,. If one test statistic is substantially larger
than the other, it could be taken as evidence
for dominance. As we have seen earlier, however, the fact that two test statistics differ
does not imply that the strength of the dependence is significantly stronger in one direction than in the other. What is needed is
a single statistical test for the difference between the measures of association for each
relationship. Of course, it is also necessary
to introduce appropriate controls for the
lagged dependence of each spouse's behavior
on his or her own prior behavior. As we shall
see, proper controls can actually reverse the
direction of dominance.

Suppose that for a sample of 100 couples
we observe behavior at two times. Thus, we
observe H{, H2, Wlt and W2. As shown in
Table 3, the data can be displayed as a fourway contingency table. These data were constructed for illustrative purposes, but there
is no reason why similar data could not arise
in real life.
Ignoring any autodependence, we first test
for cross-dependence of H2 on W\ and of W2
on H{. To do this, we collapse the four-way
table into two two-way tables and then compute Pearson's chi-square test for independence in each table. For H2 on W\ the chisquare is 270.4; for W2 on HI the chi-square
is 350.5, suggesting that the husband is dominant. This is corroborated by the fact that
|3 = 2.305 for H2 on W\ as compared with
|3 = 2.723 for W2 on //,. The difference between these statistics may be tested using
the same test we employed to compare distressed and nondistressed couples:6
4
A more powerful test is obtained by first fitting this
model and then fitting the model

The test statistic is then the difference between the likelihood-ratio chi-squares for these two models, with a
single degree of freedom. As explained in Footnote 3,
this test assumes that there is no interaction between
H, and W, in their effects on W,+1.
5
The full justification of these methods requires that
the sequential data be generated by a stationary Markov
chain. The underlying statistical theory is discussed by
Anderson and Goodman (1957) or in greater detail by
Billingsley (1961).
6
In this context, z2 is not strictly appropriate because
it presumes that the two estimates of fl are uncorrelated.
This is unlikely to be the case because both are estimated
from the same sample. If the correlation is positive
(which is the most plausible case), z2 will be lower than
the "true" z statistic. Hence, it may be regarded as a
conservative test.

Because this is not quite significant at the
.05 level, the evidence is only marginal for
husband dominance.
This analysis ignores the fact that there
is substantial autodependence for the wife's
behavior and even stronger autodependence
for the husband's behavior. To partial out
this autodependence, we apply the techniques described in the preceding section.
We first analyze the three-way table U\ X
W\ X HI to estimate the logit-linear model:

This can be interpreted as a structural model
for the dependence of the husband's behavior
on the wife's and on the husband's own previous behavior. Next, we estimate the corresponding table for the HiXWtX W2 table:
logit[Pr(W 2 = l\Hlt W,)}

The appropriate comparison is between /8,
and /3f, which are the two measures of crossdependence, controlling for autodependence.
These equations were estimated using the
program GLIM (Baker & Nelder, 1978), and
the estimates are displayed as a path diagram (Goodman, 1973) in Figure 1. With
the introduction of controls the direction of
dominance is reversed, with estimates for /3
of 2.265 for wives on husbands and 1.443 for
husbands on wives. But is this difference significant? Gillespie (Note 1) presents one
method of testing for the significance of the
difference, but a simple method is available
if the computer program provides standard
errors for each of the estimated parameters.7
For this example, the estimated standard
error of j3{ is s = .183. For /3f we have s* =
.240. The test statistic is
]/s2

= 1.937.

which is significant at beyond the .01 level.
We conclude that wives are dominant over
husbands for these data.
Polytomous Data
So far we have assumed that sequential
behavior is coded as a dichotomy. There will
often, however, be more than two categories,
and Gottman (1980b) typically dealt with
three: positive (1), neutral (0), and negative
(-1). His general strategy was to do two
separate analyses, one focusing on "positive
reciprocity" Pr[ W,+k = 1 \H, = 1 ] and the
other focusing on "negative reciprocity"
Pr[W,+k = -\\H, = -1]. Of course, these
two analyses are not independent, and if the
neutral category is small they will be almost
mirror images.
We believe that a better strategy is to do
a simultaneous analysis of all three categories after which one can test more refined
hypotheses. This is easily accomplished,
often by quite conventional methods for analyzing contingency tables. Suppose, for example, that both the husband's and the
wife's behavior is coded by the three-category scheme just mentioned, and the aim is
to test for dependence of the husband's behavior at time t + k on the wife's behavior
at time t. If we ignore autodependence, the
null hypothesis may be expressed as
Pr[Hl+k = i\W, = J] = Pr[ffl+k

= i]

for i = -1, 0, 1 and for j = -1, 0, 1. This
hypothesis can be tested by forming the 3 X
3 contingency table and applying the standard chi-square test for independence. To
determine whether the degree of dependence
differs across different groups (e.g., distressed and nondistressed couples), the best
approach is to fit the appropriate log-linear
model to the three-way contingency table
and then test the goodness of fit. The log-

Both of these methods suffer from the difficulty discussed in Footnote 6: They ignore the fact that ft and
/3* are likely to be positively correlated. As a consequence, the test statistics will be biased downward.

linear model should exclude the three-way
interaction term, and, as usual, the fit may
be evaluated using either Pearson's chisquare or the likelihood-ratio chi-square.
These tests do not, however, tell anything
about the direction and form of the dependency of Hl+k on W,. For that, it is useful
to convert the log-linear model for the contingency table into its equivalent logit-linear
form. There are several ways to "parameterize" the polytomous logit-linear model,
but for the three-category case we favor the
following expression. Let W(+) = 1 if W, =
1 and zero otherwise, and let W(-) = -1 if
W, = — 1 and zero otherwise. The model then
consists of two equations:

log.

loge

Pr[Hl+k=
Pr[Hl+k=Q\W,]}

The first equation describes the effects of W
on whether H is positive or neutral, and the
second equation describes the effects of W
on whether H is neutral or negative. These
effects are represented by four /? coefficients.
Each of these coefficients corresponds to the
logarithm of the odds ratio in one of the 2 X
2 tables formed by deleting one extreme row
and one extreme column from the 3 X 3
table.
Within this framework, one can test hypotheses of the following sort. With respect
to the wife's behavior, one might hypothesize
that the effect of going from negative to neutral is the same as going from neutral to
positive. This hypothesis is equivalent to assuming that j8n = fin in the first equation
and &i = 1822 in the second. Similarly, with
respect to the husband's behavior, one might
hypothesize that the difference between negative and neutral is the same as the difference between neutral and positive. This
amounts to hypothesizing that j8n = j821 and
1812 = $22- If both hypotheses are true, one
has the uniform association model of Duncan (1979) for ordered categorical data.
Haberman (1979) described methods for
testing these hypotheses. Just as in the dichotomous case, the models for polytomous
variables can be easily extended to allow for
more complicated lag structures and for additional control variables. Finally, if the sequential behavior is coded on a continuous
or nearly continuous scale, one can use standard procedures for the analysis of multivariate time-series data that have been developed by econometricians (see, e.g.,
Maddala, 1977) and that have been recently
advocated by Gottman and Ringland (1981).
Conclusion
The statistical procedures described here
can be used to test the kinds of propositions
advanced by Gottman (1980b) as well as
many other common propositions in the
study of social interaction. They can be applied to data on a small number of couples
followed over many time points or many couples followed through as few as two time
points. The advantages of these procedures
over those used by Gottman are essentially
threefold: (a) They explicitly take into account the categorical nature of the data; (b)

<-----Page 9----->402

they allow for multivariate as opposed to
merely bivariate analysis; and (c) they conform to conventional practices for statistical
inference.
The implications for Gottman's (1980b)
substantive conclusions are unclear. In a few
instances where Gottman presented sufficient data for reanalysis, we were able to
show that the use of more appropriate methods could lead to different conclusions. In
most cases, however, reanalysis was impossible, so we have no way of knowing how
serious the biases are. On the one hand, the
use of Sackett's (1979) incorrect statistic
would tend to result in acceptance of the null
hypothesis when, in fact, it could be rejected.
On the other hand, the failure to test explicitly for the significance of differences
between groups is likely to result in concluding that a difference exists when there
is actually insufficient evidence for a statistically reliable difference.
Given the importance of the hypotheses
and the apparent high quality of the data,
we hope that further analyses will be undertaken to answer these questions. Without
appropriate statistical procedures, even the
most elaborately coded data and carefully
controlled collection procedures will not further our understanding of social interaction.
