Abstract
Purpose – Despite a growing body of literature in the field, there is still considerable uncertainty as
to whether entrepreneurs are born or made, which has led to an ongoing debate in the
entrepreneurship academy about whether we can actually teach individuals to be entrepreneurs. With
this in mind, this two-part paper aims to address the question of whether or not entrepreneurship can
be taught.
Design/methodology/approach – In part I the importance of entrepreneurship in a modern,
constantly changing environment is outlined, and the various ways in which entrepreneurship
programmes can be categorised are considered. Attention is given to the various difficulties
associated with the design of programmes, as well as their objectives, content and delivery methods.
Part II of the paper focuses on the difficulties associated with programme evaluation and the various
approaches adopted to determining and measuring effectiveness. This leads to a discussion on
whether or not entrepreneurship can be successfully taught.
Findings – Despite the growth in entrepreneurship education and training programmes, the paper
reports that little uniformity can be found. Attention is drawn to the art and the science of
entrepreneurship, with the consensus that at least some aspects of entrepreneurship can successfully
be taught.
Originality/value – The authors highlight the need for evaluating programmes and for educators
and trainers to have a fuller understanding of what they wish to achieve from their programme from
the outset in order to ensure a more accurate assessment of the outcomes.

Introduction
The literature abounds with theories and discussions relating to the issue of who or
what is an entrepreneur, leading to the question of whether entrepreneurs are born or
made. This in turn often leads commentators to ask whether or not entrepreneurship
can be taught, and in this respect, there is still considerable uncertainty. For instance,
Fiet (2000a, p. 1) has noted that: “there is an ongoing debate in the entrepreneurship
academy about whether we can actually teach students to be entrepreneurs”. He further

<-----Page 1----->observes that the resolution of this debate is inextricably linked to our theoretical
assumptions about the field, because these will determine how and what is taught.
This is problematic, however, for the field, as it is currently constituted, does not have
an overarching theory.
According to Brazeal and Herbert (1999), the study of entrepreneurship is still in its
infancy and, in consequence, those working in the field continue to be engaged in
conceptual and methodological debates. In particular, there are two areas of concern
regarding research conducted in the field. On the one hand, research has tended to run
ahead of theoretical developments, and on the other, there has been a bias towards
research that has been conducted in an ad hoc way without theoretical underpinnings
being developed. It is in this context that Low (2001) has described entrepreneurship as
being in its adolescence, and while much research activity has occurred over the past
decade, only a modest level of academic legitimacy has been achieved. The
fundamental problems, which the field has to address, stem from the number of issues
to be explored, as well as the diverse range of disciplines from which these issues
might be examined. The result of this is that each discipline views entrepreneurship
from its own perspective without taking cognisance of approaches in other disciplines.
As Herron et al. (1991) have observed, “many ‘uni’ – rather than one or more ‘multi’ –
disciplinary views of our field currently exist”. Indeed, Ucbasaran and Westhead (2001,
p. 58) have noted that there is “growing concern that entrepreneurship as a discipline is
fragmented among specialists who make little use of each other’s work”. Thus, while a
large body of knowledge has been generated, some commentators are concerned that
this has not necessarily been cumulative.
In addition to the above, defining the very essence of entrepreneurship is part of a
longstanding conceptual debate within the field. Definitions are particularly important
in entrepreneurship because many of the terms associated with the discipline, such as
entrepreneur, enterprise and small business, are often used interchangeably. For
example, an entrepreneur has been defined as: “the owner or manager of a business
enterprise who, by risk and initiative, attempts to make profits” (Collins english
dictionary); someone who “carries out new combinations” (Schumpeter, 1934), and
someone who has the “ability to see and evaluate business opportunities; gather the
necessary resources to take advantage of them, and initiate appropriate action to
ensure success” (Meredith et al., 1982 as cited in Tiernan et al., 1996, p. 280). An
enterprise is typically considered to be the economic entity that is created by the
entrepreneur, which may develop into a small or large business in due course. In this
regard, the literature notes the difference between an entrepreneur and a business
owner (Schumpeter, 1934; Carland et al., 1984). With regard to the term
entrepreneurship itself, most commentators have focused on process and context.
For example, Low and McMillan (1988) conceptualise entrepreneurship as the creation
of new enterprise, and Bygrave (1989) refers to it as a “process of becoming, rather than
a state of being” (p. 21). Bruyat and Julien (2000) concur, observing that, while
entrepreneurship is to do with a process of change, emergence and the creation of new
value, it is also a process of change and creation for the entrepreneur. Thus,
entrepreneurship is the process of creating something different – “a new economic
entity centred on a novel product or service or, at the very least, one which differs
significantly from products or services offered elsewhere in the market” (Curran and
Stanworth, 1989, p. 12).

Within the field of entrepreneurship, it is also appropriate to consider the link
between research and teaching, as there would appear to be a correlation between the
theoretical rigour of research conducted and the theoretical rigour of courses designed.
If theoretically rigorous research is not conducted, then the content of entrepreneurship
courses may suffer. In particular, “we weaken our teaching effectiveness when we try
to teach the answers to questions that have not been addressed in the literature from a
theoretical stream of research” (Fiet, 2000a, p. 4). In addition, there is a danger that
unresolved debates concerning the definition of both entrepreneur and
entrepreneurship can lead to confusion when assessing the state of entrepreneurship
education as it currently exists.
This two-part paper focuses on entrepreneurship education and training, and its
objective is to consider the question of whether or not entrepreneurship can be taught.
In this regard, part I of the paper, presented in this issue, proceeds as follows: the first
section provides the context for the discussion by outlining the importance of
entrepreneurship education and training in a modern, changing environment. This is
followed in Section 2 with a discussion on the various ways in which entrepreneurship
programmes are categorised. Attention is also given to the various difficulties
associated with programme design and delivery. The third section considers the
objectives and content of entrepreneurship programmes, with the final section
considering the different approaches to teaching entrepreneurship.
Part II of the paper, which is presented in the next issue, deals with the topic of
determining and measuring programme effectiveness, and this leads to a discussion as
to whether or not entrepreneurship can really be taught. The paper concludes by
highlighting the need for entrepreneurship educators and trainers to have a fuller
understanding of what they wish to achieve from their programme from the outset, in
order to ensure a more accurate assessment of the outcomes.
The importance of entrepreneurship education and training
The subject of entrepreneurship receiving increased attention and sustained interest in
the field would appear to be more than just a fad. Indeed, as Venkatraman (1996), cited
by Fiet (2000b, p. 102) has commented, this interest accurately reflects an “emerging
economic environment created by the confluence of changes in the corporate world,
new technology and emerging world markets”. Entrepreneurship can prove to be
beneficial in the light of such changes, as Gibb and Cotton (1998) show in Figure 1.
At the global level, the reduction of trade barriers and the reality of the Euro
currency, together with the advancements in telecommunications, technology and
transportation, all combine to provide more opportunities, as well as more uncertainty
in the world. At the societal level, privatisation, deregulation, new forms of governance,
mounting environmental concerns and the growing recognition of the rights of
minority groups are all presenting society with greater complexity and uncertainty.
At the organisational level, decentralisation, downsizing, re-engineering, strategic
alliances, mergers and the growing demand for flexibility in the workforce, all
contribute to an uncertain climate. Finally, at the individual level, the individual is now
faced with a wider variety of employment options, the probability of ending up with a
portfolio of jobs, more responsibility at work and more stress. In addition, on a
personal level, today’s individual may be a single parent with more responsibility for
managing credit and securing finances for their future (Gibb and Cotton, 1998, pp. 8-9).

Why it is important to get
it right – education and
the Changing World

Given the above, it is apparent that, at all levels, there will be a greater need for people
to have entrepreneurial skills and abilities to enable them to deal with life’s current
challenges and an uncertain future. Furthermore, whatever their career choice or
personal situation, individuals, will be able to benefit from learning an innovative
approach to problem solving; adapting more readily to change; becoming more
self-reliant and developing their creativity through the study of entrepreneurship.
There is no doubt that in any economic climate such learning could have far reaching
benefits for society. It could be argued, therefore, that the need for entrepreneurship
education and training has never been greater.
Categorising entrepreneurship education and training
The idea that the learning needs of entrepreneurs will vary at different stages of
development has been acknowledged for some time. For example, one of the categories
adopted by Gorman et al. (1997) when conducting their survey of entrepreneurship
education literature was that of the target market of each course or programme. Indeed,
their “underlying assumption for using audience segmentation was that educational
objectives, subject matter and pedagogical approach might be expected to vary
depending on the nature of the target audience” (Gorman et al., 1997, p. 56). Others,
including McMullan and Long (1987), Monroy (1995), O’Gorman and Cunningham
(1997), Bridge et al. (1998) and van der Sijde et al. (1997), have more specifically
identified that the training needs of an individual will vary according to a particular
stage of development such as awareness, pre startup, startup, growth and maturity.
Drawing attention to the fact that the stage of development of an individual, or his/her
business, can have an impact upon the nature of entrepreneurial education that might
be received, provides an opportunity for educators and trainers to improve the
entrepreneurial learning process as much as possible. Indeed, Gorman et al. (1997, p.
65) call for a “more in-depth assessment of the matching process between what are
perceived to be entrepreneurial characteristics and the attempt of educational
institutions to enhance them”.
Jamieson (1984) has suggested a three-category framework by which to organize
entrepreneurship education. He distinguishes between education about enterprise,
education for enterprise and education in enterprise, and in so doing recognises the
roles different types of education have to play. The first category, education about

<-----Page 4----->ET
47,2

102

enterprise, deals mostly with awareness creation, and has the specific objective of
educating students on the various aspects of setting up and running a business mostly
from a theoretical perspective. Indeed, enterprise modules within business and other
courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level which seek “to foster skills, attitudes
and values appropriate to starting, owning, managing or working in a successful
business enterprise” would be included in this category (Jamieson, 1984, p. 9).
The second category, education for enterprise, deals more with the preparation of
aspiring entrepreneurs for a career in self-employment with the specific objective of
encouraging participants to set-up and run their own business. Participants are taught
the practical skills required for small business set-up and management, and the courses
are often geared towards the preparation of a business plan. Business startup schemes
and start your own business programmes, would be examples of this type of
entrepreneurship training. Jamieson (1984) sees this as the narrowest definition as it
refers to educating people to startup their own small business, with an emphasis on
startup and small.
The third category, education in enterprise, deals mainly with management training
for established entrepreneurs and focuses on ensuring the growth and future
development of the business. Management development and growth training
programmes, as well as specific product development and marketing courses, might
fit into this category. In addition, such training provides skills, knowledge and
attitudes for people to go out and create their own futures and solve their own
problems (Jamieson, 1984, p. 19). Although this definition refers strongly to the world
of business, it is by no means restricted to it. Hence, education in enterprise can refer to
courses aimed at helping individuals or groups to adopt an enterprising approach,
irrespective of the type of organisation for which they work.
Garavan and O’Cinnéide (1994) adopt a broader view to categorizing
entrepreneurship education and training, differentiating between, on the one hand,
entrepreneurship education, and on the other, education and training for small
business owners. In the former category they describe entrepreneurial education which
is aimed at providing an opportunity to learn about the conditions favouring new
business creation, as well as the various theories concerning the type of characteristics
required for successful entrepreneurship. However, the authors place more emphasis
on education and training for small business owners and have classified the type of
training that these individuals might receive into three categories, which relate
specifically to the stage of development. The first of these is termed small business
awareness education and normally appears in secondary school syllabi. As with
Jamieson (1984) education about enterprise, the aim of this type of training is to
increase the number of people who are sufficiently knowledgeable about small
business to consider it, at some stage in the future, as a career option. The second
category describes education and training for small business ownership. The aim of
such provision is to provide practical help to those seeking to make the transition from
traditional employment to self-employment. As such, this type of training would
include instruction on raising finance, marketing problems and legal issues. The third
type of education and training identified is that of continuing small business education.
This is a more specialist type of education designed to enable people to enhance and
update their skills.

<-----Page 5----->Even though commentators acknowledge that the learning needs of an entrepreneur
vary at different stages of development, there is actually very little uniformity in the
programmes and courses offered at each stage. For instance, Gorman et al. (1997) in
their survey of the entrepreneurship education literature, which comprised mainly
post-secondary courses, identified diversity within teaching strategies, learning styles
and curricula design. While one would expect a degree of diversity in courses and
programmes developed, taking into consideration the diversity of backgrounds from
which teachers and facilitators might be drawn, Fiet (2000a) suggests that such
differentiation is actually indicative of the lack of theoretical rigour within the field of
entrepreneurship. This he feels has resulted in little consensus on fundamental
questions, which in turn is reflected in differing views on developing entrepreneurship
courses. Indeed, the content of syllabi of courses developed by entrepreneurship
scholars differs to such an extent that it is difficult to determine if they even have a
common purpose.
Objectives and content of entrepreneurship programmes
The above, however, has resulted in problems when attempting to classify
entrepreneurship education and training activities, due to the level of differentiation
and disaggregation of concepts and objectives (Gibb, 1993a; Vento, 1998). Hills (1988),
for example, in his survey of 15 leading entrepreneurship educators in the USA,
identified that there were two important objectives of entrepreneurship education
programmes. These were to increase the awareness and understanding of the process
involved in initiating and managing a new business, as well as to increase students’
awareness of small business ownership as a serious career option. Cox (1996) believes
that a primary objective of training interventions targeted at the awareness stage of
entrepreneurial development is the promotion of self-efficacy with regard to new
venture creation. Instruction at this stage, therefore, should seek to provide mastery
experiences or opportunities to act entrepreneurially, as well as exposure to several
real-life entrepreneurs. An advocator that the objectives of entrepreneurship should
differ with the particular stage at which the intervention is targeted, he suggests that
the main focus of training intervention at the startup stage should be to heighten
students’ resolve to become entrepreneurs. Accordingly instructional emphasis should
be on the development of a viable business plan which should be supported by
individualised assistance in the form of financing, networking, or counselling.
According to Garavan and O’Cinnéide (1994), based on their European-wide
evaluation of six enterprise programmes across five European countries, the most
commonly cited aims of entrepreneurship programmes include: to identify and
stimulate entrepreneurial drive, talent and skills; to undo the risk-averse bias of many
analytical techniques; to develop empathy and support for all unique aspects of
entrepreneurship, and to devise attitudes towards change. In terms of content, the
focus of the programmes reviewed by them varied from idea generation and business
planning to the identification of products, market research and business formation.
They concluded that entrepreneurship itself is not usually what is taught; rather, it is
small business management skills that are provided.
Instead of considering the objectives of entrepreneurship programmes from the
viewpoint of facilitators and teachers, Hisrich and Peters (1998) examined these from
the participants’ perspective. While awareness raising was not listed, those features

that participants believed should be included in potential courses were more practically
oriented and geared at improving one’s chances of success. Some of the key learning
aims of entrepreneurship students included developing an understanding of the
strengths and weaknesses of different types of enterprises, as well as the opportunity
to assess one’s own entrepreneurial skills. In addition, knowing the essentials of
marketing, finance, operations planning, organisation planning and venture launch
planning, together with obtaining resources, were also considered essential.
Consideration of the views of participants was a feature of the development of a
small business training programme by Le Roux and Nieuwenhuizen (1996). To
ascertain those elements deemed to be most important by prospective students, they
surveyed 220 aspiring and developing entrepreneurs. They discovered that the main
areas of interest were similar to those cited by Hisrich and Peters (1998) and included
marketing, entrepreneurship, business planning, management and financial
management.
Hisrich and Peters (1998, p. 20) categorize the various skills required by
entrepreneurs as follows.
.
Technical skills: includes written and oral communication, technical management
and organizing skills.
.
Business management skills: includes planning, decision-making, marketing and
accounting skills.
.
Personal entrepreneurial skills: includes inner control, innovation, risk taking and
innovation.
In addition, Hisrich and Peters (1998) stress that the development of particular skills,
namely inner control, risk taking, innovativeness, being change oriented, persistence
and visionary leadership, differentiates an entrepreneur from a manager.
Interestingly, Timmons et al. (1987) suggest that that there is a limit to what can be
taught in entrepreneurship training programmes, and that the only way to learn is
through one’s own personal experience. With this in mind, they see the quality of the
resulting business plan as a key measure of effective experiential learning. However,
Gibb (1997) questions the emphasis placed by many entrepreneurship programmes on
producing a business plan, despite the fact that business plan development would
appear to be a common element in most entrepreneurship programmes (Hills, 1988). He
suggests that excessive focus on the business plan as an output may inhibit
entrepreneurial response to subsequent changes in the environment. Gibb (1997)
recommends that trainers realising a business plan is the only way of exploring a new
venture, and that it is often of more use to the bank manager or grant-aiding body than
to the entrepreneur him/herself. Wan (1989), to some degree supports this view, claims
that the business plan is only one of the criteria which venture capitalists use to
evaluate new proposals. A business plan does not reflect the abilities of the individual
entrepreneur, which have a strong impact on the ultimate funding decision.
Financial management and marketing have also been highlighted as critical areas
where entrepreneurs require help in the various surveys reported on by Dunsby (1996).
However, Atherton and Hannon (1996) suggest broader requirements for entrepreneurs
seeking success. Based on a survey of 70 owner-managers in North-East England and
South-West Australia, they examined entrepreneurs’ perceptions of success and found
that the key entrepreneurial competencies required to develop a business include the

<-----Page 7----->ability to manage events and conditions in the external environment, and envisioning a
future for the business. In addition, the importance of the need to develop or enhance
one’s personal capabilities (as opposed to abilities) in order to manage the environment
and develop direction and purpose for the business was stressed.
Despite the increase in the amount of research conducted into the area of
entrepreneurship training and education, Jennings and Hawley (1996) suggest that
many entrepreneurship training initiatives do not actually address the real needs of
entrepreneurs. Indeed, there is often a significant gap between the perceptions of the
training providers and those of the entrepreneurs in terms of training needs, for, what
sometimes appear as key problem areas to the trainer, may have little importance for
the entrepreneur. If one begins to examine what is actually taught in an
entrepreneurship programme, it becomes clear that some programmes tend to be
more task oriented rather than behaviour oriented, focusing on specific skills for small
business management such as finance and marketing, as opposed to creativity,
innovation and problem solving abilities (Deakins, 1996). Many structured training
interventions do little to alter the approach of the entrepreneur to solving business
problems. Entrepreneurs who become task-oriented are more likely to fail (McCabe,
1998). With this in mind, Garavan and O’Cinnéide (1994) question what can actually be
taught in entrepreneurship programmes that is specific to entrepreneurship itself.
They support Vesper’s (1982) view that most entrepreneurship programmes do not
even promote entrepreneurship in that they are not “resource effective” and their
results are poor in comparison to the throughput of participants.

Approaches to teaching entrepreneurship
It is clear from the literature that the learning methods employed in entrepreneurship
education and training programmes vary considerably from lectures, presentations
and handouts to video and case study-based learning, with group discussion and
role-plays. In addition, both traditional and non-traditional approaches to learning are
featured. Some commentators, such as Davies and Gibb (1991) for example, are critical
of the adoption of traditional education methods, which focus mainly on theory and a
didactic approach, suggesting that they are “inappropriate” in the teaching of
entrepreneurship. Young (1997) supports this view when he questions the relevance
and value of a theoretical approach to a subject which deals almost exclusively with
activity, suggesting that the experience and practical skills used by entrepreneurs are
possibly not something that can be acquired through conventional teaching methods.
However, Shepherd and Douglas (1996) criticise the use of the less traditional case
study, role play, simulation and problem solving teaching methods, arguing that, in the
confines of the classroom where guidelines are provided and outcomes are known, such
mechanisms are actually promoting logical rather than creative or entrepreneurial
thinking.
In an attempt to assess alternative approaches to teaching entrepreneurship,
McMullan and Boberg (1991) compared the case method of teaching with the project
method, by conducting a survey amongst current MBA students and alumni at the
University of Calgary. They discovered that the students felt the case method was
effective in developing analytical skills and the ability to synthesise information.
However, courses based on the project method were perceived to develop and enhance

106

knowledge and understanding of the subject area, as well as the ability to evaluate, and
were felt to be more effective in teaching entrepreneurship.
In exploring the relationship between education and entrepreneurship, Gibb (1987b)
has contrasted the classroom learning situation with the real world learning
environment of the entrepreneur. He suggests that the learning emphasis in many
educational establishments and business schools is very much on the past, with a focus
on the understanding, feedback and analysis of large amounts of information. In
reality, the entrepreneur is focused on the present, with little time for critical analysis.
He/she spends most of the time dealing with problems and learns through his/her own
experiences and through doing. The classroom situation involves a high level of
dependence on authority and on what Gibb terms “expert validation”, whereas in the
real world the entrepreneur must rely on the validity of his/her own knowledge and
personal values. The main differences between the classroom and the real world
entrepreneurial learning situation are outlined in Table I.
In view of the differences illustrated in Table I, therefore, Gibb suggests a more
flexible, in terms of location and time, as well as a more active experience-based,
learning approach to teaching entrepreneurship. For example, such an approach
should encourage students, among other things, to find and explore the wider concepts
relating to a problem; to learn by overcoming failure; to develop more independence
from external sources of information and expert advice; and to think for themselves.
However, in terms of entrepreneurship education and training, Gibb (1987b)
suggests that very little is known about the knowledge transfer process between
trainers and entrepreneurs or owner-managers, and it is not entirely clear how
participants in entrepreneurship programmes prefer to learn. Recently, the emphasis
on learning methods within entrepreneurship education has been to encourage an
active approach, though not necessarily at the expense of theory. For example, Fiet
(2000a), who advocates that those involved in teaching entrepreneurship should

cognitive skills necessary to make better entrepreneurial decisions, believes that this
can be achieved via theory-based activities (Fiet, 2000b). However, other commentators
argue that the adoption of a more practically focused and active-based approach to
entrepreneurship teaching is more valid.
Timmons and Stevenson (1985) suggest that entrepreneurship is an ongoing
lifelong learning experience and, as such, the best way to learn is to combine
experience with formal educational activities. Based on their study of 100 established
entrepreneurs attending a management programme at Harvard Business School, they
claim that analytical thinking, accounting, finance, marketing, management
information systems and manufacturing are among those aspects of
entrepreneurship that can be taught. However, other more critical skills such as
judgement, handling people, patience and responsibility cannot be taught directly and
can only be learned in the real world.
For entrepreneurial development programmes to be effective, learning must be
based in real work situations so that managers can better implement what they have
learnt. Based on the belief that aspiring entrepreneurs require more flexibility in their
learning, Sexton and Bowman-Upton (1991) call for the need to experiment more with
entrepreneurship teaching, even to the point where an unstructured approach is
adopted. In a similar vein, Connor et al. (1996) refer to Kolb’s (1984) learning cycle in
which practising business managers are involved in experiencing, reflecting,
conceptualising and experimentation. They see this process as critical in helping
business managers to apply what they have learnt in the real organisational or
business setting.
Part II of this paper, which will be presented in the journal’s next issue, focuses on
the issue of programme effectiveness which leads to a discussion on whether or not
entrepreneurship can be successfully taught. Conclusions from both parts of the paper
are also presented in part II.
