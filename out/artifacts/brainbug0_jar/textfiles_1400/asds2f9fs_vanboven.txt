Abstract
The results of two experiments support the thesis that emotional perspective taking entails two judgments: a prediction of
one’s own preferences and decisions in a diVerent emotional situation, and an adjustment of this prediction to accommodate
perceived diVerences between self and others. Participants overestimated others’ willingness to engage in embarrassing public
performances—miming (Experiment 1) and dancing (Experiment 2)—in exchange for money. Consistent with a dual judgment
model, this overestimation was greater among participants facing a hypothetical rather than a real decision to perform. Further,
participants’ predictions of others’ willingness to perform were more closely correlated with self-predictions than with participants’ estimates of others’ thoughts about the costs and beneWts of performing.

Accurately predicting others’ reactions to emotional
situations is an important part of everyday social life.
Knowing how an employee will deal with criticism is
helpful for deciding how best to provide performance
feedback. Knowing how a friend will respond to longterm physical duress is useful in deciding whether to
invite him on an extended wilderness adventure. And
knowing how much co-workers will enjoy (or dread)
singing in front of friends and colleagues is important
for deciding whether to schedule a karaoke contest for
the company retreat.

How do people predict others’ preferences and decisions in emotional situations? That is, how do people
engage in emotional perspective taking? We examine this
question in the context of people’s predictions of others’
reactions to embarrassing situations.
Fear of embarrassment is an important determinant
of social behavior. Social psychologists have cited the
impact of fear of embarrassment in non-intervention in
emergency situations (Latané & Darley, 1970), failures
to oppose unpopular policies or social norms (Miller &
McFarland, 1987; Prentice & Miller, 1993; Van Boven,
2000), obedience to authority (Sabini, Seipmann, &
Stein, 2001), and lovers’ failure to use contraception
(Herold, 1981; Leary & Dobbins, 1983). And fear of
embarrassment is one reason why regrettable inactions
are more durable than regrettable actions (Gilovich,
Kerr, & Medvec, 1993; Gilovich & Medvec, 1995).
Because fear of embarrassment is such a potent barrier
to social action (Miller, 1992; Miller & Leary, 1992),

<-----Page 1----->L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

making good decisions in social situations and accurately interpreting social behavior often depends on
accurately predicting the impact of fear of embarrassment on other people.
Based on our own and others’ research, we hypothesized that people underestimate the impact of fear of
embarrassment on others’ preferences and decisions.
SpeciWcally, we hypothesized that people overestimate
others’ willingness to engage in embarrassing public performances. This “illusion of courage” in social predictions follows from a model of emotional perspective
taking in which predictions of others’ preferences and
decisions in emotional situations depends partly on predictions of one’s own reactions to those situations.
Because people underestimate the impact of fear of
embarrassment on themselves, overestimating their own
willingness to engage in embarrassing public performances (Van Boven, Loewenstein, Dunning, & Welch,
2004), we expected them to overestimate others’ willingness to engage in public performances.

A dual judgment model of emotional perspective taking
We propose that emotional perspective taking entails
two, distinct judgments, represented by the two solid
arrows in Fig. 1 (Van Boven & Loewenstein, 2003, in
press-a, in press-b). The Wrst is a prediction of what one’s
own preferences and decisions would be in a diVerent
emotional situation (the vertical solid arrow in Fig. 1).
For example, one might predict whether a colleague
would enjoy karaoke by Wrst predicting whether oneself
would enjoy singing popular tunes in front of an audience. The second judgment is an estimation of how simi-

131

lar the other person is to the self, and, hence, how
informative the self-prediction is about others’ reactions
(the horizontal solid arrow in Fig. 1). Believing that a
colleague is more extroverted than oneself suggests
adjusting one’s own reluctance to sing to accommodate
the colleague’s outgoing personality.
Our dual judgment model of emotional perspective
taking diVers from other models of perspective taking in
two important ways. First, many models of perspective
taking focus on people’s predictions of others’ reactions
to situations or decisions that are exactly the same as
those faced by the self—for example, others who are
faced with a similar decision to wear a sandwich board
or not (Ross, Greene, & House, 1977), asked a similar
question about their preference for 1980s or 1960s music
(Gilovich, 1990), confronted with a similar decision
about whether to donate to charity (Epley & Dunning,
2000; Goethals, Messick, & Allison, 1991), or asked a
similar question about their attitudes toward social
norms (Miller & McFarland, 1987; Prentice & Miller,
1993; Van Boven, 2000). Because this previous research
(represented by the horizontal dashed arrow in Fig. 1)
has focused on perspective taking within the same, typically non-emotional, situation, previous theorizing has
focused primarily on factors that inXuence judgments of
how similar or dissimilar others are to the self (e.g.,
Krueger & Clement, 1994; Prentice & Miller, 1996).
Emotional perspective taking, in contrast, concerns predictions of how other people would react to being in a
diVerent emotional situation from the situation the self is
currently in. Accordingly, we suggest that emotional perspective taking entails the additional judgment of how
the self would respond to being in a diVerent emotional
situation.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of perspective taking across similar situations and across diVerent emotional situations. The dual judgment model of
emotional perspective taking is represented by the two solid arrows. The horizontal dashed arrow represents predictions of others who are in similar
situations as the self. The diagonal dashed arrow represents simultaneously accounting for the reactions of diVerent people who are in diVerent
situations than the self.

<-----Page 2----->132

L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

Second, other examinations of cross-situational perspective-taking posit a single judgment that simultaneously accounts for diVerences between the self and
the target and for diVerences between others’ situation
and the situation the self is currently in (the diagonal
dashed arrow in Fig. 2, Epley, Keysar, Van Boven, &
Gilovich, 2004; Keysar & Barr, 2002; Nickerson, 1999).
For example, people’s own interpretation of an ambiguous communication may serve as a judgmental anchor
from which they adjust to estimate the interpretation of
other people who were provided with diVerent information about the communication (Epley et al., 2004).
Although anchoring and adjustment of this type may
characterize perspective taking across diVerent nonemotional situations, we contend that perspective
taking across diVerent emotional situations entails two
separate judgments: a prediction of one’s own reaction
to a diVerent emotional situation, and an adjustment to
this prediction to accommodate diVerences between
oneself and others.
A novel implication of our dual-judgment model is
that accurate emotional perspective taking depends both
on the accuracy of self-predictions and on the accuracy
of assessments of the similarity between self and others.
Even if people are perfectly calibrated in their self-predictions, they may be biased in judging how similar they
are to others. And even if people are perfectly calibrated
in their judgments of how similar they are to others,
biased self-predictions could produce biased social-predictions. We propose that judgmental bias of both
types contribute to the illusion of courage in socialpredictions.

The illusion of courage in self-predictions
With respect to self-predictions (the vertical solid
arrow in Fig. 1), our own research indicates that people
underestimate the impact of fear of embarrassment on
their own preferences and decisions. When an embarrassing public performance is not real and immediate,
people overestimate how willing they would be to dance,
perform a mime, or tell a joke in exchange for money
(Van Boven et al., 2004). This illusion of courage in selfpredictions is a speciWc case of “hot/cold empathy gaps,”
which occur when people in an unaroused state underestimate the impact of being in an emotional situation on
their preferences and decisions (Loewenstein, 1999; Loewenstein, O’Donoghue, & Rabin, 2003). For instance,
people who do not own an object underestimate how
attached they would be to it and how much money they
would demand to sell the object if they did own it (Loewenstein & Adler, 1995; Van Boven, Dunning, & Loewenstein, 2000; Van Boven, Loewenstein, & Dunning,
2003). And people who are in a relatively neutral state
underestimate how much they would be bothered by

thirst versus hunger compared with people whose thirst
is aroused because they just engaged in 20 min of cardiovascular exercise (Van Boven & Loewenstein, 2003).
Hot/cold empathy gaps arise because people do not
anticipate how much emotional arousal inXuences their
construal of the situation. In particular, people underestimate how much arousal increases their focus on
emotional information relative to non-emotional information. Emotional arousal, particularly of negative
aVect such as fear and anxiety, narrows attention (Basso,
ScheVt, Ris, & Dember, 1996; Derryberry, 1993; Derryberry & Reed, 1998) and inhibits attention to non-emotional information (Fox, Russo, & Bowles, 2001; Fox,
Russo, & Dutton, 2002). This “emotional focusing” can
increase the judgmental weight of emotional information relative to non-emotional information, exacerbating
the tendency to underweight non-focal information
when making predictions (Chambers, Windschitl, &
Suls, 2003; Kruger & Burrus, 2003; Moore & Kim, 2003;
Savitsky, Epley, & Gilovich, 2001; Schkade & Kahneman, 1998; Wilson, Wheatley, Meyers, Gilbert, &
Axsom, 2000; Windschitl, Krueger, & Simms, 2003).
In the case of embarrassment, the fear and anxiety
aroused by facing a real and immediate public performance causes people to focus more on being socially
evaluated relative to the potential beneWts of embarrassing behavior (Van Boven et al., 2004; Study 5). In one
study, we found that, compared with those facing a
purely hypothetical performance, participants facing a
real and immediate decision to dance for money
reported thinking more about being evaluated by others
relative to the money they could earn. The diVerence
between people’s thoughts about social evaluation and
their thoughts about money—an index of emotional
focusing—statistically mediated the impact of facing a
hypothetical or real decision on people’s willingness to
dance.
Our other research on the illusion of courage in selfpredictions led us to predict that people’s overestimation
of their own willingness to engage in embarrassing performances would contribute to the illusion of courage in
social-predictions. SpeciWcally, we hypothesized that
people who simply imagined facing the choice of engaging in an embarrassing performance in exchange for
money would predict that others would be more willing
to perform compared with people who actually faced the
choice of performing for money.

DiVerences between self and others in fear of
embarrassment
With respect to assessments of the similarity between
the self and others (the horizontal solid arrow in Fig. 1),
previous research demonstrates that people have an
enduring intuitive belief that others experience fear of

<-----Page 3----->L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

embarrassment less than the self (McFarland & Miller,
1990; Miller & McFarland, 1987; Sabini, Cosmas, Siepmann, & Stein, 1999; Van Boven, 2000). This belief is an
instance of a more general intuitive theory that others
experience self-conscious emotions less than the self
(McFarland & Miller, 1990; Miller & McFarland, 1987;
Vorauer & Ratner, 1996). Because people often restrain
their display of self-conscious emotions (Kleck et al.,
1976; Kraut, 1982; Lanzetta, Cartwright-Smith, &
Kleck, 1976), evidence about the intensity of others’ selfconscious emotions tends to be less cognitively
accessible than evidence about one’s own self-conscious
emotions. This diVerential accessibility can lead people
to infer that others experience self-conscious emotions
less than the self (Schwarz & Vaughn, 2002; Taylor,
1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1973).
People’s belief that others experience less fear of
embarrassment than the self led us to hypothesize that
people would generally overestimate others’ willingness
to engage in an embarrassing public performance in
exchange for money, regardless of whether people themselves faced a real or hypothetical performance. More
important, our dual judgment model implies that this
overestimation would be moderated by people’s prediction of their own willingness to perform.

The present research
We examined the illusion of courage in social predictions in two experiments. We confronted people with
either purely hypothetical or potentially real decisions to
engage in embarrassing public performances in exchange
for money. We asked people to predict other people’s
willingness to mime (Experiment 1) and dance (Experiment 2). Performing in front of an audience is
embarrassing for many reasons, including simple conspicuousness and the possibility of negative social evaluation (Miller, 1992; Sabini et al., 2001). The decision to
engage in an embarrassing performance is therefore a
function of the avoidance motivations associated with
embarrassing public performances relative to the
approach motivation associated with earning money.
We expected to diVerentiate the two judgments in our
model by demonstrating two trends. First, we expected
that people’s predictions of others’ willingness to perform would be strongly correlated with people’s own
willingness to perform. People who faced a hypothetical
decision to perform for money should therefore predict
that other people would be more willing to perform
compared with people who faced a real decision to perform. Second, we expected that people would generally
overestimate others’ willingness to engage in an embarrassing performance, independent of whether people
themselves faced a real or hypothetical performance.
Furthermore, in Experiment 2 we examined whether

133

people’s predictions of others’ willingness to perform
were more closely associated with predictions of their
own willingness to perform, as implied by our model, or
with people’s estimates of how much others thought
about the costs versus the beneWts of performing.

Experiment 1: Miming
Participants were asked to predict how willing they
and other people would be to perform a mime in front of
a large audience in exchange for money. For some participants, the performance was potentially real: they knew
that they might actually have to mime if they indicated a
willingness to do so. For other participants, the performance was purely hypothetical: they knew they would not
have to mime no matter how they responded. All participants were asked to take the perspective of the other participants facing a real performance, and to predict how
willing to perform those participants would be, on average. We expected that participants in both groups would
exhibit an illusion of courage, overestimating others’ willingness to perform compared with participants who faced
a potentially real performance. We also expected this
overestimation to be pronounced among participants facing a purely hypothetical performance compared with
those facing a potentially real performance. Further, we
expected this diVerential overestimation of others’ willingness to perform to be mediated by participants’ predictions of their own willingness to perform.
Method
University undergraduates in a large lecture class
(N D 174) participated as part of a class exercise. The
experimenter distributed white and green versions of a
questionnaire randomly assigning participants to either
the real (n D 86) or hypothetical performance condition
(n D 88). Participants in the real performance condition
read:
Students with green sheets of paper—like you—are
being given the option of performing one of 20 randomly selected mimes in front of the class for a payment
of $5. The instructor will randomly select some of the
students with green sheets who have agreed to perform a
mime to do so. The instructor will randomly select a
mime for each student to perform. The instructor will
chose from the following mimes: basketball (the ball
itself), bicycle, blender, dog, cheetah, computer, elephant,
Wle cabinet, ocean liner, ocean waves, porcupine, scotch
tape, skeet shooter, snake, stapler, thumb tack, washing
machine, waste basket, waterfall, and willow tree. Students will perform the mime until someone from the
class correctly identiWes it. Mimers may use whatever
body movements they wish, but may not use words or

<-----Page 4----->134

props. Notice that because not everyone who indicates a
willingness to perform a mime will actually be called
upon to do so, no one will notice if you choose not to
perform a mime.
Participants in the hypothetical performance condition received identical instructions, except they were
printed on white paper and speciWed that participants
would not actually be asked to mime.
As measures of participants’ own willingness to perform, they stated in dollars the lowest price they would
have to be paid to mime in front of the class. They also
indicated whether or not they would be willing to perform a mime in exchange for $5. Participants were also
asked to consider the (other) participants in the real performance condition and to estimate the average lowest
performance price of those participants, as well as the
percentage of those participants that would agree to
mime for $5. The order of the two questions pertaining
to participants themselves and the two questions pertaining to the other participants was counterbalanced,
had no reliable eVect, and is not discussed further.
After the questionnaires were collected, the experimenter randomly selected Wve willing students from the
real performance condition to mime. Participants were
thanked, paid, and everyone was debriefed.
Results and discussion
Because performance prices were positively skewed,
we performed natural log transformations before analyzing the data. For interpretational ease, we present
back-transformed averages. We excluded from all analyses one participant from the hypothetical performance
condition who stated an inconsistent performance price
and decision to mime (resulting N D 173).
As anticipated, participants overestimated others’
willingness to perform a mime, and this overestimation
was greater among participants who faced a purely
hypothetical performance compared with those who
faced a potentially real performance (see Fig. 2). The
performance price stated by participants who faced a
potentially real performance (M D $19.61) was underestimated both by participants who faced a hypothetical
performance (M D $8.57, d D .70, t [171] D 4.58, 95%
C.I. D $1.51–$2.79) and those who faced a real performance (M D $11.32, d D 1.21, t [85] D 5.57, 95% C.I. D
$1.35–$1.88). Also as anticipated, participants who faced
a hypothetical performance predicted that participants
facing a real performance would state a lower performance price than did participants who faced a potentially real performance (d D .30, t [171] D 1.94, 95%
C.I. D–$1.01–$1.67).
The impact of the reality of the performance on participants’ social-predictions was mirrored in self-predictions.

research,

underestimated their own performance prices (M D
$11.24) compared with participants who faced a real
performance (d D .43, t [171] D 2.85, p D .005, 95% C.I. D
$1.16–$2.22). Furthermore, a mediation analysis
(Baron & Kenny, 1986) indicated that the impact of the
real or hypothetical nature of the performance on participants’ own performance prices ( D .21) mediated
the impact of the nature of the performance on participants’ predictions of others’ performance prices. The
correlation between the reality of the performance and
predictions of others’ performance prices was reliably
reduced (from  D .15 to  D .01, Z D 2.74, p D .006), via
a Sobel (1982) test, when participants’ own performance prices were included in a multiple regression
( D .64, t [170] D 10.72, p < .001).
A similar pattern emerged for participants’ predicted
and actual decisions of whether they would perform for
$5. The fraction of participants who faced a real performance that were willing to mime (15.12%) was overestimated both by participants who faced a hypothetical
performance (M D 43.33%, d D 2.62, t [86] D 12.05, 95%
C.I. D 23.56–32.87%) and by those who faced a real performance themselves (M D 38.74%, d D 2.20, t [85] D
10.15, 95% C.I. D 19.00–28.25%). As well, participants
who faced a hypothetical performance predicted that a
greater fraction of other students would agree to mime
compared with participants who faced a real performance, although the diVerence was not reliable (d D .21,
t [171] D 1.39, 95% C.I. D –1.93–11.10%). Finally, replicating our previous research, participants who faced a
hypothetical performance were more likely to predict
that they would mime (M D 31.03%) compared with the

<-----Page 5----->L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

fraction of participants who actually agreed to mime
(M D 15.12%,  D .19, 2 [1, N D 173] D 6.17, p D .013).
These results demonstrate the illusion of courage in
social predictions and suggest that it stems from the
combination of two judgmental biases. First, participants who faced a purely hypothetical performance predicted that others would be more willing to perform than
participants who faced a real performance, implying that
the illusion of courage in self-predictions contributed to
the illusion of courage in social-predictions. Consistent
with this thesis, the impact of facing a real or hypothetical performance on participants’ own willingness to perform (the vertical solid arrow in Fig. 1) statistically
mediated the impact of the reality of the performance on
their predictions of others’ willingness to perform. Second, participants generally overestimated how willing
other people would be to engage in an embarrassing
public performance, regardless of whether participants
themselves faced a real or hypothetical performance (the
horizontal solid arrow in Fig. 1).

Experiment 2: Dancing
We designed Experiment 2 with two goals in mind.
The Wrst was to replicate the primary results of Experiment 1 in a slightly diVerent setting with somewhat
diVerent measures. We asked people to indicate how
willing they would be to dance in front of an audience in
exchange for money. People were also asked to take the
perspective of a speciWc, randomly selected individual,
rather than a group of other individuals as in Experiment 1, and to predict that individual’s willingness to
dance for money. The performance was potentially real
for some people and purely hypothetical for others. We
expected both groups of people to overestimate others’
willingness to dance. We also expected that people facing
a hypothetical performance would be more likely than
those facing a real performance to predict that others
would perform, and that this diVerence in social predictions would mirror and be mediated by a corresponding
diVerence in self-predictions.
Our second goal was to examine the extent to which
predictions of others’ willingness to perform are correlated with predictions of one’s own willingness to perform versus estimates of others’ thoughts about the costs
and beneWts of performing. Repeating a procedure used
in our other research (Van Boven et al., 2004), people
were asked to report how much they thought about two
factors when they decided whether to dance: being evaluated by other people, and the money they could earn.
People were also asked to estimate how much the other
person thought about the same two factors when deciding whether he or she would dance. These two factors
emerged during the debrieWng of our previous studies,
including Experiment 1, as the major costs and beneWts

135

people consider when deciding whether to perform in
exchange for money. Because being evaluated by others
is, intuitively, more closely associated with the emotions
aroused by facing public performances than the money
one could earn, facing a real and immediate performance
causes people to think less about the money relative to
being socially evaluated (Van Boven et al., 2004). We
therefore expected that people facing a real performance
would focus more on being evaluated by their peers relative to the money they could earn, and that this emotional focusing would mediate the illusion of courage in
self-predictions.
Of greater import for the present investigation, we
expected that people’s predictions of others’ willingness
to perform would be more closely associated with their
own willingness to perform than with people’s estimates
of others’ thoughts about the relative costs and beneWts
of performing. Our dual judgment model of emotional
perspective taking implies that predictions of others’
preferences and decisions are based primarily on predictions of one’s own preferences and decisions. Thus,
although we expected people to project onto others
their own thoughts about being evaluated and the
money they could earn, we did not expect people’s estimates of others’ thoughts to be independently associated with people’s predictions of others’ willingness to
perform. This pattern would provide strong support for
our assertion that predictions of one’s own preferences
and decisions form the basis of emotional perspective
taking.
Method
University undergraduates in a large lecture class
(N D 270) participated as part of a class exercise. Upon
entering the classroom, a large auditorium with an elevated stage in front, students were given an instruction
packet and questionnaires to read and complete while
they listened to Rick James’ 1981 song “Super Freak.”
As in Experiment 1, participants were given green or
white sheets of paper randomly assigning them to either
the real (n D 135) or hypothetical (n D 135) performance
condition. Participants in the real performance condition read the following:
Students with green sheets of paper like you have the
option of dancing by themselves in front of the class for
a payment of $5. The instructor will randomly select
some of the students with green sheets who have agreed
to dance to do so. Those students will dance, one at a
time, for one minute, to the song “Super Freak,” by Rick
James. Notice that because not everyone who indicates
he or she will dance will be called upon to do so, no one
will notice if you choose not to dance.
The instructions given to participants in the hypothetical performance condition were identical, except they

<-----Page 6----->136

L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

were printed on white paper, and speciWed that there was
no possibility of their dancing. Both groups read that
half of the students faced a real performance and half
faced a hypothetical performance.
Participants were asked to state the smallest amount
of money they would have to be paid to dance, and to
indicate whether they would dance for $5. Participants
were also asked to consider another anonymous, “randomly selected” participant in the real performance condition, to predict that participant’s lowest performance
price, and to predict whether that participant would
dance for $5. The order of the two questions pertaining
to participants themselves and to the other participant
was counterbalanced, had no reliable eVect, and is not
discussed further.
Participants were next asked how much they thought
about two factors when indicating their willingness to
perform: “How much did you think about how you
would be evaluated by the other students?” and “How
much did you think about the $5 you would earn?” They
answered both questions on scales ranging from 1(not at
all) to 9(a great deal). Participants also estimated on
identical scales how much the participant whose performance price and choice they predicted had thought
about each factor. Participants’ completed questionnaires were collected, the experimenter selected ten willing participants from the real performance condition to
dance, and everyone was debriefed.
Results
Because performance prices were positively skewed,
as in Experiment 1, we performed natural log transformations before analyzing the data, but present backtransformed averages for interpretational ease. We
excluded from all analyses the nine participants (six in
the hypothetical performance condition and three in the
real performance condition) who stated inconsistent performance prices and decisions, either for themselves or
for the other participant (resulting N D 261).
Willingness to perform. Replicating the illusion of courage in social predictions, participants overestimated others’ willingness to dance; this overestimation was greater
among participants who faced a hypothetical performance than among those who faced a real performance
(see Fig. 3). The performance price stated by participants
who faced a real performance (M D $52.88) was underestimated both by participants who faced a hypothetical
performance (M D $12.71, d D .71, t [250] D 5.63, 95%
C.I. D $2.39–$6.09) and by those who faced a real performance themselves (M D $19.22, d D 1.06, t [119] D 5.79,
95% C.I. D $1.91–$3.72).1 Also, participants who faced a

hypothetical performance predicted others’ performance
prices would be lower than did participants who faced a
real performance (d D .29, t [250] D 2.30, 95% C.I. D
$1.05–$1.92). Finally, participants who faced a hypothetical performance underestimated what their own performance prices would be (M D $21.07) compared with
participants who faced a real performance (d D .42,
t [248] D 3.32, 95% C.I. D $1.42–$3.94).
A similar pattern emerged for participants’ predicted
and actual choices. The fraction of students that agreed
to dance when they faced a real performance (8.33%)
was overestimated by participants who faced a hypothetical performance (M D 35.66%,  D .33, 2 [1, N D
261] D 28.54, p < .001) and by participants who faced a
real performance themselves (M D 31.01%, McNemar
N D 132, p D .021). As with performance price predictions, participants who faced a hypothetical performance were more likely than participants who faced a
real performance to predict that others would choose to
dance ( D .23, 2 [1, N D 261] D 13.34, p < .001). Additionally, participants who faced a hypothetical performance were more likely to predict that they themselves
would choose to dance (M D 31.01%) compared with the
fraction of participants who actually chose to dance (
D .29, 2 [1, N D 261] D 21.34, p < .001). These results
replicate the illusion of courage in social- and selfpredictions.
Emotional focusing. As expected, participants who faced
a hypothetical performance reported thinking about the
money to be earned versus being evaluated by others
more than did participants who faced a real performance (see the left side of Fig. 4). And, as expected,
participants projected this shift in focus onto others’
thoughts (see the right side of Fig. 4). We submitted

predictions of others’ thoughts (2 D .017, F [1, 258] D
4.39, 95% C.I. D .04–1.32).
Paths of courage. Our analysis of the illusion of courage in social predictions implies two paths of mediation. First, as in our other research (Van Boven et al.,
2004), the impact of facing a real or hypothetical performance on participants’ willingness to engage in
embarrassing performances should be at least partially
mediated by their increased focus on being socially
evaluated relative to the money. Second, the impact of
facing a real or hypothetical performance on predictions of others’ willingness to perform should be mediated by participants’ own willingness to perform—and
not by participants’ estimates of others’ focus on social
evaluation.
We examined these predictions simultaneously with
the structural equation modeling (SEM) program
within the AMOS procedure.2 Because our analysis of
emotional focusing implies that facing a real perfor2

This analysis includes the 240 participants who provided all relevant data.

emotional focusing, one for participants’ own thoughts
and one for their predictions of others’ thoughts. We
subtracted participants’ ratings of thoughts about the

indicate a greater focus on being evaluated by others
relative to the money. We then included Wve measures
in the SEM analysis: (a) a binary variable indicating
whether participants were in the hypothetical or real
performance condition (coded 0 or 1, respectively), (b)
the diVerence score indexing participants’ focus on
being evaluated by their peers, (c) the diVerence score
indexing participants’ belief about others’ focus on
being evaluated by their peers, (d) participants’ own
performance price (natural log transformed), and (e)
their estimate of the other participants’ performance
price (natural log transformed).3
The fully saturated model is displayed in Fig. 5. Statistically reliable and non-reliable correlations in the
model, each controlling for all other correlations, are

We used performance prices rather than decisions as the key dependent measures in this model because prices are a more sensitive index
of participants’ willingness to perform.

<-----Page 8----->138

The pattern of correlations is consistent with both mediational hypotheses.4
Consider Wrst participants’ own performance price.
Whether participants faced a hypothetical or real performance (Hypothetical or Real Performance) is reliably
correlated with their own focus on being evaluated (Self
Focus on Evaluation, Z D 2.10, p D .036) and with their
lowest performance price (Self Performance Price,
Z D 2.86, p D .004). Participants’ own focus on evaluation
is strongly correlated with their own performance price
(Z D 7.18, p < .001). (Participants’ performance price is
also unexpectedly correlated with their prediction of
other participants’ focus on evaluation, Z D 1.98,
p D .046.) Furthermore, there is a reliable indirect path
from the hypothetical or real performance to participants’ focus on evaluation to their own predicted performance price (Z D 2.02, p D .044, Sobel, 1982). This
pattern replicates our previous Wnding that participants’
focus on evaluation partially mediated the illusion of
courage in self-predictions.
Next, consider participants’ predictions of other participants’ performance price (Others’ Performance
Price). This prediction is reliably correlated only with
participants’ own performance price (Z D 11.94,
p < .001). None of the other variables in the model is reliably correlated with participants’ predictions of others’
performance prices (all Zs < 1), not even participants’
estimates of the other participant’s focus on evaluation
(Others’ Focus on Evaluation). This is rather striking
given that participants’ own focus on evaluation was
closely correlated with their own performance price.
Thus, participants’ own performance price—but not
their estimates of others’ thoughts—statistically mediated the impact of the real versus hypothetical nature of
the performance on participants’ predictions of others’
performance prices.5 Participants’ predictions of others’
willingness to engage in an embarrassing performance,
this analysis suggests, were based primarily on their own
willingness to perform, not on any judgment about
others’ thoughts.

performance compared with those who faced a potentially real performance, a pattern that mirrored people’s
overestimation of their own willingness to perform.
Compared with those who faced a hypothetical performance, people who faced a real performance reported
thinking about, and predicted others would think about,
being evaluated by their peers more than the money to
be earned.
Inspection of Fig. 4 reveals that this shift in focus
occurred mainly because of changes in thoughts about
money. Regressions estimating the thoughts about
money revealed reliable eVects of the type of performance, both for participants’ own thoughts ( D ¡.13,
t [258] D 2.03, p D .044), and for their estimates of others’
thoughts. ( D ¡.14, t [258] D 2.23, p D .026). Regressions
estimating the thoughts about evaluation failed to reveal
reliable eVects of the type of performance for participants’ own thoughts ( D .08, t [258] D 1.28, p D .203) and
for their estimates of others’ thoughts ( D .04, t < 1).
This pattern of results is consistent with our other Wndings (Van Boven et al., 2004), and suggests that emotional focusing is primarily caused by decreased
attention to non-emotional information, rather than by
increased attention to emotional information.
In any event, the key point of Experiment 2 is that the
predictions of others’ willingness to engage in an embarrassing public performance is reliably correlated only
with predictions of one’s own willingness to perform.
According to our model, people’s predictions of others’
preferences and decisions in emotional situations—in this
case, facing an embarrassing public performance—are
based on their predictions of what their own preferences
and decisions would be in those situations. Consistent
with this thesis, a structural equation model indicated
that predictions of others’ willingness to engage in an
embarrassing performance were correlated only with participants’ predictions of their own willingness to engage
in an embarrassing performance. Participants’ predictions of what other people thought about were not independently correlated with their predictions of others’
preferences.

Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 replicated the illusion of
courage in social predictions. People generally overestimated how willing other people would be to dance in
front of an audience. This overestimation was pronounced among people who faced a purely hypothetical

We also conducted a SEM including only the associations implied
by our hypotheses, all of which remained reliable (all Zs > 2.4, all

better than the restricted model (2 [5, N D 240] D 6.07, p D .299).

According to Cohen and Cohen (1983) for analyses of two or more
mediating variables, a reasonable substitute for an exact signiWcance
test is whether all of the component path coeYcients are signiWcant.

General discussion
Predicting how emotions impact others’ preferences
and decisions is a particularly important but also particularly diYcult task of everyday social life. The two
experiments presented here demonstrate that such emotional perspective taking falls short when it comes to
embarrassing situations. People systematically underestimate the impact on others’ preferences and decisions of
fear of embarrassment. People underestimated how
willing other people would be to mime (Experiment 1)
and dance (Experiment 2) in front of an audience. This
illusion of courage emerged both when people made

<-----Page 9----->L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

predictions about groups of people (Experiment 1) and
about speciWc others (Experiment 2).
Two judgmental biases produce the illusion of courage in social-predictions. First, and most important, people base their social predictions on predictions of what
their own preferences and decisions would be in emotionally arousing situations. Because people underestimate the impact of being in an embarrassing situation
on their own preferences and decisions (Van Boven et al.,
2004), they also underestimate the impact of being in an
embarrassing situation on others’ preferences and decisions. Consistent with this thesis, the impact of facing a
real or hypothetical performance on participants’ predictions of others’ willingness to perform was statistically mediated in both experiments by the impact of
facing a real versus hypothetical performance on participants’ predictions of their own willingness to perform.
And in Experiment 2, a SEM indicated that predictions
of others’ willingness to perform was independently correlated only with self-predictions, and not with estimates
of others’ focus on being evaluated by their peers. These
results suggest that predictions of others’ preferences in
embarrassing situations are not based on coherent mental representations of others’ thoughts and preferences,
but at least partly on a (biased) representation of one’s
own preferences.
The second judgmental bias responsible for the illusion of courage in social predictions is an enduring intuitive belief that others are less inXuenced by fear of
embarrassment than themselves (Miller & McFarland,
1987; Sabini et al., 1999). As a result, people generally
expect others to be more willing than themselves to
engage in embarrassing performances. Indeed, participants in both experiments overestimated how willing
other people would be to engage in an embarrassing performance, whether or not participants themselves faced
a real or hypothetical performance.
The results of these experiments were anticipated by
and provide support for a dual judgment model of emotional perspective taking (Van Boven & Loewenstein,
2003, in press-a, in press-b). According to this model,
represented by the solid arrows in Fig. 1, people’s prediction of others’ preferences and decisions in emotional
situations is the result of two distinct judgments: (a) people’s prediction of what their own preferences and decisions would be in an emotional situation, and (b)
adjustments to this prediction to accommodate perceived diVerences between self and others. The results of
our experiments provide a more precise test of this
model by simultaneously showing that people use themselves as basis for predicting others’ willingness to
engage in an embarrassing performance (the vertical
solid arrow in Fig. 1), and that people generally believe
that others’ are more willing than themselves to engage
in an embarrassing performance (the horizontal solid
arrow in Fig. 1).

139

The results of our experiments echo a central theme in
social judgment: People’s judgments are egocentric and
the self is the gravitational center of social cognition
(Dunning & Cohen, 1992; Dunning & Hayes, 1996;
Heider, 1958; Ichheiser, 1946; Krueger, 1998; Sherif &
Hovland, 1961). In both experiments, people’s predictions of others’ willingness to engage in an embarrassing
performance were based largely on their own willingness
to perform. The egocentric nature of social judgment follows largely from people’s assumption that, because their
perceptual and emotional apparatus is for the most part
similar to others’ perceptual and emotional apparatus,
other people will experience similar reactions as the self
(GriYn & Ross, 1991; Ross & Ward, 1995). Because of
such “naive realism,” people attribute their reluctance to
perform partly to the inherent properties of the choice,
implying that others will exhibit a similar reluctance.
Our results also echo another theme in social judgment, seemingly inconsistent with egocentrism, that,
compared with others’ experience, one’s own experience
is unique (Campbell, 1986; Katz & Allport, 1938; Prentice & Miller, 1996; Snyder & Fromkin, 1977; Suls &
Wan, 1987). In both of our experiments, people generally
expected others to be more willing to perform than
themselves. That people simultaneously judge others to
be both similar and dissimilar to the self reXects the
simultaneous operation of conXicted psychological processes (cf., Monin & Norton, 2003; Sabini et al., 1999).
On the one hand, people experience public performances
as inherently embarrassing and undesirable, both to the
self and to others. One the other hand, people believe
that others react to embarrassing situations somewhat
diVerently than the self.
An important question for future research is whether
these two processes—egocentrism and perceived uniqueness—diVer in priority or eVort. Do people initially
assume that others’ reactions are similar to their own
before eVortfully accounting for potential diVerences
between oneself and others? Or do people initially assume
that their reactions are unique before accounting for the
commonality of their own and others’ emotionality?
The results of our experiments, and of our model more
generally, also raise the question of whether and in what
way perspective taking across diVerent emotional situations diVers from perspective taking across diVerent nonemotional situations. To be sure, similar egocentric biases
in perspective taking across both emotional and nonemotional situations imply overlap in the processes
underlying emotional and non-emotional perspective
taking (Van Boven & Loewenstein, in press-a, in press-b).
As mentioned earlier, recent research indicates that perspective taking across diVerent non-emotional situations
entails using the current self as an anchor from which one
adjusts to accommodate simultaneously diVerences
between situations and between the self and others (Epley
et al., 2004; Nickerson, 1999, 2001).

<-----Page 10----->140

L. Van Boven et al. / Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes 96 (2005) 130–141

By contrast, our model and the results of our experiments suggest that emotional perspective taking entails
two distinct judgments, one of which is a prediction of
how the self would react to being in a diVerent emotional situation. These two processes do not exhaust
the possible perspective taking processes, are not inherently inconsistent, and may vary in their relative inXuence across perspective taking contexts. It may be, for
example, that when perspective taking across emotional situations, using self-predictions as a basis for
predicting others is intuitively more appealing—and
may even be automatic (Hodges & Wegner, 1997)—
than when perspective taking across non-emotional
situations.
In conclusion, our Wndings provide support for a recent
assertion that underestimating fear of embarrassment is a
major cause of biased and erroneous social judgment
(Sabini et al., 2001). More generally, to the extent that people underestimate the impact of transient emotions on the
self, others’ emotionally induced behaviors may be misinterpreted as stemming from enduring dispositions (Gilbert
& Mallone, 1995; Jones, 1990; Ross, 1977). We believe
that people’s underestimation of the power of emotion is a
fundamental error in social judgment.
