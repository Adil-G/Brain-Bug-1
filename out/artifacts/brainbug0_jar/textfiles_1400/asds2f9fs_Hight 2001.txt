France has recently seen the arrival of locally produced reality-TV programming in the
form of a series called Loft Story, which borrows heavily from the formula used by the
various national incarnations of Big Brother. In this French variation of the reality
gameshow, eleven (inevitably young and attractive) people volunteered for 70 days to
share a sealed loft which is under constant surveillance by a large number of cameras.
The objective of these volunteers was to successfully pair off with other contestants, in
the hope of surviving weekly elimination votes to become one half of the couple who
ultimately win a dream house. Full Internet coverage of events in the loft was
complemented by nightly summaries on one of the private television networks.
Local reactions to this new series followed a familiar pattern; huge ratings in the wake
of publicity over a number of erotic incidents between a number of the contestants, and
a steady stream of protest from those who were outraged at the programme’s premise
and warned of serious implications for the quality of French television and culture. Apart
from the vocal complaints of critics and commentators, and token warnings over the
programme’s content from France’s broadcasting authority (CSA), the loft-studio itself
attracted direct attacks from bands of protesters who attempted to storm through lines of
riot police with the stated aim of ‘liberating the hostages’ (contestants) and saving
French viewers from the indignity of viewing the tasteless spectacle.
There are obvious differences between this French reaction to this latest addition to
the reality-TV stable and those exhibited throughout other nations—the most obvious
being a wider context of debate over whether or not France will be able to preserve some
sense of cultural identity in the face of a globalized cultural ‘invasion’ that is typically
represented by French intellectuals as a form of American cultural imperialism (and the

prospect of protesters attempting to storm the sets of Big Brother or any other reality-TV
show in Holland, Britain, Australia, the United States, or any of the other countries
which feature similar shows, does seem remote.) Outside of this speci c rhetorical
context, the majority of the critical reactions to French reality-TV largely replicate
similar debates around the globe, debates which echo a number of largely elitist
assumptions not only about the social and political role of television within modern
society, but more especially about the position which audiences occupy in relation to
these cultural forms.
Reality television constitutes one of a long line of media forms which have attracted
negative commentary from critics and commentators, who typically view these developments as the latest attempt by broadcasting (and other media) institutions to pursue a
narrow commercialist agenda, at the expense of maintaining the high standard demanded
by a public service ethic. The same rhetoric is repeated in newspaper editorials, critical
columns and journals, and from a variety of political and cultural commentators who
express alarm at the ‘depths’ to which television, in particular, is seen to have fallen. The
recent popularity of forms such as the talk show, docu-soap and video diary are
invariably viewed as yet further evidence of a widespread ‘dumbing down’ of media
forms and, by extension, that of the mass audience.
The assumptions made about viewers are extremely reminiscent of those stereotypically made about the motivations and viewing practices associated with other ‘suspect’
media forms such as soap operas and video games. The phrase ‘dumbing down’ itself
is usually used to refer to a host of audience traits—viewers are variously assumed to
be lower in intelligence, lacking in judgement and/or taste, unthinking voyeurs, unwitting dupes of commercialist broadcasters, in danger of mistaking reality-TV programmes
for ‘reality’, and essentially in need of being saved from these forms and re-directed
back to traditional authoritative, public service forms such as documentary proper.
There are two points which need to be made about such constructions. Firstly,
assumptions about the psychology of reality-TV viewers are derived from the textual
analysis of the forms themselves, rather than from any comprehensive and coherent
project of audience research. Secondly, the textual analysis which is performed also
typically suffers from the absence of any recognition that new theoretical tools need to
be developed in order to properly understand and critique the signi cance of these new
forms. The notion that fact– ction hybrids such as reality-TV, docu-soaps, talk shows
and reality gameshows may represent a signi cant and apparently permanent break from
the discourses which underlie the documentary genre has been slow to arrive (given that
the  rst of these forms have been around on primetime American network television
since the early 1990s with programmes such as I Witness Video, America’s Most Wanted
and the later Cops).
The largely apocalyptic discourse which hybrid forms have attracted has had little
noticeable impact on the actual viewing  gures of series such as Loft Story and Big
Brother. However, it has had the effect of sti ing meaningful critical debate over the
nature of these new television fact– ction hybrids, by successfully stigmatizing the
viewing of such examples of ‘trash television’. In turn, academics who attempt to study
these proliferating forms can easily be marginalized by the same stigma. Consequently,
much of the reaction to reality hybrids within the academy has tended to reinforce the
narrow and negative perspective which dominates public discourse.
Absent within much of the public ‘debate’ over reality-TV are serious attempts to treat
these forms as complex media constructions—not simply in the sense that these
programmes are complex media texts, but that they are possibly implicated within a

variety of social, economic and political changes which suggest a transformation of
fundamental aspects of modern society. Reality-TV, in other words, may be one of the
more obvious signs of the emergence of a signi cantly different con guration of
individual, state and culture than that envisaged by modernism. Of the books listed
above, Jon Dovey’s Freakshow: First Person Media and Factual Television is the most
useful recent addition to this new theoretical terrain. His book addresses some of the
lapses in theoretical research which to varying degrees shape other recently published
contributions in documentary theory.
The Jon Izod and Richard Kilborn edited collection titled From Grierson to the
Docu-soap: Breaking the Boundaries re ects the gulf which documentary theorists
currently are forced to traverse. The chapters in the book are divided into two sections,
each catering to a very different focus within documentary (not surprising given the
book’s origins as a series of papers presented at a January 1999 University of Stirling
conference also titled ‘Breaking the Boundaries’). The  rst section, titled ‘Grierson’s
Legacy’ is dedicated to the re-examination of documentary’s origins and early development, largely through the work of pioneering  lmmaker John Grierson. These chapters
present a variety of perspectives on documentary ‘tradition’, and many attempt to
deconstruct the in uence which the Griersonian de nition of the genre has had on its
development within contexts such as Britain, Canada and Australia. Collectively,
however, they also represent an emphasis on re-treading and extending well-established
theoretical territory. This is an area of documentary theory which has tended to react
with a good degree of uncertainty toward the new hybrid forms, precisely because they
violate many of the central tenets of conventional documentary that Grierson himself
sought (not unproblematically) to promote.
The second section is titled ‘The Changing Culture of British Television’, a phrase
which suggests some of the intentions of the various authors to detail the nature and
signi cance of recent developments in documentary practice (or least as they apply to
the British context). The book implicitly acknowledges the strength of critical sentiment
against these popular forms by attempting to position itself as occupying a middle
ground—moving beyond a simple rejection of hybrid forms as ‘trash television’, while
still acknowledging the enormous implications that their success has for the ways in
which documentaries are made, and received by audiences. Both the subtitle and the
editors’ general introduction to the book demonstrate some of the theoretical hedging
that this involves. The phrase ‘breaking the boundaries’, for example, assumes that new
forms are perhaps transgressing and violating the accepted ontological parameters of
documentary. However, the introduction also describes the new programming as ‘reinvigorating the old genre’, despite the dangers posed by a commercialist-dominated
broadcasting agenda. The editors refer repeatedly to the ‘dumbing down’ argument,
while attempting to position themselves outside of its implications—and certainly the
papers in the collection which deal directly with the new hybrids offer a more complex
perspective than this position allows. The strength of these contributions lies particularly
in their acceptance that documentary is not a static genre, but is continually infused with
new  lmmaking practices—practices which are themselves closely associated with a
variety of social, economic and technological changes within the wider society. Instead
of viewing new forms as a threat to an assumed privileged genre, the more interesting
of these authors regard hybrid forms as a signi cant development that needs to be
examined from a variety of perspectives.
Richard Kilborn’s own contribution (‘The docu-soap: a critical assessment’) narrowly
places the emergence of hybrid forms purely within the context of an increasingly

<-----Page 3----->392

competitive commercial environment. He notes especially that the new forms’ domination of primetime means that traditional documentary, and hence also the investigative
and critical  lmmaking skills which documentary has relied upon, are becoming
marginalized. He outlines both the detailed defence which producers have had to make
of docu-soap series, and the number of critiques that have been directed toward this
particular form. And his conclusion not only looks toward the future in the hope that
audiences will become exhausted with the current wave of docu-soaps, but also notes
that the success of the form seems to have inspired a reciprocal growth in  ctional series
with a similar sense of dramatic reality.
Kilborn also includes an acknowledgement of the paucity of detailed evidence on the
variety of ways in which audiences engage with hybrid forms, a fact which other authors
in the collection acknowledge either directly or indirectly. Audience research remains the
one signi cant unexplored area not only of hybrid forms but also of documentary as a
whole. Many of the assumptions that are made about the signi cance of documentary are
derived from assertions about the ways in which audiences interact with the genre that
may not necessarily be incorrect, but which are quite de nitely not based on a wide and
comprehensive body of ethnographic research. This absence has meant that critics of
hybrid forms have been able to draw upon the abstract ideal of documentary’s social and
political role that is constructed by documentary theorists, in order to construct a
dichotomy between the traditional genre and the new forms. In this regard, Annette
Hill’s chapter reporting on research into audience’s discussions of their viewing of these
forms (‘Fearful and safe: audience response to British reality programming’) is a useful
exploration into the ef cacy of the terms of the debate over hybrid forms.
Hill outlines  ndings from a small part of the BFI Audience Tracking Study
conducted from 1991 to 1996, and she is quite open in her intention to critically examine
the complaints that reality-TV critics make on behalf of the audience. Her  ndings
provide a number of rebuttals to the ‘dumbing down’ assumptions outlined above. For
example, she highlights both the attractiveness of the hybrids’ combination of entertainment and information to viewers, and also the ease with which they could distinguish
between these two aspects. However, Hill also argues that viewers were quite aware of
the critical discourse against hybrid forms, and provides examples where viewers
apparently felt that they needed to exaggerate the positive features of the programmes
they enjoyed, as a defensive rhetoric against this critical discourse. In this sense, her
work is an important indication of the extent to which critical debates over television
programming also shape audience’s assumptions about the value or otherwise of their
own viewing practices. The real absence within Hill’s chapter is the sense of a strong
theoretical framework within which she can offer a more complete critique of the
discourse against hybrid forms. That task is left to other contributors, such as Michael
Chanan’s exploration of hybrid forms’ relationship to the development of a new public
space (this is a concept which is explored at length by Dovey, as outlined below).
Stella Bruzzi’s New Documentary: a Critical Introduction is another recent offering
that incorporates some discussion of hybrid forms, in this case as part of a wider
re-examination of a variety of theoretical issues that she collapses into the term
‘documentary theory’. Bruzzi’s stated intention is to update documentary theory to
account for texts produced in the 1980s and 1990s. At the centre of her argument is the
notion that documentary is distinguished by a tension between an assertion that a ‘pure’
relationship between image and reality is achievable, and an acceptance that some form
of mediation is inevitable whenever documentary texts are constructed.
This is a more than useful idea with which to examine recent examples of factual

<-----Page 4----->Debating Reality-TV

393

forms, and Bruzzi is most convincing when she illustrates her perspective through textual
analysis. Her discussion of  lmmakers Nick Broom eld, Molly Dineen and Nicholas
Barker explores in detail the negotiations which documentary makers make with their
subjects—and the variety of ways in which these directors, in particular, incorporate an
open acknowledgment of their mediation into the texts themselves. And her detailed
discussion of a number of key British docu-soaps, and her detailed exploration of the
work of director Chris Terrill, in particular, develops a useful analysis of the strong
relationship between observational documentaries and docu-soaps. Her discussion treads
an interesting path between making a case for docu-soap as the natural successor of the
observational mode, and attempting to identify the points of real difference between the
forms.
Unfortunately, Bruzzi’s attempts to develop a more coherent theoretical discussion are
undermined by a frustratingly narrow reading of key documentary theorists. Bruzzi is
extremely keen to present New Documentary in opposition to the established core of
documentary theory and, in particular, to move beyond a  xed canon of key documentary texts. This is a worthy enterprise, as many of the other writers discussed here also
acknowledge the need to develop new theoretical tools in order to approach especially
the new hybrid forms. Where Bruzzi fails, however, is to convincingly demonstrate an
understanding of the writings of theorists such as Bill Nichols (with the seminal texts
Representing Reality (1991) and Blurred Boundaries (1994)). She does not appear to
have a great deal of familiarity with the depth of documentary theory, and consequently
her effort to develop a new perspective unfortunately tends to re-tread already well-established theoretical territory.
In her discussion of Nichols’ still very useful framework of ‘documentary modes’, for
example, she reduces his introduction of terms such as expositional, interactive, observational, re exive and performative to an evolutionary path in which each mode simply
replaces and obscures the next. Where Nichols suggests a set of terms which identify
different modes of mediation, then invites readers to examine how these modes operate
together within individual texts, Bruzzi insists on seeing each mode as a straitjacket in
which she complains that she cannot distinguish between two different texts. She reduces
Nichols’ attempt to develop theoretical tools for the analysis of a dynamic genre to what
she terms a ‘family tree’ structure in which none of the modes overlap or inform each
other (except in terms of succession).
Bruzzi’s construction of a ‘straw man’ at the centre of documentary theory provides
her with suf cient justi cation for declaring that this  eld is in serious need of repair,
and that she is able to offer insights of which earlier theorists are regrettably ignorant.
This is obviously a more than useful rhetorical strategy, as it allows her to, for example,
claim a degree of innovation in her exploration of the mediations of reality which lies
at the heart of all observational forms. Bruzzi argues that earlier theorists were
effectively captured by the naõ¨ve rhetoric offered by the directors of early observational
forms (direct cinema in particular) and retains a belief in the future possibility of an
idealized ‘pure’ form of documentary. What is particularly frustrating about Bruzzi’s
argument is that she then performs the exact reductionist exercise that she accuses
previous theorists of performing. Docu-soap, in Bruzzi’s terms, is an ‘evolution of the
observational mode’—a phrase which not only acknowledges the usefulness of Nichols’
term as a theoretical tool, but collapses docu-soap into the same ‘family tree’ construct
that she insists is inherent in his work.
In comparison with Bruzzi’s attempts at theory, Jon Dovey’s Freakshow: First Person
Media and Factual Television almost appears as a revelatory text. Dovey’s work is an

<-----Page 5----->394

C. Hight

extremely detailed and useful attempt to reconstruct documentary theory in response to
the rapid proliferation of forms such as talk shows, docu-soaps, reality gameshows and
the host of other forms which fall under the reality-TV umbrella. Freakshow quite
comprehensively essentially lays the groundwor k for a new theoretical approach to these
hybrid forms, not only providing a complex sense of their distinctiveness as media
forms, but also suggesting a critical framework which engages with these forms as both
symptoms of, and contributors to, signi cant wider social, political and economic
changes.
The overall argument offered by Dovey is that hybrid forms represent a signi cant
break from modernist assumptions about the wider relationships between the individual,
the state and the documentary genre. He suggests that hybrid forms are worthy of study,
in particular, because they are one of a number of media forms which are implicated in
the effort to present intimate and explicitly subjective forms of knowledge. Central to
this discussion is the careful development of the argument that these forms, and in a
wider sense much of public television, suggest a radical recon guration of the relationship between ‘private’ and ‘public’, one in which personal knowledge becomes prioritized over institutionalized public knowledges as the most authentic and ‘true’
representation of reality.
The term ‘freakshow’ is used by Dovey to describe the overall agenda of hybrid
forms, but he is quick to emphasize that he does not use this term in a pejorative sense.
Instead, he views the carnivalesque quality of recent factual forms as the key to
understanding how they break from earlier documentary texts—they expand the range of
personal voices that are available within public television beyond the mainstream into
areas of society that are typically marginalized. Dovey’s argument, however, is not a
simple reiteration of the naõ¨ve notion that hybrids represent a democratizing of the media
sphere (in fact, this is a position he deliberately criticizes). Instead, he argues that ‘ rst
person media’ such as the ‘popular ethnography’ of docu-soap, the personalized public
address of video diaries and the confessional edge of talk shows all represent a
signi cant break from traditional notions of the ‘public sphere’.
Dovey draws, in particular, upon the work of Foucault and Habermas to begin the task
of rede ning the term itself in his  nal chapter. His argument here is dif cult to reduce
to a few sentences, but it involves an acknowledgment of the dialectical relationship
between television and the space available for social and political discourse, within a
wider understanding of the systemic implications of neo-liberalism. This is developed
into a discussion on the implications for such a space if it is predicated on subjective
forms of knowledge. His conclusion insists on the signi cance of the break that hybrid
forms entail, while also calling for producers to allow for an expansion of the current
limited nature of these forms, in order to explore the full potential of this new space.
Dovey’s wider arguments regarding the transformation of the public sphere are
grounded initially in the analysis of  lms by Ross McElwee, Michael Moore, Alan
Berliner and Nick Broom eld. In a much more persuasive argument than that offered by
Bruzzi, Dovey incorporates a feminist reading into a discussion of the work of these
 lmmakers, in order to demonstrate that Nichols’ notions of interactive and re exive are
not suf cient to investigate their works’ wider social meaning. Further chapters detail the
signi cance of video technology to the development of hybrid forms, and cover areas as
diverse as video pornography , reality-TV, talk shows and docu-soaps. Each area of
textual analysis provides a number of contentious arguments that are not always
suf ciently detailed to stand on their own, but Dovey’s intention is to force an
acknowledgment from the reader of an overall complexity to hybrid forms that bolsters

<-----Page 6----->Debating Reality-TV

395

his argument that they both represent a distinct break from earlier factual forms, and that
current documentary theory is lacking many of the theoretical tools to approach these
forms properly.
Dovey’s textual analysis is particularly interesting in terms of his acknowledgement
of the role which pleasure plays in the construction of new forms. His analysis of
reality-TV couches this focus within a wider examination of the failing of current critical
and theoretical discourses centred on hybrid forms. He deconstructs in turn the notion
that these forms represent ‘trash TV’, the claim that they are evidence of a stronger
public sphere incorporating more everyday voices, and the post-modernist insistence that
they represent the erasure of the referential in popular culture.
Dovey’s work illustrates very clearly the urgency of the task of re-evaluating key
concepts within documentary theory—and, in particular, the need to develop either new
understandings of the terrain that documentary covers, or a reconsideration of whether
the term ‘documentary’ itself needs to be jettisoned when discussing hybrid forms.
Freakshow also points to two neglected areas of research within this  eld—audience
research and the investigation of on-line factual forms. Dovey is open about the
dif culties of not basing his theoretical framework on a body of research into viewers’
interpretations of hybrid forms (he does refer brie y to the BFI audience project
presented by Annette Hill, discussed above). His solution is occasionally to offer his own
subjective interpretations and to discuss them in relation to his textual analysis. While,
as he states, this is an interesting demonstration of the prioritizing of the subjective that
is at the centre of his argument, the absence of wider audience research inevitably places
much of Dovey’s analysis into the area of speculation. As suggested above, this follows
a long tradition within documentary theory of neglecting to incorporate the complexity
of audience responses into the analysis of factual texts. If Dovey is correct in his
argument that there is a signi cant shift in the manner in which audiences engage with
both these forms and documentary as a whole, this then poses the paradox that any
current research will itself be hampered by the lack of any previous body of knowledge
to use as a basis for comparison.
