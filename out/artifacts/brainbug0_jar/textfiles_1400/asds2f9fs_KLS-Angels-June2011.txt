<-----Page 0----->The Consequences of Entrepreneurial Finance:
Evidence from Angel Financings

William R. Kerr, Josh Lerner, and Antoinette Schoar*

Abstract: This paper documents that ventures that are funded by two successful angel groups
experience superior outcomes to those that are rejected: they have improved survival, exits,
employment levels, patenting, web traffic, and financing. We use strong discontinuities in the
funding behavior of angels over small changes in their collective interest levels to implement a
regression discontinuity approach. We confirm the positive effect of angel financing on most
operations of the venture, with qualitative support for a higher likelihood of successful exits. On
the other hand, there is no difference in access to additional financing around the discontinuity.
This might suggest that financing is not a central input of angel groups.

<-----Page 1----->One of the central and more enduring questions in the entrepreneurial finance literature is
to what extent early-stage financiers such as angels or venture funds have a real impact on the
firms in which they invest. An extensive theoretical literature suggests the combination of
intensive monitoring, provision of value added services, and powerful control rights in these
types of deals should alleviate agency problems between entrepreneurs and institutional
investors.1 This bundle of inputs, it is argued, leads to improved governance and operations in
portfolio firms, lower capital constraints, and ultimately stronger firm growth and performance.
The empirical documentation of this impact, however, has been challenging. Hellmann
and Puri (2000) provide a first detailed comparison of the growth path of firms backed by
venture financing with those that are not.2 This approach, however, faces the natural challenge
that unobserved heterogeneity across entrepreneurs, such as ability or ambition, might drive the
growth path of the firms as well as the venture capitalists‘ decisions to invest. The question
remains whether seed-stage investors have a causal impact on the performance of start-ups or
whether their main role is to select firms that have better inherent growth opportunities. These
problems are particularly acute for evaluating early-stage investments that are opaque by their
very nature.
An alternative approach has been to find exogenous shocks to venture financing at the
industry or regional levels. Examples of such shocks are public policy changes (Kortum and
Lerner, 2000), variations in endowment returns (Samila and Sorenson, 2010), and differences in
state pension funding levels (Mollica and Zingales, 2007). These studies, however, can only
examine the impact of entrepreneurial finance at an aggregate level, which resembles a ―needle

<-----Page 2----->in the haystack‖ challenge, given the very modest share that high-potential firms represent of all
economic activity.
This paper takes a fresh look at the question of whether entrepreneurial financiers affect
the success and growth of new ventures. We focus on a neglected segment of entrepreneurial
finance: angel investments. Angel investors have received much less attention than venture
capitalists, despite the fact that some estimates suggest that these investors are as important for
high-potential start-up investments as venture capital firms (Goldfarb et al., 2007; Shane, 2008;
Sudek et al., 2008). Angel investors are increasingly structured as semi-formal networks of highnet-worth individuals, often former entrepreneurs themselves, who meet in regular intervals
(often over a monthly breakfast or dinner) to hear aspiring entrepreneurs pitch their business
plans. The angels then decide whether to conduct further due diligence and ultimately whether to
invest in some of these deals as subgroups of members. Similar to venture capitalists, angel
groups often adopt a very hands-on role in the deals they invest in and provide entrepreneurs
with advice and contacts.
In addition to their inherent interest as funders of early-stage companies, angel
investment groups have an advantage for researchers over other venture funders in that they
make their investment decisions through well-documented processes and, in some cases, formal
votes.3 This allows us to observe the level of support or lack thereof for the deals that come
before the angel groups.4

3

By way of contrast, the venture firms that we talked to all employ a consensual process, in which controversial
proposals are withdrawn before coming up for a formal vote or disagreements are resolved in conversations before
the actual voting takes place. In addition, venture firms also rarely document the detailed voting behind their
decisions. Angel group members, in contrast, often express their interest for deals independently from one another
and based upon personal assessment.
4
Our paper is closest in spirit to work in the entrepreneurial finance literature on the investment selection process
and returns of venture capitalists. Sorensen (2007) assesses the returns to being funded by different tiers of investors.
Our work instead focuses on the margin of obtaining initial funding or not. Kaplan and Strömberg (2004) and

2

<-----Page 3----->Our analysis exploits very detailed, deal-level data of startups that pitched to two
prominent angel investment groups (Tech Coast Angels and CommonAngels) during the 20012006 period. These organizations generously provided us access to confidential records of the
companies who approached them, the level of angel interest, the financing decisions made, and
the subsequent venture outcomes. The dataset allows us to compare funded and unfunded
ventures that approached the same investor. Furthermore, we use the interest levels expressed by
the angels to form specialized treatment and control groups that have similar qualities.5
In addition, our data allow us to go further towards confirming a causal relationship by
using a regression discontinuity approach (Lee and Lemieux, 2010).6 Within the quality ranges
that we analyze, there exists a discrete jump in the probability of venture funding as interest
accumulates around a deal. This discontinuity is due to how critical mass develops within angel
groups around prospective deals.
We identify from the data the threshold where a critical mass of angels emerges around a
deal. Our approach compares firms that fall just above this threshold with the firms that fall just
below. The underlying identification relies on firms around the cut-off level having very similar
ex ante characteristics, in which case we can confirm the causal effect of obtaining angel
financing. After showing the ex ante comparability of the ventures in the border region, we
examine differences in their long-run performance. In this way, we can employ micro-data on
Kaplan et al. (2009) examine characteristics and dimensions that venture capitalists rely on when making investment
decisions. Goldfarb et al. (2007) and Conti et al. (2010) consider choices between angels and venture investors.
5
Thus, our work encompasses many of the matching traits used by prior work—industry, employment levels and
growth rates, age, etc.—but also captures better the motivations of entrepreneurs (i.e., the control group also
approached the investor at the same time as the treatment group) and the underlying qualities of the ventures (i.e.,
the angels rated the ventures comparably at the time of their pitch). To illustrate these gains more graphically,
consider the case of Twitter (which is not part of our sample). Researchers can observe that Twitter is four years old,
has approximately 300 employees (http://twitter.com/about, accessed December 20, 2010), is growing rapidly in
terms of employment but not revenue, is located in Silicon Valley, and so on. But even with this information set, it is
very hard to identify companies to which one should compare Twitter. Our data allow us to compare funded
ventures to others that the same sophisticated investors thought comparable at the time of the investment pitch.

While common in economics, this approach is underutilized in finance. Exceptions include Rauh (2006),
Chernenko and Sunderam (2009), and Bakke and Whited (2010).

<-----Page 4----->firm outcomes, while further minimizing the problem of unobserved heterogeneity between the
funded and rejected transactions.
Several clear patterns emerge from our analysis: first, and not surprisingly, the interest
levels expressed by angels in deals are a substantial factor in funding decisions. Second, when
we compare firms that received funding to those that did not within a narrow quality range, the
funded firms overall look more successful than those that pitched to the angel group but did not
receive financing: they are 20%-25% more likely to survive for at least four years (or until
December 2010, the last date of our data). They are also 9%-11% more likely to undergo a
successful exit (IPO or acquisition) and 16%-19% more likely to have either reached a successful
exit or grown to 75 employees by December 2010. Funded companies have 16-20 more
employees as of 2010, are 16%-18% more likely to have a granted patent, and are growing faster
as measured through web traffic performance between 2008 and 2010. In addition, funded
companies are better financed. Overall, they have a 70% higher likelihood of obtaining
entrepreneurial finance and have on average a little less than two additional financing rounds.
These subsequent deals are often syndicated by the angel group with other venture financiers.
These results are developed using ventures that fall within a narrow quality range. We
also demonstrate that the impact of angel funding on firm outcomes would be overstated if we
look at the full distribution of ventures that approach the angel groups, since there is a clear
correlation between initial venture quality and likelihood of funding. Using several techniques
(e.g., matched samples, modeling angel interest as a covariate), we estimate that one would
overstate the measured effects by about 25% if using the full distribution of deals that
approached the investors. This emphasizes the importance and challenge of creating proper
control groups in entrepreneurial finance studies.

4

<-----Page 5----->Our third set of findings considers ventures just above and below the funding threshold
using the regression discontinuity methodology, which removes the endogeneity of funding and
other omitted variable biases if ventures just below and above the funding threshold are
otherwise very similar. We confirm several of our prior findings: ventures just above the
threshold are more likely to survive, and they have superior operations in terms of employee
counts, patenting, and web traffic growth. We also find qualitative support that funded ventures
achieved a successful exit by December 2010, but these results are not statistically significant.
This latter difference may suggest that the angel groups select on ventures with quicker exit
prospects, which are not captured in our initial interest measures.
Interestingly, we do not find an impact of angel funding on follow-on financing when
using the regression discontinuity approach. This difference to the estimates based on a simple
comparison between funded and non-funded firms may suggest that access to additional
financing is not essential for the success of angel-funded firms just above the threshold. But
when looking at the full distribution of funded versus non-funded ventures, the positive selection
bias of receiving angel funding translates into a higher likelihood of follow-on funding. This
result might also underline that, in the time period we study, prior angel financing was not an
essential prerequisite to accessing follow-on funding.
In a final step, we compare the returns of the venture capital industry to that of one of the
angel groups. A natural concern is that these investments are by angels who are not professional
investors, and thus their decisions and voting may be shaped by factors other than economic
considerations (e.g., the joy of working with start-up companies). While our project focuses on
the consequences of financing for start-up ventures, this additional analysis helps confirm that

5

<-----Page 6----->the investments were warranted for the angel group as a whole. We find that the angel group
performed as well as the venture capital industry overall during the period of study.
Thus, this paper provides new evidence about an essential question in entrepreneurial
finance. We quantify the positive impact that these two angel groups had on the companies that
they funded by simultaneously exploiting novel, rich micro-data and addressing concerns about
unobserved heterogeneity. We should note, however, that the angel groups that we worked with
for this project are two of the largest and most established groups in the country. They are both
professionally managed, and at least one group performed as well as the venture industry as a
whole during the period we study. Given the substantial heterogeneity across angel investors, the
magnitude of the impact that we estimate is likely to be at the upper end of the angel population.
We hope that future research can further quantify the extent to which other angel investment
groups and individual investors aid start-up ventures.
The plan of this paper is as follows. Section 1 reviews the angel group investment
process. Section 2 introduces our angel investment data and describes our methodology. Section
3 introduces our outcomes data. Section 4 presents the analysis. Section 5 evaluates the portfolio
returns for one of the angel groups. The final section concludes the paper.

1. The Angel Group Investment Process
Angel investors are high-net-worth individuals that make private investments in start-up
companies with their own money. While angel investors have a long history (e.g., Lamoreaux et
al., 2004), angel groups are a quite recent phenomenon. Beginning in the mid-1990s, angels
began forming groups to collectively evaluate and invest in entrepreneurial ventures. These
groups are seen as having several advantages by the angels. First, angels can pool their capital to

6

<-----Page 7----->make larger investments than they could otherwise fund alone. Second, each angel can invest
smaller amounts in individual ventures, allowing participation in more opportunities and the
diversification of investment risks. They can also undertake costly due diligence of prospective
investments as a group, reducing the burdens for individual members. Fourth, these groups are
generally more visible to entrepreneurs and thus receive a superior deal flow. Finally, the groups
frequently include some of the most sophisticated and active angel investors in a given region,
which results in superior decision-making.
The Angel Capital Association (ACA) lists 300 U.S. groups in its database. The average
ACA angel group had 42 member angels and invested a total of $1.94 million in 7.3 deals in
2007. Between 10,000 and 15,000 angels are believed to belong to angel groups in the U.S.7
Angel groups follow mostly similar templates. Entrepreneurs typically begin the process
by submitting to the group an application that may also include a copy of their business plan or
executive summary. The firms, after an initial screening by the staff, are then invited to give a
short presentation to a small group of members, followed by a question-and-answer session.
Promising companies are then invited to present at a monthly meeting (often a breakfast or
dinner). The presenting companies that generate the greatest interest then enter a due diligence
review process by a smaller group of angel members, although the extent to which due diligence
and screening leads or follows the formal presentation varies across groups. If all goes well, this
process results in an investment one to three months after the presentation. Figure 1 provides a
detailed template for Tech Coast Angels (Sudek et al., 2008).

<-----Page 8----->2. Angel Group Data and Empirical Methodology
This section jointly introduces our data and empirical methodology. The discussion is
organized around the two groups from which we have obtained large datasets. The unique
features of each investment group, their venture selection procedures, and their data records
require that we employ conceptually similar, but operationally different, techniques for
identifying group-specific discontinuities. We commence with Tech Coast Angels, the larger of
our two investment groups, and we devote extra time in this first data description to also
conveying our empirical approach and the biases it is meant to address. We then describe our
complementary approach with CommonAngels and how we ultimately join the two groups
together to analyze their joint behavior.

2.1. Tech Coast Angels
Tech Coast Angels is a large angel investment group based in southern California. They
have over 300 angels in five chapters and seek high-growth investments in a variety of high-tech
and low-tech industries. The group typically looks for funding opportunities of $1 million or less.
Additional details on this venture group are available at http://www.techcoastangels.com/.8
Tech Coast Angels kindly provided us with access to their database regarding prospective
ventures under explicit restrictions that the confidentiality of individual ventures and angels
remain secure. For our study, this database was exceptional in that it allowed us to fully observe
the deal flow of Tech Coast Angels: it has detailed information about many of the companies that
were and were not funded by Tech Coast Angels. Our analysis considers ventures that

8

Tech Coast Angels grows from two to four chapters during our period of study, with 30-40 active angels on
average per chapter. Appendix Table 1 provides additional details.

8

<-----Page 9----->approached Tech Coast Angels between 2001 and 2006: as of early 2007, there were over 2500
ventures in the database.
We first document in Table 1 the distribution of interest from the angel investors across
the full set of potential deals. This description sets the stage for identifying a narrower group of
firms around a funding discontinuity that offers a better approach for evaluating the
consequences of angel financing. Table 2 then evaluates the ex ante comparability of deals
around the border, which is essential for the identification strategy.
The central variable for the Tech Coast Angel analysis is the count of the number of
angels expressing interest in a given deal. This indication of interest does not represent a
financial commitment, but instead expresses a belief that the venture should be pursued further
by the group. The decision to invest ultimately depends upon three factors: one or more angels
being strong champions of the deal, the support of the professional manager, and a critical mass
of angels being willing to fund the venture as a group. While we do not observe the champions
of the deals, we do have a unique window into how funding relates to obtaining a critical mass of
interested angels.
Table 1 documents the distribution of deals and angel interest levels. The first three
columns of Table 1 show 64% of ventures receive no interest at all. Moreover, 90% of all
ventures receive interest from fewer than ten angels. This narrowing funnel continues until the
highest bracket, where there are 44 firms that receive interest from 35 or more angels. 15
ventures receive the interest of 50 angels or more. This funnel shares many of the anecdotal traits
of venture funding—such as selecting a few worthy ventures out of thousands of business
plans—but it is exceptionally rare to have the interest level documented consistently throughout
the distribution and independent of actual funding outcomes.

9

<-----Page 10----->The shape of this funnel has several potential interpretations. It may reflect heterogeneity
in quality among companies that are being pitched to the angels. It could also reflect simple
industry differences across ventures. For example, the average software venture may receive
greater interest than a medical devices company if there are more angels within the group
involved in the software industry. There could also be an element of herding around ―hot deals‖.
But independent of what exactly drives this investment behavior of angels, we want to explore
whether there are discontinuities in interest levels such that small changes in the number of
angels expressing interest among otherwise comparable deals results in material shifts in the
probability of funding.
The central idea behind this identification strategy is that angel interest in ventures does
not map one-to-one into quality differences across ventures, which we verify empirically below.
Instead, there is some randomness or noise in why some firms receive n votes and others receive
n+1. It is reasonable to believe that there are enough idiosyncrasies in the preferences and beliefs
of angels that the interest count does not present a perfect ranking of the quality of the
underlying firms. Certainly, the 2% of ventures with 35 or more interested angels are not
comparable to the 64% of ventures with zero interest. But, we will show that ventures with 18
votes and 22 votes are much more comparable, except that the latter group is much more likely
to be funded.
We thus need to demonstrate two patterns. First, we need to identify where in the
distribution small changes in interest level lead to a critical mass of angels, and thus a substantial
increase in funding probability. As Tech Coast Angels does not have explicit funding rules that
yield a mandated cut-off, we must identify from observed behavior where de facto breaks exist.

10

<-----Page 11----->We then need to show that deals immediately above and below this threshold appear similar at
the time that they approached Tech Coast Angels.
To investigate the first part, the last column of Table 1 documents the fraction of ventures
in each interest group that are ultimately funded by Tech Coast Angels. None of the ventures
with zero interest are funded, whereas over 40% of deals in the highest interest category are. The
rise in funding probability with interest level is monotonic, excepting some small fluctuations at
high interest levels. Ventures with high interest levels can remain unfunded by Tech Coast
Angels for multiple reasons: e.g., the subsequent due diligence process turns up poor
information, the parties cannot agree upon deal terms, and the start-up chooses to take financing
elsewhere and withdraws.
There is a very stark jump in funding probability between interest levels of 15-19 angels
and 20-24 angels, where the funded share increases from 17% to 38%. This represents a distinct
and permanent shift in the relationship between funding and interest levels. We thus identify this
point as our discontinuity for Tech Coast Angels. In most of what follows, we discard deals that
are far away from this threshold, focusing on the region around the border. This restriction
prepares us for the border discontinuity exercise, but it is also warranted because the quality and
funding prospects for ventures are most comparable in this region. Operationally, the narrower
range of the quality distribution is also needed for many of our outcome variables since
collecting records for unfunded ventures is very challenging.
We specifically drop the 90% of deals with fewer than ten interested angels and the 44
deals with very high interest levels. We designate our ―above border‖ group as those ventures

11

<-----Page 12----->with interest levels of 20-34 angels; our ―below border‖ group is defined as ventures with
interest levels of 10-19 angels.9
Appendix Table 1 provides further details on Tech Coast Angels‘ selection process by
year. Our choice of a raw angel count to designate the funding border, while the overall angel
network is growing in size, reflects two considerations. First, and most important, angels invest
as subgroups of members once sufficient interest is achieved. Thus, comparisons to the overall
size of the network are less important than actual counts of angels interested in participating in a
deal. Second, and more operationally, the growth in Tech Coast Angels is mainly through new
chapters. While angels can be involved in deals in other chapters, statistics like the count of
active angels per chapter, the average interest level in a funded deal, and the share of ventures
funded by Tech Coast Angels across years are quite stable despite the changes in the absolute
size of the network. These factors suggest that the time-invariant bar is the most appropriate.
Having identified from the data the border discontinuity, we now verify the second
requirement that ventures above and below the border are ex ante comparable except in the
probability that they received funding from Tech Coast Angels. This step is necessary to assert
that we have identified a quasi-exogenous component to angel investing that is not merely
reflecting underlying quality differences among the firms. Once established, a comparison of the
outcomes of above border versus below border ventures will provide strong confirmation of the
role of angel financing in venture success as their initial qualities are very similar.
Before assessing this comparability, we make two sample adjustments. First, to allow us
to later jointly analyze our two investment groups, we restrict the sample to ventures that

9

There is also a discrete step in funding probability around having ten or more interested angels, relative to having
5-9 interested angels. This margin would be interesting to study as well, but it is operationally quite difficult as the
information collected for the typical unfunded venture declines at lower interest levels (e.g., due diligence reviews
are not undertaken). We set the lower bound for our study to be above this threshold of ten angels being interested.

12

<-----Page 13----->approached Tech Coast Angels in the 2001-2006 period. This restriction also allows us a
minimum horizon of four years for measuring outcomes. Second, we remove cases where the
funding opportunity is withdrawn from consideration by the venture itself. These withdrawn
deals are mainly due to ventures being funded by venture capital firms (i.e., the venture courted
multiple financiers simultaneously). As these deals do not fit well into our conceptual experiment
of the benefits and costs of receiving or being denied angel funding, it is best to omit them from
the sample. Our final sample includes 87 firms from Tech Coast Angels, with 46 ventures being
above the border and 41 below. 45 of the 87 ventures are funded by Tech Coast Angels.
Table 2 shows that the characteristics of ventures above and below the funding threshold
are very similar to one another ex ante. If our empirical approach is correct, the randomness in
how localized interest develops will result in the observable characteristics of firms immediately
above and below the threshold not being statistically different. Table 2 documents this
comparability across a number of venture characteristics. Columns 2 and 3 present the means of
the above border and below border groups, respectively. The fourth column tests for the equality
of the means, with the t-tests allowing for unequal variance.
The two border groups are very comparable in terms of venture traits, industries, and
venture stages. The first four rows show that basic characteristics like the amount of funding
requested, the documents provided by the venture to the angels, and the firm‘s number of
managers and employees are not materially different for the firms above and below the
discontinuity. The same is true for industry composition and stage of the business (e.g., whether
the firm is in the idea stage, in its initial marketing and product development stage, or already
revenue generating). We report two-tailed tests for simplicity; differences in means for all traits
are not significant at a 10% level in one-tailed tests in either direction as well. Pearson Chi

13

<-----Page 14----->Squared probabilities for the latter two distributions are 0.831 and 0.534, respectively. For all of
these traits, the null hypothesis that the two groups are similar is not rejected.10
While there are no observable differences in the characteristics of the ventures in the first
three panels, the fourth panel of Table 2 shows that there are significant differences in how
angels engage with ventures above and below the cut-off. With just a small adjustment in interest
levels, angels assemble many more documents regarding the venture (evidence of due diligence),
have more discussion points in their database about the opportunity, and ultimately are 60%
more likely to fund the venture. All of these differences are statistically significant. This supports
our identifying hypothesis that there is a non-linear change in the provision of resources from the
angel group around the cut-off. This will allow us to identify the effect of the bundle of inputs
that the angels provide, holding constant the underlying quality of the firms around the cut-off.

2.2. CommonAngels
CommonAngels is a leading angel investment group in Boston, Massachusetts. They
have over 70 angels seeking high-growth investments in high-tech industries. The group
typically looks for funding opportunities between $500 thousand and $5 million. Additional
details on this venture group are available at http://www.commonangels.com.11
CommonAngels kindly provided us with access to their database regarding prospective
ventures under explicit restrictions that the confidentiality of individual ventures and angels
remain secure. The complete database for CommonAngels as of early 2007 contains over 2000
ventures. Unlike the Tech Coast Angels data, however, CommonAngels does not record interest

10

Despite the power of these tests, we recognize that there are limits to what we can discern regarding the ventures.
Most important, soft features (e.g., quality perceptions of management team) may systematically vary in ways not
captured by our data.
11
CommonAngels had about 50 members throughout our period of study, before expanding to 70 in recent years.

14

<-----Page 15----->for all deals. We thus cannot explicitly construct a distribution similar to Table 1. Nevertheless,
the funnel process is again such that a small fraction of ventures receive funding (2-3%). A little
under 30% of ventures that reach the pitch stage with CommonAngels receive funding.
CommonAngels does, however, conduct a paper-based poll of members following
pitches at its monthly breakfast meetings. Most important, attending angels give the venture an
overall score. Angels also provide comments about ventures and potential investments they
might make in the company. Figure 2 provides a recent evaluation sheet. We focus on the overall
score provided by angels for the venture as this metric is collected on a consistent basis
throughout the sample period.
CommonAngels provided us with the original ballots for all pitches between 2001 and
2006. After dropping two poor quality records, our sample has 63 pitches in total. One potential
approach would be to order deals by the average interest levels of angels attending the pitch. We
find, however, that the information content in this measure is limited. Instead, the data strongly
suggest that the central funding discontinuity exists around the share of attending angels that
award a venture an extremely high score. During the six years covered, CommonAngels used
both a five and ten point scale. It is extremely rare that an angel awards a perfect score to a pitch.
The breaking point for funding instead exists around the share of attending angels that award the
pitch 90% or more of the maximum score (that is, 4.5 out of 5, 9 out of 10). This is close in spirit
to the dichotomous expression of interest in the Tech Coast Angels database.
Some simple statistics describe the non-linear effect. Of the 63 pitches, 14 ventures
receive a 90% or above score from at least one angel; no deal receives such a score from more
than 40% of attending angels. Of these 14 deals, 7 deals are ultimately funded by
CommonAngels. Of the 49 other deals, only 11 are funded. This stark discontinuity is not present

15

<-----Page 16----->when looking at lower cut-offs for interest levels. For example, all but 12 ventures receive at
least one vote that is 80% of the maximum score (that is, 4 out of 5, 8 out of 10). There is no
further material difference in funding probability based upon receiving more or fewer 80% votes.
The same applies to lower cut-offs for interest levels.
We restrict the sample to the 43 deals that have at least 20% of the attending angels
giving the presentation a score that is 80% of the maximum possible score or above. As a
specific example, a venture is retained after presenting to a breakfast meeting of 30 angels if at
least six of those angels score the venture as 8 out of 10 or higher. This step removes the weakest
presentations and ventures. We then define our border groups based upon the share of attending
angels that give the venture a score greater than or equal to 90% of the maximum possible score.
To continue our example, a venture is considered above border if it garners six or more angels
awarding the venture 9 out of 10 or better. A venture with only five angels at this extreme value
is classified as below border.
While distinct, this procedure is conceptually very similar to the sample construction and
culling undertaken with the Tech Coast Angels data. We only drop 20 CommonAngels pitches
that receive low scores, but that is because the selection into providing a formal pitch to the
group itself accomplishes much of the pruning. With Tech Coast Angels, we drop 90% of the
potential deals due to low interest levels. We implicitly do the same with CommonAngels by
focusing only on 63 pitches out of over 2000 deals in the full database of submitted plans.
Our formal empirical analyses jointly consider the two groups. To facilitate this merger,
we construct uniform industry classifications and two simple indicator variables for whether a
venture is funded or not and whether the venture is above or below the border discontinuity. This
pooling produces a regression sample of 130 ventures.

16

<-----Page 17----->3. Outcome Data
This section documents the data that we collect on venture outcomes. This is the most
significant challenge for this type of project as we seek comparable data for both funded and
unfunded ventures. In many cases, the prospective deals are small and recently formed, and may
not even be incorporated. We develop three categories of outcomes: venture survival and
success, venture operations and growth, and venture financing.

3.1. Venture Survival and Success
Our simplest measure is a binary indicator variable for firm survival as of December
2010. This survival date is a minimum of four years after the potential funding event with the
angel group. We develop this measure through several data sources. We first directly contacted
as many ventures as possible to learn their current status. Second, we looked for evidence of the
ventures‘ operations in industry databases or news wires.12 Finally, we examine every venture‘s
web site, if one exists. Existence of a web site is not sufficient for being alive, as some ventures
leave a web site running after closing operations. We thus based our measurement on how recent
various items like press releases were.13
Our second measure is a binary indicator variable for whether the venture had undergone
a successful exit by December 2010. A successful exit can either be an initial public offering
(IPO) or a successful acquisition. We code acquisitions as successful exits or not based upon the
Industry databases include CorpTech, VentureXpert, Dun & Bradstreet, and Hoover‘s. Industry news sources (all
sources are online with a ―.com‖ suffix) include yahoo, linkedin, inc, businessweek, spoke, manta, venturebeat,
wikipedia, crunchbase, glassdoor, insideview, healthcareitnews, socaltech, masshightech, xconomy, and boston.
13
In cases of acquisitions, we code whether the venture is alive or not through a judgment about the size of the
acquisition. Ventures are counted as alive if the acquisition or merger was a successful exit that included major
announcements or exit valuations greater than $5 million (where known). If the event was termed an ―asset sale‖ or
similar phrase, we code the venture as not having survived. The results below are robust to simply dropping these
cases.
12

17

<-----Page 18----->press releases, news articles, and blog posts surrounding the event. We define an unsuccessful
exit as an ―asset sale‖ or similar transaction. In total, 3 and 8 of our 130 ventures had a
successful IPO or acquisition, respectively, by December 2010.14 Given the short time horizon,
judging success through liquidity events may be restrictive—some successful entrepreneurs may
have passed on exit opportunities to continue growing their businesses. Thus, our third measure
augments the successful exit measure to also include if the venture has 75 or more employees in
2010, which we will also adjust below to thresholds of 50 and 100 employees. 22 of our 130
ventures are successful according to this combined measure. By contrast, 45 of the 130 ventures
have closed or had an unsuccessful exit.

3.2. Venture Operations and Growth
Our second set of metrics quantifies venture operations and growth after the potential
financing event. While we would ideally consider a broad range of performance variables such
as sales and product introductions, obtaining data on private ventures is extremely challenging.
This is especially true for unfunded ventures. We are able to employ three outcome variables:
employment, patents, and web site traffic. These three measures also allow for more
differentiation between firms than the binary indicators used for venture success.
We first consider the employment level of the venture in 2010. Employment measures are
collected using the sources described above for venture survival. While we identified exact

14

In five of our eight successful acquisition cases, acquisition values greater than $40 million are reported in the
media. In a sixth case, while the acquisition value was not disclosed, the acquired company disclosed substantial
revenues (>$12m) and investor returns (>200%). Two cases are more difficult to assign. In the first, the venture
(funded and above border) received major press attention at acquisition, with significant discussion of its integration
and then joint release of the next product. This venture still operates as a private subsidiary of the acquiring
company, and the investor considers it a success while not disclosing the returns. In the second, the venture
(unfunded and below border) was estimated to have had more than 50 employees and four funding rounds at
acquisition, and was described as ―major‖ in the press. Recoding the last two cases as unsuccessful acquisitions
marginally strengthens our empirical results below.

18

<-----Page 19----->employment levels for many ventures, in other cases we had to transform reported employment
ranges into point estimates. We applied a consistent rule in these cases to all ventures with the
specified range. The chosen point estimates reflect the typical firm size distribution through the
range (e.g., an employment level of 20 was assigned when the reported range was 10-50
employees). We further coded the employment levels of closed ventures with a zero value.
Finally, we faced the question of how to code employment levels for very successful
ventures. These outliers with several hundred employees can have large effects on the outcomes.
Other very successful cases have been acquired by large companies and thus are no longer
reported separately. To address these issues, we cap the maximum employment level at 100
employees. We also code very successful exits as having 100 employees. The results are robust
to instead using caps of 50 employees or 250 employees. Using a maximum of 100 employees,
our average venture had 26 employees in 2010 (36 among operating businesses) versus 12
employees at the time of the pitch.
The second measure is an indicator variable for having been granted a patent by the
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) by December 2010. About a quarter of the
ventures received a patent. Of course, many ventures in our sample are not seeking patent
protection. We partially control for this in the regressions with our industry controls, but we
acknowledge that patenting is an imperfect measure of innovation levels more generally.
We also want to observe venture growth, but acquiring ongoing operational data is very
challenging with unfunded ventures. We are able to use, however, web traffic records. To our
knowledge, this is the first time that this measure has been employed in an entrepreneurial

19

<-----Page 20----->finance study. We collected web traffic data from www.alexa.com, one of the largest providers
of this type of information.15
We collected web traffic data in the summer of 2008 and January 2010. We identify 91 of
our 130 ventures in one of the two periods, and 58 ventures in both periods. The absolute level of
web traffic and its rank are very dependent upon the specific traits and business models of
ventures. This is true even within broad industry groups as degrees of customer interaction vary.
Some venture groups may also wish to remain ―under the radar‖ for a few years until they are
ready for product launch or have obtained intellectual property protection for their work.
Moreover, the collection method by Alexa may introduce biases for certain venture types. We
thus consider the changes in web performance for the venture between the two periods. These
improvements or declines are more generally comparable across ventures.
One variable simply compares the log ratio of the web rank in 2010 to that in 2008. This
variable is attractive in that it measures the magnitudes of improvements and declines in traffic.
A limitation, however, is that it is only defined for ventures whose web sites are active in both
periods. We thus also define a second outcome measure as a binary indicator for improved
venture performance on the web.16 This technique allows us to consider all 91 ventures for which
we observe web traffic at some point, while sacrificing the granularity of the other measure.17

15

Alexa collects its data primarily by tracking the browsing patterns of web users who have installed the Alexa
Toolbar, a piece of software that attaches itself to a user‘s Internet browser and records the user‘s web use in detail.
According to the company, there are currently millions of such users. The statistics are then extrapolated from this
user subset to the Internet population as a whole. The two ‗building block‘ pieces of information collected by the
toolbar are web reach and page views. Web reach is a measure of what percentage of the total number of Internet
users visit a website in question, and page views measures how many pages, on average, they visit on that website.
Multiple page views by the same user in the same day only count as one entry in the data. The two usage variables
are then combined to produce a variable known as site rank, with the most visited sites like Yahoo and Google
having lower ranks.
16
If we observe the web ranks in both 2008 and 2010, the indicator variable takes a value of one if the rank in 2010
is better than that in 2008. If we only observe the firm on the web in 2008, we deem its web performance to have
declined by 2010. Likewise, if we only observe the firm in 2010, we deem its web performance to have improved.
17
Where possible, we also cross-checked the Alexa trends for ventures against Google Insights. Google Insights is
based upon search queries made. While Google Insights allows for historical monthly measurement, the quality of

20

<-----Page 21----->3.3. Venture Financing
Our final measures describe whether the venture received venture financing. We define
these measures through data collected from VentureXpert and CorpTech, and we cross-checked
with as many ventures directly as possible. We consider both indicator variables for financing
events and counts of financing rounds. As described below, we also use data on the investors in
each round to identify the role of CommonAngels and Tech Coast Angels in subsequent
financing events (either exclusively or in a syndicated deal).

4. Results for Entrepreneurial Firms
This section documents our empirical results for the consequences of entrepreneurial
finance for start-ups. We first compare the subsequent outcomes of funded ventures with nonfunded ventures. We then test more closely the discontinuity between border investments and
angel funding. We close by comparing the outcomes of ventures above and below the border.

4.1. Funding and Firm Outcomes
Tables 3a-3c quantify the relationship between angel group financing and outcomes. We
focus on the 130 ventures that are used in our border analysis. This sample restriction removes
both very low quality and very high quality ventures, focusing on ventures that are similar in
quality and for which funding prospects were quite uncertain at the time of the pitch. We later
consider alternative estimation techniques and the full sample of ventures. Appendix Table 2
provides descriptive statistics on outcomes for the funded and unfunded groups.
the search results varied much more across ventures than the web traffic measures. These differences are because
relevant search terms can be much more ambiguous when ventures have common names or products than measures
of the web traffic that went to a specific url.

21

<-----Page 22----->Table 3a considers our outcome variables for venture success. In the first column, we
regress a dummy variable for whether the venture was alive in 2010 on the indicator for whether
the firm received funding from the angel group. In Panel A, we include only a constant and the
funding dummy variable; in Panel B we control for angel group, industry, and year fixed effects
(controlling for the year that the venture approached the angel group). The coefficients on the
indicator variables are 0.20 and 0.25, both statistically significant at the 1% level. Firms that
received angel funding are 20%-25% more likely to survive for at least four years.
Column 2 shows that funded ventures are also 9%-11% more likely to undergo a
successful exit by December 2010. In unreported specifications, we also disaggregated this result
into a 4%-7% higher likelihood of successful acquisition and a 4%-5% higher likelihood of
going public. Finally, Column 3 finds that the funded ventures are 16%-19% more likely to be
successful, where success represents achieving 75 employees or a successful exit by December
2010. Columns 4 and 5 show that this venture success result does not depend substantially on the
threshold used to measure employment success. These additional outcomes are all statistically
significant and precisely measured. Moreover, reflecting the use of indicator variables, they are
very robust to modest changes in sample composition.
Table 3b considers our metrics of venture operations and growth using a similar
specification to Table 3a. The first column finds that funded ventures have 19-20 more
employees in 2010 than unfunded ventures. This estimate is again statistically significant.
Column 2 shows that this higher employment level in 2010 is not due to funded ventures having
greater employment at the time of the pitch. Median regressions find an employment growth of
13.0 (5.2) employees.18

18

Our data description highlighted the need to cap very high employment or successful exits at a certain
employment level. The measured employment effect with controls is higher at 38.8 (16.5) employees if the cap is

22

<-----Page 23----->Column 3 shows that funded ventures are 16%-18% more likely to have a granted patent.
Columns 4 and 5 consider improvements and growth in web traffic performance. Funded
ventures are 12%-16% more likely to have improved web performance, but these estimates are
not precisely measured. On the other hand, our intensive measure of firm performance, the log
ratio of web site ranks, finds a more powerful effect. Funded ventures show on average 32%39% greater improvements in web rank than unfunded ventures in recent years.
Finally, Table 3c analyzes whether angel funding leads to other financing. Panels A and
B consider indicator variables for types of financing activity, while Panels C and D consider
counts of financing rounds. The first column begins with whether the venture ever receives
professional venture capital financing. This starting point provides background on whether
alternative financing to the angel group was easily available. We find that funded ventures are
70% more likely to receive some form of venture financing than start-ups rejected by the angel
groups. On average, they have 1.6-2.1 more financing rounds. These estimates suggest that
rejected deals found it reasonably difficult to obtain venture financing at all.
The estimates in Column 1 use data on venture financing that we developed from
multiple sources, including contacting the venture directly. Column 2 shows similar results, but
with somewhat lower elasticities, when we use only data that we obtain from searching
VentureXpert. We will return to this estimation when discussing Table 4‘s expanded sample.
Column 3 returns to the financing data used in Column 1 and removes the current angel
financing event. Thus, we now compare the probability of a funded venture obtaining further
financing to the probability of a rejected deal obtaining any financing. Even after excluding the

increased to 250 employees. On the other hand, the estimated effect is 12.2 (3.6) employees if the cap is lowered to
50 employees. Based upon the data we could collect for very successful ventures in our sample, a cap of 100
employees appears most appropriate, and our preferred estimate is the 19-20 employee figure.

23

<-----Page 24----->current angel financing event, the ventures funded by the angel groups are 21%-27% more likely
to obtain later financing and have on average 0.8-1.2 more financing rounds.
The last two columns quantify the role of the angel groups in these subsequent financing
events. Column 4 counts deals that include investors other than the original angel groups. A
comparison of Columns 3 and 4 shows that most of the additional financing events include
outside investors. Column 5 alternatively counts deals that only include outside investors. The
effects here are a third to a half of their magnitude in Column 3. Funding by these two angel
groups aids access to follow-on financing, with a substantial portion of the subsequent deals
syndicated by the angel groups with other venture financiers.
Of course, we cannot tell from this analysis whether angel-backed firms pursue different
growth or investment strategies and thus have to rely on more external funding. Alternatively,
the powerful relationships could reflect a supply effect where angel group investors and board
members provide networks, connections, and introductions that help ventures access additional
funding. We return to this issue below after viewing our border discontinuity results.19

4.2. The Role of Sample Construction
The results in Tables 3a-3c suggest that funding by these angel groups is associated with
improved venture performance. In describing our data and empirical methodology, we noted
several ways that our analysis differed from a standard analysis. We first consider only ventures
that approach our angel investors, rather than attempting to draw similar firms from the full
population of business activity to compare to funded ventures. This step helps ensure ex ante

19

We do not find that being financed by the angel groups materially influences the types of venture investors
subsequently accessed, at least in terms of venture fund size or age (two common proxies for the prestige of venture
funds). These results question one common rationale given for pitching to angel investors—that they provide an
entry to prestigious venture capital firms later.

24

<-----Page 25----->comparable treatment and control groups in that all the ventures are seeking high growth.
Second, we substantially narrow even this distribution of prospective deals until we have a group
of companies that are ex ante comparable. This removes heterogeneous quality in the ventures
that approach the angel investors. Finally, we introduce the border discontinuity to bring
exogenous variation in funding outcomes.
Before proceeding to the border discontinuity, it is useful to gauge how much the second
step—narrowing the sample of ventures to remove quality differences inherent in the selection
funnel—influences our regression estimates. Table 4 presents this analysis for one outcome
variable and the Tech Coast Angels data. We are restricted to only one outcome variable by the
intense effort to build any outcomes data for unfunded ventures. The likelihood of receiving
venture funding is the easiest variable to extend to the full sample.
The first column repeats a modified, univariate form of Column 2 in Table 3b with just
the Tech Coast Angels sample. The elasticities are very similar, and we only use the information
that we would have collected from VentureXpert. The second column expands the sample to
include 2385 potential ventures in the Tech Coast Angels database. The elasticity increases 25%
to 0.56. The difference in elasticities between the two columns demonstrates the role of sample
construction in assessing angel funding and venture performance. The narrower sample provides
a more comparable control group. Our rough estimate of the bias due to not controlling for
heterogeneous quality is thus about a quarter of the true association.
The third and fourth columns demonstrate this bias in a second way. In Column 3 we
regress a dummy variable for obtaining venture funding on the linear interest variable. By itself,
collective interest is very predictive of future outcomes; the coefficient on the angel funding
dummy is 0.11 and significant at the 1% level. This positive association, moreover, holds when

25

<-----Page 26----->excluding companies that Tech Coast Angels ultimately funds. In unreported regressions, we
find that the interest level variable has a coefficient of 0.006 (0.002), indicative of the power of
the screening mechanism. The fourth column shows that controlling for the ex ante interest
levels of the angels, and thereby the approximate quality of investment opportunities, reduces the
measured elasticity in the full sample to a little less than that measured for our border group. In
total, these results suggest that while there is a positive and significant relationship between the
level of interest by the angels in a deal and the underlying quality of the firms, there is a strong
non-linearity in outcomes for those deals that were supported by the angel group versus those
that were not.
Finally, Column 5 shows a similar pattern with another econometric technique. We create
a matched sample where we pair funded ventures with unfunded ventures that are as close as
possible in terms of interest levels, date of pitch, city/chapter, industry, stage, and employment at
time of pitch. We drop funded ventures for which a close match is not available. This technique
again produces very similar outcomes.20 The combined results of Table 4 emphasize the
importance of identifying a comparable control group in terms of venture quality for measuring
the outcomes of venture financing events.

4.3. Border Discontinuities and Angel Funding
We next turn to our border discontinuity exercise. Table 5 formally tests that there is a
significant discontinuity in funding around the thresholds for the ventures considered by Tech
Coast Angels and CommonAngels. The dependent variable is an indicator variable that equals
one if the firm received funding and zero otherwise. The primary explanatory variable is an
20

The matched sample in Table 4 includes ventures outside of our primary interest region where an appropriate
match could be identified. We have further confirmed that our results across the other outcome variables hold when
using a matched sample approach within our primary interest region.

26

<-----Page 27----->indicator variable for the venture being above or below the interest discontinuity. Appendix
Table 3 provides descriptive statistics on outcomes for the above and below border groups.
Column 1 presents a regression with just a constant, while Column 2 controls for angel
group fixed effects, year fixed effects, and industry fixed effects. These regressions combine data
from the two angel groups. Across these two groups, we have 130 deals that are evenly
distributed above and below the discontinuity. We find that there is a statistically and
economically significant relationship between funding likelihood and being above the border:
being above the border increases funding likelihood by about 32%. Clearly, the border line
designation is not a perfect rule—and this fuzziness will limit below how strongly we interpret
the regression discontinuity—but it does signify a very strong shift in funding probability among
ventures that are ex ante comparable as shown in Table 2.
Column 3 shows similar results when we add year and angel group fixed effects. These
fixed effects control for the secular trends of each angel group. The funding jump also holds for
each angel group individually. Column 4 repeats the regression controlling for deal
characteristics like firm size and number of employees at the time of the pitch. The sample size
shrinks to 87, as we only have this information for Tech Coast Angel deals. But despite the
smaller sample size, we still find a significant difference in funding probability. The magnitude
of the effect is comparable to the full sample at 29%. Unreported regressions find a groupspecific elasticity for CommonAngels of 0.45 (0.21). These results suggest that the identified
discontinuities provide a reasonable identification strategy.21

21

We find similar results in a variety of robustness checks. To report one, concern could exist that angels have fixed
voting patterns that skew the scores. For example, the most meaningful endorsement for a venture could come from
an angel who very rarely expresses interest in any deal, and so his or her vote carries unequal weight in the
decisions. These patterns could be obscured in our aggregated measures. To check this, we develop a second
measure of the interest level in deals that normalizes each angel‘s total expressed interest to be the same. That is, we
down-weight the votes of angels who express interest in every deal. We find very similar results to those reported

27

<-----Page 28----->4.4. Border Discontinuities and Firm Outcomes
Tables 6a-6c consider venture outcomes and the border discontinuity. Even after
eliminating observable heterogeneity through sample selection, the results in Tables 3a-3c are
still subject to the criticism that ventures are endogenously funded. Omitted variables may also
be present. Looking above and below the funding discontinuity helps us to evaluate whether the
ventures that looked ex ante comparable, except in their probability of being funded, are now
performing differently. This test provides a measure of exogeneity to the relationship between
angel financing and venture outcomes.
Tables 6a and 6b have the same format as Tables 3a and 3b; the only difference is that the
explanatory variable is the indicator variable for being above the funding border. The
coefficients are not directly comparable across the two estimation approaches, but we can
compare the qualitative results.22 In Table 6a, being above the border is associated with stronger
chances for survival, but it is only qualitatively associated with venture success by December
2010 as measured by successful exits or having 75 or more employees. In Table 6b, above border
ventures are associated with generally better operating performance as measured by employment
levels, patenting, and web site traffic growth. Median regressions find an employment growth of
15.0 (4.1) employees.

below, which suggests that our identification strategy is not being contaminated by band-wagon effects and angelspecific heterogeneity in voting.
It is also worth noting that the professional managers of both angel groups found this funding discontinuity a
reasonable description of their groups‘ behavior. One manager noted that because the angels need to jointly invest,
the development of critical mass behind a deal is essential and non-linear. He also noted that the group early on
(before our sample) changed its meeting procedures so that angels scored their sheets before an open group
discussion was held to allow collection of more independent views of the venture.
22
The coefficients would be comparable if we used the border discontinuity in an instrumental variables framework.
Given the substantial fuzziness of our funding discontinuity, we only use this empirical approach to confirm the
overall qualitative direction of our findings.

28

<-----Page 29----->This comparability indicates that endogeneity in funding choices and omitted variable
biases are not driving the general association found earlier between financing by these two
groups and start-up performance. The results in Table 6a, however, do suggest that some of the
association between funding and venture success by December 2010 may be due to factors not
captured by the angel interest levels (e.g., the speed with which the investment can reach a
liquidity event).
Finally, Table 6c looks at border outcomes with respect to venture financing. The
identification of the investors is not very meaningful in this context, and so we simply focus on
whether the venture receives any financing (at all or removing the current financing round).
Table 6c shows that being above the border discontinuity does not lead to greater venture
financing in later years. This null result may indicate that the least squares association between
current financing and future financing reflects the investment and growth strategies of the
financiers, but that this path is not necessary for venture growth or success as measured by our
outcome variables in Tables 6a and 6b. This interpretation would also fit with the substantial
syndication evident in Table 3c. We return to these questions in our conclusions.23

5. Performance of Angel Investors
One natural concern is whether these investments represent an economically driven
activity, since angels are individuals who often derive utility from simply meeting with and
investing in entrepreneurs. This raises questions about whether our findings could apply to the
venture investment process as a whole. One way to address this concern is to look at the angels‘

23

We have confirmed the border results in several ways. Perhaps most important, the results do not depend upon
how the two angel groups are combined or changes in angel group size over the sample. Similar patterns emerge, for
example, when considering Tech Coast Angels in the period after 2001. We also find positive associations for each
group individually, although some results are not statistically significant due to smaller sample sizes.

29

<-----Page 30----->returns relative to those of the typical professional venture capital funds. If these two measures
are comparable, then this will dispel some of these hobbyist concerns.24
We undertake this analysis using venture capital data from VentureXpert, which has been
previously extensively used in earlier research (e.g., Kaplan and Schoar, 2005). We compare on
an annual basis the investment multiples of the industry to that of one of the angel groups. We
compute two ratios (as of December 2009): 1) the amount returned to investors to the amount
invested (distributed to paid-in capital) and 2) the sum of the distributed capital and the current
remaining value of the investment portfolio to the amount invested (total value to paid-in
capital). We compute a simple average across years and one weighted by the venture capital
investment in each year.
There are two complications. First, professional venture funds charge investors a
management fee (typically 2% of committed capital) and retain a share of the profits (usually
20%, termed carried interest). The returns reported by VentureXpert are net of these fees. Direct
investments by angels do not incur these costs. We thus adjust the returns of the angel groups as
if they had paid these fees, assuming that an extra amount equal to the management fees incurred
from the time of the investment to December 31, 2009 was raised but not invested. Second, we
reduce any distributions by 20% of the difference between the value of the distribution and the
amount invested in the distributed shares to reflect the carried interest.
A second complication is that the angel data are computed using investment dates, while
VentureXpert‘s tabulations are arranged by the fund‘s vintage year (measured using the final
closing date of the fund). The actual investment may be earlier—many groups will begin
24

Of course, this analysis does not prove that the findings about the impact of angel investors will really carry over
to other investors. For instance, even if the returns were equal, it might be that the angel groups invest more
unobservable effort, and their approach would not be sustainable if they priced their inputs at market rate. Again, it
is important to note that both funds have professional managers and that CommonAngels further raises venture
funds from limited partners that its professional managers invest alongside the angels (e.g., Applegate et al., 2010).

30

<-----Page 31----->investing immediately after the first closing—or later, continuing for a number of years after the
final closing. Data constraints require that we use the inexact time comparisons: we compare the
angel investments to the performance of venture funds raised two years later.
Table 7 presents the comparison, with the bottom lines providing the summary statistics.
Using a simple average, the two groups are about equivalent when using the distributed capital
measure, while the angel group outperforms using the total value measure. When weighted, the
venture industry outperforms when using the distributed capital measure, while the angel group
outperforms using the total value measure. Collectively, the evidence provides little support for
claim that angel investors are hobbyists who are not seriously pursuing the investment process.

6. Conclusions and Interpretations
This study analyzes two prominent angel groups and their effects on the start-ups in
which they invest. We find that the angel investments enhance the outcomes and performance of
the firms that are funded by these groups. Using a variety of econometric techniques, we find
consistent evidence that financing by these angel groups is associated with improved likelihood
of survival for four or more years, higher levels of employment, and more traffic on the web sites
of these firms. We also find evidence that angel group financing helps in achieving successful
exits and reaching high employment levels. These latter success results are strong in the base
data, but they are only qualitatively supported in the border analysis.
Our evidence regarding the role of angel funding for access to future venture financing is
mixed. Being funded by one of the angel groups is associated with superior follow-on financing
in the base data, but there is no evidence that this matters around the border discontinuity (where
the other results are supported). We do not want to push this asymmetry too far, but one might

31

<-----Page 32----->speculate that access to capital per se is not the most important value added that angel groups
provide. Our results suggest that some of the ―softer‖ features, such as their mentoring or
business contacts, may help new ventures the most.
Overall, we find that the interest levels of angels at the stages of the initial presentation
and due diligence are predictive of investment success. These findings suggest that in addition to
having a causal impact on the venture they fund, angels engage in an efficient selection and
screening process which sorts proposals into relevant bins: complete losers, truly exceptional
opportunities, potential winners, and so on (e.g., Kerr and Nanda, 2009).
At the same time, this paper leaves many questions unanswered. Our experiment does not
allow us to identify the costs of angel funding (e.g., Hsu, 2004), as we cannot observe equity
positions in the unfunded ventures. We thus cannot evaluate whether taking the money was
worth it from the entrepreneur‘s perspective after these costs are considered. In addition, we
cannot test the impact of angel funding against specific alternative counterfactuals, such as
whether the venture would have been better off with venture capital funding.
Moreover, we have looked at just a few of the many angel investment groups that are
active in the U.S. Our groups are professionally organized and managed, and it is important for
future research to examine a broader distribution of investment groups and their impact for
venture success. Likewise, future work needs to evaluate the performance of individual angel
investors. It would be important to understand whether the dual motives of many angels—
financial returns and non-pecuniary benefits from working with entrepreneurs—affect their
approach and the type of support that these investors provide. Our paper demonstrates that angel
investments can have an important impact on the deals they support and offers an empirical
foothold for analyzing many important questions in entrepreneurial finance.

Notes: Table compares the ex ante traits of ventures above and below the border discontinuity. Columns 2 and 3 present
the means of the above border and below border groups, respectively. The fourth column tests for the equality of the
means, and the t-tests allow for unequal variance. The first panel compares venture traits documented at the time of the
investment pitch. The first row tests equality for log value of financing sought. The second and third panels compare the
distribution of ventures in terms of industries and stages of development, respectively. The shares in these panels sum to
100%. The final panel considers differences in the subsequent activities and funding of the angel investors for the
groups.

Notes: Panel A includes linear regressions of firm outcomes on a dummy variable for whether the firm received venture funding. Regressions in Panel B include
industry, year, and angel group fixed effects. The first column tests employment levels in 2010. Failed ventures are given zero employment, and a maximum of 100
employees is given for very successful ventures. Very successful acquisitions are also given this maximum value. The second column also controls for employment at
the time the venture approached the angel group. Column 3 is an indicator variable for having been granted a patent by the USPTO. The last two columns test for
improved venture performance through web site traffic data from 2008 to 2010. Column 4 is an indicator variable for improved performance, while Column 5 gives log
ratios of web traffic (a negative value indicates better performance). Robust standard errors are reported.

Notes: Panels A and C include linear regressions of firm outcomes on a dummy variable for whether the firm received venture funding. Regressions in Panels B and D
include industry, year, and angel group fixed effects. Column 1 tests whether the venture receives financing, including the current angel financing event. The second
column uses only data of financings in Venture Xpert, which we build upon in Table 4. The third column excludes the current angel financing round where applicable.
The fourth column considers deals that have investors other than CommonAngels and Tech Coast Angels. The last column considers deals that do not involve
CommonAngels and Tech Coast Angels at all. Across these outcomes, Panels A and B present binary indicator variables, while Panels C and D consider counts of
financing rounds. Robust standard errors are reported.

Notes: Linear regressions quantify the role of sample construction in the relationship between funding and venture outcomes. Column 1 repeats a modified, univariate
form of Column 2 in Table 3c with just the Tech Coast Angels sample. Column 2 expands the sample to include all of the potential ventures in the Tech Coast Angels
database, similar to Table 1. The difference in elasticities between the two columns quantifies the role of sample construction in assessing angel funding and venture
performance. As a second technique, Columns 3 and 4 analyze interest levels joint with funding. Column 5 considers a matched sample approach, where we pair
funded ventures with unfunded ventures that are closest to them in terms of interest levels and covariates (year of pitch, city/chapter, industry, stage, initial
employment). Robust standard errors are reported.

Notes: Table compares performance of an angel group fund to the venture capital industry as a whole. We use a two-year lag (e.g., comparing 2005 venture funds to 2007 angel
investments) under the assumption that funds invest with a lag. Weights used in the first weighted industry average returns are based on total VC dollars raised. Weights used in the
second weighted industry average employ the same year distribution as the angel group's investments. Net of fee assumes 2% management fee for first seven years and 0.5% for next
three years; analysis assumes additional funds raised to cover fees. Net of carry assumes 20% of difference between distributed and invested capital; deducted from distributed capital or
total value. Performance is as of June 30, 2010. Industry data from Thomson Reuters.

Notes: Table documents the annual activity of Tech Coast Angels. The first column lists the count of ventures examined by the group. The next two columns
show the number of angels expressing interest in deals, with our primary count being the angels who express interest in ten or more deals (over all the years that
we observe). Tech Coast Angels expands from two to four chapters in 2003. One of the new chapters pre-existed as a separate angel group; the second pulled
both new and existing members. On a per chapter basis, the number of active angels remains mostly constant during this growth period, as shown in the fourth
column. The fifth column shows that the average interest in a deal rises over the sample. This increase is primarily due to fewer deals receiving zero interest.
The average non-zero interest is flatter in Column 6. The seventh and eighth columns show that the mean and median interest levels for funded ventures is
mostly flat during our sample, with the exception of the lower values in 2001. The mean interest statistic caps interest levels at 50 angels. The last two
columns show the share of ventures funded by year, with the tenth column adjusting for external decisions (e.g., the venture withdrew to take funding
elsewhere). These funding percentages have minor fluctuations around 3.5% during the sample period.
