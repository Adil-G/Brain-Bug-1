New Products: What Separates Winners from Losers?
R. G. Cooper and E. J. Kleinschmidt

There is no issue more fundamental to new products managers than understanding the factors
that separate successfromfailure. In this article,
Robert Cooper and Elko Kleinschmidt present a
series of ten hypotheses which they test using
data obtained from their study of 203 new products. Significantly, these products include both
commercial successes and failures, since previous studies have concentrated on either one or
the other. The authors conclude that product superiority is the number one factor influencing
commercial success and that project definition
and early, predevelopment activities are the most
critical steps in the new products development
process. Success, they argue, is earned. It is not
the ad hoc result of situational or environmental
influences. Synergy, both marketing and technical, is crucial.

Critical Management Questions
What makes a new product a success? And what
separates new product winners from losers? The
answers to these questions are critical to effective
new product management. An understanding of
new product success factors is important for two
reasons: it provides guidelines to the screening of
new product projects; and it leads to insights into
the way the new product project should be managed.
We set out to resolve the success-vs.-failure
issue by studying 203 new products-both winners and losers-that were launched into the
market place. A thorough review of past studies
and literature resulted in a conceptual model of
new product success and failure-a model that
links project outcomes to a number of key project
descriptors. Ten hypotheses were derived from
the model. These hypotheses were then tested
using the 203 actual case histories. The results are
provocative; besides lending support to the conceptual model, the results also have important
managerial implications in terms of screening criteria and new product management approaches.

New products are vital to the growth and prosperity of most manufacturing firms. Booz-Allen
and Hamilton estimates a doubling of new product introductions in the 1981-1986 period, and
that by the end of 1986, new products introduced
during these 5 years will have accounted for 40%
of corporate sales [4]. New products are also

high-risk endeavors; approximately 46% of the
resources devoted to product development and
commercialization
go to unsuccessful
projects
[4], and 35% of products launched fail commercially [14,17].
Early research in the field of product innovation sought to identify those characteristics that
were common to new product successes. An extensive descriptive study of 567 successful innovations by Myers and Marquis showed that most
successes were market-derived (market pull) ventures and that only 21% were technology push
[26]. A descriptive process model, consisting of
five major steps and eight activities, portrayed
the process typically followed in these innovations.
The ingredients of success in Globe’s study of
ten radical innovations were dominated by internal and technical factors [18]. Success factors included: a recognition of a technical opportunity;
market need recognition; proficient R&D management; well-executed venture decisions; ample
development resources; and a technical entrepreneur. An investigation of six successful innova-

tions at GE Labs by Roberts and Burke showed a
close link to market needs as the key to success
[30]. Market needs were typically recognized,
and R&D was targeted at satisfying these needs;
when a technical breakthrough did not have a
specific market need, the product was adapted to
suit an identified need.
A study of highly successful Canadian case histories revealed that the new product process was
a goal directed, stepwise process, involving a series of information acquisition activities and evaluation points [ 12,131. Extensive market inputs,
including, for example, marketing research, were
common to the successes, especially near the beginning of the project, and played a key role in
shaping the success of the products. In a similar
vein, Townsend’s study of one radical innovation
and subsequent incremental innovations showed
that success hinged on close collaboration between user and innovator; a well-defined market
need; a technical champion; strong internal communication; and highly developed screening and
testing procedures [37].
Another research direction has been the investigation of new product failures. The premise underlying such exploratory research is that a retrospective analysis of past failures would identify
pitfalls and problems in product innovation, that
management can then take steps to overcome or
avert in the future.
Three Conference Board studies over a 16-year
period all identified marketing variables as the
major weaknesses in firms’ new product failures
[19,20,27]. Inadequate market analysis, product
defects, the lack of an effective marketing effort,
high costs, bad timing, and competitive strength
were uncovered as major failure reasons. Recommendations from these studies called for more
and better marketing research and marketing efforts, careful product positioning, better concept
testing and test marketing, and improved project
notably early screening. Another
evaluation,
large sample study (114 failure cases) identified
particularly weak activities in the new product
process, notably market research and market
studies; test marketing; and financial evaluation
[ 10,l 11, Many of these failures could be described
as a “better mousetrap no one wanted,” a product conceived and developed in the absence of
market information and with no clearly identified
market need [6]. A second popular failure type

<-----Page 2----->WHAT SEPARATES

WINNERS

FROM LOSERS?

was the “me too product meeting a competitive
brick wall,” a product similar to competitors’
products but offering no advantages to the user.
Success vs. Failures
The problem with both research directions above
is that they only looked at one type of producteither commercial successes or commercial failures-but
not both types in the same study. In
short, there was no control group or group for
comparison. In order to uncover success factors,
one must identify characteristics which discriminate between commercial successes and failures,
hence the need for both types of projects in the
analysis.
The first study to undertake such a comparison
was Project
SAPPHO,
which employed
a
pairwise comparison methodology
[33]. Fortythree pairs of projects-success
versus failurewere studied, and 41 variables were found to be
statistically significant in their relationship to project outcomes. The most important discriminators were:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Understanding of users’ needs;
Attention to marketing and publicity;
Efficiency of development;
Effective use of outside technology and external scientific communication;
and
5. Seniority and authority of responsible managers.
A similar study was undertaken in Hungary
and revealed a parallel set of success factors, notably market need satisfaction; effective communication; efficient development; a market orientation; and the role of key individuals [33,34].
Kulvik’s success/failure study in Finland yielded
similar results to the above, but identified additional facilitators, including a good “company/
product fit,” the utilization of technical “knowhow” of the company, and familiarity with both
the product’s markets and technologies [22]. Another study on European and Japanese successes
vs. failures identified marketing
proficiency,
product advantage, early market need recognition, a high degree of customer contact, and top
management initiation as the keys to success [38].
Fifty-four significant facilitators for success
were identified in Rubenstein’s study of U.S. new

products [35]. High on the list were the existence
of a product champion, marketing factors such as
need recognition,
superior data collection and
analysis, planned approaches to venture management , and strong internal communications.
Project NewProd was an exploratory study
into success vs. failure, which sought to identify
those characteristics
that separated
102 new
product successes from 93 failures in 102 firms
[9,11,12]. The use of factor analysis and multiple
regression analysis revealed a set of success factors, the most important being:
1. Having a unique, superior product in the eyes
of the customer, one with a real differential
advantage in the market;
2. Having strong market knowledge and market
inputs, and undertaking the market research
and marketing tasks well; and
3. Having technological and production synergy
and proficiency.
The most recent success/failure study was undertaken by Maidique and Zirger, the Stanford
Innovation Project [25]. The researchers used a
variety of methodologies, including unstructured
interviews, a structured survey, and an analysis
of paired case histories. The authors conclude
that success is likely to be greater under the following circumstances:
1. The developing organization, through in-depth
understanding
of the marketplace
and customers, introduces a product with a high performance-to-cost
ratio.
2. The company is proficient in marketing, and
commits a significant amount of resources to
selling and promoting the product.
3. The product yields a high contribution margin
to the firm.
4. The R&D process is well planned and executed.
5. The create, make, and market functions are
well interfaced and coordinated.
6. The product is introduced into the market
early.
7. The markets and technologies
of the new
product benefit from the strengths of the firm.
8. There is a high level of management support
for the project from the development
stage
through to launch.

Figure 1. A Conceptual

A Conceptual

Model of New Product Outcomes

Model

The results of these empirical investigations have
helped to identify the possible factors that underlie new product success. Many of the results of
these studies were consistent, in spite of obvious
methodology,
sample type, and location differences. One result of these studies is the development of conceptual models of new product outcomes. For example, both NewProd and the
Stanford Innovation Project propose tentative
conceptual models. The research to date, however, has been largely exploratory: to identify
variables and propose explanatory models rather
to test models and hypotheses.
The current research takes the next step and
involves model and hypotheses
testing. The
model, shown conceptually in Figure 1, is based
on previously proposed models and previous research results, as well as on other literature that
proposes what factors should be key to success.
The model postulates that new product outcomes

R. G. COOPER AND E. J. KLEINSCHMIDT

(success or failure) are determined from the interaction of the market environment and the new
product strategy and execution. The new product
strategy and execution includes both the product
itself (e.g., product design, product advantages)
as well as the launch. The new product strategy
and execution is the result of the new product
process, a series of activities that move the product from idea to launch. Finally, this process
takes place within a corporate environment consisting of resources, experience, and skills in
marketing, production, and technology.
A set of ten hypotheses’ was next derived from
the conceptual model, from previous research
findings on new product outcomes, and from
other research and writings on business or product success. Each hypothesis and its rationale are
presented below, while Figure 1 shows how each
hypothesis links constructs in the conceptual
model. (Not all the possible hypotheses
that
might have been derived from the model are
tested in the current research; further, the hypotheses are presented in the positive, rather
than null form, for style reasons, although it is the
null hypothesis that is being tested here.) Later in
the article, the tests of these hypotheses are presented, where “product success” is measured in
a variety of ways.
Hypotheses
Hl: New Product Success Is Positively Related
to Product Advantage
Rationale: The product itself-its
design, features, attributes, and advantages-is
the leading
edge of the new product strategy, as shown in
Figure 1. It is the new product strategy interacting with the market environment that yields product outcomes. In previous research, product advantage has been uncovered as a success factor.
Maidique and Zirger concluded that products that
are better matched to users’ needs and that feature a higher benefit-to-cost ratio are more likely
to be a success [25]. NewProd identified product
superiority and product economic advantage to
the user as success factors [9-l I]. The PIMS

vealed that product quality was a major determinant of profitability in the case of on-going products [5,36]. Further, studies into new product
failures have revealed that product deficiencies
and lack of product advantage are major failure
causes [10,19]. Finally, conceptual articles cite
product advantage as important to success: for
example, Kotler argues that product design is a
strategic tool [21]. Bennett and Cooper propose
their “product value” concept [3]; and Corey
cites product advantage as an important evaluation criterion in analyzing the chances for success
for a new product [ 151.
H2: New* Product Success Is Positively Related
to Market Potential for the New Product
Rationale: Market attractiveness and market potential are obvious descriptors of the market environment, which is postulated to interact with
product strategy to yield product outcomes (Figure 1). Moreover, previous research has identified market size, growth rate, and market need
level as factors in success [9-l I]. Additionally,
Maidique and Zirger [24] found environmental
factors, including market characteristics, to be a
consideration in new product success (cited by
managers 14% of the time in the unstructured interview phase of the Stanford study). Market attractiveness is also an important dimension in
various strategy models used to allocate resources to new and existing businesses and products [I ,231. Finally, market characteristics were
found to be useful screening criteria for project
selection [ 141.
H3: New Product Success Is Negatively
Related to the Level of Competitiveness in the
New Product’s Market
Rationale: Market competitiveness
as a negative
success factor is a logical corollary to H2, and
represents the negative facet of the market environment in Figure 1. Maidique and Zirger identified the competitive situation as one factor in project outcomes, but it was not nearly so frequently
or strongly cited in the unstructured
interview
phase as other factors [2.5]. Similarly, NewProd
identified the competitive situation as a negative,
albeit minor, factor in project outcomes [9-111.
Nonetheless, business strategy literature, partic-

J PROD INNOV MANAG
1987:4:169-184

173

ularly recent writings, emphasize the competitive
situation and competitive analysis as key to strategy [ 1,291. The strength of arguments in the conceptual literature, together with the fact that market competitiveness
was uncovered in previous
exploratory work, led to its inclusion as a hypothesis in the current research.
H4: New Product Success Is Positively Related
to Marketing Synergy or Fit-the Ability of the
Project to Build from the Firm’s Existing
Marketing Resources
H5: New Product Success Is Positively Related
to Technological Synergy or Fit-the Ability of
the Project to Build from the Firm’s Existing
Development and Production Resources
Rationale: Synergy is the common thread that
binds the new business to the old, according to
Ansoff [2]. Peters and Waterman, in In Search of
Excellence, make a strong case for “sticking to
the knitting,”
that is, building on existing
strengths, skills, and experience rather than seeking new opportunities far from one’s experience
and resource base [28]. Both marketing and technological synergy were found to be important
success determinants in the Stanford Project, in
NewProd, and in Kulvik’s study [9-l 1,22,25].
Synergy also plays a role in many strategy selection models: for example, the “business position” dimension in Abel1 and Hammond’s portfolio model, which is similar to many such portfolio
models, closely parallels the notion of business fit
or synergy [l].

H7: New Product Success Is Positively Related
to the Proficiency of the “Up-Front” or
Predevelopment Activities of the New Product
Process
The predevelopment
activities of the new product
process-those
activities that precede the product development phase-are
increasingly seen as
key to success. Booz-Allen and Hamilton note

<-----Page 5----->174

J PROD INNOV MANAG
1987;4:169-184

that successful U.S. firms spend more on these
“up-front”
activities,
and that the Japanese
spend still more [4]. In previous research, effective project evaluation, market studies, and marketing research, and a well-defined market need
early in the process were identified as success
factors [9-l 1,19,24,25,31-33,381. The empirical
evidence and conceptual arguments led to the inclusion of this hypothesis in the study.
Closely related to these “up-front” activities is
predevelopment
strategy definition. Crawford
makes a strong case for all-party predevelopment
agreement on the product strategy: target market
definition, product benefits to be delivered, etc.
[16]. He calls this strategy agreement or step the
“protocol.” The logic and strength of Crawford’s
proposition led to the inclusion of protocol and its
impact on success as a hypothesis in the current
research.
H8: New Product Success Is Positively Related
to the Proficiency of the Market-Related
Activities of the New Product Process
H9: New Product Success Is Positively Related
to the Proficiency of the Technological
(Development and Production) Activities of the
New Product Process
Rationale: How well the activities of the new
product process are undertaken has been found
to be related to project outcomes in previous research. For example, a strong market orientation,
marketing proficiency, undertaking market research, and effective advertising, promotion, and
launch have all been found to be correlates of
success [9-11,19,24,25,31-351.
Similarly, the
technological activities-the
management of the
R&D phase and efficient product developmenthave been found to be linked to outcomes [25,32341.
HlO: New Product Success Is Positively
Related to the Degree of Top Management
Support for the Project
Rationale: The SAPPHO studies were among the
first to identify the important role of top management support in product success [3 l-341. The European/Japanese
new product study undertaken
by Utterback et al. revealed top management initiation to be a positive success factor [38]. Fur-

ther, the Stanford Innovation Project showed that
success likelihood was higher when there was a
high level of top management support for the
product from the development stage through to
launch [25]. Based on these empirical studies, top
management support as a success factor was included as a hypothesis in the current study.
Research Methodology
In order to test the ten hypotheses, original data
was collected in late 1985 for a large sample consisting of 125 industrial product firms and 203 new
product projects.2 The sample of firms was taken
from government
lists of manufacturing
firms
known to be active in product development, and
included firms from a variety of industries (See
Table 1). Originally 205 firms were contacted,
yielding a response rate of 60%. Two typical new
product projects per firm were requested: one a
success, the other a commercial failure; both
products were to have been launched. The eventual sample included 123 successes and 80 failures. In each firm, personal interviews were undertaken with the manager or managers most
knowledgeable
about each project. The interviews were based on a lengthy pretested questionnaire.
Ten constructs or composite variables were
developed for the research, each corresponding

are shown in Table 2. (Some constructs overlapped each other, i.e., some items were used in
two constructs, notably in constructs 7, 8, and 9.)
Each item was measured on a zero-to-ten scale
with anchor phrases. A zero-to-ten index was
then computed for each construct: the numeric
average of the scale values for the items in that
construct.
New product success can be viewed in a num-

ber of different ways [24]. Eleven different measures of “success” were developed for the study,
and included:
1. Success/failure: whether or not the product
was a financial success, i.e., exceeded or fell
short of the acceptable profitability level for
that firm (a dichotomous Yes/No measure).
2. Profitability level: the degree to which the
product’s profitability exceeded or fell short
of the minimum acceptable profitability level
for the firm for this type of investment, however profitability was measured (-5 to +5
scale).
3. Payback period: the number of years from
launch required to recoup the initial financial
outlays (years).
4. Domestic market share: the estimated market share in the domestic market in year three
after launch (% share).
5. Foreign market share: the estimated foreign
market share in year three in the foreign target markets (averaged across intended target
market countries ; % share).
6. Relative sales: dollar sales of the product relative to other recent new product introductions by the firm in the last five years (0 to 10
scale).
7. Relative profits: profit level of the product

relative to other recent new product introductions by the firm (0 to 10 scale).
8. Sales us. objectives: extent to which the new
product’s sales (dollars) exceeded or fell
short of sales objectives (0 to 10 scale).
9. Projits uersus objectives: extent to which the
new product’s profits exceeded or fell short
of profit objectives (0 to 10 scale).
10. Opportunity window on new categories: extent to which the product opened a window
of opportunity on a new category of products
for the firm (0 to 10 scale).
11. Opportunity window on new markets: extent
to which the product opened a window of
opportunity on a new market for the firm (0 to
10 scale).
Coefficient Alphas and item-total correlations
were determined for each construct to check for
internal consistency of reliability of constructs.
The hypotheses
themselves were tested using
one-way Anovas and Pearson product-moment
correlations for each construct versus each of the
11 measures of success.
Results
The ten constructs were found to be internally
consistent
and statistically
reliable. Table 2
presents Coefficient Alphas and item-total correlations for each construct. All reliability coefficients (alphas) exceeded the minimum acceptable
level of 0.50 and many were greater than 0.80.
Item-total correlations were generally high, and
thus revealed a similar reliability picture.
Table 3 presents the correlation coefficients between each of the ten hypothesized success determinants and the ten continuous measures of
success. Only correlations significant at the 0.01
level or better are shown. Figure 2 shows the oneway Anova results and group means for successful vs. unsuccessful
projects for all ten constructs.
Discussion

of Results

Tests of Hypotheses
Hl: Product advantage. This first hypothesis was
strongly supported by the results. The correlations between outcomes and product advantage
(Table 3) were the strongest of all constructs,

R. G. COOPER

AND E. J. KLEINSCHMIDT

with some correlations in excess of 0.50. Product
advantage was significantly correlated with all ten
continuous success measures (cu = 0.01). The
Anova results (Figure 2) were also highly significant (Q = O.OOl), with the successful products
having a much stronger product advantage than
failures (7.25 vs. 4.93 on a zero-to-ten scale). The
direction of effect in all cases was as hypothesized. The evidence overwhelmingly
points to
product advantage as a number one success factor in this study.
H2: Market potential. The second hypothesis
gained partial support from the research results.
Market potential was significantly correlated with
seven of the 11 continuous measures of success
(a = 0.01) and the Anova results were significant
at the 0.001 level. Market potential was most
strongly tied to opportunity windows, and somewhat less so to relative profits and sales, and
meeting sales and profit objectives. As might be
expected, market potential was not linked to both
market share measures, but was tied to payback
period. All directions of effects were as hypothesized. The evidence suggests that market potential is a positive success factor, certainly for some
measures of success, and particularly for opportunity windows.
H3: Market competitiveness. Here the null hypothesis was accepted-that
there appears to be
no relationship between market competitiveness
and new product success. Market competitiveness was a robust construct consisting of six
items and with a Coefficient Alpha of 0.74. But
not one of the 11 success measures was significantly related to market competitiveness.
The
Anova results concurred. The result is somewhat
surprising in view of the attention that competitive analysis receives from some business writers. This result is also fairly consistent, however,
with previous empirical findings that showed that
market competitiveness
was a rather weak factor
in project outcomes. The overwhelming evidence
from the research is that market competitiveness
is not a decisive determinant of project outcomes.
H4: Marketing synergy. Hypothesis 4 was partially supported by the research results. Marketing synergy was significantly correlated with six
of the 11 continuous measures of success (cu =
0.01). The Anova results were also significant (a
= O.OOl), with successful products demonstrating
more marketing synergy. Marketing synergy was

positively and strongly tied to meeting sales and
profits objectives. It was also positively linked to
relative sales and profits, profitability level, and
negatively related to payback period: higher marketing synergy yielded shorter paybacks. Surprisingly, neither market share measure was correlated with marketing
synergy. The evidence
supports the contention that marketing synergy is
a positive success factor in product innovation.
H5: Technological
synergy. The impact of
technological synergy closely paralleled that of
marketing synergy; it was correlated with seven
measures of success and had strongly significant
Anova results. Technological synergy had a positive impact on meeting sales and profit objec-

tives, and on relative sales and profits. The construct was linked to both measures of financial
performance,
and weakly to domestic market
share. The evidence supports technological synergy as a positive success factor.
H6: Protocol. The protocol hypothesis-that
a well-defined project in terms of target market,
product positioning, product benefits, and product requirements is important prior to development-was
strongly supported by the research.
Protocol was significantly linked to eight of the 11
performance measures, and in the hypothesized
direction. The Anova results were also strongly
significant, with successful projects having much
better definition than failures (mean of 8.12 for

<-----Page 11----->180

R. G. COOPER AND E. J. KLEINSCHMIDT

successes vs. only 5.44 for failures on a zero-toten scale). As might be expected, protocol was
unrelated to opportunity windows. Foreign market share was also unrelated to protocol. In this
first test of protocol as a success factor, the overwhelming evidence is that protocol is a strong
positive success factor.
H7: Proficiency of predevelopment
activities.
How well the “up-front” or predevelopment
activities were undertaken,
like protocol, was
strongly linked to new product success. This construct was positively correlated with all 11 continuous measures of success (a = O.Ol), and the
Anova results were also highly significant (a =
0.001). Hypothesis 7 was supported by the research results. The only disconcerting evidence
was the relative weakness of the “up-front” activities in general: on a O-to-10 scale, they scored
4.80 for successes and only 3.13 for failures.
HS: Proficiency

of market-related

activities.

How well various market oriented activities were
undertaken-from
market assessment and marketing research through to market launch-was
positively correlated with seven of the continuous success measures. Moreover, the Anova
results were also significant at the 0.001 level.
Hypothesis 8 was supported in part by the research results. In particular, market-related activities had strong link to meeting sales and profit
objectives, relative sales and profits, and payback
period. The evidence suggests, however, that the
marketing activities are poorly undertaken for
both successes and failures (mean score of 3.65
out of ten for successes, and only 2.53 for failures).
H9:

Proficiency

of

technological

activities.

How well the technological activities are undertaken-R&D
engineering, product testing, etc.was also closely tied to new product success. The
research results gave partial support to Hypothesis 9. Technological
activities were positively
correlated (a = 0.01) with eight of the 11 continuous measures of success and most strongly with
payback period, meeting sales and profits objectives, relative sales and profits, and profitability
level. In terms of overall proficiency, technological activities scored higher than market activities;
moreover, technological activities in successful
projects were rated higher than in failures: 5.57
out of 10 for successes vs. 4.06 for failures. These
differences between successes and failures were

significant at the 0.001 level based on a one-way
Anova.
HlO: Top management support. The final hypothesis-that
top management support is key to
success-gained
only limited support from the
research results. Top management support was
measured on three scales: commitment to the
project; involvement in the project; and guidance/
direction for the project. The construct was a robust one, with a Coefficient Alpha of = 0.81 and
high item-total correlations. While there were five
significant correlations
between this construct
and the 11 continuous success measures, the correlation coefficients themselves tended to be low
(although still significant at the 0.01 level). The
Anova results were also significant, but only at
the 0.01 level. Top management support was correlated with payback period, domestic market
share, relative profits, and meeting sales and
profits objectives, all in the hypothesized directions.

Key Success Fuctors
Of the ten hypothesized
success factors, nine
were found to be significantly related to new
product success, three of these in a very strong
way. Moreover, all of the significant relationships
were in the hypothesized direction of effect. The
strongest success factors, measured in terms of
numbers of correlations and strength of correlation, were:
1. Product aduantage.
The product
offered
unique features for the customer; was higher
quality; reduced customers’ costs; was innovative; was superior to competing products in
the eyes of the customer; and solved a problem faced by the customer.
2. Proficiency of predeueloprnent activities. Undertaking proficiently a set of “up-front” activities, namely initial screening; preliminary
market assessment; preliminary technical assessment; detailed market study or marketing
research; and business/financial analysis.
3. Protocol. There was a clear definition, prior to
the product development stage, of the target
market; customers’ needs, wants, and preferences; the product concept; and product specifications and requirements.

and

synergy.

Each of these has been defined in Table 2.
There was one relatively weakly related success factor, namely Top Management Support. It
would appear that failure projects had almost as
much top management commitment and involvement as did the successes. Finally, one hypothenot supsis-market
competitiveness-was
ported at all by the research findings. The failure
of this one hypothesis comes as no great surprise:
Even during the hypothesis development phase,
the role of market competitiveness
was in question. The hypothesis was included largely because of arguments in speculative writings, not
on the basis of past research results.
The fact that nine of the ten hypotheses were
supported lends partial support to the conceptual
model from which they were derived (Figure 1).
While tests of these ten hypotheses do not represent a complete test of the model, it is important
to note that none of the results were in conflict
with the model. The conceptual model of Figure 1
appears to be a reasonable representation
or
model of new product outcomes, and certainly
merits further testing.

What the Results Mean to Managers
Besides yielding a test of ten hypotheses and
lending support to a conceptual model, the research results have managerial implications:
Product superiority is the number one factor in
success. This finding has implications
for both

new product screening decisions and for the management of the new product process. There were
six items that comprised product superiority:
Unique benefits for the customer;
Product quality;
Reduced customers’ costs;
Product innovativeness;

Product superiority
tomer; and

in the eyes of the

cus-

problem.

This list provides a useful checklist of questions
in assessing the odds of success of a proposed
new product project. In short, these items logically should be top priority questions in a project
screening model or checklist.
The second implication focuses on how the
process is managed. The development of a product with real advantages becomes the number one
objective in the new product process. Simply being equal to competition, or having a good “product-market fit” is not enough; rather, one must
seek a product advantage: the goal must be superiority. If the proposed product is weak on all or
most of the above six items, then every effort
must be made to build in product superiority as
the final product takes shape. Some of these efforts might include, for example, extensive market research to understand customers’ needs,
wants, and preferences, and to gain an insight
into what constitutes “a better product in the
eyes of the customer”; creativity techniques and
creative problem solving methods to arrive at
novel technical solutions; and extensive field trials and tests with customers to ensure that the
final product design scores high on customer acceptance and preference.
Project definition and the “up-front” activities
are vital to success. These two hypotheses-pro-

tocol and the proficiency of predevelopment
activities-are
closely related. The most critical
steps in the new product process are those that
occur before the product development gets underway. These include: initial screening, preliminary technical and market assessments, marketing research, and business/financial analysis. One
implication is that management must recognize
the importance of these up-front steps, and be
prepared to devote the necessary resourcespeople, time, and money-to
see that they are
carried out well. The research evidence suggest
otherwise: that these steps are currently weakly
handled. Further, the Booz-Allen & Hamilton
study notes that the Japanese devote considerably more resources to these “homework”
stages
than does the typical U.S. firm [4].
A second implication is that these five key predevelopment
activities should be built into the

<-----Page 13----->182

new product process as a matter of routine rather
than by exception. The recommendation
is that
firms adopt a game plan or process model that
incorporates these five up-front activities as an
integral and vital part of the process.
The role of protocol-gaining
agreement on
target market and product strategy prior to charging ahead with product development-supports
Crawford’s plea for such a step in the new product process [ 161. The recommendation
is that
managers build into their new product process a
protocol step or check point. This step should
occur just prior to product development,
and
hence logically after the completion of the five
up-front steps cited above. Here, there must be
agreement on:
The target market: exactly
will be aimed at.

who the product

The customers’ needs, wants, and preferences:
the customers’ “wish list.”
The product concept: what benefits the product will deliver, and how it will be positioned
in the market.
The product’s attributes,
tions, and requirements.

features,

specifica-

If the five up-front activities are carried out well,
then defining a protocol should be relatively
straightforward.
Synergy-both
marketing and technologicalis a key factor in success. The proponents of syn-

ergy as an ingredient in success appear to be correct, according to the results of this research.
While synergy was not the most important success determinant, it was nonetheless a significant
factor. Marketing synergy means having a good
fit in terms of a variety of
“project-company”
marketing resources and skills, varying from the
sales force through to the service department.
Technological synergy included project-company
fit in terms of R&D, engineering, and production
resources and skills. These two factors, and the
list of items that comprise each, become important checklist questions in the screening of new
product ventures.
Controllable variables, rather than situational
or environment variables, are the dominant factors in success. The ten hypothesized
success

factors can be approximately
two groups:

categorized

into

AND E.J.KLEINSCHMlDT

Controllable factors: those factors over which
the project manager and team have control and
can affect in the short term. Such factors include:
Proficiency of predevelopment
activities.
Proficiency of market-related activities.
Proficiency of technological activities.
Product advantage.
Protocol.
Situational/environmental
factors: those factors that are more or less fixed, and describe
the setting for the project. They include:
Market potential.
Market competitiveness.
Marketing synergy.
Technological synergy.
One factor, top management involvement,
fits
into both categories-partly
controllable, partly
noncontrollable by the project leader and team.
A review of the two lists-controllable
vs. situational/environmental
variables-reveals
that
the strongest success factors are in the controllable category. Indeed, the top three success factors-product
advantage, proficiency of predevelopment activities, and protocol-are
all factors
within the control of the project manager and
team. This finding has important implications.
First, it means that the way the new product process is managed and executed-the
activities that
people undertake and how well they do them
from idea to launch-largely
decide project outcomes. This points to the need for a carefully
conceived plan of action or blueprint of activities
to ensure that key steps are carried out, and that
sufficient resources are made available. Second,
the environmental/situational
variables, such as
market potential, market competitiveness,
marketing synergy, and technological synergy remain
valid screening criteria for project selection.
They are not the most important correlates of
success, however.
Conclusion
New product development
remains one of the
riskiest yet most important management challenges. A better understanding of what makes a
new product a success-what
separates winners
from losers-is
essential to improved project selection and management. This research, by testing certain success factor hypotheses, has identi-

fied and confirmed the importance of a number of
success determinants. The research has also lent
support to a model of new product outcomes, and
yielded results that have action implications to
managers.

Hypothesis testing. Is concerned with deciding
whether a hypothesized
statement is supported by the empirical evidence or not.
Null hypothesis. In scientific research, hypotheses are usually stated in the null form, e.g.,
that new product success is not related to
product advantage. Data is collected and analyzed to test the hypothesis, and one concludes that the evidence supports or does
not support a relationship (but does not necessarily prove the relationship).

Constructs or composite variables. Constructs
are theoretical phenomenon, e.g., “product
advantage”
that cannot be directly measured by one single measure. Multiple items
(or several questions) are used to capture
such a construct.
Coefficient alpha. A mathematical approach to
assess the reliability or consistency of a construct; i.e., how reliable can one measure a
phenomenon
(e.g., “product advantage”).
To establish a coefficient alpha one measures the construct with different items or
questions. Then one correlates all individual
items against all other items. If the overall
mean correlation among all items is high,
one says that the construct is reliably measured, i.e., internally consistent.
Item-total-correlation.
The item-total-correlation is the correlation that one specific item
or question has with the sum of all items

One-Way ANOVA. ANOVA (analysis of variance) is a technique for assessing how several nominal explanatory variables (categories) affect a continuous response variable.
One-way ANOVA deals with the effect of a
single factor (e.g., low R&D spenders vs.
high R&D spenders) on a response variable
(e.g., financial success). Generally a oneway ANOVA involves a comparison of several (two or more) means.
Pearson Product moment correlation. This is a
measure of association of how two variables
are associated in a sample (e.g., “product
advantage”
and a success measure). The
range of possible values of the correlation (r)
is from - 1 to + 1. The closer this measure is
to 1, the more strongly are the two variables
associated. If the measure is close to zero,
there is little, if any, association between the
two variables.
