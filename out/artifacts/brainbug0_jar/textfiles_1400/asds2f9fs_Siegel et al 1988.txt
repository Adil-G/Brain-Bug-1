This report presents the results of a formal study of the corporate venture
capital community in the United States, and is based upon responses to a
questionnaire completed by 52 corporate venture capitalists (CVCs).
The central question addressed in this study involves which approach
to corporate venture capital is most likely to produce successful results.
This question was addressed viu cluster analysis which segregated
which are marked by substantial organizational
the CVC community into two broad classes-“pilots,”
independence and “copilots,” which are highly dependent on corporate management with respect to
venture funding and decision authority.
Pilots achieve equal or higher levels of performance, and are plagued by far fewer obstacles,
than their highly dependent counterparts. The results suggest the following:

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

I, The corporate venture fund should be established as an independent entity and should have
access to a committed, separate pool offunds. This will enable CVCs to respond aggressively
to, and manage, investment opportunities with minimal corpomte interference. Such an
independent entity will defuse justifiable concerns on the part of entrepreneurs related to
such interference.
2. The ,fund should be managed by skilled venture professionals who may be drawn from the
independent venture community or the small but growing pool of experienced CVCs. Corporate executives may comprise a part of the management team.
3. If the corporate venture fund hopes to attract top quality managers, it must be prepared to
offer compensation and authority commensurate with their skill level. In short, corporate
venture capitalists should be treated like independent venture capitalists. By organizing the

fund as an independent entity, the political problem associated with establishing compensation levels above those of the corporation can be minimized.
4. All CVCs should establish a primary focus on the realization of financial objectives (i.e.,
return on investment). Strategic benefit objectives are not necessarily ill advised so long as
they do not interfere with sound financial decision making. When they do, the corporate
venture capital process is likely to become less effective. For instance, a corporate venture
fund should only confine itself to investing in a few industries if there are sufficient highgrade investment opportunities within those industries to ensure adequate deal pow. The
venture fund should not be pressured. Investments that appear exciting from a corporate
perspective, for technological or marketing reasons, but are not financially attractive may
well drain resources rather than produce opportunities.
5. Venture proposals failing on financial criteria might be referred to other parts of the corporation with the purpose of exploring an alternate relationship (e.g., a development contract
or joint venture). If this is appealing to the corporation, a mechanism such as a corporate
liaison or reporting system might be established to facilitate the flow of information.
6. A corporation should be willing to make a complete commitment of talent and capital if it
establishes its own corporate venture fund. The corporation should then be willing to accept
a limited role. If the corporation is unable to accept a limited role with respect to its own
fund, it may be best for it to participate as an investor in a traditional fund, where such
limitations will be enforced. However, this latter approach may sigtuficantly dilute or eliminate potential for strategic benehts.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of a formal study of the corporate venture capital community
in the United States. We were drawn to this area of study for three primary reasons.
First, an activity that combines the enormous resources of corporate America with the
volatile nature of new ventures holds the promise of dramatic gain or loss. Some corporate
venture funds have started and thrived while others have started, sputtered, and finally
discontinued operations.
Secondly, the very term “corporate venture capital” implies a contradiction.
Large
corporations are generally considered to be nonentrepreneurial
relative to the way they make
decisions and operate. Yet venture capitalists necessarily must function in an entrepreneurial
environment.
This raises questions as to how the two cultures may be reconciled.
Finally, there has been little study of this activity to date. What has been done is more
case oriented rather than focusing broadly on the corporate venture capital community. For
instance, Hardymon, DeNino, and Salter (1983) studied the effectiveness of corporate venture
capital in three major corporations. More recently, Sykes (1986) presented a detailed examination of Exxon’s corporate venture capital activity.
It was hoped that as a result of this study we would better understand:

The objectives of corporate venture capitalists (CVCs);
The manner in which CVCs pursue these objectives including their decision-making
process and how they organize their efforts;
The results of corporate venture capital activity as reflected in obstacles that they encounter
and their performance; and
Perhaps most important, what approach to corporate venture capital is most likely to
produce successful results.
The application

of the above understanding

should have the following practical benefits:

1. Existing CVCs will become more familiar with the activity of their peers and this knowledge should help them to fine-tune their efforts.
2. Corporations contemplating entering the field will be better able to formulate expectations
and ultimately achieve their goals.
3. Entrepreneurs
seeking corporate venture capital will better understand this important
financial resource, hereby improving the efficiency of the venture capital market.

METHODOLOGY
The first stage of the study involved interviews with seven prominent CVCs. The purpose
was to determine which questions they would most like to see answered. The interviews
also gave us a better feel for the diversity of interests, organizations and modes of operation
which characterize the corporate venture capital community.
Next, a questionnaire was designed which focused on:

All responses, with the exception of those related to organization, were scaled on a
four-point scale.
The questionnaire was mailed to a list of 142 corporate venture capitalists. We received
52 responses giving us a response rate of over 35%, thus indicating a high level of interest
in the study. Twenty-nine of these respondents were Fortune 100 companies.
In interpreting the results, the usual selection and social acceptance biases associated
with self-report questionnaire responses need to be taken into account.

RESULTS
Objectives
As shown in Table 1, the objective considered most important by CVCs is return on investment. However, the high standard deviation for this objective indicates that there is not
high consensus as to the importance of this objective. In fact, nearly 42% of the respondents
listed return on investment as less than essential.
Of the objectives related to strategic benefits, the most important was exposure to new
technologies and markets.

Investment Criteria
Means and standard deviation for the responses related to investment criteria appear in Table
2. In general, CVCs appear to screen ventures in a manner similar to that of the independent

capitalists.
Criteria related to the entrepreneur appears to take priority over product,
market, or financial considerations.
This is consistent with past studies examining the investment criteria of independent venture capitalists, such as the study conducted by MacMillan,
Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha
(1985).
However, our findings show that CVCs do deviate in some respects from the independent venture capitalists in the study by MacMillan et al. (1985). Some CVCs heavily
weigh corporate strategic considerations whereas others appear to focus less intently on some
of the qualities of the entrepreneur. These departures are most evident when examining the
10 criteria most frequently rated as essential by CVCs, reported in Table 3, and comparing
these results with those found in the study by MacMillan et al. (1985).
Three new evaluation criteria are included among those most frequently rated as
essential. These include the entrepreneur’s
familiarity with the product, the attractiveness
of the venture’s market or industry to the corporation, and whether the products fit with the
corporation’s long-term strategy. The first of these criteria was not included in the earlier
study, but it seems likely that independent venture capitalists would also deem it to be
important. The latter two criteria relate to strategic benefits to the corporation, and clearly
would be irrelevant to independent venture capitalists. Significantly, both of these strategic
benefit criteria correlate negatively with the criterion that the entrepreneur have demonstrated
leadership ability in the past. In other words, those CVCs that focus on strategic benefit
appear to be more willing to tolerate the absence of an entrepreneur with demonstrated
leadership ability to head up a new venture.
Generally, CVCs also consider financial return and liquidity to be less important than
do independent venture capitalists. This is not surprising given that CVCs are more concerned
with strategic benefit than with financial return.
Three evaluation criteria that are considered to be much less important by CVCs than
independent venture capitalists are indicated in Table 4. All three of these criteria relate to
the entrepreneur.
In summary, the fundamental differences between CVC criteria and those of independent venture capitalists is that CVCs will sacrifice financial and entrepreneur quality
criteria to achieve strategic fit for the corporation. As we shall see below, this is a sacrifice
of dubious value.

activities per se. Means and standard deviations for these obstacles appear in Table 5, while
obstacles
rated by more than 25% of the respondents
as either having a significant or
destructive impact appear in Table 6.

Obstacles Related to Corporate Management
The most damaging obstacle CVCs report in their dealings with corporate management is
the lack of a clear mission regarding venture activity. Other obstacles receiving high ratings
relative to corporate management include inadequate financial commitment, underestimation
of the risk involved in venture investing, and lack of patience related to the time required
for new ventures to achieve success. It is clear that lack of understanding and plain interference on the part of the parent corporation are major sources of frustration in the eyes of
cvcs.

Obstacles Related to Executing the Venture Activity Itself
The most important obstacle related to the venture activity itself is an incompatibility between
corporate and entrepreneurial
cultures. This is closely followed by the lack of authority to
make independent decision, the inability of corporations to attract qualified venture managers,
and a pervasive concern by entrepreneurs that their ventures will be subverted to satisfy the

make decisions without corporate interference, and an inability for the corporation to understand even as it is interfering.

2. The venture is in a market or industry which is attractive to my company.
3. My company is, or will have, the option to be the controlling investor in the venture.

Four obstacles correlate positively with each of these three criteria-lack
of authority
to make independent decisions, inadequate deal flow, fear by entrepreneurs that the venture
will be controlled to satisfy the corporation’s objectives, and incompatibility
between corporate and entrepreneurial
cultures. This we take as strong evidence that an insistence on
corporate strategy criteria causes serious problems in the execution of the CVC’s activity,
at least in the eyes of the CVC managers.
Furthermore,
CVCs who indicate that the option to be a controlling investor is a
condition for funding ventures also indicate that corporate management:
lacks a clear mission regarding venture activity,
makes inadequate financial commitment to venture activity,
0 is impatient regarding the time it takes for new ventures to succeed,
0 is inflexible, and
0 does not encourage support of the activity from other areas within the corporation
l

l

To us this strongly suggests that when corporate management encroaches on the
decision-making
process for venture investing, the corporation becomes less appealing as a
source of funds to the entrepreneur.
Further, in extreme situations, when the corporation
requires complete control of the venture, the potential for conflict not only arises between
the CVC and the entrepreneur, but also between the CVC and corporate management.

Organization
We next asked a series of questions which focus on how corporations organize their venture
capital effort. Frequency of distributions for these responses are reported in Table 8.

Approval Process and Funding
The majority of the CVCs surveyed are given little authority to select which ventures
should be funded without approval from corporate management. Of the total, 51% of the
venture professionals indicated that formal approval from corporate management was required
for ull deals. Another 15% of the CVCs require approval for deals over a designated size.
Thus, nearly two-thirds of all CVCs require formal approval on projects of significant size.
Nearly half of the CVCs surveyed get their deals funded on an ad hoc basis (46%).

Compensation
The majority of CVCs surveyed are compensated in a manner which has little or
nothing to do with the performance of their company’s investment portfolio. It typically
takes several years or longer for ventures to mature into successful companies, yet 6 1% of
the CVCs surveyed reported that they were compensated either by a base salary only or by
a base salary plus a short-term bonus. Only 24% of the CVC (15% of the respondents did
not answer the question) indicated that their compensation was linked to the performance
of their company’s venture activity over the long term (either through a bonus or direct
equity participation in the fund).

Source and Structure of Deals
The most important source of deals for CVCs is via direct contact from entrepreneurs.
This is closely followed by other venture funds in terms of importance. Because many CVCs
have a different orientation than independent venture capitalists, we suspected that CVCs
might experience problems in networking with other venture capitalists. As a result, they
might have access to few deals and few opportunities to participate in syndications. This
suspicion appears to be unfounded. The relatively high ranking of venture funds as a valuable
source of deals and the relatively low rating of the two obstacles “inadequate deal flow”
and “lack of opportunity to participate in syndications” suggest that CVCs’ interaction with
the venture capital community is quite adequate.
There was a high consensus that direct equity was the best approach to structuring a
deal. Objectives of the CVC did not appear to influence structure.

Performance
One important area that we hoped to better understand was the level of performance being
achieved by the CVCs. Since performance is not easily quantified, particularly when associated with strategic benefits, we asked respondents to report their general levels of
satisfaction relative to their various objectives. The means and standard deviations for
responses to this question appear in Table 9.
As a caveat, responses related to performance must be reviewed with care given the
self-report nature of this study, the general way in which the question was asked, and the
subjectivity involved in rating one’s own performance.

Experience Effects
A study by MacMillan, Block, and SubbaNarasimha
(1986) suggested that there are significant experience effects in venturing activities and piqued our interest to explore whether
there were similar effects for corporate venture capital activity.
Therefore, we compared responses of those CVCs who had made more than 10 deals
with those who had made less than 10 (CVCs having made exactly 10 deals were not included
in this part of the analysis, so that the differences between the experienced and less experienced CVCs would be more pronounced).
We thought that experience would be best
measured by number of deals transacted rather than years in business, since a CVC who
had been in existence for several years but had made few deals would still be relatively
inexperienced. The results are presented in Table 10.
It is clear that the more experienced CVCs learn to ameliorate the impact of a number
of obstacles that plague less experienced CVCs. In particular, they learn over time to
overcome some of the key problems identified above, developing some proficiency at handling the relation with the corporation and more expertise at attracting deals from nervous
entrepreneurs. They also learn to deliver return on investment. So, as they gain experience,
they begin to behave more like independent venture capitalists-they
receive more authority
and a more certain financial commitment from the corporation. They are also able to reduce
the impact of a number of obstacles (which are unique to corporate venture capital) and
their performance in return of investment improves.

Ciuster Analysis
The observation that the more experienced venture capital firm secured more antonomy and
also reduced the obstacles while simultaneously
achieving better financial performance led
to another question which has been the focus of considerable discussion in the corporate
venturing area: how much autonomy should be allowed? We hypothesized that the autonomy
of the CVC in relation to its corporate parent would be a significant determinant of effectiveness of venture activity. We therefore subjected the responses to a cluster anaIysis using
the SAS cluster procedure with the responses to the items on funding procedure and approval
procedure as independent variables. Each of these sets of items were treated as a 1 to 4
scale, with low score indicating the highest dependency on corporate and a high score
indicating high autonomy. The tw-o cluster solution revealed a large group of highly controlled
CVCs (62% of respondents) and a smaller group of highly autonomous CVCs (38% of
respondents).
The small cluster we dubbed “pilots” because these members have far greater authority
to make investment decisions and the parent corporation makes a far more permanent and
reliable financial commitment to corporate venture activity. The large cluster we dubbed
“copilots” because this group enjoys significantly less independence: respondents must share

decision-making
authority with corporate management and the corporation’s financial commitment is considerably more uncertain, since capita1 is contributed on a periodic or deal
by deal basis.
Unfettered by constraints imposed by the corporation, one might expect the pilots to
behave in a way that is similar to independent venture capitalists. Conversely, one would
expect the copilots to be significantly influenced by corporate dictate.
Our expectations were borne out by the responses of the two groups with respect to
objectives and investment criteria, as indicated in Table 11.
Almost all of the pilots regarded return on investment as a major objective of venture
investing. In their screening of ventures, this group places relatively heavier emphasis on
entrepreneurial talent and leadership and financial considerations than do the copilots. Criteria
related to strategic benefits weigh less heavily in their investment decisions.
Copilots attach greater importance to strategic benefits. Almost all consider at least
one strategic objective to be essential. Of the 32 respondents in this cluster 19 consider
return on investment a less than essential objective. The investment criteria of this group
reflect the corporate priorities in their criteria. Strategic benefits are much more important
then criteria relating to the entrepreneur and to financial performance.
In order to determine which was the more effective of the pilot and copilot approaches,
responses relative to obstacles and performance were compared. These results are reported
in Table 12.
There were eight instances in which the impact of obstacles were assessed differently
by the two clusters. In every instance, the copilots assessed the obstacles as being more

<-----Page 13----->246

damaging than did the pilots. Four of the obstacles---corporate
managements’ lack of a clear
mission, lack of flexibility, Iack of patience regarding venture activity, and inability to
relinquish control to the CVC-appear
to be a direct resdt of the intimate organization
relationship between the corporation and its copilot CVC. This close relationship also seems
to magnify obstacles related to the appeal of the corporation as a source of funds: the
entrepreneurs’
fear of corporate control and their fear that their ideas will be pirated, a
general incompatibility
between corporate and entrepreneurial cultures, and inadequate deal
flow are all viewed as more serious by the copilots than by the pilots.
This is very strong evidence that when it comes to corporate venture capital, close
control appears to become a serious impediment to such activity.
This argument is further supported by the results on performance. We expected pilots
to report better performance with respect to return on investment, and copilots to report
better performance with respect to achieving strategic benefits. However, while pilots do
report higher satisfaction in achieving return on investment generally, the>?do no wurse than
copilots in achieving strategic benefits (the only exception to this is exposure to acquisition
opportunities).
To check that we were not merely seeing a “replay” of the experience effect discussed
above, we tested to see whether pilots had done significantly more deals than copilots. This
was not the case, indicating that while CVCs tend to gain pilot status with experience, it is
pilot status that is important for performance, whether the CVC is experienced or not.
We take the above results as strong and convincing evidence that the pilots’ approach
to corporate venture capital organization is generally more effective than a copilot approach.
A desire to identify acquisition opportunities seems to be the only excuse for employing the
latter approach. And even then, there are difficulties associated with the acquisition portfolio
companies funded by corporate venture capital (Hardymon, Denino, and Salter 1983).
At this point, one might conclude that if corporate venture capital is to be successful.
CVCs should simply be made clones of independent capitalists.
Our interpretation of the data is that this view is too extreme. In particular, a few
copilots were able to achieve outstanding performance relative to strategic benefit objectives,
as were some pilot CVCs. Clearly further study is needed in order to determine how CVCs
successfully integrate financial and strategic considerations,
and which benefits are most
likely to be achieved.
In summary, we review our two major findings. First, autonomy and a fnm commitment
of capital (the pilot approach) are necessary conditions to provide an environment conducive
to effective corporate venture capital operations. This approach has far less obstacles to
effective CVC operations. Secondly. the pilot approach is successful in producing both return
on investment (no surprise) and strategic benefit (something of a surprise). It appears that
a primary emphasis on strategic benefits increases problems with obstacles. These tindings
are especially noteworthy given that 62% of our respondents are organized using the copilot
approach to corporate venture capital.
