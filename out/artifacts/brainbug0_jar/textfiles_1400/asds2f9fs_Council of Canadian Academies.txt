Innovation and Business
Strategy: Why Canada
Falls Short

PREFACE
The Expert Panel on Business Innovation first met in November
2007, a time when the Toronto Stock Exchange index was nudging
14,000, oil was close to $100 a barrel, the Canadian dollar was
above par with the U.S. dollar, economic growth was solid and the
unemployment rate was at a multi-decade low.
But beneath the bullish daily headline data were worrisome longerterm trends, particularly the poor performance of productivity
growth in Canada. Growth of the hourly output of Canada’s
business sector had been falling behind that of the United States for
more than two decades, and the trend had deteriorated significantly
since 2000. Investment in leading-edge technology — particularly
related to computers and communications — was lagging
significantly behind not only that of the United States, but also many
of the advanced countries with which Canada compares itself.
Business spending on research and development as a share of the
economy was down 20% from its 2001 peak at the end of the
technology boom.
It was in this context of mixed signals — rosy on the surface but less
so underneath — that the Government of Canada asked the Council
of Canadian Academies to appoint a broad-based panel of experts
to assess the innovation performance of Canadian business. This
document is an abridged version of the panel’s findings.

The panel focused its analysis primarily on long-run
phenomena, stretching over decades and across several
ups and downs of the economic cycle. Its findings
therefore remain relevant despite the severe shock to
the global economy.
While the panel was completing its work in late 2008 and early 2009,
the world changed dramatically. Because the extent of the global
economic crisis — its depth, duration and ultimate impact on Canada’s
economy and society — is unknown, its full implications for the panel’s
analysis will only become clear with the passage of time. The panel has
therefore not attempted to factor the crisis prominently into its
diagnosis of business innovation in Canada — a longer-term
perspective is needed in any event. The symptoms of lagging
innovation by the business sector in Canada are of very long standing.
The panel therefore focused primarily on long-run phenomena,
stretching over decades and across several ups and downs of the
economic cycle. The panel’s findings remain relevant despite the
severe contemporary shock to the global economy. As governments in
Canada continue to take measures in the near term to mitigate the
downturn, a sound diagnosis of the underlying causes of Canada’s
generally weak business innovation performance can help to target
those measures so that they also strengthen the nation’s economy for
the long term.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.

In assessing the fundamental factors that influence business innovation
behaviour in Canada, the panel has regarded innovation as an economic
process rather than as a primarily science and engineering activity. The
report’s focus is on the long run, across several turns of the economic cycle,
and thus remains relevant despite the severe current shock to the global
economy. As requested by the government, the panel’s report is diagnostic
rather than policy prescriptive.

2.

Innovation is new or better ways of doing valued things. An “invention” is
not an innovation until it has been implemented to a meaningful extent.
Innovation is not limited to products but includes improved processes and
new forms of business organization. Innovation is of great economic
importance because it is, directly or indirectly, the key driver of labour
productivity growth (increased output per hour worked) and thus the main
source of national prosperity.

3.

Canada has a serious productivity growth problem. Since 1984, relative
labour productivity in Canada’s business sector has fallen from more than
90% of the U.S. level, to about 76% in 2007. Over the 1985-2006 period,
Canada’s average labour productivity growth ranked 15th out of 18
comparator countries in the OECD group.

4.

Canada’s relatively poor productivity growth is due mainly to weak growth
of multifactor productivity (MFP), which measures broadly the effectiveness
with which labour and capital are used in the economy. The problem is not
caused by shortcomings in Canada’s workforce or inadequate capital
investment (with the exception of significantly lagging investment in
information and communications technology (ICT)).

5.

6.

7.

8.

The rate of MFP growth over suitably long periods primarily reflects the
contribution to labour productivity growth of business innovation —
including better organization of work, improved business models, the
efficient incorporation of new technology, the payoff from R&D, and the
insights of entrepreneurs. Canada’s weak MFP growth indicates that the
country’s lagging productivity growth is largely due to weak business
innovation.
Canada’s innovation weakness is also signalled by conventional indicators.
For example, business R&D in Canada, as a percentage of GDP, declined by
20% between the collapse of the technology boom in 2001 and 2007, and
has consistently fallen below the OECD average. Canada’s failure to develop
many innovative Canadian-based multinationals has been a key contributor
to the country’s overall R&D weakness. A lack of global export leaders in
advanced equipment for the resource sector is also an indicator of the
country’s innovation shortcomings.
Investment at the leading edge of technology (which represents the indirect
acquisition of innovation) has also lagged. Empirical evidence suggests a
correlation between investment in machinery and equipment and MFP
growth. The most significant and puzzling area of lagging investment has
been in ICT where average investment per worker in Canada was only about
60% of the U.S. level in 2007. Investment in ICT is an important driver of
productivity growth, particularly in many service-producing industries that
are the main source of job growth in advanced economies. The ICT
investment picture is consistent with the view that Canadian businesses on
the whole — but always with notable exceptions — are technology
followers, not leaders.

Business strategy drives innovative behaviour. The starting point of any
exercise that aims to improve Canada’s innovation and productivity
performance should therefore be to understand why relatively few Canadian
businesses choose strategies that emphasize innovation. A focus on the
determinants of business strategy, rather than on innovation activities
themselves, is the most significant new contribution of this study.

9.

The principal factors that influence the business innovation decision can be
categorized broadly as (i) particular characteristics of the firm’s sector; (ii)
the state of competition; (iii) the climate for new ventures; (iv) public
policies that encourage or inhibit innovation; and (v) business ambition
(e.g., entrepreneurial aggressiveness and growth orientation). The relative
importance of these factors will vary from sector to sector and over the
lifecycle of individual firms. (These factors are analyzed fully in the panel’s
report.)

10. The foregoing factors are themselves influenced by certain long-standing
features of Canada’s economy — in particular:

 Canada is “upstream” in many North American industries. This
positioning is related to the traditional resource dependence of
Canada’s economy and the extent of foreign control. Upstream
positioning limits contact with ultimate end-customers who are a
strong source of motivation and direction for innovation.

 Canada’s domestic market is relatively small and geographically
fragmented. Small markets offer lower potential reward for
undertaking the risk of innovation and tend to attract fewer
competitors, and thus provide less incentive for a business to innovate
in order to survive. On the other hand, the innovation success of
countries like Finland and Sweden shows that the disadvantage of a
small domestic market can be offset by a strong orientation toward
innovation-intensive exports.
11. There is no single cause of the innovation problem in Canada, nor is there
any one-size-fits-all remedy. Public policy in respect of innovation therefore
needs to be informed by a deep understanding of the factors that influence
business decision makers, sector by sector. This requires consultation with
business people themselves as well as the further development of
innovation surveys and other forms of micro-analysis of the innovation
process.
12. Overarching the sector-specific factors that influence innovation strategies,
there are certain issues identified in the panel’s analysis that suggest the
need for proactive public policies to:

 encourage investment in advanced machinery and equipment (M&E) in
general, and in ICT in particular (such incentives should be designed
only in light of a more thorough understanding of the reasons for the
relatively slow adoption of ICT in Canada to date);

 sharpen the incentive for innovation-oriented business strategies by
increasing exposure to competition and by promoting a stronger export
orientation on the part of Canadian firms, particularly in goods and
services that are downstream in the value chain and thus close to endusers;

 improve the climate for new ventures so as to better translate
opportunities arising from Canada’s university research excellence into
viable Canadian-based growth businesses, bearing in mind that better
early-stage financing and experienced mentorship hold the key; and

 support areas of particular Canadian strength and opportunity through
focused, sector-oriented strategies as was done in the past in, for
example, the automotive, aerospace and ICT industries.
13. The many successes of Canadian businesses in the hyper-competitive
global marketplace show that there is nothing innate or inevitable in the
national character that prevents Canada’s businesses from being just as
innovative and productive as those of other nations.
14. As governments in Canada continue to take measures in the near term to
mitigate the current global economic downturn, the panel’s diagnosis of
the nature and underlying causes of Canada’s business innovation
performance can help to target those measures so that they also
strengthen the nation’s economy for the long term.

1. INTRODUCTION
Innovation — new or better ways of doing valued things — is the
manifestation of creativity, the uniquely human capacity to
transform the imagined into the real. Innovation matters
enormously for society because it is the means by which problems
are solved and new opportunities are created. Innovation is what
gave us insulin, the telephone, movies, the microchip and the
shopping mall, for better or worse.
Innovation matters for businesses because novel products and more
efficient processes are the principal means of making businesses
more competitive. It is through innovation that businesses find ways
to generate more value from existing resources. As will be argued in
what follows, innovation is thus the main driver of productivity
growth — the increased output of goods and services per hour
worked. Productivity growth is, in turn, associated with the
international competitiveness and commercial dynamism on which
high employment and good jobs ultimately depend.
Looking forward, we see a convergence of trends that make
innovation more necessary than ever:

 Intensified global competition, particularly the exceptionally
rapid emergence of China, India, Brazil and Russia as
economic powers, is creating both growing challenges and
opportunities for Canada.

 Less resource-intensive and environmentally damaging
methods of production need to be developed through
innovation to permit the continuation of economic growth and
the realization of its benefits in the still-developing world.

 An aging population in Canada is making productivity growth
imperative as the proportion of population that is of working
age plateaus and then declines.

 Continuing revolutionary developments in the transformative
technologies of information and communications, life sciences
and advanced materials provide extraordinary opportunities to
benefit from their innovative application.
We must therefore be concerned in the face of evidence suggesting
that Canadian business on the whole, though with notable
exceptions, is lagging in innovation relative not only to the United
States, but also to many of our peer group of economically
advanced countries in the OECD.
The Charge to the Panel
The question is “why”. If innovation is good for business, why is
Canadian business on the whole apparently less committed to
innovation than analysts and policy makers believe it should be?
The question is all the more puzzling since it has been asked for
decades, yet things have not changed much in relative terms. The
causes of Canada’s innovation deficiency must therefore run deep
in the nature of the economy, and perhaps in Canadian society as
well.
To the extent that some of the causes might be mitigated by more
appropriate public policies, it is important that governments have a
sound diagnosis of what ails business innovation propensity in

Canada. To this end, the federal Minister of Industry asked the
Council of Canadian Academies to appoint a panel of business,
labour and academic experts to answer the following questions:

 How should the innovation performance of Canadian firms be
assessed?

 How innovative are Canadian firms, and what do we know
about their innovation performance at a national, regional and
sector level?

 Why is business demand for innovation inputs (for example,
research and development, machinery and equipment, and
skilled workers) weaker in Canada than in many other OECD
countries?

 What are the contributing factors, and what is the relative
importance of these contributing factors?
Outline
Despite an outpouring of research and commentary over the years
on the innovation behaviour of Canadian business, the understanding
of it remains incomplete. The aim of this report is to contribute to a
greater understanding through analysis and diagnosis based on
existing literature and the experience of panel members. No new
studies were undertaken. The panel was not asked to provide policy
recommendations, though much of its diagnosis of business
innovation performance is of policy relevance. Where findings have
direct implications for policy, the panel has usually taken the
opportunity to make the implications explicit.*
The report is organized as follows:

 Section 2 defines the concept of innovation employed in the
report and presents evidence of the impact of innovation on
productivity growth in Canada.

 Section 3 provides a quantitative description of the innovation
activities of Canadian business relative to Canada’s peer group
of economically advanced countries.

 Section 4 establishes a framework for the panel’s analysis by
identifying the key factors that influence a firm’s decision
regarding the emphasis to be placed on innovation in its
business strategy. The most important factors in this regard are
(i) the structural characteristics of the Canadian economy; (ii)
the state of competition; (iii) the conditions that favour, or
inhibit, the creation and growth of new innovative businesses;
(iv) public policies that have significant impact on innovation;
and (v) business ambition.

 Sections 5 through 9 address each of the foregoing factors,
assessing their impact on business decisions regarding
innovation.

 Section 10 presents several short case studies on sectors of the
Canadian economy — automotive, life sciences, banking, and
information and communications technologies. The case
studies contribute concreteness to the overall story and
illustrate the great diversity and complexity of the innovation
problematique in Canada.

 Section 11 summarizes the key conclusions of the report.

document) where data or publications are directly quoted in this digest version. A comprehensive list of references appears in the full report, available on the Council’s
website at www.scienceadvice.ca, in June 2009.

2. THE NATURE AND IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATION
Innovation occurs in the economy in two distinct but
complementary ways — “radical” innovation and “incremental”
innovation. Radical innovations like the steam engine, canned food,
the automobile, television and the transistor are often science or
engineering based, and create entirely new markets where
innovation initially evolves rapidly and competitive races sort out
the fit from the unfit. This invention-driven form of innovation is
what most people have in mind when they think of “innovation”.
The ultimate economic benefits (jobs and income growth) of a
blockbuster innovation usually diffuse broadly and rapidly beyond
the firm and location where the innovation originates. For instance,
while the microchip and the personal computer may have been
pioneered by a small number of companies in the United States
(e.g., Apple, IBM and Intel), many of the resulting production jobs
migrated elsewhere and, more important by far, the productivity
benefits of the resulting information and communication
technologies (ICT) revolution continue to accrue to users
worldwide. This is a spectacular example of the “spillover” benefit
of innovation generally, and of research and development (R&D)
investment in particular.
Much more pervasive is incremental innovation in which goods and
services, and their means of production, marketing and distribution,
are being continuously improved. Incremental innovation — in
which developments are typically “new to the firm”, or perhaps to a
sector, but not “new to the world” — is what drives productivity
growth and firm competitiveness in established markets. Since
established markets constitute the great bulk of economic activity,
incremental innovation is directly responsible for the vast majority
of labour productivity growth.
For analytical and statistical purposes, the OECD defines business
innovation as “…the implementation of a new or significantly
improved product (good or service), or process, a new marketing
method, or a new organizational method in business practices,
workplace organization or external relations”.1 This definition
implies that:

 an innovation is not simply an invention, or even a practical
prototype. There must be implementation to a meaningful
extent.

 innovation is not limited to products and services, nor to the
direct application of science and technology. Indeed, many of
the most far-reaching business innovations — e.g., the factory
assembly line, television advertising, just-in-time inventory
management, web-based commerce and artistic
commercializations like rock music — have little to do with the
traditional image of breakthrough products coming out of the
lab, much less simply to the application of R&D or the grant
of a patent.
The concept of innovation used in this report is intentionally broad
and encompasses not only the direct innovative activities initiated
within a business but also the capital investment and knowledge
acquisition by which the business captures and employs innovation
that is generated elsewhere. That is because most of the innovation
that is ultimately used in a particular business originates outside the

business itself and is acquired through investment in machinery and
equipment, and by adaptation of leading-edge knowledge that is
circulating in business and academic environments.
The focus of this report is on innovation in the business sector,
which accounts for about 85% of Canada’s output. Of course,
innovation also occurs in the public and not-for-profit sectors.
Public-sector investments in infrastructure, education, R&D, health
and social services are essential complements to private-sector
innovation, but this report does not analyze these
complementarities in depth.
Why Innovation Matters
Innovation drives an economy’s ability to create more economic
value from an hour of work. The resulting productivity growth
creates the potential for rising wages and incomes, and thus for a
higher standard of living. Canada’s experience shows that natural
resources can also make a region wealthy so long as supply lasts,
prices are strong and the environmental costs are acceptable. But
these favourable conditions may be unsustainable or out of a
nation’s control. Moreover, resource production itself requires
continuous innovation to increase efficiency, extend supply and
mitigate environmental impacts.

The ultimate economic benefits (jobs and income
growth) of a blockbuster innovation usually diffuse
broadly and rapidly beyond the firm and location where
the innovation originates.

While resource price booms may be welcomed, they lead to
appreciation of the exchange value of the Canadian dollar and thus
undermine the cost competitiveness of Canada’s non-resource
sectors that are exposed to international competition. These sectors,
which constitute a much larger share of Canada’s workforce and
total output than the primary resource industries, will survive only
by becoming much more productive and, to that end, more
innovative.
A Long-Term Perspective on Canada’s Economic Performance
If Canadian business has lagged seriously in terms of innovation, the
consequences should show up in macroeconomic comparisons with
peer countries, and in fact they do.
Canada’s average living standard, measured as GDP per capita, has
closely tracked behind that of the United States for as long as
comparative estimates have been made. Output per person in the
United States has always exceeded that of Canada, usually by about
20%, though with substantial fluctuations. When Canada has fallen
too far behind, implicit forces — economic, attitudinal and political
— have always eventually come into play to restore the balance. But
history is not destiny. Indeed, the restorative forces that keep the
relative gap from widening indefinitely are brought to bear only
through the conscious actions of business and political leaders, and
of Canadians themselves.

<-----Page 4----->Page 5

Per capita output (GDP divided by total population) is, by
definition, output per hour worked (labour productivity) multiplied
by hours worked per capita (a measure of overall labour utilization
in the economy). Hours worked per capita have trended up in
recent years in Canada and in 2007 exceeded the comparable
measure in the United States by about 4%. Thus the roughly 20%
gap between the United States and Canada in respect of per capita
output today is due entirely to a lower level of labour productivity in
Canada. Moreover, since the demographics of Canada’s aging
population will constrain the future increase of hours worked per
capita, the growth of output per person in Canada will depend
increasingly, if not entirely, on productivity growth.

The conclusions of the analysis, in summary, are as follows:

 As the top panel in Figure 2 shows, between 1961 and 1980
(middle set of bars) average annual labour productivity growth
in Canada (2.9%) outstripped that of the United States (2.5%).
Over that period, improvement in the skills composition of
the workforce — measured by changes in average educational
attainment and years of work experience — advanced more
rapidly in Canada. There was also greater capital deepening in
Canada — i.e., more rapid growth of productivity-enhancing
capital per hour worked. These factors favouring labour
productivity growth in Canada were partly offset by
significantly lower MFP growth in Canada (0.7% per year)
compared to the United States (1.5%) — the bottom panel in
the figure.

Innovation encompasses not only the direct innovative
activities initiated within a business but also the
capital investment and knowledge acquisition by which
the business captures and employs innovation that is
generated elsewhere.

 In the period since 1980 (the right side of Figure 2), average
productivity growth in the U.S. (2.2%) has significantly
outpaced that of Canada (1.5%), particularly since 2000. The
rate of growth of capital intensity and improvement in
workforce skills has been roughly similar, on average, in both
countries, but the rate of MFP growth in the U.S. has
averaged about five times that of Canada. In the most recent
10-year period, 1996-2006 (not shown in Figure 2),
productivity growth increased in Canada (averaging 1.8% per
year), but not nearly to the extent seen in the United States
(2.8%). Again the Canada-U.S. difference reflects, almost
entirely, much slower MFP growth in Canada.

Canada was rapidly closing the labour productivity gap with the
United States until the early 1980s (Figure 1). Since 1984, relative
productivity in Canada’s business sector has fallen from more than
90% of the U.S. level to about 76% in 2007. This near quartercentury of relative decline in Canada’s productivity is ominous in
view of the nation’s dependency on strong productivity growth to
sustain prosperity.

Figure 1*: Relative Productivity Levels in the Business Sector
Canada was rapidly closing the productivity gap with the U.S. until the early 1980s. The strength of
U.S. productivity growth since the mid 1990s is primarily associated with the production and use of
information and communication technologies.

Statistics Canada has analyzed the differences in labour productivity
growth between the business sectors of Canada and the United
States over the 45-year period, 1961-2006, and identified the
relative contributions due to (i) upgrading of the labour force, (ii)
“deepening” of the capital stock, and (iii) increases in multifactor
productivity.2 Multifactor productivity (MFP) reflects, among other
things, the contribution to productivity from aspects of innovation
not already embodied in the capital stock. The results of the
productivity growth comparison are summarized in Figure 2 where
the time period covers the entire span of years from 1961 to 2006
(left side of Figure 2) and the two sub periods (1961-80 and 19802006) that capture roughly the times when Canada was narrowing
the productivity gap and when it was falling further behind.
* Data sources for figures are listed at the end of this document.

Figure 2: Accounting for Productivity Growth
Labour productivity growth can be accounted for by increasing capital intensity, improvement in
workforce skills and a residual called multifactor productivity (MFP) — which broadly reflects the
effectiveness with which labour and capital are used. Growth rates in the top panel are the sum of
growth rates of the factors in the bottom three panels. The time periods cover the total 45-year
interval (leftmost bars) and two sub periods when Canada was closing the productivity gap (roughly
1961-1980) and falling behind (roughly 1980-2006).

<-----Page 5----->Page 6

For a time — between 1961 and the mid-1980s — Canada’s strong
growth in capital intensity and more rapid improvement in the skill
level of the workforce were able to offset persistently weak MFP
growth. But that has long since ceased to be the case. Over the
1985-2006 period, Canada’s average labour productivity growth
ranked 15th out of 18 comparator countries in the OECD and weak
MFP growth was the principal cause (Figure 3). To reverse that
dismal trend is the core economic challenge facing Canada.
CONTRIBUTIONS OF MFP AND CAPITAL DEEPENING TO LABOUR
PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
1985-2006*

* Data for some countries are for shorter periods — refer to original source for details.

Figure 3: Contributions of MFP and Capital Deepening to Labour
Productivity Growth
The OECD’s decomposition of productivity growth into components reflecting MFP and capital
intensity employs a less sophisticated methodology than the Canada-U.S. comparison in Figure 2
owing to less complete and consistent data across OECD countries.

The Significance and Meaning of Multifactor Productivity
Intuitively, changes in MFP measure that portion of labour
productivity growth that can not be accounted for by measured
growth of both capital intensity and the quality of the workforce.
MFP is what is left over. Most significant for this discussion is that
MFP growth contains the macroeconomic signature of aggregate
business innovation — the extraction of increasing value from inputs
of capital and labour through inventive activity. Two examples will
illustrate:

 Consider the addition of a drive-through window in a fast food
outlet. A small amount of construction and one or two extra
servers could substantially increase sales volume by expanding
the effective “seating capacity” of the restaurant, and, more
importantly, by increasing service convenience and thereby
attracting more customers. After accounting for the modest
capital cost of installing the drive-through window and some
extra labour, the remainder of the increased output is chalked
up to MFP growth.

 Consider a sales force in the field before the advent of the
cellphone or, better yet, the BlackBerry. Today’s relatively
inexpensive wireless capital equipment has amplified greatly
the value of each field employee, not only through more
efficient allocation of time but also through more timely and
co-ordinated service for customers. While some of the added
value comes from new investment in equipment, most is
measured as an increase in MFP.
Micro-examples like these can be multiplied endlessly. In each case,
we see an innovation that may be based on science and technology

(e.g., the BlackBerry) or on some very simple engineering combined
with entrepreneurial insight (e.g., the drive-through window). The
economic impact of thousands upon thousands of such innovations,
large and small, is huge.
There is an important interaction between new capital investment
(which embodies prior innovation) and MFP since successive
generations of capital induce complementary, and often highly
innovative, changes in the organization of work and the training of
employees — e.g., as the adoption of computer and communications
technologies has done. Thus the distinction between the component
of productivity growth ascribed to more and better capital, and the
component ascribed to MFP, can be somewhat artificial. The impact
of technological innovation on productivity growth enters jointly
through both channels.
Since MFP is the residual after improvements in labour quality and
capital intensity have been accounted for, it reflects all other factors
that affect labour productivity. So the innovation signal in MFP
growth comes mixed with a lot of “noise”. These other confounding
factors include, prominently, changes in capacity utilization caused
by booms and recessions, and changes in economies of scale that
might be due to opening up of large new markets.

 When the economy slows, capital and workers may be
underutilized yet much of their cost continues to be registered;
thus some of the decline in output shows up as a temporary
decrease in MFP. This business cycle effect can distort shortterm comparisons, but the 45 years of data in Figure 2 are
more than sufficient to average out such cyclical distortions.

 The effect on productivity due to efficiencies derived through
economies of scale shows up as MFP. Such effects may arise
from growing markets, as would typically occur after trade
liberalization (e.g., NAFTA), which has facilitated Canada’s
access to much larger markets. Canadian MFP should have
benefited from this increased scale to a greater extent than the
United States has since the late 1980s. Thus changes in scale
economies can not explain the slower MFP growth in Canada
— in fact, the effect of scale economies since the 1980s would
be expected to be the opposite.
The analysis of growth rates summarized in Figure 2 applies the
same procedures to both Canadian and U.S. data, minimizing the
effect of methodological differences or errors. For these reasons, the
long-term comparisons of MFP growth rates presented in Figures 2
and 3 primarily reflect differences in business innovation,
understood in the broad sense used in this report.
Innovation, MFP Growth and Productivity Growth
The long-term analyses by Statistics Canada and the OECD show
that Canada’s relatively poor productivity growth is due almost
entirely to weak MFP growth. The panel believes that the rate of
MFP growth over suitably long periods is primarily due to business
innovation — including better organization of work, improved
business models, the efficient incorporation of new technology, and
the payoff from R&D and from the insights of entrepreneurs. The
panel therefore concludes that Canada’s weak productivity growth
over the past two decades is largely due to weak business innovation
performance.

3. THE INNOVATION PERFORMANCE OF CANADIAN
BUSINESS
The purpose of this section is to answer the first two questions in the
charge to the panel: (i) How should the innovation performance of
Canadian firms be assessed? (ii) How innovative are Canadian firms,
and what do we know about their innovation performance at a
national, regional and sector level?
How Should Innovation Performance be Assessed?
Only certain aspects of innovation are directly observable — for
example:

 Inputs like R&D, investment in advanced equipment or
venture capital financing for new businesses.

 Outputs like the fraction of sales contributed by products
introduced within, say, the past three years.

 Outcomes like market share in sectors that are considered to
be technologically dynamic. At the level of the entire economy,
or for major sectors, the outcome of innovation is best
indicated by the long-term growth of MFP.
Each of the foregoing groups of metrics has limitations and captures
only a portion of the total innovation process. Individual firm
performance can be correlated with measures of innovation through
formal innovation surveys conducted by national statistical agencies.
These, together with surveys of advanced technology use, have been
carried out for many years by Statistics Canada and produce valuable
micro-level data on firm behaviour in respect of innovation. In view
of the need to gain a much deeper understanding of innovation, it is
essential that Statistics Canada continues to build on its leading
capabilities to conduct deeper and more extensive innovation surveys
and analysis.

ecosystem, but are not readily captured in aggregate statistical
measures, though Statistics Canada has done valuable initial work to
develop a framework for such measures.3

Research & Development
Business expenditure on research and development (BERD) is a
particularly relevant indicator because it has been found to correlate
closely with other indicators of innovation activity, including microdata collected through innovation surveys. Most sectors of the
economy do little or no R&D. (About 80% of business R&D in
Canada takes place in sectors that account for about 25% of GDP.)
Innovation is not absent in sectors that perform little R&D, but is
likely to be manifested as improved management practices and
organization of work, and through employment of capital equipment.
Machinery and equipment is the embodiment of R&D, and is a
critical link in the chain of economic value creation, whether it is
performed directly by a business firm or acquired indirectly.
R&D spending by business is of interest to policy-makers in view of
strong evidence that R&D has large spillover benefits with “social”
returns usually exceeding the private returns to the businesses that
undertake the R&D. Business R&D spending in Canada was $15.8
billion in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, BERD grew more rapidly
than the total economy, particularly during the technology boom
from 1996 to 2001 when BERD almost doubled, driven by the surge
in the ICT sector, led by Nortel. Since the collapse of the technology
boom in 2001, BERD has remained roughly flat after taking account
of inflation. Canada’s BERD intensity (BERD as a percentage of
GDP) actually declined by 20% between 2001 and 2007 and has
consistently remained below the OECD average (Figure 4). Finland,
meanwhile, achieved an exceptionally rapid increase in BERD
intensity during the 1990s, reflecting that country’s concerted effort
to become one of the world’s technological leaders (Box A).

Over the 1985-2006 period, Canada’s average labour
productivity growth ranked 15th out of 18 comparator
countries in the OECD and weak MFP growth was the
principal cause. To reverse that dismal trend is the core
economic challenge facing Canada.

Measures of Innovation Inputs
The following sections describe the principal statistical facts
regarding Canada’s performance in respect of R&D, employment of
highly skilled people, and investment in machinery and equipment.
Other key inputs, which include technology partnerships,
outsourcing contracts, consulting relationships, and venture and
angel investors, are increasingly important parts of an innovation

How Innovative is Canadian Business?
The panel addressed this question by examining the principal input,
output and outcome measures of innovation, drawing on
international comparisons with a peer group of about 20 of the larger
and most economically advanced OECD countries and, more
specifically, with the United States. Although Canada is not strictly
comparable to the United States in view of the vast difference in size
and industrial structure, the close proximity and economic links
between the two countries make comparison both inevitable and
instructive. While no single indicator provides an adequate measure
of the innovation performance of Canadian business, the following
constellation of indicators yields a consistent and reliable picture.

Figure 4: Trend in BERD Intensity
BERD intensity in Canada declined by 20% between 2001 and 2007 reflecting the pull back in
Canada’s large telecom equipment sector. The commitment of Finland to innovation-led growth
accelerated sharply in the wake of a severe banking crisis in 1991, exacerbated by weakness in
Finland’s traditional exports following the collapse of the USSR.

Within Canada there is considerable provincial variation of BERD
intensity. Only Québec and Ontario have levels at or near the
OECD average, reflecting the relatively heavy weight of
manufacturing and certain R&D-intensive industries, such as
pharmaceuticals and ICT, in those provincial economies.

<-----Page 7----->Page 8

BOX A: FINLAND’S INNOVATION STRATEGY
The stimulus for Finland’s commitment to an innovation-led economic
strategy appears to have come in large part from the severe economic crisis
of 1991 when the Finnish economy was devastated by the simultaneous
impact of a near collapse of the domestic banking system and a massive
export market disruption due to the disintegration of the USSR. Through the
concerted effort of the government and the business sector, Finland
committed to transform its economy into one of the most technologically
advanced in the world. While the ICT sector has been responsible for a great
deal of Finland’s remarkable R&D growth, the country also stepped up its
innovation performance in traditional resource sectors like forestry. Finland’s
success was also due to the fact that it was much less affected than Canada
by the communications sector pullback after 2001. This is because the
Finnish ICT industry, and notably Nokia, was more heavily oriented to mobile
communications products and to the global consumer segment.
Finland’s experience shows that a concerted strategy to focus resources on
innovative activity and investments, and to nurture globally oriented national
companies and sectors, can transform a national economy from laggard to
leader in a remarkably short period of time. It must be acknowledged,
however, that Finland’s relatively small size (population of 5.3 million) and
cohesive culture make for a significant difference compared with a much
larger and highly diverse and regionalized country like Canada.

Canada’s total R&D intensity — including business, higher education
and governments — was 1.9% in 2006, placing Canada 11th in its peer
group of 20 OECD countries. Weakness in BERD intensity has
been partly offset by a sharp increase in higher education R&D
(HERD) since the late 1990s (Figure 5), which reflects a significant
allocation of federal government funds over the past decade or so to
support university- and hospital-based research via major new
initiatives including the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Genome
Canada, the Canada Research Chairs and the research granting
councils. GOVERD intensity — R&D performed within government
departments and agencies — has meanwhile declined more or less
steadily since the early 1980s.
There are potentially significant complementarities among R&D
performed by businesses (more “D” than “R”), in universities (more

*Expenditure on R&D performed in Canada by institutional groups.

Figure 5: Trends in Components of R&D Intensity in Canada
Heavy investment in university R&D (HERD) — led by the federal government once budgets swung
into surplus in the late 1990s — boosted Canada’s HERD intensity to second place in the OECD
(behind Sweden) in 2007. In recent years, all three major categories of R&D intensity have been flat

“R” than “D”) and in government laboratories (R&D applied in
support of policy objectives, including intermediation between basic
and applied knowledge). In view of its large public investment in
university research, Canada could further benefit from improved
R&D co-operation between universities, businesses and, in many
cases, government scientific establishments. While Canadian
academic science has received international recognition, the direct
payoff from this investment in terms of new businesses created has
been meagre. The relative weakness of business R&D and the
disappointing level of university research commercialization appear
to be two symptoms of the same underlying condition — a lack of
orientation by Canadian business to the commercial exploitation of
opportunities at the leading edge of science and technology.

Highly Qualified People
The productivity gap that has opened up between Canada and the
United States since the mid-1980s has not been due to any measured
relative deterioration in Canada’s workforce. Indeed, among OECD
countries, Canada has the highest proportion of workers who have
completed post-secondary education — 46% in 2005. Although only
about 39% of U.S. workers have post-secondary credentials, among
these there is a higher proportion with university degrees than in
Canada, where community college diplomas are much more
prevalent. There is also a higher proportion of U.S. workers with
advanced graduate degrees, indicating greater demand for the most
technically sophisticated skills. The demand by businesses for
research-level skills is in fact closely correlated with BERD intensity
across OECD countries.
A higher proportion of managerial employees in the United States,
relative to Canada, has university degrees, and the proportion of
those with business degrees appears to be more than double. There
is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that technology-based startups in
Canada suffer from deficient business management skills, particularly
when compared with the United States where the pool of
experienced technology executives is exceptionally deep. Business
school programs focused on technology entrepreneurship can
complement practical experience and mentorship in solving the new
venture management problem.

Investment in Machinery and Equipment
Investment in advanced machinery and equipment (M&E) is a
principal source of productivity growth, both through its direct
labour-augmenting effect and through its induced impact on
innovation, including innovations in the business reorganization
required to fully exploit new M&E. (Most of this induced impact is
captured statistically as part of MFP growth.)
Canadian industries have largely relied on leading-edge capital
equipment provided from other countries. Canadian innovation was
therefore more likely to be manifested as adaptation of technical
equipment than as the development of sector-leading capital goods
industries. This has been particularly notable and puzzling in forest
products, mining and fisheries where, despite a comparative
advantage in resource endowment, Canada did not develop leading
global firms in machinery for these industries. Canada’s failure to
develop global export leaders in advanced M&E for the resource
sector is one particularly telling indicator of the country’s innovation
shortcomings.

<-----Page 8----->Page 9

Investment in M&E by Canadian business has not always lagged the
United States as has been the case with R&D, though a gap has
opened up since the early 1990s (Figure 6). The gap has been almost
entirely due to Canada’s persistently weaker investment in ICT. This
gap is particularly significant since the near consensus among
economists is that the ICT-producing sector drove the productivity
revival in the United States during the 1990s. Since then, the
influence of ICT has been primarily to drive productivity growth in
sectors that use ICT intensively. Studies of the introduction of ICT
show that the technology by itself will not boost aggregate
productivity growth unless accompanied by training and significant
changes (i.e., innovation) in business organization and work
practices.
M&E INVESTMENT INTENSITY
1987-2007

Figure 6: M&E Investment Intensity
This chart traces annual investment in nominal terms (i.e., using current prices) as a percentage of
nominal GDP. Since ICT prices, per unit of performance, have fallen substantially (especially for
microelectronics and optical communications), the performance-adjusted “volume” of ICT investment
would be much greater than the chart suggests. Note that Canada’s non-ICT investment ratio
increased from 1993 to 1998, despite Canadian dollar weakness (which increased the cost of
imported capital goods) and has been flat to declining since 2002 even as the dollar strengthened.

Why has the ICT investment gap between Canada and the United
States remained so large? One study found that about 20% of the
Canada-U.S. gap was due to industry structure differences — e.g.,
Canada has a smaller share of output in ICT-intensive industries and
a slightly higher proportion of small firms, which tend to invest less
in ICT. The study was not able to account definitively for the
majority of the ICT investment gap but noted anecdotal evidence
that differences between the United States and Canada in terms of
business “culture” and intensity of competition are contributors,
although the hard evidence is still inconclusive. 4
The panel believes that the ICT investment picture is consistent with
the view that Canadian businesses on the whole — but always with
notable exceptions — are technology followers, not leaders, and are
reluctant to adopt new practices until they have been well proven
south of the border. In today’s fast-paced world, that strategy is
unlikely to work as well as it once did.
Measures of Innovation Outputs
The results of innovation surveys indicate generally that Canada
ranks ahead of most European countries in terms of the proportion
of manufacturing firms that self-report to be innovative. But the
proportion of sales derived from innovative products has consistently
been reported to be lower for Canadian businesses than for their
European counterparts. Survey data of this type promise eventually

to yield much deeper insight into innovation behaviour than can be
conveyed by aggregates like national R&D spending. But the
coverage and methodology have not yet reached the point where
firm conclusions can be drawn. The continuation of innovation
surveys and the further development of their methodology may be
the best way to improve both the understanding of business
innovation and the design of policies to foster innovation.
Measures of Innovation Outcomes
Reliable and internationally comparable measures of innovation
outcomes are even more elusive than measures of innovation output.
For reasons explained in Section 2, the growth rate of MFP is the
best overall indicator of innovation outcome at the aggregate level.
Sustained weakness in MFP growth is the most compelling indicator
that Canada has a business innovation problem, and that this
problem is the primary source of Canada’s lagging labour
productivity growth.
Composite Indicators of Innovation
The business media publicize various global competitiveness and
innovation rankings primarily based on surveys of executives and
other stakeholders. The World Economic Forum, which has tracked
and refined its criteria over many years, appears to provide the most
reliable of such rankings. The overall message is consistent with the
objective statistics — i.e., Canada is a mid-to-low performer among
peer group countries in terms of business innovation. The quality of
Canada’s research institutions is considered to be world class, and
there appears to be an ample supply of scientists and engineers — in
fact, slightly more ample than U.S. business people believe their own
supply to be. On the other hand, university-industry collaboration is
seen as quite weak in Canada as is the perception of Canada’s
“capacity for innovation” — i.e., the extent to which companies
conduct formal research and pioneer their own new products and
processes.5

The ICT investment picture is consistent with the view
that Canadian businesses on the whole — but always
with notable exceptions — are technology followers,
not leaders.
Canada’s Subpar Innovation Performance
Given the unimpressive long-term trend in the level and growth of
business sector productivity in Canada, there is no reason to believe
that Canada excels in the areas of innovation that are not captured by
conventional metrics such as R&D and M&E investment.
Weaknesses in the less easily quantified dimensions of innovation
would be expected to show up in subpar growth of Canada’s MFP,
and this has emphatically been the case. Canada’s relative lack of
export aggressiveness outside the North American market, despite
the burgeoning opportunities in Asia, also implies a degree of
complacency incompatible with attitudes needed to excel in the nontechnological aspects of business innovation.
Despite many examples of successful innovation by Canadian firms,
the weight of evidence from the benchmark indicators reviewed in
this section establishes that the innovation performance of Canadian
business, taken as a whole, is significantly weaker than the innovation
performance of the U.S. business sector, and in fact weaker than that
of many of Canada’s peers among OECD countries.

<-----Page 9----->Page 10

4. INNOVATION AS A BUSINESS STRATEGY
This section addresses the third question in the charge to the panel:
Why is business demand for innovation inputs (for example,
research and development and skilled workers) weaker in Canada
than in many other OECD countries?
Business strategy drives innovative behaviour — some companies
have strategies based heavily on innovation and some do not.

Explaining business innovation performance in Canada therefore
comes down to explaining the business strategy choices of Canadian
firms. In other words, to understand why Canadian firms have not
invested more in innovation, one must shift the perspective of
analysis from innovation activities themselves — e.g., inputs such as
R&D and M&E investment — and focus instead on the factors that
influence the choice of business strategy. Such a reframing of the
innovation puzzle is the most important contribution of the panel’s
analysis.
Factors Influencing the Choice of Innovation as a Business Strategy
What are the factors that principally influence firms in Canada to
choose, or not to choose, business strategies based around
innovation? The five factors that are, in the panel’s view, of greatest
importance are depicted in Figure 7. The logic flow in this diagram
serves as the conceptual framework for the panel’s analysis.
The decision as to the emphasis to be placed on innovation in a
firm’s strategy will be primarily influenced — to varying degrees
depending on the circumstances of the individual firm — by the
following:
 Structural characteristics — For example, is
the firm in a sector of the economy that
typically does little in-house innovation,
relying instead on technology embodied in
capital equipment and/or on production of
relatively standard goods or services? Or is
the firm foreign controlled with most
innovation originating in the home country?

 Business ambition — For example, is the business dedicated to
market expansion and prepared to take the required risks?
Business ambition, in this context, reflects the extent of
entrepreneurship and drive.
Once a firm has decided on an innovation strategy, it assembles the
enabling inputs. These include the appropriate mix of highly
qualified employees; investment in the necessary capital equipment
and training; an R&D program if needed; and retention of
consultants and various external suppliers, including licensing
arrangements and partnerships with other firms. While these inputs,
and R&D spending in particular, can be regarded as indicators of
innovation, they are actually the consequences of a commitment to
innovation as a business strategy.
To the extent that Canadian businesses lag in respect of innovation,
the reasons lie primarily in some combination of the primary
influencing factors outlined above. Business ambition will be a key
factor in almost every case. For would-be radical innovators in new
markets, the other significant influencing factors will be the climate
for new ventures and perhaps some supportive public policies. For
firms in established markets, on the other hand, the innovation
strategy choice is likely to be most influenced by the state of
competition, by specific features of public policy or by some industry
characteristic such as the firm’s sector or its domicile of control. The
specific context can have a major influence on innovation strategy —
e.g., whether the firm is a stand-alone innovator or part of a network
where it must operate within the constraint of an alliance.*

 Competitive intensity — For example, is the
pressure from competitors so intense that
innovation is needed to maintain profitability
and/or market share? This would be the case
in many export markets, and particularly in
those where technology or customer
requirements or tastes are changing.

 Climate for new ventures — For example, is
sophisticated early-stage venture financing
available? Are there research universities
nearby to provide potential innovation
partners and highly trained graduates? Is
there an ecosystem of supplier firms to help
carry an innovation from concept to success
in the market?

 Public

policies — For example, are
government policies in respect of tax,
regulations, targeted assistance programs or Figure 7: Logic Map of the Business Innovation Process
public procurement favourable to innovation,
or not?

* A global survey of 1,000 firms identified six different innovation “games” that innovators can play, depending on the competitive dynamics that prevail in their industry.
Each innovation game is associated with a dominant strategy and a set of best practices.6

<-----Page 10----->Page 11

For policy makers, the concern is the extent to which the factors that
influence the innovation strategies of businesses can be affected by
public policy. Clearly some can be — taxes, regulations,
procurement, assistance programs, foreign investment rules and
certain aspects of competition. Policy has much less impact, at least
in the near- to mid-term, on factors such as industry structure and the
ambition of business leaders, though business attitude can certainly
be affected by competitive intensity, which is amenable to policy
influence.
The final question in the charge to the panel asks: What are the
contributing factors [responsible for the weak business demand in
Canada for innovation inputs], and what is the relative importance of
these factors? In the panel’s view, the key factors are the five
identified in Figure 7 as having the greatest influence on the
innovation strategy decision. The next five sections address each of
these factors, the relative importance of which will vary from sector
to sector (as illustrated by the examples in Section 10), and across the
life cycle of individual businesses.

and, conversely, a relatively small presence in sectors where it has a
high R&D intensity (e.g., pharmaceuticals, computing machinery,
electrical machinery and communications equipment). The 11
sectors in Table 1 that reduce the overall gap tend to be those that
are either resource based or highly mature. These sectors may
nevertheless employ sophisticated technology acquired by
investment in M&E.

Services
Many of the most dynamic subsectors in today’s economy are in
business services, which in 2002 constituted a much heavier weight in
U.S. business GDP (66%) than in Canada (53%). This, combined
with a higher BERD intensity in services in the United States (1.71%)
than in Canada (1.26%), added 0.46 percentage points to the overall
U.S.-Canada gap in 2002. The major sectoral contributor was
“wholesale and retail trade”, which, due to firms like Wal-Mart, has
used process innovation and ICT investment to revolutionize
productivity.

Evolution of the R&D Gap
5. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS
Structural issues related to sector mix, foreign control and
firm size are most readily analyzed in the limited context of
R&D spending because a long series of internationally
comparable data is available from the OECD. The
influence of sector mix and of foreign control is most pronounced in
the subsets of the economy that perform at least some R&D. The
analysis of the effect of sector mix and foreign control through the
lens of R&D intensity is therefore appropriate, provided we accept
that observed R&D investment is a reasonable proxy for the degree
of commitment to an innovation strategy in the studied sectors.

Figure 8 traces the evolution, by sector, of the U.S.-Canada BERD
intensity gap over 16 years from 1987 through 2002. The total gap
diminished from about 1.7 percentage points in the 1988-91 period
to about 1 percentage point in 2001-02, though it has increased
somewhat since then.† The most significant drivers of the trend have
been (i) the sharp reduction in the manufacturing sector’s
contribution to the gap, and (ii) the increasing share of the gap
accounted for by business services since the mid-1990s. The strong
U.S. investment trend in ICT described in Section 3 is consistent
with such a shift to services.

The Effect of Sector Mix on R&D Expenditure
To what extent do differences in industry sector mix − e.g., the
relatively heavy weight of resource-based industries in Canada −
account for the large gap between Canada and the United States in
business expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP (BERD
intensity)?* OECD data show that in 2002 (the latest year for which
a full set of comparable data was available) the BERD intensity gap
was about 1.03 percentage points — the difference between a U.S.
intensity of 2.90% and a Canadian intensity of 1.87%. The
manufacturing sector contributed 0.63 percentage points to the gap;
business services added 0.46 percentage points; whereas mining,
utilities and construction all diminished the gap by a total of 0.06
percentage points (Table 1).

EVOLUTION OF THE U.S.-CANADA BERD INTENSITY GAP
1987-2002

Manufacturing
Within manufacturing, the auto industry was the largest contributor
to the gap. In 2002 the BERD intensity of the U.S auto industry was
more than seven times the Canadian intensity. (This reflects the
overwhelming concentration of R&D activity in parent companies
based primarily in the United States and Japan.) A rough pattern,
apparent in Table 1, is that Canada tends to have a relatively low
R&D intensity in those manufacturing sectors where it has a relatively
large presence (e.g., autos, machinery, and “other” manufacturing)

Figure 8: Evolution of the U.S.-Canada BERD Intensity Gap
This chart traces the evolution of the most important sectoral components of the R&D intensity gap.
The narrowing of the manufacturing gap (at least through 2002) has been due entirely to the
disappearance of the gap in the aerospace sector as the U.S. industry downsized after the Cold War
and due to commercial competition from Airbus. The business services gap has meanwhile widened
since the mid 1990s. Much more work is needed to improve data on sub-sectors of business services.

* A similar analysis could be undertaken to compare Canada with other high-intensity R&D spenders like Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Japan, but comparison with
the United States is most relevant in view of its close integration with the Canadian economy.
† A detailed sectoral breakdown for the Canada-U.S. comparison was not available for more recent years.

In accounting for the overall U.S.-Canada BERD intensity
gap, further analysis of the data in Table 1 and Figure 8
shows that low R&D intensity within Canadian sectors is
more important than an adverse sector mix. Since the
precise quantitative results are sensitive to the granularity
of the sectoral breakdown, it is not particularly meaningful
to ascribe a specific percentage of the BERD intensity gap
to either sector mix or to intensity. Moreover, any such
allocation would vary from year to year.
The Effect of Foreign Control on R&D Expenditure
The foreign control of Canadian industry is often cited as
an explanation for Canada’s low R&D spending in view of
the fact that Canada has a disproportionate share, relative
to most OECD countries, of facilities that are subsidiaries
of foreign companies. (Canadian facilities nevertheless
benefit from parent company R&D embodied in
advanced equipment and business processes.)
While foreign control is part of the explanation for low
R&D intensity in Canada, it is not necessarily the cause in
the sense that were the foreign-controlled facilities not
here, there is no guarantee that Canada would have had a
“replacement set” of domestically owned R&D
performers. In the motor vehicle industry, for example, it
is far more likely that the alternative to the status quo
would not have been a domestically owned assembly
industry, but rather a situation where both assembly and
R&D took place outside Canada and all vehicles were
simply imported. By contrast with the auto industry, there
are other sectors — e.g., pharmaceuticals, computers,
machinery — where, despite extensive foreign control,
R&D intensity in Canada actually exceeds that in the
United States. The pattern in Table 1 depends on the
history and specific circumstances of the individual sectors
(Box B).

Canada’s BERD to total GDP exceeds that of the United States — i.e., sectors that reduce the gap.

second, with generally lower R&D intensity than
Canadian-owned multinationals, but higher than
purely domestic Canadian firms.

 Canadian firms with only domestic operations have
both the lowest incidence of R&D spending and the
lowest BERD intensity.
This underlines the fact that Canada’s failure to develop a
greater number of innovative Canadian-based
multinationals has been a key contributor to the country’s
overall R&D weakness.

<-----Page 12----->Page 13

BOX B: R&D AND PRODUCTION INCENTIVES
A comparison of the automotive and pharmaceutical sectors provides a
revealing contrast in the domestic economic impact of government policies
on R&D spending by foreign firms. The negotiation of the Canada-U.S. Auto
Pact in 1965 focused on offering tariff-free access to the Canadian market in
exchange for guarantees of manufacturing jobs and Canadian content.
While concerns about R&D spending had been identified, the agreement did
not address the issue. With pharmaceuticals, the trade-off was quite
different. In recognition of changes in Canada’s patent legislation, the
industry committed to spend 10% of its Canadian sales on R&D in Canada.
In both cases, the Canadian government traded market access concessions
for a specific commitment from a foreign-owned industry, and in both cases
the industry delivered what was promised. However, the impact on R&D
intensity, and on jobs in Canada, has been entirely different in the two
situations. In the case of pharmaceuticals, the R&D ratios have been
impressive but the scale of the industry in Canada in terms of jobs and
income has been much less so. The opposite has been the case for the auto
industry.

The Effect of Firm Size on R&D Expenditure
The conclusion of recent analysis is that Canada’s greater proportion
of small firms does not explain a meaningful proportion of the
BERD intensity gap between Canada and the United States. (The
fraction of total R&D performed by small firms — those with fewer than
20 employees — is very small and thus the U.S.-Canada difference in the
proportion of such firms necessarily accounts for a very small part of the
R&D gap.) To the extent there is a size effect, it is within the largest

category of firms — those with 500 or more employees — which
account for a large proportion of total R&D and where Canada’s
share of such firms is relatively low.
The Position of Canadian Firms in North American Value Chains
Canadian firms, reflecting the nation’s traditional areas of
specialization, have often chosen, or been relegated to, an upstream
position as providers of commodities or other intermediate goods in
many North American value chains, with most product innovation
taking place elsewhere.
Successful innovation, especially in respect of goods and services, is
most likely to come from businesses that have direct contact with
end-users, and thereby develop a deep understanding of what those
ultimate customers need or want. It is also the case that firms at the
upstream end of the value chain are removed from the leading edge
of business decision making regarding innovation, especially in
respect of product development, marketing and new business
models.
It has been noted that Canadian businesses on the whole, but always
with many exceptions, appear to be less customer focused than those
in the United States. This difference in attitude would be expected if
the reference is to the end-user customer and the Canadian business
is an intermediate supplier, and particularly if it is a supplier of
commodities or a foreign-controlled branch producer for export,
often to the United States. Since Canada’s economy is relatively
heavily weighted toward such upstream industries, the (end-user)
customer focus would be relatively less pronounced in Canada than

is typical in the United States. The motivation to adopt innovationoriented business strategies would, as a result, also be relatively less
pronounced in Canada.
The implications for Canada looking forward are challenging. The
U.S. market has excelled in supporting vibrant innovation because of
the “venturesome” nature of its consumers. (In some sectors,
particularly consumer electronics, such customers are now
increasingly to be found in Asia.) As a small market, Canada does
not naturally attract early deployments of new technologies or new
products. However, as innovation is increasingly being driven by the
interaction between global leaders — that is, between firms leading
technology development and customers leading technology adoption
— any country whose businesses and citizens do not participate at the
leading edge risks falling farther behind.
6. THE ROLE OF COMPETITION
Competition is among the most potent incentives for
innovation, both because of the benefits innovation can
provide in terms of greater market success and the threats
that can be averted if innovation can keep a firm running
ahead of its competitors. The state of competition in a firm’s market
will thus often be the deciding influence on the choice as to whether
or not to employ innovation as a core strategy.
In the 1940s Joseph Schumpeter argued that large firms with market
power were more likely to innovate than small firms. Almost all of
the recent empirical analysis contradicts Schumpeter and shows that
too much concentration inhibits innovation by removing the
incentive created by competitive rivalry, and also that small firms
with specialized expertise can be the most innovative.

Canada’s failure to develop a greater number of
innovative Canadian-based multinationals has been a
key contributor to the country’s overall R&D weakness.
Interplay Between Competition and Innovation in Canada
Is the state of competition in Canada a significant cause of the
country’s weak productivity and innovation performance? The
evidence does not permit a definitive answer in view of (i) the
difficulty in measuring the intensity of competition; and (ii) the great
variety of market situations throughout the economy, some of which
are intensely competitive and others not. The following general
observations are germane.

Export-Oriented Sectors
For some sectors, particularly technology-intensive industries and
many parts of manufacturing, the market for the product is North
American or global. In these cases, the competitive intensity faced by
Canadian firms is essentially identical to that faced by competitors in
other countries, and most indicators suggest that Canadian firms
achieve comparable levels of innovation and competitiveness. For
example, the Canadian ICT sector consistently demonstrates R&D
intensity levels similar to those elsewhere. Assessments of innovation
activity at the firm level demonstrate that exporting firms are more
likely to invest in R&D and to manifest innovative behaviour.

<-----Page 13----->Page 14

Sectors Where Competition is Curtailed
There are some important sectors in Canada — e.g.,
telecommunications services, broadcasting, air transport and certain
agri-foods — where regulations curtail foreign entrants, thus limiting
competition. Innovation tends to be more muted in those situations
than might otherwise be the case because there is very little incentive
for the well-established incumbents to compete for domestic market
share via innovation.

Market Regulation
According to work by the OECD, Canada has among the fewest
policy-related restraints on product market competition overall. On
the other hand, in 2003 Canada was ranked worst out of its 20country peer group in respect of foreign ownership barriers. Many
Canadian authorities consider this to be too harsh a judgment since
in practice, and apart from sectors where there are formal
restrictions on foreign ownership, Canada’s treatment of foreign
investment does not appear to be more restrictive than that of most
industrialized countries.8

Internal Barriers
The impact of Canada’s internal trade barriers that limit competition
is most evident in a few high-profile industries like beer and wine.
Governments sometimes also impose conditions on their suppliers
in the form of preferences in favour of local firms in several
industries. While such procurement policies support certain public
objectives, they nevertheless reduce competition and may thus
diminish the incentive to innovate.

Indirect Evidence of Competitive Intensity
There is a great deal of anecdotal evidence that the intensity of
competition in the U.S. domestic market is far greater than in
comparable sectors in Canada. For example, the generally lower
level of business profit (relative to the size of the economy) in the
United States as compared with Canada (Figure 9) is indirect
evidence of stiffer competition in the U.S. market because, other
things being roughly equal, more intense competition would be
expected to lead to the observed lower relative level of business
profitability in the United States.

The Effect of Canada’s Market Size on Competition and Innovation
A fundamental characteristic of the Canadian economy is its
relatively small size and geographic fragmentation, particularly when
compared with the enormous scale of the United States. As a general
rule, larger markets promote innovation via two principal channels.
First, larger markets attract and support more competitors and the
resulting competitive intensity stimulates innovation; and second,
larger markets increase the size of the potential reward for
innovation and thus improve the likelihood that the upfront cost and
risk of innovation will be recouped. Since Canada starts with the
limitation of a relatively small domestic market — which in some
sectors is made even smaller by interprovincial and regulatory
barriers — to stimulate innovation it would be particularly important
to increase the “effective size” of the market by reducing internal
barriers and increasing access to markets abroad.
7. THE CLIMATE FOR NEW VENTURES
New ventures are the “green shoots” of the innovation
system, bringing new ideas to market and creating new
competition. It is important to understand what features of
Canada’s business environment affect the quality of the
breeding ground for such enterprises. The key enabling conditions
can be grouped into three broad categories:
 Venture financing and acquisition of commercial skills — the
sources and availability of risk capital and mentorship to
support the development of new companies from concept to
sustainable business.

 Technology transfer — the mechanisms to take research and
intellectual property developed within universities and
government laboratories to commercial realization.

 Clusters — the development of a local innovation ecosystem
that supports and sustains the creation and growth of new
ventures.
Venture Financing and Acquisition of Commercial Skills
Successful venture investing demands much more than financial
capital: operational and business experience is a key ingredient
needed to monitor and manage these investments. That is a key
reason why traditional capital markets for public equity or
commercial debt do not play a significant role at the early stage of
new technology ventures. Venture funding is critical for new business
creation, but its precise nature changes as companies evolve from
seed or early-stage investment, through commercial validation, to
later-stage growth and expansion (Table 2). The focus here is on the
initial funding stages that are needed to bridge the new venture
across the so-called “valley of death” that separates a promising
business idea from a sustainable commercial operation.

Getting Started

Figure 9: Corporate Profits — Canada-U.S. Comparison
Aggregate corporate profit (before tax) as a percentage of GDP has generally been higher in Canada
than in the U.S., with the Canadian ratio higher in 39 of the 47 years (83%) from 1961 to 2007. The
only time when the profit ratio in Canada was significantly below that of the U.S. was in the 1990-93
period reflecting the deeper recession in Canada.

Support from family and friends (“love money”) is often needed for
new firms to get started, but is usually limited. Angels — investors that
are independent of the firm but usually knowledgeable in its business
sector — are typically needed to enable a startup to proceed to the
next level. The limited available data on these “informal” investment
sources in Canada suggest that they are much less extensive, in
relative terms, than the comparable sources in the United States.

<-----Page 14----->Page 15

This relative weakness is of concern because the angel and venture
capital communities are linked and complementary. Successful
entrepreneurs are valuable as angel investors not only for the funds
they bring (a byproduct of their own past success), but particularly for
the valuable experience and mentorship they can offer to new
entrepreneurs, often providing business contacts as well as
specialized market knowledge.

There are reasons to be concerned about the state of venture capital
in Canada. Fundraising for Canadian VC firms — i.e., the capital
raised or committed from investors for subsequent VC investments
— has been falling with 2007 marking the fifth decline in the previous
six years. By contrast, there were five consecutive years of growth in
the United States. In 2007 the fundraising level in Canada dropped
to $1.2 billion, or around 3% of the $37 billion raised in the United
States (Figure 10).

Canadian governments have sought to address the early-stage gap in
financing through various initiatives. For example, the Business
Development Bank of Canada has been directing a growing share of
its resources to seed-stage and startup companies. While such
programs improve the availability of capital, they do not address the
other critically important aspects of the role of angel investors —
experience, contacts and mentorship. To address that gap, a number
of incubation centres have been created to assist small companies in
their earliest stages of growth — e.g., the Regional Economic
Intervention Fund established by the Québec government, the
Centre for Drug Research and Development in British Columbia
and the Accelerator Centre in Waterloo.

Commercial Validation (Venture Capital)
Venture capital is provided primarily by professionally managed
funds that pool assets from multiple investors. While venture capital
(VC) investment is substantially smaller than the total pool of
informal investment — in Canada it has ranged from $1.5 to $2
billion per year over the last five years — it is concentrated in those
firms with the greatest potential to eventually become public, or to
grow into large companies.

The fundamental questions regarding the weak state of the Canadian
VC industry are the following:
 Are there too few attractive opportunities for investment
relative to the amount of venture capital potentially available in
Canada?

 Alternatively, is there too little venture capital available in
Canada to support the development of the skills base needed
for a healthy VC industry — i.e., a supply-side problem?

 Are there deficiencies in the structure and skills base of the
Canadian VC industry itself that have depressed investment
performance?
It might be argued that if there were, in fact, a sufficient number of
good quality companies in Canada that were attractive for VC
funding, the money would be forthcoming, whether from Canadian
investors or from those in other countries. There is a perception that
there are too few Canadian entrepreneurs with the experience
needed to successfully develop startup firms in science and
technology-based sectors. However, there are no pertinent data to
effectively measure demand for venture capital, as categorized by
quality of opportunity, which would be the relevant correlate.
To the extent that there is a supply constraint on VC funding, it is
believed to be due to the low level of institutional VC investment in
Canada. More than a third of the funds raised by the U.S. VC
industry in 2004 derived from pension funds and foundation
endowments, while Canada generated only 15% from those sources.

<-----Page 15----->Page 16

Canadian institutions would presumably be more inclined to invest
in Canadian venture capital if the sector produced better investment
performance. It is significant that “buyout funds” (those that target
more mature businesses than venture capital) have generally
performed well in Canada and have not experienced the fundraising
issues that have afflicted venture capital.
Problems concerning the sustainable supply of capital to the VC
industry in Canada appear to be rooted primarily within the industry
itself and its poor performance (Figure 11). There are two main
contributors: (i) Canada’s VC industry is still relatively young, and
therefore has not fully developed the necessary skills for success; and
(ii) there are structural issues related to the historical predominance
of tax-advantaged Labour Sponsored Investment Funds.

direct early-stage VC investments in 2006 and channel its
technological VC investments through the private VC firms in which
it invested.
The message of the foregoing discussion is that there is no quick or
easy fix for the Canadian VC industry. Attracting sufficient capital to
become self-sustaining will require VC firms to demonstrate they
have the skills and experience to generate acceptable returns. The
dilemma is that the industry requires access to sustainable pools of
investment capital to develop a critical mass of investing skills. It is
encouraging that recent government policy initiatives at both the
provincial and federal levels have been designed to support the
growth of market-based venture firms that will be judged, and will
succeed or not, based solely on their performance.
Technology Transfer
Research that takes place in universities and government labs is a
potentially important source of ideas and new technologies,
particularly for startup businesses. Given Canada’s heavy investment
in university-led R&D the effective transfer of technology from
university research labs to commercial practice is an opportunity to
be seized.

Research Support Philosophy and Incentives

Figure 11: Venture Capital Performance
The financial underperformance of aggregate VC investment in Canada is clear. (Some individual
funds may of course perform well.) There has been a decline in the 10-year rate of return for VC funds
in both the U.S. and Canada following the end of the tech boom, but the fall-off was steeper in
Canada and started from a much lower level.

Compared with the United States, the Canadian VC industry is very
young, with the great majority of firms dating only from the mid1990s. More than 80% of existing Canadian firms were created
during the expansion of the technology bubble between 1995 and
2001. Fund managers in Canada thus have less operational
experience than their U.S. counterparts, which has led them to take
a more passive role in investments; whereas it is through active
management that the investee firms are made more valuable.
Canadian VC firms invest a larger share of their funds in early-stage
companies, do too many deals and tend to underinvest in each one.
The big maturity gap between the U.S. and Canadian VC industries
is important because it takes time for a VC sector to learn the lessons
of successful investing, and to winnow out weak firms and reallocate
resources to the strong ones.
A significant component of the Canadian VC industry − Labour
Sponsored Investment Funds (LSIFs) — have used the availability of
personal tax credits as an incentive to draw significant amounts of
capital into the industry. The evidence is strong that LSIFs across
Canada have contributed to weaker performance of the VC industry,
essentially by accumulating significant capital in a vehicle that is
poorly designed for new venture investments. This led the Fonds de
solidarité − the first and still the largest LSIF in Canada − to exit

Research funding for university faculty is allocated primarily by peer
review committees whose criteria are focused on the research
significance of the proposed effort and not on commercial potential.
The priority usually given to the quick publication of university-based
research militates against commercialization of discoveries and, by
extension, implementation of a patent strategy to protect
commercially promising intellectual property (IP). There is a thriving
debate internationally about the relative merits of “open science”
regimes versus those in which IP rights are strongly asserted.
Recently, the balance has shifted in favour of the view that an open
science model leads to more rapid technological advances overall
than the alternative approach.

There is no quick or easy fix for the Canadian VC
industry. Attracting sufficient capital to become selfsustaining will require VC firms to demonstrate they
have the skills and experience to generate acceptable
returns.
Although the effect of university practices and incentives on research
commercialization will continue to be debated, the panel believes
there is an unambiguous case for improving the critical infrastructure
for identifying and mobilizing potentially commercializable
knowledge as it emerges from university-based research. In many
cases this will involve well-designed partnerships between universities
and private-sector businesses or government labs.

Institutional Support for Technology Transfer and IP Ownership
Even when researchers identify discoveries with commercial
potential, the technology transfer challenge remains. Most Canadian
universities support this process through a technology transfer office
(TTO). The overall performance of university technology transfer in
Canada has not been strong. Almost no TTO in Canada is selfsustaining and licensing revenue is insufficient to pay the full costs of
an office. Funding limitations may leave a TTO without sufficient

<-----Page 16----->Page 17

scale and expertise to effectively manage the technology transfer
segment of the commercialization process. A challenge facing the
Canadian technology transfer system is to generate sufficiently
specialized expertise in appraising the commercial potential of
university-generated IP and then facilitating the commercialization
process. (A recent organizational innovation in this regard is the new
MaRS Innovation initiative in Toronto, funded through the federal
government’s Centres of Excellence for Commercialization and
Research program.)
Canadian universities exhibit a wide range of policies as to the
ownership and commercialization of IP. For example, the University
of Waterloo places no restrictions on faculty seeking to
commercialize the products of their research, but no one model
appears to be best in all circumstances. In life sciences, for example,
where patents and the ability to assemble complementary IP from
various institutional sources may be a critical component of the
technology’s value, a centralized model through a TTO could be the
most effective.

Business Receptors for Research
The university is only one side of the technology transfer equation.
There must be a business — either an established firm or a startup —
that can receive the technology and commercialize it. Research
originating in universities is most readily commercialized by
businesses that are oriented strategically toward the development and
marketing of opportunities at the leading edge of science and
engineering. Almost inevitably, these are businesses that do a lot of
R&D. The low BERD intensity of the Canadian business sector, as
documented earlier, would therefore tend to correlate with subpar
commercialization of university research. The implication is that
commercialization is more likely to occur if the surrounding business
environment is rich in firms that are committed to science and
technology-based innovation as a major business objective — i.e.,
more “market pull” is needed to complement the “research push”.
Clusters
The Waterloo region stands out in the Canadian innovation system
as an area that has developed a cluster of successful startup firms
with a particular focus on information technologies (Box C). There
are several others across the country. For example, Ottawa has a
leading cluster in communications technologies; Montréal has
developed a digital media and computer graphics cluster; and
Saskatoon has an agricultural biotechnology cluster. In every case, a
local community has developed a sufficient critical mass of resources
— from people to new ventures to financing and support services —
to enable a self-sustaining ecosystem that nurtures and amplifies
innovation and growth.
While it is easy, after the fact, to identify successful clusters, public
policies designed to create a cluster from whole cloth have yet to
demonstrate much success, though continued learning from
initiatives like MaRS will aid the design of supportive policies.
Experience has shown that highly individualized, and often
essentially random factors can influence the development of a local
cluster or region,* but a strong local catalyst and some pre-existing
advantages appear to be critical success factors.

BOX C: THE WATERLOO CLUSTER
The industrial, small-firm background of the Kitchener-Waterloo area,
combined with the strong community focus of the local population, led to
the University of Waterloo’s emphasis on technology and its practical
application in local industry. The immensely successful vehicle for this has
been the co-operative educational model. The combination of qualities that
has made the Waterloo region such a successful cluster is difficult to
replicate. Other regions that have developed technology clusters have often
done so very differently. One key lesson of the Waterloo experience is that
development of a sustainable, vibrant cluster takes time. While the university
was founded in 1957, it took almost 25 years before the first wave of
startups emerged. It has since taken almost another 25 years to reach the
point that a sustainable ecosystem has emerged.

8. THE INFLUENCE OF PUBLIC POLICY
This section addresses the influence of several areas of
public policy on the decisions of businesses in Canada to
adopt innovation-based strategies. It is complementary to
the foregoing treatment of structural characteristics,
competitive intensity and the climate for new ventures, each of which
is also amenable, in varying degrees, to policy influence.
International Trade
The general liberalizing trend of trade policy, until very recently at
least, has favoured innovation strategies both to counter import
competition and to take advantage of new markets. Still, Canada
maintains substantial barriers, notably to the import of some agrifood goods and to foreign presence in some services — for example,
in sensitive sectors such as culture, health care, transportation and
telecommunications. But the restrictions have not worsened over
time and now represent an opportunity for improvement. The
concern looking forward — particularly in view of the severe
economic stress in most countries — is the risk of increased
protectionism. This would reduce the size of the addressable market
for many Canadian businesses and thus the potential return from an
investment in innovation.
As a relatively small open economy, Canada is particularly exposed
to the vicissitudes of global markets and especially to conditions in
the United States. While Canada’s prudent macroeconomic policy
over the past 15 years has provided some capacity to absorb shocks,
further insulation depends on building a base of export industries at
the leading edge of innovation in order to be among the last to lose
market share if customers retrench.
Education
Education and the quality of human capital is one of Canada’s most
significant strengths and therefore offers little by way of explanation
for the long-term relative weakness in productivity growth or business
innovation. The federal government’s commitment to the support of
university research has been strong since the mid-to-late 1990s. This
has increased the supply of leading-edge skills and, other things being
equal, made Canada a more attractive location for innovative
business. The competition from China and India, among others, for
knowledge-intensive activity has meanwhile increased sharply as
those countries have also succeeded in rapidly expanding their

* For example, the consent decree between the U.S. Justice Department and AT&T that separated Western Electric from Northern Electric (later to become Nortel),
forced Northern to develop its own technology, and was thus indirectly a key catalyst for the evolution of the Ottawa ICT cluster.

<-----Page 17----->Page 18

production of skilled people. The accumulation of human
capabilities is a race without a finish line.
Of particular significance for innovation performance is the fact that
Canadian business managers are, on average, not as well trained as
those in the United States. This education gap may leave many
Canadian managers less aware than their U.S. counterparts of
developments at the leading edge of technology and business
practice, and thus less likely to choose business strategies that
emphasize innovation.

Education and the quality of human capital is one of
Canada’s most significant strengths but the accumulation
of human capabilities is a race without a finish line.
Regulation
The impact of regulatory policies is usually sector-specific, thus few
generalizations can be made. Moreover, the effect of regulation on
business innovation may either be stultifying or encouraging.
Regulations often inspire innovation either to meet the rules (e.g.,
auto emission limits and fuel efficiency standards) or to design
around them (e.g., refrigerant substitutes for CFCs to avoid ozone
depletion). The intensifying pressure on virtually all aspects of the
natural environment due to population and economic growth in
general, and energy use in particular, requires an unprecedented
innovative response, elements of which will need to be encouraged
by well-designed regulation in all countries. This is both an
enormous challenge and opportunity for government and business,
and will be one of the world’s main arenas of innovation for decades
to come. While Canada has some companies that have been
successful innovators in various fields of environmental technology
(e.g., fuel cells and wastewater treatment), it has not generally been
an area of comparative global strength for Canada despite this
country’s outstanding research competence in many fields of
environmental science.9
The OECD product market regulation index ranked Canada as the
seventh least restrictive country overall among its 20-country peer
group in 2003. More specifically, Canada was judged, together with
the United Kingdom, to be the least restrictive in respect of barriers
to entrepreneurship. A less favourable OECD study presented
evidence that Canada’s relatively restrictive regulations in several
ICT-intensive sectors — particularly electricity, retail distribution, air
transport and professional services — have contributed to Canada’s
weak ICT investment numbers.10 There appears to be considerable
potential for targeted regulatory reform to increase the incentives for
innovation in many service sector industries in Canada, and
particularly the incentive for ICT adoption and use.
Intellectual property rights (IPRs) — e.g., patents, copyrights,
trademarks, trade secrets — play an important role in innovation
strategies in certain industries. The design of IPRs must seek to
balance the incentive to innovate as against the spillover benefits to
society of relatively unencumbered access to knowledge and
innovative ideas. While Canada’s IPR regime is generally considered
to comply with global best practice, there is concern that Canada’s
efforts to thwart various forms of IP theft have been inadequate.

Moreover, the new challenges facing IPR protection, in light of the
Internet and other manifestations of information technology, call for
innovation and vigilance to keep Canada’s IPR regulation on the
leading edge.
Taxation
Many studies over the years have pointed to a relatively high rate of
business taxation in Canada, particularly as it affects the after-tax cost
of M&E investment. This would reduce the incentive for firms to
accumulate M&E and, because of the strong linkages among M&E,
R&D and innovation generally, would explain some part of Canada’s
weak productivity performance. According to estimates by the C.D.
Howe Institute, Canada’s marginal effective tax rate (METR) for
medium and large companies was the highest in the OECD in 2005
and 2006, though the comparable rate in the United States was only
slightly lower.11 The federal government has meanwhile been steadily
reducing corporate tax rates of various kinds, and in Budget 2009
committed to continue with measures that would give Canada the
G7’s lowest overall tax rate on new investment by 2010.

The Scientific Research and Experimental Development Tax
Incentive
The SR&ED incentive, with an estimated annual tax expenditure
(i.e., foregone revenue) of $4 billion in 2007, is by far the most
significant government-provided support for business R&D in
Canada. A rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the SR&ED estimated a
net economic benefit of 11 cents per dollar of tax expenditure, or a
benefit of about $400 million annually for the economy.12 Although
the SR&ED program is generally popular with business, there has
also been persistent criticism of its design because the incentive is of
much less benefit for large firms when tough economic conditions
reduce or eliminate taxable income and there is pressure to delay
R&D spending. A refundable SR&ED credit (which is available for
very small R&D performers) would strengthen the incentive for
larger firms to sustain the pace and continuity of R&D through
downturns.
Direct Government Support for Innovation
Governments can provide incentives to business directly through
grants, co-investments, government laboratories (via mandates that
are important to business) and, less transparently, by various forms
of favoured public-sector procurement. To the extent that such
support mechanisms can be shown to subsidize export activity, they
have been increasingly limited by international trade rules.
Direct forms of support are, almost by definition, targeted to specific
sectors, and their benefits and costs reflect many specific
circumstances. The panel has therefore limited its discussion to
some general principles based on empirical evidence from crosscountry studies. The case for public support of business innovation
(whether direct or tax-based) should be judged in terms of:
 incrementality — does the public subsidy simply substitute for
work the recipient would have done anyway (“crowding out”)
or does it induce extra investment by the business (“crowding
in”)?

 spillovers — to what extent does the “social return” arising from
the innovation activity induced by the public expenditure
exceed the full economic cost of public funds?

<-----Page 18----->Page 19

This framework can, in principle, also be used to determine the
most effective way to deliver a given amount of public support — i.e.,
whether via the tax system or directly. Canada’s total government
support for business R&D (tax and direct spending combined) is
somewhat larger, relative to GDP, than that of the United States and
the United Kingdom. It is noteworthy that Canada’s heavy reliance
on the tax assistance channel makes it virtually an outlier (Figure 12).
This invites close analysis as to why Canada has chosen such an
extreme mix of assistance delivery mechanisms and whether such a
tax-heavy emphasis is appropriate.

Influences on Business R&D Trends
It is instructive to revisit the long-term trend of business R&D
spending in Canada (1981-2007), superimposing on it a number of
key policy initiatives and other factors (e.g., North American
recessions and trade agreements) that might have been expected to
influence the expenditure pattern (Figure 13). Nothing appears to
have had a material impact on the gradual upward-sloping trend
other than the Internet/telecom boom between the mid-1990s and
2001, and the aftermath of the bubble’s collapse. While the
aggregate impact of targeted support for business innovation is hard
to discern in Figure 13, such support can nevertheless be decisively
important at the scale of individual firms and sectors.

Canada has provided a progressively more
encouraging environment for business innovation —
e.g., prudent fiscal and monetary policies, a trend of
lower tax rates and support for university research —
but Canada’s innovation performance is still far from
where it needs to be so there is still a great deal of
work to do.
A recent study by Finance Canada reviewed the extensive literature
seeking to estimate the impact of different mixes of direct and taxbased support for business research and concluded that “…there is
presently no evidence-based reason to choose between tax credits,
grants and publicly performed R&D as alternative ways to deliver
support for R&D”. 13 This is a good starting point but is probably not
the last word. Subsidies are likely to be more effective in motivating
firms to take bigger risks and are attractive to companies that are
constrained for funds. Tax credits — unless they are refundable —
benefit only profitable firms. Thus a policy based largely on (nonrefundable) tax credits would tend to bias the innovation process
toward established companies conducting less risky projects. Of
course the SR&ED credit is refundable for small Canadian R&D
performers, so riskier projects, for these companies at least, should
not be discouraged by the nature of the tax incentive.

Policy to Encourage Innovation
Canada has provided a progressively more encouraging environment
for business innovation, at least in respect of those factors over which
public policy has direct influence — e.g., prudent fiscal and monetary
policies, a trend of lower tax rates and support for university
research. In the meantime, Canada’s other benchmark competitors
are not standing still and globalization and ICT are changing the way
in which a great deal of business innovation is conducted. Most
important, Canada’s innovation performance is still far from where it
needs to be so there is still a great deal of work to do — for example
to:
 enhance competition

 foster the supply of finance for new ventures

Figure 12: Government Funding of Business R&D
Government funding of business R&D, whether through direct grants or tax credits, is a relatively
small proportion of BERD in most OECD countries (e.g., about 20% in Canada). The use of taxbased incentives has been increasing in the OECD group, but Canada is unusual in its almost
exclusive reliance on the SR&ED incentive.

 encourage the transformation of university and government
research into innovation

 reform regulations that may be inhibiting ICT investment in
certain service sectors

 continue to improve the design of tax incentives, and
 design ways to encourage innovation-based business strategies
in sectors where Canada has demonstrated strengths or
significant opportunities.
Box D summarizes several highlights of OECD research on policies
to foster innovation.14

BOX D: STIMULATING INNOVATION — INSIGHTS FROM A DECADE
OF OECD RESEARCH
In 2007, the OECD launched a concerted work on innovation strategy for
presentation to its Ministerial Council in 2010. A paper released in February,
2009 and entitled: OECD Work on Innovation − A Stocktaking of Existing
Work, provides a broad overview of OECD research over the past decade as
to good policy practices for innovation. Summarized below is a selection of
findings from the paper that are of particular relevance for issues addressed
in this report.
Policy conditions that generally create a favourable environment for
innovation include:
 macroeconomic stability, openness to trade and investment, deep
financial systems, competitive markets, and regulation that is
proportionate and appropriate;
 flatter, lower and more predictable taxes; and
 labour markets that allow mobility and adjustment, assist workers to
retrain, and allow firms to undertake organizational change.
OECD research supports the following general propositions of relevance for
policies to foster innovation.
 Access to secondary “high risk” capital markets, in addition to
generally deep financial markets, is useful for young innovative
firms.
 Intellectual property rights require a balance between rewarding
risk-takers and diffusing new knowledge.
 Supporting management training appears to be beneficial.
 For clusters, the role of government is mainly as a catalyst and
broker for strengthening cluster formation.
With regard to areas particularly in need of further investigation, the
following were noted.
 More research is needed to appropriately measure human capital as
an input to innovation. Especially important would be a better
understanding of “soft skills” such as teamwork.
 Tax subsidies are increasingly used (relative to direct grants) to
support firms. More evaluation is needed to determine the efficiency
and effectiveness of this support since it is unclear whether the
social benefits outweigh the costs.
 Since innovation is closely linked to demand from users, government
as a large-scale purchaser can promote innovation by being a
demanding buyer. More work is needed to better understand the
linkages and policy responses to support innovation through
procurement.
 Evaluation is sparse in many areas of innovation policy and much
more work is needed to assess the return on government investment
in the innovation activities of firms.
 Further work on the measurement of innovation is likely to yield
benefits, particularly in understanding innovation in the service
sector and better capturing the increasingly international nature of
innovation activity.
 Indicator and related econometric research must move forward from
innovation inputs and activities to include the outputs and impacts.
A marked improvement in the policy relevance of innovation
research is required in order to create a “science of science policy.”

9. BUSINESS AMBITION
The intangibles that make up Canada’s business culture
are believed by many to reduce the supply of
entrepreneurial talent, the appetite for risk, the urge to
grow and the propensity to innovate. The relevance of
“business ambition” to an explanation of Canada’s lagging innovation
performance is a matter for debate based on evidence that is largely
anecdotal. But it is almost by definition the residual explanation once
all the other more tangible factors have been assessed.
The Influence of History
Canada’s particular colonial history, its specialization in natural
resources and its proximity to the U.S. colossus have had a powerful
shaping influence on Canada’s path of economic development, and
on the nation’s values and the attitudes of its business people (Box
E). This history should be less a barrier to business innovation
tomorrow. Members of Canada’s immigrant communities are
increasingly moving into positions of business leadership that will
allow them to exploit advantages of language, contact networks and
deep cultural understanding to succeed in new export markets.
Moreover, with each new generation, Canadian business people —
whether born in Canada or abroad — will have an increasingly global
mindset and be further removed psychologically from the more
limiting conceptions that shaped the nation’s past.
Empirical Evidence
The question of business culture is frequently the subject of surveys
and commentaries in which there are two contradictory threads. One
is pessimistic and reflects a widespread view among Canadian
business people that too many of their number simply do not
measure up to the standards needed for global success. The contrary
view, based on surveys of the broader population — e.g., the World
Values Survey conducted periodically in a large number of countries
— contends that Canadians are not that much different from
Americans when it comes to attitudes regarding risk and
entrepreneurship, and therefore any explanation of innovation
shortcomings based on public attitude and “business culture” is a red
herring.
There is nevertheless a widespread conviction in the Canadian
business community, usually based on direct experience, that there is
an inbred propensity among U.S. business people to maximize the
economic heft of their enterprise — to always go for growth. In
Canada and Europe, “good enough” appears more often to be
reached at a lower level. In other words, there appears to be a
deficiency of business ambition in Canada. Too many successful
Canadian businesses would rather behave like an “income trust”
than like a “venture capitalist”. On the other hand, Canadians have
been bold and entrepreneurial in domains where the country has
had long experience and deep knowledge flowing from the particular
opportunities and challenges the country has faced — mineral
exploration and project engineering being good examples. Canadian
business, on the whole, has acquired much less experience at the
frontiers of science and technology, and has thus been less able to
gauge the risks and opportunities in many of these domains. Fewer
Canadian companies have therefore been prepared to adopt
strategies based on technological innovation.

<-----Page 20----->Page 21

BOX E: A PERSPECTIVE FROM AN INNOVATION PIONEER
V.O. Marquez, when CEO of Northern Electric (later to become Nortel), drew
on his extensive experience to conclude in a 1972 article that foreign
ownership and an abnormal degree of dependence on imported innovation
and technology were key characteristics of the Canadian manufacturing
economy. As a result, “…the lack of need to make risk decisions in Canada
and the consequent stunting of experience in making such decisions have
conditioned the managers of manufacturing enterprises in Canada into
becoming inexperienced, diffident and reluctant risk-takers”.
In Marquez’s view, “we lack, above all, the entrepreneurial initiative
achieved by others, not because their people have greater potential than
Canadians, but because their corporations and their countries have been
forced to develop more vigorous responses by exposure to severe conditions
from which we have been insulated… Technology is not a prime mover;
entrepreneurship is. Seeking by incentive to lure our present industries into
generating more of their own technology, or to seek foreign markets with
vigor, will continue to meet with indifference and spotty success until and
unless these activities are preceded by a greater proliferation of native
entrepreneurial talent.” 15

Innovation and Global Growth Strategies
Innovation is needed to move from a domestic to a global growth
strategy. Reciprocally, a heavy investment in innovation usually
requires Canadian businesses to go for the scale of global markets.
Canadian businesses, on the whole, have so far failed to aggressively
grasp the opportunities created by globalization. Canada has never
had a single global brand in consumer products, though the
BlackBerry has become a contender. Canada has no “super-major”
energy multinationals and, notwithstanding Canada’s vast forest
tracts, no domestically owned forest company to rival those of
Scandinavia. Despite a strong tradition in mining, only very few
major international players — e.g., Barrick Gold, Teck Cominco,
Sherritt International — have Canadian head offices.

There appears to be a deficiency of business ambition
in Canada. Too many successful Canadian businesses
would rather behave like an “income trust” than like a
“venture capitalist”.
More positively, Canada has produced companies like Research in
Motion, Cirque du soleil, SNC-Lavalin, Bombardier and CAE, all of
which are still controlled by Canadians. High-profile foreign
takeovers like Alcan, the Hudson’s Bay Company and Molson tend
to attract much more media play than acquisitions of foreign firms by
Canadian companies — e.g., Manulife’s purchase of John Hancock
Financial Services, TD Bank’s acquisition of Commerce Bancorp (as
a result of which TD now has more branches in the United States
than in Canada) or Thomson’s takeover of Reuters, a global
company with deep historical roots.
Comprehensive research suggests that recurring fears of the
hollowing out of Canadian industry through foreign takeover are
probably exaggerated. Between 1994 and 2007, Canadian merger
and acquisition (M&A) activity abroad exceeded foreign M&A in
Canada, and the number of billion-dollar-plus deals was about the
same on both sides of the ledger. At the same time, there has been
persistent concern that too many innovative startups fail to mature in
Canada with the most promising often acquired and eventually

relocated to the United States. The greater supply and sophistication
of venture capital investors in the United States and immediate
proximity to a larger market can be irresistible attractions for young,
technology-based firms. Because these businesses are small they
attract far less media attention than major takeovers but their
disappearance saps the long-run innovation capacity of the Canadian
economy. This underlines the importance of improving the climate
for new ventures as discussed in Section 7.
A Lack of Business Ambition?
Are Canadian businesses good enough to compete in global markets,
aggressive enough, willing to take risks, and sufficiently outwardlooking beyond the huge and accessible U.S. market? Clearly, the
many Canadians who have built successful global businesses have the
necessary attributes. But the issue is whether there are enough of
them to ensure the long-term prosperity of the entire economy. The
panel’s view is that today, there are not. This is not due to any lack of
innate capacities of Canadian business people — it is not in the
“DNA”, so to speak. Rather, the traditional attitudes of business
people have been shaped over a very long time by the particular
circumstances of Canada’s economy. For many exporters, easy
access to the world’s largest market next door has blunted the
incentive to venture farther afield. With relatively subdued domestic
competition, there are fewer market incentives to push toward the
kind of competitiveness that can survive in larger world markets. As a
small country, Canada offers a limited field on which business
people can test themselves (though examples of innovation leaders
like Finland and Sweden show that small size need not be a
definitive constraint). Finally, Canada is rich and business has been
profitable — so why change?
The truth is that the behaviour of Canadian business will not change
unless its circumstances change. Those circumstances are, in fact,
changing radically due not only to the current turmoil in the world
economy but, more fundamentally in the long run, to a massive
reallocation of the share of global economic activity as China and
others become full participants in world commerce. The
demographics of the Canadian business community are also
changing as immigrants and a younger generation of entrepreneurs,
unencumbered by traditional attitudes, expand their presence. So
whether by necessity or inclination, there is reason to expect that
Canadian business will become more ambitious.
10. CASE STUDIES: SECTORAL PERSPECTIVES ON
INNOVATION
No one industry is “average” and there is no one-size-fits-all
explanation for Canada’s innovation shortcomings. The four sectors
addressed in this section — automotive, life sciences, banking and
ICT — were chosen as examples because innovation of different
varieties tends to be an important business strategy in each and,
taken together, they illustrate most of the innovation issues that arise
in the economy.
Innovation also occurs in Canada’s resource-based sectors. Much of
the innovation in these industries involves process improvements,
the adaptation of foreign-sourced M&E and techniques to Canadian
circumstances, mineral exploration, and the financing and
engineering of resource projects at all scales. But with very few

<-----Page 21----->Page 22

exceptions, Canadian firms have not been at the forefront of
innovation in capital equipment for resource industries or in the
development of the most sophisticated materials and products
derived from the nation’s resources — further evidence of Canada’s
characteristic upstream, commodity-oriented position in global value
chains.
THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY — WEAK R&D BUT STRONG
PRODUCTIVITY
The Canadian automotive sector presents an innovation paradox.
Canada’s R&D intensity in the sector is about one-seventh that of the
United States, yet average labour productivity in the Canadian
industry has exceeded U.S. levels in recent years, making automotive
one of the few manufacturing industries where Canada enjoys a
productivity advantage. The unprecedented decline in customer
demand for motor vehicles since mid-2008 has now overshadowed
considerations related to Canada-U.S. cost and productivity
differences and left the industry in crisis in both countries. A
recommitment to innovation by the major U.S.-based firms will be
necessary for the industry eventually to return to a sustainable state.
Canada’s Performance and Challenges in Automotive Innovation
The Canadian segment of the industry has focused on process
innovation, as a result of which Canada has some of the most
productive assembly plants in the industry. This kind of innovation is
not captured in R&D statistics but has evidently contributed to the
performance of Canadian automotive plants and, by doing so,
encouraged additional investment in Canada.
Canada’s contribution to automotive product development has been
mixed. Despite pockets of product innovation strength (e.g., in global
players like Magna and Linamar), Canada has primarily been an
adapter, rather than a creator, of automotive innovation.

The global success of automotive parts makers such as
Magna and Linamar shows that ambitious Canadian firms
can expand from their base in a Canada-U.S. supply chain
to serve the world market.
Canada has some areas of strength in relevant basic research —
including lightweight materials, fuel cells and biofuel technologies —
but better integration of this research with industry-sponsored
initiatives would be desirable. Where there are automotive design
centres in Canada, these facilities attract both talent and the R&D
efforts of their suppliers. To the extent that such centres remain in
the United States, or are established elsewhere, they can serve to pull
R&D activity, even for Canadian firms, out of Canada.
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler represent more than two-thirds
of Canadian vehicle production and purchase an even larger share of
Canadian-made auto parts. There has been an increase in Canadian
R&D and innovation activity by these companies in recent years
(especially by GM and Chrysler), partly leveraged through targeted
government support for new investment in Canada. But the declining
North American market share of these firms — which reflects a longstanding innovation problem but not specifically a “Canadian”
innovation problem — has put further pressure on the industry in this
country.

Some Lessons for Business Innovation Strategy
 The innovation strategies adopted by firms in the Canadian
auto sector have been influenced heavily by structural
characteristics — specifically the integration of the North
American market and the role of foreign-controlled
assemblers. But the global success of parts makers such as
Magna and Linamar shows that ambitious Canadian firms can
expand from their base in a Canada-U.S. supply chain to serve
the world market.

 The experience of Canada’s auto industry shows that it is
possible to build a competitive industry without a strong base
of domestic R&D. The structure of the sector in Canada has
instead led to innovation strategies that focus on process
efficiency and workplace practices. This raises the question as
to whether public policies could be designed to foster more
such gains in productivity, including in resource industries
where process innovation is also the prominent strategy. While
questions of policy design are beyond the mandate of the
panel, the message is that innovation policies in Canada should
not be too heavily focused on the more typical measures of
innovation, such as R&D spending. These do not adequately
take into account the Canadian context with its unusually high
reliance on sectors that are components of global supply chains
and that do not necessarily rely on significant R&D spending to
achieve greater productivity.

 The recent decline of the automotive sector in the face of an
extraordinary convergence of adverse factors — some demandrelated and some exchange-rate-related — shows that Canada’s
automotive policy will need to become more flexible and
proactive. Fostering Canadian-based innovation by both vehicle
assemblers and parts makers should be a goal of a new
Canadian auto strategy that emerges from the industry’s crisis.
LIFE SCIENCES: GREAT PROMISE BUT MIXED RESULTS
Life sciences comprise the most R&D-intensive sector of the
economy and generally exhibit a strong strategic commitment to
innovation. Companies in health-related life sciences are of three
main types, each of which faces different issues:
 Large, brand name pharmaceutical companies are foreign
owned and dominate the industry with more than 80% of total
sales.

 Small R&D-oriented companies − biotech or medical devices
− account for relatively insignificant sales but are important
generators of innovation and future growth.

 Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers represent more than
15% of industry sales and 40% of volume, but do relatively little
R&D. Canadian generic firms are nevertheless quite
competitive and export a significant proportion of their sales.
In total, Canada spends slightly more than $6 billion annually on
R&D in health-related life sciences. More than half supports basic
and pre-commercialization research done in universities and
teaching hospitals and is funded primarily by governments and
private non-profits. Businesses in Canada and foreign sources
account for about 40% of total R&D funding in the sector.

<-----Page 22----->Page 23

Canada’s Performance and Challenges in Life Sciences Innovation
Beginning in the 1980s, Canadian governments adopted a variety of
policies specifically to encourage growth in life sciences R&D. As
part of this initiative, the multinational pharmaceutical companies
committed to spend 10% of their sales on R&D in return for
favourable patent legislation. Private-sector R&D spending has been
complemented by significant public-sector investments. This
concerted investment nevertheless failed to produce the economic
results desired or expected. For example, the share of the
pharmaceutical industry in Canada’s business GDP has fluctuated
around 0.5% (Figure 14(a)), despite the large increase in R&D
intensity (Figure 14(b)).
While there has been some modest success in growing mid-sized
health biotech firms in Canada, most have been absorbed by larger
global enterprises. The one area where Canada has had increased
commercial success is in generics, which benefited from the
government’s previous policy of compulsory licensing.

small Canadian biotech companies, the most appropriate ties to the
large pharmas are typically not through their Canadian subsidiaries,
but directly with R&D or product development groups abroad. Since
the symbiosis between biotech and pharma is increasingly important,
the countries that will become leaders in the health-related life
sciences are those that create conditions where the mutual
interdependence can flourish.

Competition for R&D Mandates
The competition for global R&D mandates has intensified and
Canada is increasingly competing against low-cost locations like
China and India and several highly developed countries as well.
Although the research environment in Canada is strong, the country
is seen by the global industry as increasingly uncompetitive in terms
of market access to provincial formularies, drug pricing and patent
rules, which, in combination, undermine new business opportunities.

Climate for New Ventures
Small biotech companies, which are dependent on external financing
to fund research and product development, face the same issues that
confront other innovative new ventures, as outlined in Section 7.
However, the exceptionally long development cycles in health
biotech — often taking 10 to 15 years from initial discovery to final
regulatory approval — present a challenge that other technologybased sectors do not face to the same extent. To get a health biotech
startup to market therefore requires risk capital that is both large and
patient.

The 1990s saw a significant increase in funding for new biotech
ventures in Canada. Unfortunately, too many startups were created
with neither experienced management nor a viable business case.
Inexperienced venture capitalists compounded the problem by
failing to bring to bear the due diligence and operational expertise
that is always needed to weed out unlikely prospects and install better
management. The poor results of the venture investments in the
1990s have produced a predictable pullback, with the entire sector
now finding it difficult to obtain additional funding.

Figure 14: Pharmaceutical Industry — Canada and U.S.
The R&D intensity of the pharma industry in Canada actually exceeded that of the U.S. after the late
1990s — the result of industry undertakings in the context of Canadian patent law tightening. But
the size of the sector in Canada did not grow and in 2002 was much smaller relative to the U.S. than
it had been in 1987.

Segmenting the Product Development Value Chain
The past decade has seen a significant shift in the R&D spending of
the global pharmaceutical companies. During the 1990s, while their
worldwide R&D expenditures tripled, the number of new drugs
approved is estimated to have fallen by about half. This has forced
the major pharmas worldwide to look beyond their own doors for
new opportunities. The shift in strategy has fit with the need for
smaller biotech firms to seek out partners to take promising
compounds through high-cost later-stage trials and to market. For

Some Lessons for Business Innovation Strategy
 The strategies of life sciences companies are strongly science
based and thus are heavily influenced by public policies that
support R&D as well as research and training in universities.
Public policies in respect of health procurement and regulation
are also of great importance, particularly for multinational
pharmaceutical firms where there is strong and increasing
competition among national affiliates for innovation and
product mandates. The strategies of the smaller,
biotechnology-based companies are very heavily influenced by
(i) the availability of patient early-stage finance and mentorship,
and (ii) their ability to strike collaborative arrangements with
global pharmas.

 The experience of life sciences demonstrates what can and
cannot be accomplished through a targeted government policy.
The federal government set out to generate increased R&D
spending in the life sciences in Canada and it worked, but it has
not yet produced the expected follow-on benefits, neither of a
growing pharmaceutical sector nor a vibrant, sustainable
biotech industry.

<-----Page 23----->Page 24

 Additional IP protection could strengthen Canada’s position as
an R&D location and help domestic affiliates in winning global
mandates, but new IP policies are not likely to be sufficient.
More important is the fact that, with the exception of Québec,
governments do not view life sciences as a genuinely high
economic priority and do not take a holistic approach to the
sector by insuring that procurement practices are harmonized
with industry development objectives.

 Given Canada’s single-payer health care system, Canadian

Balancing Innovation and Stability
More than in virtually any other sector, innovation in financial
services is a doubled-edged sword. Both the benefits of getting it right
and the costs of getting it wrong are enormous and not easily
managed. In particular, banking is an industry that requires
exceptionally vigilant regulatory oversight in order to ensure that risk
is kept within appropriate bounds, that bank’s obligations are
transparently disclosed and that a high level of funder/depositor
confidence is maintained.

governments could seek to establish a leading role in using
health innovation to improve the productivity and quality of the
health care system. An exceptionally promising initiative is the
partnership among the federal and provincial/territorial
governments through Canada Health Infoway (a federally
funded, not-for-profit organization) to accelerate development
of an electronic health record for all Canadians.

Canadian governments could seek to establish a
leading role in using health innovation to improve
the productivity and quality of the health care
system. An exceptionally promising initiative is
Canada Health Infoway to accelerate development

 Public policies should seek to increase links among industry
participants: global pharmas with their sophisticated product
management and marketing competencies; biotech and
medical devices companies with creative new products but
facing significant regulatory and marketing challenges; and
universities and research centres with great ideas but few links
to the marketplace.
BANKING SERVICES: TRADE-OFF BETWEEN STABILITY AND
RADICAL INNOVATION
The banking sector, which comprises about 60% of the Canadian
financial services industry, has a long history of innovation and
technology adoption including some of the earliest deployments of
automated teller machines, multi-branch banking and electronic bill
payments. The areas where Canada has been an innovation leader
have depended on attaining a critical mass of customer and
merchant adoption in order to generate benefits. The small number
of large banks in Canada provided the necessary scale of adoption of
these technology-based innovations, an advantage that the highly
fragmented banking system in the United States had formerly lacked.
Banking has thus been one of the very few industries where scale has
traditionally played to Canada’s advantage.
Competition and Innovation in Canadian Banking
The major players in the Canadian banking industry compete
primarily through mild product differentiation aimed at creating
brand recognition and loyalty. The particular structure of the
industry — a small number of well-established national players —
reduces the incentive for “visible” innovation (in products, services
and marketing) since such innovation can be quickly copied by the
other banks, thus nullifying the benefits being sought by the first
innovator. Innovation in the Canadian setting instead typically takes
the form of internal process and organizational improvements, which
are less visible and therefore less readily copied. (This is supported
by heavy investment in ICT physical capital and software, which
embody a great deal of innovation indirectly.) Product and service
innovations from elsewhere eventually diffuse across the Canadian
banking industry after an innovation has proven successful, and the
costs and risks have become well understood. This “early follower”
strategy has kept the industry in Canada from slipping behind.

The events that rocked the world’s financial system in 2008, and
subsequently, are proof that innovation and specialization do not
always create beneficial results. The banking crisis is a case where
several financial innovations combined in unforeseen ways to
generate a drastically negative outcome. The catastrophic
consequences for many banks in the United States and elsewhere
have not been felt to nearly the same extent in Canada where high
standards of bank supervision and more cautious business strategies
(e.g., relatively few “subprime” mortgages were created) have
insulated Canadian banks from the worst of the global financial
sector turmoil.
Some Lessons for Business Innovation Strategy
The innovation strategies of the major Canadian-owned banks
strongly reflect the market structure of the sector. The state of
domestic competition has militated against a strong focus on
product innovation leadership (being content with early
adoption).





The generally more conservative banking and regulatory
practices prevailing in Canada — relative particularly to those in
the United States and Europe — have kept Canadian banks off
the “bleeding edge” of innovation in the design and distribution
of the most sophisticated financial instruments. The analysts at
the IMF consider that the performance and stability of Canada’s
major banks are among the best in the world.



The success of Canadian banks over many years may have
dulled their business ambition. With limited exceptions,
Canadian banks were, until fairly recently, content to focus on
the domestic market and to restrict their international activity
primarily to commodity-type wholesale banking as parties to
international lending consortia. Now Canada’s banks have
become more aggressively and creatively outward-looking with
many examples of large investments to establish a substantive
presence abroad.



The recent turmoil in the banking industry globally has created
a window of opportunity for Toronto to become one of the
major North American, if not worldwide, innovation centres for
the financial services industry. Canadian banks have economic

<-----Page 24----->Page 25

and strategic decisions to make as to where to locate their
product and service development, software programming, data
centres and other innovative activities going forward. With the
right business climate, Toronto has the potential to emerge as a
centre not only for these activities, but also to attract specialists
from around the world to create financial industry products and
services.
ICT: A CATALYTIC ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT
Information and communications technologies are vitally important
for innovation because (i) the producers of ICT are themselves key
innovation-intensive sectors of the economy; and (ii) the use of ICT
in other sectors contributes increasingly to productivity growth in the
entire economy, and particularly in service sectors.
Canada’s Challenges in ICT Innovation
As with other technology-intensive sectors in Canada, the Canadian
ICT industry is significantly smaller (as a share of GDP) than its
counterpart in the United States. For Canada to improve its position
in ICT, the challenge is to grow more businesses that can expand the
sector’s role both in the domestic economy and in exports.

Slower Adoption of New Technology
The slow adoption of new ICT by Canadian small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), as compared with SMEs in the United
States, was a significant source of the growing ICT investment gap
during the 1990s. The reasons for this are still debated. Attitudinal
issues may explain the technology-follower approach of Canadian
firms. While the relative cost of capital and labour and the weak
Canadian dollar have also had an impact on investment in ICT at
least until the last few years, the perception of many industry
participants is that too many Canadian SME managers lack formal
training and thus lack the knowledge and confidence to take full
advantage of the benefits of ICT. This adoption gap has an impact
on the ICT-producing sectors. In addition to shrinking the effective
size of the Canadian market, it leaves Canadian new entrants with
too few local lead customers and has the further effect of limiting the
development of a surrounding ecosystem of ICT service and support
firms that can evolve into growing ventures themselves.

The role of government in ICT sectors has typically
been catalytic, enabling an innovative line of
activity to take root and to build scale to the point
where commercial viability has emerged.

Globalization of Value Chains
Canadian firms cannot compete internationally on cost — instead,
they must rely on superior skill and value creation. One response has
been to create “fabless” semiconductor companies, where the design
is conducted in Canada and the manufacturing is outsourced.
Canada has also had success in software, but to maintain and grow
capacity, the domestic workforce must remain competitive in the
face of the improving skill levels in developing countries. Recent
trends are cause for concern. During the 2005-06 academic year, for
example, the share of enrolment at Canadian universities in
mathematics, computer and information sciences was the lowest
since 1992.

Some Lessons for Business Innovation Strategy
The ICT sector is a heterogeneous collection of industries
encompassing many different innovation strategies as the following
examples illustrate.
 The fact that several large players in the computer industry in
Canada are foreign controlled has not stunted Canada-based
product innovation activity as has been the case, for example,
in the automotive and industrial chemicals industries. The
prospect of government procurement contracts for ICT firms
that established a substantial presence in Canada provided in
some cases (notably IBM) an initial attraction that grew into
major activities with global product mandates. This experience
shows that government’s role as lead customer can, under the
right conditions, provide the impetus to kick-start a new
industry. The case of ICT procurement, which catalyzed
substantial economic development, stands in contrast to the
very different philosophy of health sector procurement that has
prevailed for pharmaceutical products.

 Canada became a leader early on in satellite and microwave
communications technology in order to communicate across a
vast geography, a mission that was initially supported by
targeted government research and enterprise. For example,
Telesat was founded in 1969 as a joint government-privatesector business.

 The climate for new ICT ventures (hardware, software,
systems and services) in Canada has been quite favourable in
view of (i) a strong base of research and training in universities
and colleges, and in major players like Nortel, IBM and RIM;
(ii) government supports such as the SR&ED tax credit and
various laboratories and programs; and (iii) supportive clusters
of ICT subsector activity in several centres across Canada. The
many successes have produced numerous role models and
angel investors, and bred confidence in young ICT
entrepreneurs that they could succeed in Canada. Business
ambition has not been in short supply although lack of a strong
base of leading-edge ICT customers in Canada is a significant
drawback. Unfortunately, the sharp decline in the
telecommunications technology sector since 2001 (now
exacerbated by the global recession) has hit Canada particularly
hard in view of this country’s specialization in several of the
most heavily affected market segments. Canada’s hard-won
advantages are now at risk.
A theme running strongly through the foregoing examples is the key
influence of government, at least at the outset. The initiating
influence has taken many forms — early procurement, public-private
commercial partnership in support of a national mission (satellite
communication), and research support through targeted university
funding and sector-oriented government facilities and programs. The
role of government in ICT sectors has typically been catalytic,
enabling an innovative line of activity to take root and to build scale
to the point where commercial viability has emerged.

11. CONCLUSIONS
The panel has approached innovation as an economic process rather
than as a primarily science and engineering activity. The panel’s
analysis of business innovation in Canada thus provides a perspective
on the fundamental factors that connect business strategy, innovation
activity and productivity growth. The analysis demonstrates that the
persistent weakness of productivity growth in Canada is rooted in
subpar business innovation. The main quantitative evidence is
Canada’s persistently slow growth in multifactor productivity. When
measured over long periods of time, MFP growth provides the
appropriate broad measure of business innovation — that is, the
combination of human and capital resources in new or more
efficient ways to create value. While this is not a new finding, this
report describes Canada’s innovation shortcomings in quantitative
terms more precisely than most previous studies have.
The panel’s principal conclusion is that Canada’s poor performance
in respect of innovation is due to the prevalence of business
strategies that do not emphasize innovation as a key competitive tool.
It follows that the starting point of any exercise that aims to improve
Canada’s productivity performance should be to understand why so
many Canadian businesses and entrepreneurs choose business
strategies that place little emphasis on innovation. A focus on the
determinants of business strategy, rather than on innovation activities
themselves, is the most significant new contribution of this study.

The many successes of Canadian businesses in the
hyper-competitive global marketplace show that
there is nothing innate or inevitable in the national
character that prevents Canada’s businesses from
being just as innovative and productive as those of
other nations.
The principal determinants that influence the business innovation
decision can be categorized broadly as (i) particular structural
characteristics, (ii) competitive intensity, (iii) the climate for new
ventures, (iv) public policies that encourage or inhibit innovation,
and (v) business ambition (e.g., entrepreneurial aggressiveness and
growth orientation). These five factors are themselves influenced by
certain deep and long-standing features of Canada’s economy, of
which the two most significant are the following:

 Canada is “upstream” in many North American industries.
This positioning, which is related to important structural
characteristics such as sector mix and foreign control, is the
result of Canada’s resource endowment and development
history as a commodity supplier and technology adopter.
Canada’s upstream position in many continentally integrated
value chains limits contact with ultimate end-customers (who
are a strong source of motivation and direction for innovation),
and shapes the nature of business ambition in many sectors.

 Canada’s domestic market is relatively small and geographically
fragmented. Small markets offer lower potential reward for
undertaking the risk of innovation and tend to attract fewer
competitors, and thus provide less incentive for a business to
innovate in order to survive. Of course the innovation success
of countries like Finland and Sweden shows that the
disadvantage of a small domestic market can be offset by a
strong orientation toward innovation-intensive exports.

Addressing Canada’s Innovation Challenge
Canada has a serious productivity growth problem. The statistical
evidence is unambiguous and of long standing. The panel believes
that Canadians should be concerned about the productivity of our
export-oriented economy as competition from China and other
emerging economies intensifies. Strong productivity growth is the
way to remain internationally competitive with a rising standard of
living. The panel also believes that Canadians should be concerned
about the long-run consequences of continued weak productivity
performance in the domestic economy as the population ages and
competition intensifies among the mature economies for the best
human skills, and particularly for entrepreneurial talent.
Because Canada’s productivity problem is actually a business
innovation problem, the discussion about what needs to be done to
improve productivity in Canada needs to focus on the factors that
encourage, or discourage, the adoption of innovation-based business
strategies. This is a complex challenge because the mix of relevant
factors varies from sector to sector and requires a much broader
conception of innovation than the conventional R&D-centred view,
which, while important, is far too limiting.
The short case studies in this report illustrate the great variety in the
circumstances facing individual sectors of the Canadian economy
and the very different incentives and constraints that affect the choice
of innovation strategy in each. There is no single cause of the
innovation problem in Canada, nor is there any one-size-fits-all
remedy. Public policy in respect of innovation therefore needs to be
informed by a deep understanding of the factors that influence
business decision makers, sector by sector, and this clearly requires
extensive consultation with business people themselves as well as the
further development of innovation surveys and other forms of microanalysis of the innovation process.
Overarching the sector-specific factors that influence innovation
strategies, there are certain issues of pervasive influence identified in
the panel’s analysis that suggest the need for proactive public policies
to:
 encourage investment in advanced M&E in general, and in
ICT in particular (such incentives should be designed only in
light of a more thorough understanding of the reasons for the
relatively slow adoption of ICT in Canada to date);

 sharpen the incentive for innovation-oriented business
strategies by increasing exposure to competition and by
promoting a stronger export-orientation on the part of
Canadian firms, particularly in goods and services that are
downstream in the value chain and thus closer to end-users;

 improve the climate for new ventures so as to better translate
opportunities arising from Canada’s university research
excellence into viable Canadian-based growth businesses,
bearing in mind that better early-stage financing and
experienced mentorship hold the key; and

 support areas of Canadian strength and opportunity through
focused, consistent sector-oriented strategies, such as was done
in the past in, for example, the automotive, aerospace and ICT
industries.

little to do with the booms and busts of the economic cycle. As
governments in Canada continue to take measures in the near term
to mitigate the downturn, the panel’s diagnosis of the nature and
underlying causes of Canada’s generally weak business innovation
performance can help to target those measures so that they also
strengthen the nation’s economy for the long term.

The panel has completed its analysis of business innovation in the
shadow of the most severe global economic downturn in decades.
The panel has nevertheless remained focused on the long term
because Canada’s innovation conundrum is deeply rooted and has
