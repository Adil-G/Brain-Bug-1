Explaining the Influence of Anger and Compassion on Negotiators’ Interaction Goals: An
Assessment of Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct Mediators
Abstract
This study examined the influence of anger and compassion, two discrete emotions that differ in
valence and appraisals, on negotiators’ interaction goals through trust and distrust, two related,
but functionally distinct constructs. Findings showed that the influence of anger (a negative
emotion with appraisal of other-person control) on perceived importance of competitively
oriented goals was mediated by distrust, but not trust, whereas the influence of compassion (a
positive emotion with appraisal of situational control) on perceived importance of cooperatively
oriented goals was mediated by trust, but not distrust. This study not only sheds light on the
process whereby anger and compassion influence negotiation performance, but also supports the
proposition that trust and distrust represent two distinct psychological processes that are
associated with different antecedents and consequences.

Explaining the Influence of Anger and Compassion on Negotiators’ Interaction Goals: An
Assessment of Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct Mediators
Negotiation is often an emotion-laden process whereby two or more parties who have
incompatible interests need to work out a mutually acceptable solution. Negotiators may come to
the meetings with a rational analysis of possible outcomes. However, many of their aspirations
may be thwarted in the encounters with the other party, a precondition for a wide range of
emotions to arise. A growing body of research shows that emotions have a significant impact on
negotiation performance, such as the use of bargaining tactics (Butt, Choi, & Jaeger, 2005;
Carnevale & Isen, 1986; Liu, 2009), the direction and size of concessions parties make (Van
Kleef, De Dreu, & Manstead, 2004; Sinaceur & Tiedens, 2006), the type of outcomes (Anderson
& Thompson, 2004), the amount of individual or joint gains (Allred, Mallozzi, Matsui, & Raia,
1997), and perceived relationships between parties (Allred et al., 1997). For example, Allrd et
al.’s study found that negotiators who felt high anger and low compassion toward the counterpart
achieved smaller joint gains and had less desire to work with each other in the future. Although
these studies have yielded important insights into what effects emotions have on negotiation
performance, we are theoretically under-equipped to explain how these effects take place.
This study seeks to fill in the theoretical “void” by investigating viable mechanisms
through which anger and compassion, two other-directed, discrete emotions, have distinct effects
on negotiators’ interaction goals, based on the premise that interaction goals play an important
role in shaping negotiators’ bargaining tactics and outcomes (Liu & Wilson, in press; Wilson &
Putnam, 1990). Specifically, drawing upon cognitive theories of emotions and beliefs as well as
scholarship that characterized trust and distrust as two distinct constructs that are associated with
different antecedents and consequences, we assessed how the influence of anger and compassion
on negotiators’ goals is differentially mediated by trust and distrust. The following section

<-----Page 3----->Trust and Distrust 4
reviews relevant literature in each of the three areas (emotions, interaction goals, and trust and
distrust) that informs key hypotheses of the study. Next, we describe the methods used to
evaluate the hypotheses as well as our findings. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical
implications of these findings and directions for future research.
The Role of Anger and Compassion in Negotiation
Earlier negotiation research that considers the role of emotion tends to focus on affects or
moods that are more enduring, of low intensity, and not associated with a specific target (e.g.,
Carnevale & Isen, 1986). In the past decade, discrete emotions that are more intense and directed
toward a specific person have received increasing attention from negotiation scholars (e.g.,
Allred et al., 1997; Liu, 2009). Negative emotions, especially anger, have received far more
attention than other discrete emotions because they are more likely to be prevalent in situations
where conflicts and negotiations occur (Allred, 1999). Positive emotions, such as happiness and
compassion, were often examined as a contrast to anger. The current study focuses on anger and
compassion as two social emotions (i.e., occurring only as a result of real or imagined encounters
with other people, see Leary, 2000) that derive from appraising the same social event in different
ways. Such a contrast helps to illuminate the processes through which different emotions
produce distinct effects on negotiators’ judgments and motivation.
Studies that focus on genuinely felt emotions (as opposed to strategically expressed
emotions) draw heavily on cognitive appraisal theories to induce emotions. Appraisal theorists
believe all emotions are initiated by an individual’s appraisal of events in the environment in
relation to the things that he or she cares about, and that these appraisals also affect the
consequences of emotions (Parrot, 2004). Researchers have identified a variety of appraisal
dimensions to distinguish between discrete emotions (e.g., Smith & Elliworth, 1985). For
example, judgment of responsibility is a cognitive appraisal concerning the relationship between

<-----Page 4----->Trust and Distrust 5
a person’s success or failure (i.e., whether a person’s goals are accomplished or thwarted) and
the factors that may account for it (e.g., ability, effort, luck, see Weiner, 1995). Inferences about
another person’s responsibility (i.e., what he or she “should” or “ought to” have done) are guided
by a distinction between internal (dispositional) versus external (situational) causality. Internal
causes, such as lack of effort that caused failure in a game, often are perceived as controllable;
an individual is judged personally responsible for such behavior because he or she could have
done otherwise to prevent the negative outcome. On the other hand, external causes, such as a
physical injury from training that caused poor performance in a game, often are perceived as
uncontrollable; an individual is judged as having less or no personal responsibility for such
behavior because there was not much he or she could have done to prevent what had happened.
Consequently, angry feelings tend to arise when one judges another person to be responsible for
a negative event, whereas compassionate feelings tend to result from the perception that the other
person is not responsible because of extenuating circumstances. Considerable evidence has
supported the associations between judgment of responsibility and these two emotions (e.g.,
Allred et al., 1997; MacGeorge, 2001; Schmidt & Weiner, 1988).
It should be noted that the study of compassion has a long tradition in religion, medicine,
and sociology, as a cardinal moral emotion or a selfless belief state motivating prosocial action
(Dreyfus, 2002). Only recently have scholars begun to understand its impact as a discrete
emotion in interpersonal and organizational processes, such as social support provision
(MacGeorge, 2001), negotiation (Allred et al., 1997), leadership (Scalise, 2007), and
organizational commitment (Lillius, Worline, Maitlis, Kanov, Dutton, & Frost, 2008).
Compassion is frequently used interchangeably with sympathy, empathy, and pity1, especially
when it results from witnessing another’s suffering. In this study, we follow Allred et al.’s (1997)

<-----Page 5----->Trust and Distrust 6
method of inducing compassion in a bargaining context where a negotiator perceives the other
party as not personally responsible for thwarting the negotiator’s goals because of external,
uncontrollable circumstances. Like Allred et al. (1997), we treat compassion as a positive
emotion that involves empathy and understanding regarding the other’s intentions and motives
for a past behavior, in that even though the primary appraisal is negative (i.e., it is a goalincongruent event), the second appraisal carries a positive valence (i.e., something external
and/or uncontrollable, rather than the other party personally, accounts for it).
Appraisal theorists assume that emotions serve specific motivational concerns. Emotion
is not thought to lead directly to specific action but rather to put the individual in a state of
readiness for focused behavior that is appropriate for coping adaptively with emotion-arousing
events, known as action tendency (Parrot, 2004). The innate action tendency of anger is “attack
on the agent held to be blameworthy for the offense” (Lazarus, 1991, p. 226); anger often
provokes an intention in an individual to remove the barrier or decrease an unwanted response
through punishment and retaliation. In contrast, compassion entails empathy (a capacity to think
and feel in another person’s place) and is associated with a readiness to help (Weiner, 1995;
2006). Despite these automatic and impulsive action tendencies, an individual’s actual behavior
to cope with the situation draws heavily upon perceptions about what is possible in the context
and what one is capable of doing (Lazarus, 1991). The following sections (a) introduce perceived
importance of interaction goals as a viable construct for linking emotions with specific forms of
behavior, and (b) discuss trust and distrust as one set of mediating variables for explaining the
distinct effects of anger and compassion on the importance negotiators place upon various goals.
Interaction Goals in Negotiation
The concept of interaction goals has been introduced in the message production literature

<-----Page 6----->Trust and Distrust 7
as a useful construct for explaining why individuals say what they do in social interactions.
Interaction goals are desired futures states of affairs that can only be achieved through
communication and coordination with others; they provide insights into the cognitive processes
that lead to specific forms of behavior (Wilson, 2002). Whereas negotiation scholars typically
treat goals as monetary target or resistance points set for the entire negotiation or even multiple
negotiations, message production scholars commonly assume that individuals often pursue
multiple, sometimes conflicting goals during social interaction (e.g., Dillard, 1989; O’Keefe &
Shepherd, 1987; Wilson & Putnam, 1990). For example, negotiators may desire to push toward
an agreement where they can claim the largest portion of the pie possible; they may also be
concerned about establishing a trusting relationship with the other party, which at times may
“pull” them back from achieving the former goal.
Research has shown that interaction goals can predict strategic behavior in conflict
management (e.g., Canary, Cunningham, & Cody, 1988; Keck & Samp, 2007), negotiation (Liu
& Wilson, in press), social influence (Olufowote, Miller, & Wilson, 2005), emotional support
(Burleson & Mortenson, 2003), and teamwork situations (Monahan & Samp, 2007). For
example, Liu and Wilson (in press) found that when negotiators placed greater importance on
competitively oriented interaction goals, they used more distributive persuasion and fewer
priority information exchange tactics; furthermore, interaction goals produced a significant
impact (direct or indirect) both on the size of joint profit and on dyad members’ individual gains.
Given the established links between goals, tactics, and outcomes, this study focuses on the direct
and indirect influence of emotions (i.e., anger and compassion) on interaction goals to shed light
on the process whereby these emotions influence negotiation performance.
Specifically, angry feelings entail a behavioral readiness to attack, to punish, or to

<-----Page 7----->Trust and Distrust 8
retaliate. In a bargaining context where negotiating parties have both incompatible and
interdependent interests (Tjosvold, 1998), the extent to which these automatic action tendencies
translate into actual, specific bargaining tactics depends on how a negotiator (re)defines the
bargaining situation and (re)formulates goals. Wilson and Putnam (1990) identified three types
of interaction goals in negotiation: instrumental (or task-oriented goals, e.g., obtaining money or
information), relational (e.g., gaining power or building trust), and identity goals (e.g., managing
one’s own or the other party’s face). Interaction goals reflect a negotiator’s social motives (i.e., a
negotiator’s preference for particular outcome distributions between him-or herself and the
counterpart, De Dreu, 2004).2 The mixed-motive nature of negotiation often places negotiators in
a position of pursuing multiple, sometimes conflicting goals concomitantly (e.g., wanting to
maximize joint profit but also to avoid being taken advantage of). Therefore, as compared with
action tendencies, interaction goals are more specific, multifaceted, and arise from the contextual
features of the interaction. The current study employs a job contract negotiation scenario to
examine the hypothesized links. We assess eight interaction goals that vary in type (instrumental,
relational, and identity) and motivation (competitive vs. cooperative). We predict that:
H1:

Angry negotiators will place greater importance on competitively oriented
interaction goals, such as getting a better deal than the counterpart, withholding
information, attacking the other’s face, and gaining power over the other party.

On the other hand, compassionate feelings entail empathy, an ability to take another
person’s perspective, as well as a behavioral readiness to help. In a bargaining process such
feelings can motivate negotiators to be concerned about the counterpart’s needs and interests,
both tangible and intangible. Thus, we hypothesize that:
H2:

Compassionate negotiators will place greater importance on cooperatively

<-----Page 8----->Trust and Distrust 9
oriented interaction goals, such as maximizing both parties’ profit, exchanging
information concerning interests and priorities, enhancing the other’s face, and
establishing a positive relationship with the other party.
Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct Mediators
Although interaction goals can serve as a viable construct linking emotions with specific
forms of negotiation behavior, the link between emotions and interaction goals requires further
theorizing. Emotion theorists contend that we must understand the influence of emotions on
beliefs in order to understand their impact upon human life (see Forgas, 2000; Frijda, Manstead,
& Bem, 2000). Beliefs are thoughts and judgments concerning what is true; they extend to the
causes or intentions behind events, their likely consequences, and the enduring properties of
things or persons that make them behave in a particular manner (Frijda & Mesquita, 2000).
Beliefs may result from the way an event is appraised and therefore be parts of emotions, but
beliefs tend to involve generalizations and are about stable and intrinsic properties of the object.
The current study examines perceived trust and distrust as one set of beliefs that can potentially
explain the differential effects of anger and compassion on negotiators’ interaction goals.
Trust and Distrust: A Tale of Two Dimensions
Researchers have yet to reach consensus on definitions of trust and distrust (for a review
of various definitions, see Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998). Nonetheless, most scholars agree
that trust and distrust are cognitive notions involving an individual’s positive or negative
perceptions of another’s intentions and motives, as well as a willingness to act upon such beliefs
(e.g., Deutsch, 1960, Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995). Early research has implicitly treated
trust and distrust as direct opposites of each other on one conceptual spectrum. Evidence of low
trust was routinely assumed to be that of high distrust. The majority of the extant literature on

<-----Page 9----->Trust and Distrust 10
trust is based on this premise. In these works, the positive impacts of interpersonal trust are welldocumented (e.g., Butler, 1995, 1999; Kimmel, Pruitt, Magenau, Konar-Goldband, & Carnevale,
1980), whereas distrust receives little attention.
Recent scholarship has identified distrust as a distinct construct that is related to, but
qualitatively different from trust ( Cho, 2006; Lewicki et al., 1998; Kramer, 1999). Whereas trust
is defined in terms of an individual’s positive expectation of another’s conduct and a willingness
to cooperate (McAllister, 1995), distrust is viewed as the expectation that the other party may
engage in harmful actions against oneself, thus triggering a desire to “buffer oneself from the
effects of another’s [expected] conduct” (Lewicki et al., 1998, p. 439). The elements that
contribute to the growth and decline of trust and distrust are often separate. For example, one can
trust a barber to do a good haircut (i.e., trust his competence), but think the barber may
overcharge him when chance permits (i.e., distrust his integrity). Having high trust in one facet
of a social relationship, therefore, does not preclude one from having high distrust in another;
distrust is different from low trust in that it emphasizes negative expectations rather than the
absence of positive expectations. This is especially true in negotiation, where negotiators need to
constantly balance the desire to trust the counterpart and reciprocate with integrative tactics (e.g.,
sharing information and formulating mutually beneficial tradeoffs) and to distrust the counterpart
and engage in distributive tactics (e.g., withholding information and claiming value for oneself).
This distinction has led researchers to believe that the antecedents and consequences
associated with distrust are distinct from those surrounding trust. A recent study conducted by
Cho (2006), in particular, supports this proposition. Specifically, he found that buyers’
perception regarding online sellers’ benevolence fosters trust, whereas their perception
concerning the sellers’ competence reduces distrust; trust is more crucial in determining buyers’

<-----Page 10----->Trust and Distrust 11
commitment, whereas distrust discourages consumers from disclosing information about
themselves. This is consistent with broader research that demonstrates the separability of
positive-valent and negative-valent constructs for affect (Watson & Tellegen, 1985),
optimism/pessimism (Stallings, Dunham, Gatz, & Bengston, 1997), and interracial attitudes
(Katz & Hass, 1988). Such consistency suggests that trust and distrust may be associated with
other processes (e.g., emotions) in ways that are consistent with their valence.
Feeling is Believing: Emotions and Judgments Concerning Trust and Distrust
In contrast to a large body of research examining the role of cognition in emotion, the
influence of emotion on beliefs has been under-explored (Forgas, 2000). Nevertheless, a number
of models have been advanced to theorize the relationship between emotion and judgment. One
group of models views affect as information; in this light, mood influences judgment through
biased retrieval of mood-congruent information from memory (Bower, 1981; Schwarz & Clore,
1988). Thus, negative affect leads to negative assessments of the target, and the opposite is true
for positive affect. Going one step further, Forgas’s (1995) Affect Infusion Model (AIM)
identifies cognitive processing strategies (i.e., direct access, motivated, heuristic, and substantive
processing) that can moderate the relationship between mood and judgment. For example, when
individuals engage in heuristic processing (i.e., rely on cognitive shortcuts or heuristics) they are
likely to make mood congruent judgments; however, when individuals engage in motivated
processing (involving highly selective information search directed by a specific motivational
objective), their judgments may not be mood congruent.
These models have received considerable support from empirical research. A growing
body of literature suggests that incidental emotions (i.e., emotions stemming from a prior,
unrelated event) produce judgments that are congruent with their cognitive appraisals (e.g.,

<-----Page 11----->Trust and Distrust 12
Keltner, Ellsworth, & Edwards, 1993; Lerner & Keltner, 2000). Tiedens and Linton (2001) found
that emotions associated with certainty appraisals (e.g., anger) promotes heuristic processing;
therefore they are more likely to produce valence-congruent effects. Researchers did not link
emotions with trust until recently. Dunn and Schweitzer (2005) examined how trust judgments
were influenced by incidental emotions. Consistent with the models discussed above, their study
found that emotions with appraisals of other-person control influence trust in a manner consistent
with the emotion’s valence (e.g., gratitude increases trust whereas anger decreases trust),
especially when dealing with unfamiliar partners (when heuristic processing is more likely).
Although empirical work on emotion and judgment tends to focus on incidental
emotions, research has demonstrated that discrete integral emotions (i.e., event-specific
emotions) have a significant impact on judgment that is even stronger than incidental mood
states. For example, Allred et al. (1997) found that anger and compassion directed toward the
target produced a stronger impact on negotiators’ accuracy of judgment concerning the target’s
interests than their general mood states. The current study, therefore, expects to find that the two
integral emotions (i.e., anger and compassion) with related (both high in certainty) but distinct
appraisals (other-person vs. situational control) will influence trust and distrust in valencecongruent ways. Given that anger arises from the perception that the target has intentionally done
something harmful, it is likely to increase distrust, or negative expectation of the target’s
subsequent behavior. On the other hand, as compassion stems from the perception that the target
engaged in undesirable behaviors due to external circumstances beyond personal control, it is
likely to be associated with trust, or positive judgment of the target’s intentions and motives.
Linking Trust and Distrust with Goals
Trust and distrust have been defined in terms of the willingness or desire to act upon

<-----Page 12----->Trust and Distrust 13
positive (or negative) expectations about the (dis)trustee’s actions and/or motives. Given the
expectation that the other party will engage in harmful activities against oneself, distrust entails a
propensity to protect oneself from such conduct (Lewicki et al., 1998). Researchers have
identified at least two behavioral consequences of negotiator distrust (or paranoia): defensive
noncooperation, which entails withdrawal from cooperative behavior, and moral aggression,
which refers to the intense negative reactions individuals sometimes experience when they
anticipate being treated in an unfair, unjust, or untrustworthy fashion (Kramer, 2004). Because
negotiating parties come to the negotiation table with incompatible interests, a distrusting
negotiator tends to view negotiation as a win-lose game. Such a distributive mindset may
motivate the distruster to place greater importance on interaction goals that are competitively
oriented, such as to withhold information, to get a better deal than the counterpart, to gain power
over the other party, and to attack the other’s face. On the other hand, researchers have
associated trust with the willingness to count on (Gillespie, 2003; McAllister, 1995), to cooperate
with (Parks, Henager, & Scamahorn, 1996), and to be friend with the trustee (Fukuyama, 1996).
Given the positive expectations regarding the counterpart’s intentions and motives, a trusting
negotiator is likely to view both parties’ interests as interdependent and place greater importance
on cooperatively oriented goals, such as to promote information exchange, to maximize both
parties’ profit, to enhance the other’s face, and to promote a positive relationship with the other
party. Thus, based on existing research on emotions and beliefs, as well as scholarship on trust
and distrust as two functionally distinct constructs, we hypothesize:
H3:

The influence of anger on competitively oriented interaction goals will be
mediated by distrust, but not trust.

H4:

The influence of compassion on cooperatively oriented interaction goals will be

<-----Page 13----->Trust and Distrust 14
mediated by trust, but not distrust.
Method
Participants
Participants were 277 college students (97 men and 180 women) recruited from a major
Eastern university in the U.S. through an on-line participant pool. The majority of the
participants (69%, N = 191) identified themselves as White/Caucasian. The others identified
themselves as Asian American (14.4%, N = 40), African American (12.3%, N = 34), and Latino
American (4.3%, N = 12). They were 19.62 years in age on average and received a small amount
of extra credit from their course instructors for participating in this study.
Survey Procedures and Hypothetical Scenarios
Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions that varied by
manipulation condition (high vs. low responsibility) and bargaining role (employer vs.
employee). They read a negotiation scenario where they took on the role of either a manager of a
large-consulting firm or a prospective employee to negotiate over an employment contract. After
reading the first negotiation task, which is a single-issue, zero-sum game, participants were told
how the other party behaved (i.e., they were given a list of positional statements as well as
persuasive arguments made by the other party) and the result of that negotiation (i.e., a straight
compromise). Participants then completed a questionnaire assessing (a) their perception of the
other party’s behavior and the extent to which the other party was responsible for such behavior,
(b) the emotions they felt toward the other party, and (c) the extent to which they trusted and
distrusted the other party. Participants were then instructed to prepare for a subsequent
negotiation task with the same partner on core employment issues. After they read the
instructions, they were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing the importance they would

<-----Page 14----->Trust and Distrust 15
place on a number of interaction goals if they were to engage in this subsequent negotiation.
The hypothetical scenario has demonstrated validity in prior studies (e.g., Allred et al.,
1997). Participants were told that their objective was to get as good a deal as they could for their
company or for themselves, measured by the total number of points they could earn from the two
negotiation tasks. The first task, which was distributive in nature, concerned what kind of laptop
computer the employee would receive from the company. Three options were available for
discussion, the basic, advanced, and elite options, which varied in price, weight, and accessories,
and were respectively worth 0, 20, and 100 points for the employee and 100, 20, and 0 points for
the manager; thus, both parties must compete in order to win. Moreover, instructions for this task
and responses from “the other party” were intended to elicit contrasting expectations. For
example, “employees” were told that the laptop computer was an important symbol of status and
respect at the firm and aggressive pursuit of the elite option was typically perceived as an
indicator of their requisite confidence to succeed at the firm; however, in the negotiation, the
“manager” argued that the consulting firm frowned upon ostentatious fringe benefits, and most
new recruits had been happy with a basic option computer.
The laptop negotiation was thus designed to elicit perceptions in both parties that the
other party was competitive and stood in their way for achieving desired goals. The experimental
manipulation then focused on altering participants’ perceptions of how responsible the other was
for that negatively perceived behavior. In the low responsibility condition, additional
explanations for the other party’s behavior were provided which aimed to divert participants’
attention to external, uncontrollable causes (i.e., situational constraints). In the employee version,
the participant had learned through a friend that the employer representative had little choice in
the laptop computer he or she could offer because the partners in the firm had previously made
that decision. The employer version stated that the prospective employee was from a graduate

<-----Page 15----->Trust and Distrust 16
program which stressed the importance of new technologies and state-of-art computer
equipment, and the program also instructed students to demand cutting-edge computers in order
to gain the tools and respect needed to be successful. In the high responsibility condition, these
additional explanations (i.e., mitigating information) were not presented.
After participants completed the questionnaire assessing their attribution of
responsibility, emotions, and trust and distrust, they were told that the other party eventually
agreed upon the advanced option laptop computer (i.e., a straight compromise). They were then
asked to prepare for a subsequent negotiation with the other party, which concerned the core
terms of employment, including salary, medical coverage, vacation time, and start date.
Participants were given a payoff schedule that described five options for each issue and were told
that the priorities of these issues were different, as reflected in the point values associated with
each option. For example, in the employee version, the highest salary was worth 660 points, but
the best medical coverage was only worth 100 points, whereas the priority of the two issues is
reversed for managers. Participants were told that for an offer to be acceptable, they should try to
get a minimum of 900 points (a straight compromise for all issues only leads to 620 points). This
task, which contained integrative potential (i.e., both parties could “win” by trading off issues of
differential importance), can motivate participants to form a variety of interaction goals that are
both competitively and cooperatively oriented. Participants completed an interaction goals
questionnaire after reading this hypothetical negotiation task, but were not asked to negotiate.
Measures
Judgment of responsibility for a negative behavior. This construct consists of two
components: (a) judgment of how negative the other party’s behavior was, and (b) judgment of
how responsible the other party was for such behavior (Weiner, 1995; Allred et al., 1997). Six
items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) assessed the negativity component

<-----Page 16----->Trust and Distrust 17
(e.g., “To what extent do you perceive Mr. Johnson’s behavior as negative?”). Eight items on 7point Likert scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very much) assessed the attribution of responsibility
component (e.g., “To what extent do you hold Mr. Johnson accountable for his behavior?”).
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was performed to assess the two-factor oblique model on
the 14 items. Chi-square value for the overall model fit was significant, χ2(63) = 110.3, p < .001.
Due to the sensitivity of χ2 in large samples, other fit indices were assessed (Kline, 1998).
Examination of these indices showed an acceptable model fit, NNFI = .92, CFI = .95, and SRMR
= .06 (Hu & Bentler, 1999). All the factor loadings were significant at the .05 level. The two
factors were moderately correlated, r = .56. Cronbach’s alpha was .74 for negativity and .76 for
responsibility. Weiner’s (1995) work suggests that the negativity and responsibility elements
have a multiplicative rather than an additive effect on anger and compassion. Thus, we followed
Allred et al.’s (1997) method and multiplied the composite negativity and responsibility scores
for each participant to compute a measure of judgment of responsibility for a negative behavior.
Anger and compassion. Four items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = not at all, 7 = very much)
were included to measure anger, which assessed participants’ feelings of anger, annoyance,
madness, and irritation (MacGeorge, 2001). For compassion, four items assessed participants’
feelings of sympathy, compassion, empathy, and understanding. CFA was performed to assess
the two-factor oblique model on the 8 items. Chi-square value for the overall model fit was
significant, χ2(16) =56.66, p < .001. Other fit indices showed an acceptable model fit, NNFI =
.94, CFI = .96, and SRMR = .07. All but one factor loadings were significant at the .05 level. The
item with insignificant loading (i.e., madness) was dropped. Examination of the fit indices of the
new model showed an acceptable fit, χ2(12) = 29.34, p = .004, NNFI = .96, CFI = .98, and SRMR
= .05. The two factors were not correlated, r = -.04. The internal consistency of the two scales

<-----Page 17----->Trust and Distrust 18
was deemed satisfactory: Cronbach’s alpha was .86 for anger and .77 for compassion.
Trust and Distrust. Measurement items for trust and distrust were developed based on
prior literature (see Appendix) and were pilot tested. Four items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = not
at all, 7 = very much) measured trust and four measured distrust. CFA was performed to assess
the two-factor oblique model on the 8 items. Chi-square value for the overall model fit was
significant, χ2(17) =48.3, p < .001. Other fit indices showed an acceptable model fit, NNFI = .91,
CFI = .95, and SRMR = .05. All the factor loadings were significant at the .05 level. The two
factors were slightly correlated, r = -.30. Cronbach’s alpha was .70 for trust and .77 for distrust.
Interaction goals in negotiation. Measurement items for negotiators’ interaction goals
were developed based on Wilson and Putnam’s (1990) framework and were pilot tested (see
Appendix). 31 items on 7-point Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) assessed
eight interaction goals. CFA was performed to assess two four-factor oblique models for
cooperative and competitive goals respectively. Chi-square value for the cooperative goals model
fit was significant, χ2(81) =134.2, p < .001. Other fit indices showed a good model fit, NNFI =
.96, CFI = .97, and SRMR = .04. All the factor loadings were significant at the .05 level.
Correlations between the four factors ranged from .41 to .81. Chi-square value for the
competitive goals model fit was also significant, χ2(95) =145.9, p < .001. Other fit indices
showed an acceptable model fit, NNFI = .94, CFI = .95, and SRMR = .05. All the factor loadings
were significant at the .05 level. Correlations between the four factors ranged from .24 to .76.
Cronbach’s alpha was .76 for “maximizing both parties’ profit,” .72 for “promoting information
exchange,” .85 for “enhancing the other’s face,” .72 for “promoting a positive relationship,” .74
for “getting a better deal than the other,” .67 for “withholding information,” .75 for “attacking
the other’s face,” and .69 for “gaining power over the other”. Table 1 displays the correlation

Manipulation Check
The inducement of anger and compassion by manipulating participants’ judgment of
responsibility proved to be successful. Participants in the High Responsibility (HR) condition
perceived the counterpart’s behavior as more negative (M = 4.86, SD = .83) than those in the
Low Responsibility (LR) condition, (M = 4.65, SD = .84), t(270) = 1.98, p < .05, d = .17;
consistently, they also held the other party more responsible for such behavior (M = 4.38, SD =
.99) than those in the LR condition (M = 3.81, SD = .88), t(274) = 5.06, p < .001, d = .61. Thus,
the manipulation produced a significant effect on participants’ overall judgment of responsibility,
t(270) = 4.54, p < .001, d = .37, with participants in the HR condition attributing greater
responsibility to the counterpart for perceived negative behavior (M = 21.58, SD = 7.05) than
those in the LR condition (M = 17.96, SD = 6.96). Further analysis indicates that the effect was
stronger for participants in the manager’s role, t(126) = 5.49, p < .001, d = .97, than for those in
the employee’s role, t(142) = 2.08, p < .05, d = .35. The composite measure of overall judgment
of responsibility for perceived negative behavior was positively associated with anger, r = .29, p
< .001, and negatively associated with compassion, r = -.27, p < .001. The measures of anger and
compassion (based on emotion terms) were thus used for subsequent analyses.
The Effects of Anger and Compassion on Interaction Goals: Zero-order Correlations
Hypothesis 1 predicted that anger would be positively associated with competitively
oriented goals and Hypothesis 2 predicted that compassion would be positively associated with
cooperatively oriented goals. As Table 1 shows, bivariate correlational analyses detected

<-----Page 19----->Trust and Distrust 20
significant positive associations between anger and (a) “to get a better deal than the counterpart”
(p < .05), (b) “to attack the other’s face (p < .01), and (c) “to gain power over the counterpart” (p
< .05). There was also a significant association between compassion and “to enhance the other’s
face” (p < .01). There appeared to be no significant association between anger and “to withhold
information,” nor were there significant associations between compassion and (a) “to maximize
both parties’ profit,” (b) “to promote information exchange,” and (c) “to promote a positive
relationship.” Thus, H1 and H2 were partially supported based on zero-order correlations.
The Effects of Trust and Distrust as Two Distinct Mediators
Hypothesis 3 predicted that the influence of anger (X) on the four competitively oriented
goals (Y) would be mediated by distrust (M1), but not trust (M2). According to Baron and Kenny
(1986), a variable functions as a mediator if (a) X significantly predicts M (anger  distrust), (b)
M significantly predicts Y after controlling for X (distrust  competitive goals), and (c) when M
is controlled, the effect of X on Y (anger  competitive goals) decreases (partial mediation), with
the strongest demonstration of mediation occurring when the effect becomes non-significant (full
mediation). As Table 1 shows, anger was positively associated with distrust (p < .01) and
negatively associated with trust (p < .01).3 To assess the mediation of distrust, hierarchical
regression procedures were performed on each of the four competitive goals, in which anger was
entered on the first step, followed by distrust on the second step. Results from the analyses are
summarized in Table 2. After controlling for anger, distrust had a significant effect on all four
competitive goals. Based on Baron and Kenny’s criteria, distrust fully mediated the influence of
anger on two of the competitive goals, “to get a better deal” and “to gain power over the other
party,” in that the associations between anger and these goals became non-significant after
distrust was controlled. In addition, distrust partially mediated the influence of anger on the goal

<-----Page 20----->Trust and Distrust 21
“to attack the other’s face” in that the beta for anger dropped substantially after distrust was
controlled, even if it remained significant. Finally, based on these criteria, distrust did not
mediate the influence of anger on the goal “to withhold information” because the effect of anger
was non-significant both before and after distrust was controlled.
----------- Insert Table 2 about Here --------------Sobel tests were subsequently performed to assess whether the indirect effects of anger
on the four competitive goals through distrust were statistically significant (Sobel, 1982). As
Table 2 shows, all four indirect paths proved to be significant. It should be noted that although
the terms mediated effects and indirect effects are sometimes used interchangeably, a conclusion
that a mediation effect is present implies that the X  Y zero-order correlation (also referred to
as the total effect) was initially present, whereas it is possible to find an indirect effect (e.g.,
anger  distrust  “to withhold information”) even when there is no evidence for a significant
total effect (e.g., anger  “to withhold information,” n.s.). Recent scholarship contends that
mediation exists whenever significant indirect effects (i.e., the influence of X on Y through one or
more intervening variables) are found (Preachers & Hayes, 2008).
To assess the mediation of trust on the link between anger and competitive goals, the
same hierarchical regression procedures were repeated, only with distrust being replaced by trust
on the second step. Results are summarized in Table 2. After controlling for anger, trust did not
have a significant effect on any of the four competitive goals. Based on Baron and Kenny’s
(1986) criteria, trust had no mediating effect on the relationship between anger and competitive
goals. Results from Sobel tests confirmed this conclusion: None of the indirect paths from anger
to competitive goals through trust was significant (see Table 2). H3 was supported.
Hypothesis 4 predicted that the influence of compassion (X) on the four cooperatively

<-----Page 21----->Trust and Distrust 22
oriented goals (Y) will be mediated by trust (M1), but not distrust (M2). As Table 1 shows,
compassion was positively associated with trust (p < .01) but not associated with distrust (n.s.).
To assess the mediation of trust, hierarchical regression procedures were performed, with
compassion entered on the first step, followed by trust on the second step. Results are
summarized in Table 3. After controlling for compassion, trust had a significant effect on all four
cooperative goals. Based on Baron and Kenny’s criteria, trust partially mediated the influence of
compassion on the goal “to enhance the other’s face” because the beta for compassion dropped
substantially after trust was controlled, even if it remained significant. However, trust did not
mediate the influence of compassion on the other goals because the effect of compassion was
non-significant at the .05 level both before and after trust was controlled. Nevertheless,
subsequent Sobel tests showed that the indirect effects of compassion on the four cooperative
goals through trust were all statistically significant (see Table 3).
-------------- Insert Table 3 about Here -------------------Because compassion was not associated with distrust (see Table 1), distrust did not
qualify as a mediator for explaining the influence of compassion on cooperative goals.
Nevertheless, the same hierarchical regression analyses and Sobel tests were performed, with
trust being replaced by distrust. As Table 3 shows, these findings provide further support to this
conclusion: None of the indirect paths from compassion to cooperative goals through distrust
was statistically significant. H4 was supported.
Comparing the Indirect Effects of Trust and Distrust in Multiple Mediator Models
Although previous analyses indicate that trust and distrust mediate the influence of anger
and compassion on negotiators’ interaction goals in distinct ways, it is of theoretical interest to
further assess whether the indirect effects of the two constructs are significantly different from

<-----Page 22----->Trust and Distrust 23
each other. By far, the procedures suggested by Baron and Kenny (1986) are the most commonly
used method in social sciences to guide mediation analysis. However, recent scholarship has
identified several shortcomings in this method that make it insufficient to assess mediation when
(a) the sample size is small and the assumption of normality is violated, (b) the analysis involves
multi-level models, and (c) the effects of multiple mediators need to be assessed and compared
(Bauer, Preachers, & Gil, 2006; MacKinnon, Lockwood, & Williams, 2004; Preachers & Hayes,
2008). Preachers and Hayes (2008) recently proposed bootstrapping procedures for assessing and
comparing indirect effects in multiple mediator models. Bootstrapping also has the advantage of
making no assumptions about the shape of the sampling distribution of the indirect effect or its
underlying paths; rather, it is accomplished by empirically estimating these distributions through
resampling procedures and deriving a confidence interval with them.
To assess whether the indirect effects of trust and distrust are significantly different from
each other, we followed Preacher and Hayes’ procedures and summarized the results of the
bootstrapping tests (5,000 resamples, N = 277) in Tables 4 and 5. Like in the Sobel tests, the
specific indirect effect of X on Y via mediator M1 or M2 is defined as the product of the two
unstandardized paths (e.g., X  M1 and M1  Y controlling for X). The total indirect effect of X
on Y is the sum of the specific indirect effects of M1 and M2). The significance of the total
indirect effect indicates whether the multiple mediator models have an overall good fit.
As Tables 4 shows, the indirect effects of anger on the four competitive goals were all
significantly mediated by distrust, but not trust; the difference of the two paths was statistically
significant for two of the competitive goals (p < .05), “to get a better deal” and “to gain power
over the other party,” and approached significance for the other two (p < .10), “to withhold
information” and “to attack the other’s face.” The addition of trust as a mediator for explaining

<-----Page 23----->Trust and Distrust 24
anger’s influence on competitive goals proved to be unnecessary.
------------------ Insert Table 4 about Here --------------------------Similarly, as Table 5 shows, the indirect effects of compassion on the four cooperative
goals were all significantly mediated by trust, but not distrust; the difference of the two paths
was statistically significant for three of them (p < .05), “to maximize both parties’ profit,” “to
promote information exchange,” and “to promote a positive relationship,” and approached
significance for the other goal, “to enhance the other’s face.” The addition of distrust as a
mediator for explaining compassion’s influence on cooperative goals proved to be unnecessary.
----------------------- Insert Table 5 about Here -------------------------------Discussion
Whereas empirical work on emotion in negotiation has primarily focused on the direct
effects of emotions on negotiation performance, the current study delves into the psychological
mechanisms that lead to such effects. Specifically, we examined the paths through which anger
and compassion, two discrete emotions that differ in valence (negative vs. positive) and appraisal
(other-person vs. situational control), influence negotiators’ interaction goals through trust and
distrust, two related, but functionally distinct constructs. We found that whereas the effects of
anger (a negative emotion with appraisal of other-person control) on competitive goals were
mediated by distrust, but not trust, the effects of compassion (a positive emotion with appraisal
of situational control) on cooperative goals were mediated by trust, but not distrust. These
findings not only shed light on the cognitive processes through which anger and compassion
influence negotiation behavior, but also support the proposition that trust and distrust represent
two distinct psychological processes that are associated with different antecedents and
consequences. This section reviews major findings of the study and discusses its theoretical and

<-----Page 24----->Trust and Distrust 25
practical implications, as well as limitations and directions for future research.
The Effects of Anger and Compassion on Negotiators’ Interaction Goals
Recent research shows that the relative importance that negotiators place on interaction
goals is associated with the specific bargaining tactics they use, as well as their own and their
counterpart’s negotiation outcomes (Liu & Wilson, in press). Based on this premise, this study
examined how angry and compassionate feelings toward the counterpart influenced the ways in
which negotiators (re)formulate their interaction goals. Given the contextual features of a job
contract negotiation, we measured eight interaction goals that varied in type (instrumental,
identity, and relational) and motivational orientation (competitive vs. cooperative) after
participants were primed with an imagined emotion-inducing interaction. Consistent with prior
research suggesting that anger provokes an intention to attack, whereas compassion is associated
with an ability to take another’s perspective and a willingness to help, this study found that anger
drives negotiators to place more importance on competitive goals, such as wanting “to get a
better deal than the counterpart,” “to attack the other party’s face,” and “to gain power over the
other party,” whereas compassion causes people to place more importance on cooperative goals,
such as wanting “to enhance the other’s face.” In addition to these zero-order effects, our
mediational analyses further revealed that anger has an indirect effect on all four competitive
goals (also including “to withhold information”) through distrust, whereas compassion has an
indirect effect on all four cooperative goals (also including “to maximize both parties’ profit,”
“to promote information exchange,” and “to promote a positive relationship”) through trust.
On a theoretical level, this study identifies viable mechanisms for explaining the dynamic
psychological processes through which anger and compassion influence negotiation
performance. For example, Allred et al.’s (1997) study found that negotiators who felt more

<-----Page 25----->Trust and Distrust 26
anger and less compassion toward the counterpart achieved fewer joint gains and had less desire
to work with each other in the future. Findings from this study suggest that these effects take
place because such an emotional state causes negotiators to redefine the bargaining situation
toward a more distributive (competitive) and less integrative (cooperative) direction.
Specifically, given that angry feelings arise from the perception that the other party has
intentionally engaged in negative behavior, they tend to activate an individual’s negative
expectation of the other party’s future behavior, or distrust; such a negative assessment of the
other’s intentions and motives will in turn provoke an intention to protect oneself from being
taken advantage of, such as placing greater importance on wanting “to withhold information,” as
well as a “win-lose” frame to view the negotiation, hence the desire “to get a better deal,” “to
gain more power than the other party,” and even “to attack the other’s face.”
Likewise, because compassionate feelings arise from the perception that the other party
had to engage in negative behavior due to external, uncontrollable factors, they tend to activate
an individual’s positive memory concerning the other party’s intentions and motives, and
therefore positive expectation of the person’s future behavior, or trust; such a positive judgment
will in turn invoke prosocial tendencies, such as placing greater importance on wanting “to
enhance the other’s face” and “to promote a positive relationship with the counterpart,” as well
as a “win-win” frame to view the negotiation, hence the willingness “to maximize both parties’
profit” and “to promote information exchange.”
These findings provide additional support to existing models that explain the relationship
between emotions and beliefs (e.g., the affect-as-information model, Schwarz & Clore, 1988),
with evidence from integral emotions. Consistent with Tiedens and Linton’s (2001) study
suggesting that emotions associated with certainty appraisals promotes heuristic processing, in

<-----Page 26----->Trust and Distrust 27
this study, anger and compassion (both involving certainty appraisals) produced valencecongruent effects on trust and distrust judgments as well as interaction goals. Nevertheless, as
Forgas’s (1995) Affect Infusion Model suggests, when individuals adopt motivated processing
(i.e., deliberate information search guided by a specific objective), the likelihood of affect
infusion can be reduced. Research shows that motivated processing is more likely when people
become aware of the causes and consequences of their emotions (Berkowitz, Jaffee, Jo, &
Troccoli, 2000). Understanding the paths through which cognitive appraisals give rise to
emotions and in turn influence negotiators’ judgments and goals, therefore, will allow
negotiators to consciously seek information and formulate goals in order to combat the negative
impact of emotions on their own and their counterpart’s behaviors and outcomes.
On a practical level, the study provides insight into the management of not only one’s
own, but also the counterpart’s emotions. Given the indirect effects of anger and compassion on
interaction goals through trust and distrust, it is desirable for negotiators to gain trust from their
counterparts by eliciting their feelings of compassion. Findings from this study suggest that this
can be achieved by managing the counterpart’s attribution of responsibility, which involves
reducing the apparent competitiveness of one’s own behavior (e.g., verbal aggressiveness) and
proactively providing information (personally or through a third party) to the counterpart
concerning external, uncontrollable causes for behavior that may be negatively perceived. In
doing so, a negotiator can also reduce the counterpart’s angry feelings and perception of distrust,
leading the bargaining process toward a more cooperative (integrative) and less competitive
(distributive) direction. Thus far, many prescriptive maxims regarding the role of emotion in
negotiation focus on dealing with one’s own emotions; this study recognizes the interdependent
nature of the bargaining process and suggests that it is also important to modify the other party’s

<-----Page 27----->Trust and Distrust 28
emotions, beliefs, and motivations through effective information exchange.
The Distinct Roles of Trust and Distrust in Negotiation
The study also provides empirical support to scholarship that views trust and distrust as
two related, but qualitative different constructs (e.g., Kramer, 1999; Lewicki et al., 1998). The
mediation effects that trust and distrust had on the relationship between the two discrete
emotions (anger and compassion) and negotiators’ various interaction goals were statistically
different in most cases. Specifically, although angry feelings reduced trust and increased distrust,
compassionate feelings increased trust but did not necessarily reduce distrust. In addition, trust
increased the importance that negotiators placed on all cooperative goals, whereas it had no
effect on negotiators’ pursuit of competitive goals. On the other hand, distrust increased
negotiators’ perceived importance of all competitive goals but were negatively associated with
only a couple of cooperative goals with a weaker strength of association. It is evident that trust
and distrust are associated with distinct antecedents and consequences. On a theoretical level, the
study suggests that distrust as a distinct construct demands as much attention as trust because it
yields unique insights into the processes by which anger and compassion influence negotiation.
Furthermore, the study suggests that trust and distrust play an important role in
accounting for the effects that anger and compassion have on negotiators’ goals.4 Without
introducing trust and distrust as viable mechanisms, our understanding of how these two
emotions influence motivation is limited. For example, based on zero-order correlations,
compassion appeared to influence only one cooperative goal (“to enhance the other’s face”),
whereas meditational analyses revealed that compassion had an indirect effect on all the other
cooperative goals (“to maximize both parties’ profit,” “to promote information exchange,” and
“to promote a positive relationship”) through trust. Similarly, anger appeared to have no

<-----Page 28----->Trust and Distrust 29
influence on perceived importance of “withholding information” according to the zero-order
correlation, but a mediation analysis revealed its indirect effect on this goal through distrust.
To date, most research on emotion in negotiation focuses on direct links between
emotions and negotiation performance. Prescriptive maxims based on the direct links are
sometimes inconsistent (for a review, see Thompson, Medvec, Seiden, & Kopelman, 2001). For
example, negotiators have been advised to avoid or suppress anger during negotiation because it
leads to smaller joint gains and has no effect on the portion of value individuals claim for
themselves (Allred et al., 1997). Competing maxims, however, advise them to “rant and rave”
because anger allows individuals to get a better deal (Van Kleef et al., 2004; Sinaceur & Tiedens,
2006). The current study suggests that by identifying the underlying mechanisms we may be able
to generate new insights into the functions of emotions (that are lost in indirect links) and
possibly reconcile some of the existing inconsistencies. For example, the indirect effect of anger
on wanting “to withhold information” through distrust may explain why anger leads to smaller
joint gains in integrative bargaining situations, whereas its positive effects on wanting “to get a
better deal” and “to gain power over the other” may explain why it allowed individuals to claim
more value in distributive bargaining situations.
On a practical level, we can conclude that trust is particularly important in bargaining
situations that contain integrative potential and where negotiators have a long-term relationship
beyond negotiation. This is because trust tends to motivate prosocial tendencies, such as wanting
to enhance face concerns and to establish a positive relationship, as well as integrative motives,
such as information exchange directed at maximizing joint gains. On the other hand, distrust can
be important in distributive bargaining situations where value-claiming is critical, because
distrust drives individuals to be more vigilant against potential exploitation by the opponent.

<-----Page 29----->Trust and Distrust 30
Perhaps more importantly, trust and distrust as two distinct constructs can co-exist; because most
negotiations are mixed-motive in nature, it is important for negotiators to be aware of their
respective antecedents and consequences and to balance the bargaining processes through
conscious management of both their own, and their counterpart’s trust and distrust.
Limitations
Like any research, this study has several limitations that may constrain the
generalizability of its findings. First, participants in this study were university students at the
undergraduate level with a limited amount of work experience. Although the hypothetical
scenario described a job-offer negotiation situation which college students commonly encounter
as a prospective employee, a sample that consists of working professionals is more desirable to
enact the role of the recruiting manager. Second, although we successfully induced anger and
compassion through manipulation of judgment of responsibility, we accomplished this goal by
providing participants with standard responses given by a hypothetical counterpart in the survey
rather than an actual person through face-to-face negotiation interaction. It may be important for
future research to triangulate the current findings with interaction-based negotiation simulations .
Third, we measured participants’ interaction goals through self reports for an imagined
subsequent negotiation. Although these one-time reports provide insights into participants’
motivational tendencies in response to an emotion-inducing event, future research should
measure interaction goals using alternative methods, such as stimulated recalls after face-to-face
interactions, to capture the dynamic nature of interaction goals (see Keck & Samp, 2007).
Finally, findings from this study were derived from a Western sample that was predominantly
white and of middle-class backgrounds. Future research should replicate the study in other
cultures or ethnicities to see whether these models can be generalizable to other cultures.

Footnotes
1

Scholars have not reached consensus on how compassion should be distinguished from

pity. Some consider compassion as requiring a certain degree of equality and pity as regarding its
object as inferior (Ben Ze’ev, 2000), whereas some believe that the distinction may be
historically and culturally specific (Goetz, 2008; Nussbaum, 1996).
2

Research has identified many social motives – competitive (win-lose), cooperative (win-

win), individualistic (pro-self), altruistic (pro-other), and so on (Carnevale & De Dreu, 2006).
Given that the purpose of the study is to shed light on how anger and compassion result in more
distributive or more integrative bargaining processes, we focus on interaction goals that are
competitively and cooperatively oriented.
3

Mediation analyses show that judgment of responsibility had a mediated (indirect) effect

on distrust through anger, r = .03, z = 2.17, p. < .05, and a mediated (indirect) effect on trust
through compassion, r = -.01, z = -2.92, p. < .01.
4

The current study identifies trust and distrust as viable mechanisms for explaining the

influence of anger and compassion on negotiators’ interaction goals because of the theoretical
connections between these constructs; however, it is not our intention to make a general claim
that trust and distrust can also mediate the influence of other emotions on the negotiation
process.
