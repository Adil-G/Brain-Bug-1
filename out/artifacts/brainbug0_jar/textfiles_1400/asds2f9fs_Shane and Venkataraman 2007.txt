Abstract
To date, the phenomenon of entrepreneurship has lacked a conceptual framework. In this
note we draw upon previous research conducted in the different social science disciplines
and applied fields of business to create a conceptual framework for the field. With this
framework we explain a set of empirical phenomena and predict a set of outcomes not
explained or predicted by conceptual frameworks already in existence in other fields.

For a field of social science to have usefulness, it must have a conceptual framework that explains and predicts a set of empirical phenomena not explained or
predicted by conceptual frameworks already in existence in other fields. To date,
the phenomenon of entrepreneurship has lacked such a conceptual framework.
Rather than explaining and predicting a unique set of empirical phenomena, entrepreneurship has become a broad label under which a hodgepodge of research is
housed. What appears to constitute entrepreneurship research today is some aspect
of the setting (e.g. small businesses or new firms), rather than a unique conceptual
domain. As a result, many people have had trouble identifying the distinctive contribution of the field to the broader domain of business studies, undermining the
field’s legitimacy. Researchers in other fields ask why entrepreneurship research
is necessary if it does not explain or predict empirical phenomena beyond what is
known from work in other fields. Moreover, the lack of a conceptual framework
has precluded the development of an understanding of many important phenomena
not adequately explained by other fields.
One example of this problem is the focus in the entrepreneurship literature on
the relative performance of individuals or firms in the context of small or new
businesses. Since strategic management scholars examine the differences in and
sustainability of relative performance between competitive firms, this approach is
not unique (Venkataraman, 1997). Moreover, the approach does not provide an
adequate test of entrepreneurship, since entrepreneurship is concerned with the
discovery and exploitation of profitable opportunities. A performance advantage
over other firms is not a sufficient measure of entrepreneurial performance,
because a performance advantage may be insufficient to compensate for the opportunity cost of other alternatives, a liquidity premium for time and capital, and a

premium for uncertainty bearing. Therefore, although a conceptual framework to
explain and predict relative performance between firms is useful to strategic management, it is not sufficient for entrepreneurship.
We attempt an integrating framework for the entrepreneurship field in the form
of this note. We believe that this framework will help entrepreneurship researchers
recognize the relationship among the multitude of necessary, but not sufficient,
factors that compose entrepreneurship, and thereby advance the quality of empirical and theoretical work in the field. By providing a framework that both sheds
light on unexplained phenomena and enhances the quality of research, we seek to
enhance the field’s legitimacy and prevent its marginalization as only “a research
setting” or “teaching application.”
The note proceeds as follows. First, we define the domain of the field. Second,
we explain why organizational researchers should study entrepreneurship. Third,
we describe why entrepreneurial opportunities exist and why some people, and not
others, discover and exploit those opportunities. Fourth, we consider the different
modes of exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities. Finally, we conclude with
brief reflections on the potential value of the framework presented here.

Definition of Entrepreneurship
Perhaps the largest obstacle in creating a conceptual framework for the entrepreneurship field has been its definition. To date, most researchers have defined the
field solely in terms of who the entrepreneur is and what he or she does (Venkataraman, 1997). The problem with this approach is that entrepreneurship involves
the nexus of two phenomena: the presence of lucrative opportunities and the presence of enterprising individuals (Venkataraman, 1997). By defining the field in
terms of the individual alone, entrepreneurship researchers have generated incomplete definitions that do not withstand the scrutiny of other scholars (Gartner,
1988).
The definition of an entrepreneur as a person who establishes a new organization
is an example of this problem. Because this definition does not include consideration
of the variation in the quality of opportunities that different people identify, it
leads researchers to neglect to measure opportunities. Consequently, empirical
support (or lack of support) for attributes that differentiate entrepreneurs from
other members of society is often questionable, because these attributes confound
the influence of opportunities and individuals.
In contrast to previous research, we define the field of entrepreneurship as the
scholarly examination of how, by whom, and with what effects opportunities to
create future goods and services are discovered, evaluated, and exploited
(Venkataraman, 1997). Consequently, the field involves the study of sources of
opportunities, the processes of discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities, and the set of individuals who discover, evaluate, and exploit them.

<-----Page 2----->The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research 173

Although the phenomenon of entrepreneurship provides research questions for
many different scholarly fields,1 organization scholars are fundamentally concerned with three sets of research questions about entrepreneurship: (1) why,
when, and how opportunities for the creation of goods and services come into existence; (2) why, when, and how some people and not others discover and exploit
these opportunities; and (3) why, when, and how different modes of action are
used to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities.
Before reviewing existing research to answer these questions, we provide several caveats about our approach. First, we take a disequilibrium approach, which
differs from equilibrium approaches in economics (Khilstrom & Laffont, 1979)
and social psychology (McClelland, 1961). In equilibrium models, entrepreneurial
opportunities either do not exist or are assumed to be randomly distributed across
the population. Because people in equilibrium models cannot discover opportunities that differ in value from those discovered by others, who becomes an entrepreneur in these models depends solely on the attributes of people. For example,
in Khilstrom and Laffont’s (1979) equilibrium model, entrepreneurs are people
who prefer uncertainty.
Although we believe that some dimensions of equilibrium models are useful for
understanding entrepreneurship, we argue that these models are necessarily
incomplete. Entrepreneurial behavior is transitory (Carroll & Mosakowski, 1987).
Moreover, estimates of the number of people who engage in entrepreneurial behavior range from 20 percent of the population (Reynolds & White, 1997) to over
50 percent (Aldrich & Zimmer, 1986). Since a large and diverse group of people
engage in the transitory process of entrepreneurship, it is improbable that entrepreneurship can be explained solely by reference to a characteristic of certain
people independent of the situations in which they find themselves. Therefore,
when we argue that some people and not others engage in entrepreneurial behavior, we are describing the tendency of certain people to respond to the situational
cues of opportunities-not a stable characteristic that differentiates some people
from others across all situations.2
Second, we argue that entrepreneurship does not require, but can include, the
creation of new organizations. As Amit, Glosten, and Mueller (1993) and Casson
(1982) explain, entrepreneurship can also occur within an existing organization.
Moreover, opportunities can be sold to other individuals or to existing organizations. In this note we do not examine the creation of new organizations per se but,
rather, refer interested readers to excellent reviews on firm creation in organizational ecology (Aldrich, 1990; Singh & Lumsden, 1990), economics (Caves, 1998:
Geroski, 1995), and organizational theory (Gartner, 1985; Katz & Gartner, 1988;
Low & MacMillan, 1988).3
1

For example, economists are interested in the distribution of entrepreneurial talent across productive
and unproductive activities (Baumol, 1996).

2 We also argue that entrepreneurship can be undertaken by a single individual or a set of people who
undertake the steps of the process collectively or independently.
3 Many researchers argue that entrepreneurship occurs for reasons other than for profit (see Roberts,
1991, for a review), but we discuss only for-profit entrepreneurship.

<-----Page 3----->174 Scott Shane and Sankaran Venkataraman

Third, our framework complements sociological and economic work in which
researchers have examined the population-level factors that influence firm creation. Stinchcombe (1965) identified societal factors that enhance incentives to
organize and organizing ability. Aldrich (1990) and Singh and Lumsden (1990)
have provided reviews of factors enhancing firm foundings and have described
the effects of such factors as environmental carrying capacity, interpopulation
processes, and institutional factors. Similarly, Baumol (1996) has related the institutional environment to the supply of people who are willing to create firms.
Although these other frameworks are valuable to entrepreneurship scholars,
they involve a set of issues different from those with which we are concerned. Our
framework differs from these in that (1) we focus on the existence, discovery, and
exploitation of opportunities; (2) we examine the influence of individuals and
opportunities, rather than environmental antecedents and consequences; and (3)
we consider a framework broader than firm creation.
Fourth, our framework also complements research on the process of firm creation (e.g. Gartner, 1985; Katz & Gartner, 1988; Katz, 1993). Explaining this process is important, but research on it involves examining a different set of issues
from those we explore. Firm creation process researchers examine resource mobilization, firm organizing, and market making, starting with the assumption that
opportunities exist, have been discovered, and will be exploited through the creation of new firms. Since we lack the space to review both the processes of entrepreneurship through market mechanisms and through firm creation, we limit our
discussion to the conditions under which entrepreneurial opportunities are exploited through firms and markets, and we refer readers to these other frameworks
for information on the process of firm creation.

Why Study Entrepreneurship?
Many scholars ask, either implicitly or explicitly, why anyone should study entrepreneurship. Data are difficult to obtain, theory is underdeveloped, and many findings to date are the same as those obtained in other areas of business. In response,
we offer three reasons for studying the topic. First, much technical information
is ultimately embodied in products and services (Arrow, 1962), and entrepreneurship is a mechanism by which society converts technical information into
these products and services. Second, entrepreneurship is a mechanism through
which temporal and spatial inefficiencies in an economy are discovered and
mitigated (Kirzner, 1997). Finally, of the different sources of change in a capitalist society, Schumpeter (1934) isolated entrepreneurially driven innovation in
products and processes as the crucial engine driving the change process. Therefore, the absence of entrepreneurship from our collective theories of markets,
firms, organizations, and change makes our understanding of the business landscape incomplete. As Baumol eloquently remarks, the study of business without
an understanding of entrepreneurship is like the study of Shakespeare in which
“the Prince of Denmark has been expunged from the discussion of Hamlet”
(1989: 66).

The Existence, Discovery, and Exploitation
of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
The Existence of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
To have entrepreneurship, you must first have entrepreneurial opportunities. Entrepreneurial opportunities are those situations in which new goods, services, raw
materials, and organizing methods can be introduced and sold at greater than their
cost of production (Casson, 1982). Although recognition of entrepreneurial opportunities is a subjective process, the opportunities themselves are objective phenomena that are not known to all parties at all times. For example, the discovery
of the telephone created new opportunities for communication, whether or not
people discovered those opportunities.
Entrepreneurial opportunities differ from the larger set of all opportunities for
profit, particularly opportunities to enhance the efficiency of existing goods, services, raw materials, and organizing methods, because the former require the discovery of now means-ends relationships, whereas the latter involve optimization
within existing means-ends frameworks (Kirzner, 1997). Because the range of options and the consequences of exploiting new things are unknown, entrepreneurial
decisions cannot be made through an optimization process in which mechanical
calculations are made in response to a given set of alternatives (Baumol, 1993).
Entrepreneurial opportunities come in a variety of forms. Although the focus in
most prior research has been on opportunities in product markets (Venkataraman,
1997), opportunities also exist in factor markets, as in the case of the discovery of
new materials (Schumpeter, 1934). Moreover, within product market entrepreneurship, Drucker (1985) has described three different categories of opportunities:
(1) the creation of new information, as occurs with the invention of new technologies; (2) the exploitation of market inefficiencies that result from information
asymmetry, as occurs across time and geography; and (3) the reaction to shifts in
the relative costs and benefits of alternative uses for resources, as occurs with
political, regulatory, or demographic changes.
Previous researchers have argued that entrepreneurial opportunities exist primarily because different members of society have different beliefs about the relative value of resources, given the potential to transform them into a different state
(Kirzner, 1997). Because people possess different beliefs (because of a lucky
hunch, superior intuition, or private information), they make different conjectures
about the price at which markets should clear or about what possible new markets
could be created in the future. When buyers and sellers have different beliefs
about the value of resources, both today and in the future, goods and services can
sell above or below their marginal cost of production (Schumpeter, 1934). An
entrepreneurial discovery occurs when someone makes the conjecture that a set of

<-----Page 5----->176 Scott Shane and Sankaran Venkataraman

resources is not put to its “best use” (i.e. the resources are priced “too low,” given
a belief about the price at which the output from their combination could be sold
in another location, at another time, or in another form). If the conjecture is acted
upon and is correct, the individual will earn an entrepreneurial profit. If the conjecture is acted upon and is incorrect, the individual will incur an entrepreneurial
loss (Casson, 1982).
Entrepreneurship requires that people hold different beliefs about the value of
resources for two reasons. First, entrepreneurship involves joint production, where
several different resources have to be brought together to create the new product
or service. For the entrepreneur to obtain control over these resources in a way
that makes the opportunity profitable, his or her conjecture about the accuracy of
resource prices must differ from those of resource owners and other potential
entrepreneurs (Casson, 1982). If resource owners had the same conjectures as the
entrepreneur, they would seek to appropriate the profit from the opportunity by
pricing the resources so that the entrepreneur’s profit approached zero. Therefore,
for entrepreneurship to occur, the resource owners must not share completely the
entrepreneur’s conjectures. Second, if all people (potential entrepreneurs) possessed the same entrepreneurial conjectures, they would compete to capture the
same entrepreneurial profit, dividing it to the point that the incentive to pursue the
opportunity was eliminated (Schumpeter, 1934).
But why should people possess different beliefs about the prices at which markets should clear? Two answers have been offered. First, as Kirzner (1973) has
observed, the process of discovery in a market setting requires the participants
to guess each other’s expectations about a wide variety of things. People make
decisions on the basis of hunches, intuition, heuristics, and accurate and inaccurate
information, causing their decisions to be incorrect some of the time. Since
decisions are not always correct, this process leads to “errors” that create shortages,
surpluses, and misallocated resources. An individual alert to the presence of an
“error” may buy resources where prices are “too low,” recombine them, and sell
the outputs where prices are “too high.”
Second, as Schumpeter (1934) explained, economies operate in a constant state
of disequilibrium. Technological, political, social, regulatory, and other types of
change offer a continuous supply of new information about different ways to use
resources to enhance wealth. By making it possible to transform resources into a
more valuable form, the new information alters the value of resources and, therefore, the resources’ proper equilibrium price. Because information is imperfectly
distributed, all economic actors do not receive new information at the same time.
Consequently, some people obtain information before others about resources lying
fallow, new discoveries being made, or new markets opening up. If economic
actors obtain new information before others, they can purchase resources at below
their equilibrium value and earn an entrepreneurial profit by recombining the resources and then selling them (Schumpeter, 1934).
The informational sources of opportunity may be easier to see in the case of
new technology, but they need not be restricted to technological developments.
For example, the production of the movie Titanic generated new information
about who was a desirable teen idol. An entrepreneur could respond to this new

<-----Page 6----->The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research 177

information by acting on the conjecture that posters of Leonardo DeCaprio would
sell for greater than their cost of production.
Because entrepreneurial opportunities depend on asymmetries of information
and beliefs, eventually, entrepreneurial opportunities become cost inefficient to
pursue. First, the opportunity to earn entrepreneurial profit will provide an incentive to many economic actors. As opportunities are exploited, information diffuses
to other members of society who can imitate the innovator and appropriate some
of the innovator’s entrepreneurial profit. Although the entry of imitating entrepreneurs initially may validate the opportunity and increase overall demand, competition eventually begins to dominate (Hannan & Freeman, 1984). When the entry of
additional entrepreneurs reaches a rate at which the benefits from new entrants
exceeds the costs, the incentive for people to pursue the opportunity is reduced,
because the entrepreneurial profit becomes divided among more and more actors
(Schumpeter, 1934).
Second, the exploitation of opportunity provides information to resource providers about the value of the resources that they possess and leads them to raise
resource prices over time, in order to capture some of the entrepreneur’s profit for
themselves (Kirzner, 1997). In short, the diffusion of information and learning
about the accuracy of decisions over time, combined with the lure of profit, will
reduce the incentive for people to pursue any given opportunity.
The duration of any given opportunity depends on a variety of factors. The provision of monopoly rights, as occurs with patent protection or an exclusive contract, increases the duration. Similarly, the slowness of information diffusion or
the lags in the timeliness with which others recognize information also increase
the duration, particularly if time provides reinforcing advantages, such as occur
with the adoption of technical standards or learning curves. Finally, the “inability
of others (due to various isolating mechanisms) to imitate, substitute, trade for or
acquire the rare resources required to drive down the surplus” (Venkataraman,
1997: 133) increases the duration.

The Discovery of Entrepreneurial Opportunities
Although an opportunity for entrepreneurial profit might exist, an individual can
earn this profit only if he or she recognizes that the opportunity exists and has
value. Given that an asymmetry of beliefs is a precondition for the existence of entrepreneurial opportunities, all opportunities must not be obvious to everyone all
of the time (Hayek, 1945). At any point in time, only some subset of the population will discover a given opportunity (Kirzner, 1973).
Why do some people and not others discover particular entrepreneurial opportunities? Although the null hypothesis is blind luck, research has suggested two
broad categories of factors that influence the probability that particular people will
discover particular opportunities: (1) the possession of the prior information necessary to identify an opportunity and (2) the cognitive properties necessary to
value it.

<-----Page 7----->178 Scott Shane and Sankaran Venkataraman

Information Corridors. Human beings all possess different stocks of information and these stocks of information influence their ability to recognize particular
opportunities. Stocks of information create mental schemas, which provide a
framework for recognizing new information. To recognize an opportunity, an
entrepreneur has to have prior information that is complementary with the new information, which triggers an entrepreneurial conjecture (Kaish & Gilad, 1991).
This prior information might be about user needs (Von Hippel, 1986) or specific
aspects of the production function (Bruderl, Preisendorfer, & Ziegler, 1992).
The information necessary to recognize any given opportunity is not widely
distributed across the population because of the specialization of information
in society (Hayek, 1945). People specialize in information because specialized
information is more useful than general information for most activities (Becker &
Murphy, 1992). As a result, no two people share all of the same information at the
same time. Rather, information about underutilized resources, new technology,
unsated demand, and political and regulatory shifts is distributed according to the
idiosyncratic life circumstances of each person in the population (Venkataraman,
1997).
The development of the Internet provides a useful example. Only a subset of the
population has had entrepreneurial conjectures in response to the development of
this technology. Some people still do not know what the Internet is or that profitable opportunities exist to exploit it.
Cognitive Properties. Since the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities is
not an optimization process by which people make mechanical calculations in
response to a given a set of alternatives imposed upon them (Baumol, 1993), people
must be able to identify new means-ends relationships that are generated by a
given change in order to discover entrepreneurial opportunities. Even if a person
possesses the prior information necessary to discover an opportunity, he or she
may fail to do so because of an inability to see new means-ends relationships. Unfortunately, visualizing these relationships is difficult. Rosenberg (1994) points
out that history is rife with examples in which inventors failed to see commercial
opportunities (new means-ends relationships) that resulted from the invention of
important technologies, from the telegraph to the laser.
Prior research has shown that people differ in their ability to identify such relationships. For example, research in the field of cognitive science has shown that
people vary in their abilities to combine existing concepts and information into
new ideas (see Ward, Smith, & Vaid, 1997, for several review articles). Recently,
a few researchers have begun to evaluate empirically the role that cognitive properties play in the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities (see Busenitz &
Barney, 1997; Kaish & Gilad, 1991; Shaver & Scott, 1991). For example, Sarasvathy, Simon, and Lave (1998) have shown that successful entrepreneurs see
opportunities in situations in which other people tend to see risks, whereas Baron
(in press) has found that entrepreneurs may be more likely than other persons to
discover opportunities because they are less likely to engage in counterfactual thinking (i.e. less likely to invest time and effort imaging what “might have been” in a

<-----Page 8----->The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research 179

given situation), less likely to experience regret over missed opportunities, and are
less susceptible to inaction inertia.

The Decision to Exploit Entrepreneurial Opportunities
Although the discovery of an opportunity is a necessary condition for entrepreneurship, it is not sufficient. Subsequent to the discovery of an opportunity, a
potential entrepreneur must decide to exploit the opportunity. We do not have
precise figures on the aborting of discovered opportunities, but we do know that
not all discovered opportunities are brought to fruition. Why, when, and how do
some people and not others exploit the opportunities that they discover? The answer again appears to be a function of the joint characteristics of the opportunity
and the nature of the individual (Venkataraman, 1997).
Nature of the Opportunity. The characteristics of opportunities themselves
influence the willingness of people to exploit them. Entrepreneurial opportunities
vary on several dimensions, which influences their expected value. For example, a
cure for lung cancer has greater expected value than does a solution to students’
need for snacks at a local high school. The exploitation of an entrepreneurial opportunity requires the entrepreneur to believe that the expected value of the entrepreneurial profit will be large enough to compensate for the opportunity cost of
other alternatives (including the loss of leisure), the lack of liquidity of the investment of time and money, and a premium for bearing uncertainty (Kirzner,
1973; Schumpeter, 1934).
To date, research has shown that, on average, entrepreneurs exploit opportunities having higher expected value. In particular, exploitation is more common
when expected demand is large (Schmookler, 1966; Schumpeter, 1934), industry
profit margins are high (Dunne, Roberts, & Samuelson, 1988), the technology life
cycle is young (Utterback, 1994), the density of competition in a particular opportunity space is neither too low nor too high (Hannan & Freeman, 1984), the cost of
capital is low (Shane, 1996), and population-level learning from other entrants is
available (Aldrich & Wiedenmeyer, 1993).
Individual Differences. Not all potential entrepreneurs will exploit opportunities with the same expected value. The decision to exploit an opportunity involves
weighing the value of the opportunity against the costs to generate that value and
the costs to generate value in other ways. Thus, people consider the opportunity
cost of pursuing alternative activities in making the decision whether or not to
exploit opportunities and pursue opportunities when their opportunity cost is lower
(Amit, Mueller, & Cockburn, 1995; Reynolds, 1987). In addition, people consider
their costs for obtaining the resources necessary to exploit the opportunity. For example, Evans and Leighton (1989) showed that the exploitation of opportunities is
more common when people have greater financial capital. Similarly, Aldrich and
Zimmer (1986) reviewed research findings that showed that stronger social ties to
resource providers facilitate the acquisition of resources and enhance the probability of opportunity exploitation. Furthermore, Cooper, Woo, and Dunkelberg

<-----Page 9----->180 Scott Shane and Sankaran Venkataraman

(1989) found that people are more likely to exploit opportunities if they have
developed useful information for entrepreneurship from their previous employment, presumably because such information reduces the cost of opportunity exploitation. Finally, the transferability of information from the prior experience to
the opportunity (Cooper et al. 1989), as well as prior entrepreneurial experience
(Carroll & Mosakowski, 1987), increases the probability of exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunity because learning reduces its cost.
The decision to exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity is also influenced by
individual differences in perceptions. The creation of new products and markets involves downside risk, because time, effort, and money must be invested before the
distribution of the returns is known (Knight, 1921; Venkataraman, 1997). Several
researchers have argued that individual differences in the willingness to bear this
risk influence the decision to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities (Khilstrom &
Laffont, 1979; Knight, 1921). For example, people who exploit opportunities tend
to frame information more positively and then respond to these positive perceptions (Palich & Bagby, 1995).
The decision to exploit entrepreneurial opportunities is also influenced by individual differences in optimism. People who exploit opportunities typically perceive their chances of success as much higher than they really are-and much
higher than those of others in their industry (Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988).
Moreover, when these people create new firms, they often enter industries in
which scale economies play an important role at less than minimum efficient scale
(Audretsch, 1991). and they enter industries at rates exceeding the equilibrium
number of firms (Gort & Klepper, 1982).4
However, in most industries, at most points in time, most new firms fail (Dunne
et al. 1988), and few firms ever displace incumbents (Audretsch, 1991), suggesting that people who exploit opportunities, on average, are overly optimistic about
the value of the opportunities they discover. This overoptimism motivates the
exploitation of opportunity by limiting information, stimulating rosy forecasts of the
future (Kahneman & Lovallo, 1994), triggering the search for relatively small
amounts of information (Kaish & Gilad, 1991), and leading people to act first and
analyze later (Busenitz & Barney, 1997).
Other individual differences may be important in explaining the willingness to
exploit opportunities. Researchers have argued that people with greater selfefficacy and more internal locus of control are more likely to exploit opportunities, because exploitation requires people to act in the face of skepticism of others
(Chen, Greene, & Crick, 1998). Similarly, opportunity exploitation involves ambiguity, and people who have a greater tolerance for ambiguity may be more likely
to exploit opportunities (Begley & Boyd, 1987). Finally, the exploitation of opportunity is a setting in which people can achieve, providing a valuable cue for those
who possess a high need for achievement (McClelland, 1961). Consequently,
those who are high in need for achievement may be more likely than other members of society to exploit opportunities.
4

The information signals generated by the entrepreneurial process are weak.

<-----Page 10----->The Promise of Entrepreneurship as a Field of Research 181

Readers should note that the attributes that increase the probability of opportunity exploitation do not necessarily increase the probability of success. For example, overoptimism might be associated with a higher probability of both exploitation and failure. Of the population of individuals who discover opportunities in a
given industry, those who are pessimistic may choose not to exploit discovered
opportunities because they more accurately estimate what it will take to compete
and how many other people will try to do similar things. Overoptimistic individuals do not stop themselves from exploiting these opportunities, because their overoptimism limits information and motivates rosy forecasts of the future.

Modes of Exploitation
Another critical question concerns how the exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities is organized in the economy. Two major institutional arrangements for the
exploitation of these opportunities exist – the creation of new firms (hierarchies)
and the sale of opportunities to existing firms (markets), but the common assumption is that most entrepreneurial activity occurs through de novo startups. However, people within organizations who discover opportunities sometimes pursue
those opportunities on behalf of their existing organizations and sometimes establish
new organizations, whereas independent actors sometimes sell their opportunities
to existing organizations and sometimes establish new organizations to pursue the
opportunities.
Research shows that the choice of mode depends on the nature of the industrial
organization, the opportunity, and the appropriability regime. Research in industrial organization has shown that entrepreneurship is less likely to take the form of
de novo startups when capital market imperfections make it difficult for independent entrepreneurs to secure financing (Cohen & Levin, 1989). Entrepreneurship is
more likely when the pursuit of entrepreneurial opportunity requires the effort of
individuals who lack incentives to do so in large organizations; when scale
economies, first mover advantages, and learning curves do not provide advantages
to existing firms (Cohen & Levin, 1989); and when industries have low barriers to
entry (Acs & Audretsch, 1987). Research on the appropriability of information has
shown that entrepreneurship is more likely to take the form of de novo startups
when information cannot be protected well by intellectual property laws, inhibiting the sale of entrepreneurial opportunities (Cohen & Levin, 1989). Finally, research on the nature of opportunities has shown that entrepreneurship is more
likely to take the form of de novo startups when opportunities are more uncertain
(Casson, 1982), when opportunities do not require complementary assets (Teece,
1986), and when opportunities destroy competence (Tushman & Anderson, 1986).

Conclusion
Entrepreneurship is an important and relevant field of study. Although those in the
field face many difficult questions, we have presented a framework for exploring

<-----Page 11----->182 Scott Shane and Sankaran Venkataraman

them. We recognize that we may have offered some uncertain assumptions,
potentially flawed logical arguments, or have made statements that will prove,
ultimately, to be inconsistent with data yet to be collected. Nevertheless, this
framework provides a starting point. Since it incorporates information gained from
many disciplinary vantage points and explored through many different methodologies, we hope that it will prod scholars from many different fields to join us in
the quest to create a systematic body of information about entrepreneurship. Many
skeptics claim that the creation of such a body of theory and the subsequent
assembly of empirical support for it are impossible. We hope that other scholars
will join our effort to prove those skeptics wrong.
