Recently, several studies have been published that have shown the need for greater student engagement within engineering
education. These studies indicate that when students are exposed to pedagogies that stimulate student engagement, such as
active learning, student performance is better than with more traditional forms of instruction. One form of active learning
that is starting to grow within engineering education is the use of games and gamiﬁcation. In the spring of 2014, we were
able to compare two sections of a sophomore Introduction to Chemical Product Design class to determine the eﬀectiveness
of game-based learning on student learning outcomes. The ﬁrst section received content delivered utilizing active learning
techniques. The second section received content utilizing the same form of delivery but included classroom based games
and a game-based portal for homework assignments. Each section was evaluated in the same manner, and the instruction in
each section was provided by the same two faculty members. Throughout the course, students completed clicker questions
on class content, and at the end, they reviewed content in a class session administered using the clickers. Students were also
responsible for completing a semester design project that included both a written and oral component. Analysis of the
clicker responses demonstrated that the students in the game-based class performed statistically similar to or better than
those in the control group throughout the semester. In the last class review session, retention of material appears to have
been better in the game-based class, where several learning objectives demonstrated a signiﬁcantly higher outcome. Student
performance on the semester design project also exhibited similar trends. As the sample sizes are relatively small in this
study, the results are preliminary but do demonstrate a trend towards enhanced learning outcomes when content is
delivered utilizing game-based pedagogy.

1. Introduction
Traditional lecturing has been the primary method
of instruction at universities for over 900 years.
However, a recently published study showed that
in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics classes,
the use of active learning instead of traditional
lecturing increased the students’ examination
scores by an average of 6%. Furthermore, the
study showed that students taking a lecture-based
class were 1.5 times more likely to fail the class than
were students in active learning classes [1]. For this
reason, it is important that instructors, particularly
those in STEM related ﬁelds, strive to make the
classroom environment engaging to students, which
will contribute to their ultimate success within these
ﬁelds of study.
The purpose of this study is to examine the impact
of game-based learning methodologies on the per448

formance of students within a sophomore level
Introduction to Chemical Product Design class.
Game-based learning techniques were selected due
to their growing recognition as a medium that can
contribute to student engagement [2], although
more research is still required to ascertain the
beneﬁts of this form of pedagogy on student learning outcomes. Two class sections of the Introduction to Chemical Product Design class were taught
using active learning strategies, with one of the
sections including live classroom games and completion of homework assignments through a game
portal.
This paper provides an overview of the types of
instructional strategies that were used in both sections, the assessment measures employed, and the
impact of game-based learning strategies on student
learning outcomes. We will also discuss faculty
perspectives of the use of game-based learning

within the classroom and opportunities for future
development. We found through our analysis that
students in the game-based class performed statistically similar if not better than those in the active
learning class throughout the semester. We also
found that students in the game-based class demonstrated higher retention of course material with
signiﬁcantly better performance in three out of the
seven learning objectives in the summative clicker
assessment. In addition, interviews with the course
instructors revealed that both felt game-based
learning was an eﬀective pedagogy for this type of
class content and would continue to use this method
of instruction in the future.
1.1 Game-based learning
Game-based learning has the potential to increase
the learning ability of students, due to its capacity to
engage students in course material. This is due to the
many properties of game designs, including the
provision of a goal with speciﬁc rules, immediate
feedback on performance, a gradually-increasing
diﬃculty level based on user performance, and the
ability to encourage users to work to the edge of
their capabilities to achieve the winning condition
[2–4]. These characteristics allow for games to be
used for more than just fun by providing a foundation that will encourage meaningful learning to take
place. However, it has been cited that one of the
main challenges of using games within an educational setting is to balance the motivational aspects
for playing games with student learning [5]. For this
reason, some researchers have tailored the design of
their games to meet the motivational needs of the
student population and help ensure they facilitate
learning [6].
Perhaps the best way to envision how these
properties work together within an educational
environment is through example. One such example
is an adaptation of a trivia game, such as Jeopardy,
which can work well in higher education classes. In
this type of game, students can either work in teams
or as individuals (depending on class size). The goal
of the game is for students to select questions they
would like to answer in a given category when
provided with a game board that outlines ﬁve
questions per category, with each question assigned
a diﬀerent point value. The higher the point value of
the question, the more diﬃcult the problem is to
solve. Students are told that they can only select a
speciﬁc number of questions and will lose the points
assigned to the question if they answer it incorrectly.
These rules encourage students to be strategic by
choosing the questions they feel they can answer
while working towards the winning condition of
obtaining the greatest number of points. When
students respond to a question, they are told imme-

449

diately whether they are correct or not, which
provides the feedback necessary to iterate on their
solution to the problem. This type of game can serve
as a great review tool for students by encouraging
them to actively engage with course material prior
to an exam.
Although games can lay the framework for meaningful learning to take place, it is crucial to their
broader adaptation that proper assessment of student performance with the games is performed [7].
There are many ways that students can be assessed,
but in order to obtain the most conclusive results
regarding the eﬀectiveness of game-based learning,
the assessment must be in-depth and leave little
room for error [8]. The next section will provide
an overview of studies that have been performed,
speciﬁcally within engineering education, to determine the impact game-based learning has had on
student learning outcomes.
1.2 Game-based learning within engineering
education
Only a limited number of studies have been published which provide an argument for the beneﬁts of
games on student learning outcomes. In a recent
literature review performed on the implementation
of games within undergraduate engineering classes,
it was found that only 40% of publications over the
past ﬁve years have performed some measure of
student learning assessment as part of their implementation whether through qualitative or quantitative measures [9]. Examples of diﬀerent methods
for assessing the impact of games within undergraduate engineering classes have been included
below for reference of the existing work in the
ﬁeld. It is important to note that the examples
provided do not capture all of the work that has
been done in this ﬁeld, and readers are encouraged
to reference the literature review cited previously for
the complete listing of references in this area.
One common approach to quantitatively assess
the impact that games can have on student learning
is through the utilization of a pre- and post-test. In
these instances, the pre-test is used as a measure of
the students’ baseline performance and then the
post-test allows for comparisons to be made on
student learning after the intervention. An example
of a study that utilized this approach was done by
Chang et al. in 2011 when they implemented a gamebased version of a virtual laboratory [10]. In their
implementation, students were given a pre-test to
assess their preparedness for the laboratory and also
determine areas where they showed conceptual
weaknesses. After completion of the pre-test, students participated in the game-based laboratory
and then completed the post-experiment test. The
authors utilized tests that were similar in nature

<-----Page 2----->450

although not identical to avoid the possibility of
short-term memorization impacting the results.
They found that students showed increases in their
performance on the post-test in comparison to the
pre-test measure. In this particular implementation,
there was no control group that was used and beneﬁt
from the implementation of the game was characterized solely on the basis of the change in student
performance between the start and end of the
intervention.
In other implementations, tests can be used in
conjunction with control groups to allow for a more
detailed understanding of whether the learning
observed may be associated with game-based intervention. Ebner and Holzinger took this approach in
their assessment of whether a computer-based game
was helpful in teaching civil engineering students
[11]. In their implementation students selected
whether they wanted to voluntarily participate in
playing the game, with the remaining students in the
class becoming the control for the implementation.
This approach involves a concurrent cohort comparison. They also had an additional experimental
group that was outside of the classroom (i.e., online)
during the entire study. Similar to the approach
described earlier, students in this study were given
both a pre- and a post-test as a measure of learning
gains associated with the intervention. Their results
demonstrated that there was an increase in the
average number of problems that students answered
correctly from the pre- to the post-test. However,
there were no statistical diﬀerences in the results
between the control and experimental group.
There are also studies performed which don’t use
speciﬁc instruments or tests to assess the students
but rather focus their analysis on student performance on course-embedded materials such as
homework assignments and midterm and ﬁnal
exams. This was the approach that was taken by
Sancho et al. in 2009 when they were determining
the ability of their ‘‘Nucleo’’ framework for computer programming, built around the principles of
virtual collaborative blended learning, to improve
student learning outcomes [12]. In the three case
studies that they performed they examined not only
performance on traditional student assignments,
such as classwork and the ﬁnal exam, but also
determined if there were any changes in the dropout rate of students. Their results showed that there
were a signiﬁcantly lower number of students that
withdrew from the course in the experimental group
and that on average their exam scores were also
higher in comparison to the control group.
Another method for assessing the impact of
games on student learning outcomes is a qualitative-based approach. This was utilized by Hauge
and Riedel in their evaluation of two serious games,

Cheryl A. Bodnar et al.

COSIGA and BEWARE, for teaching engineering
and manufacturing [13]. In their study, they analyzed a combination of student communication chat
logs, student responses to cognitive formulated
questionnaires administered prior to and after
exposure to the simulation, and student work that
was produced after interaction with the simulation.
The COSIGA game, which was evaluated using
student communication chat logs and cognitive
maps, extended learning beneﬁts for students; however, this was impacted by the student’s role within
the simulation. The BEWARE game demonstrated
that students could identify risk better after interaction with this simulation. In addition, performance was improved when students were exposed
to a learning cycle that involved playing the game,
debrieﬁng their experience, and playing the game a
second time. Results were also impacted by students’ past experiences, and it was found that taking
this background into account during the debrieﬁng
period could positively impact the learning.
Our study focuses on the assessment of two
concurrent cohorts of students taking an Introduction to Chemical Product Design class, with one of
the sections receiving in-class games and completing
homework through a game-based portal and the
other receiving only active-learning based instruction. The direct assessment of student performance
and learning outcomes was performed through the
analysis of clicker (i.e., audience response system)
questions during the semester as well as in a ﬁnal
review session. Additional comparisons are made
based on student performance on a semester design
project. Finally, faculty perspectives and observations regarding the two class cohorts provide a
qualitative assessment of the diﬀerences in these
two forms of instructional pedagogy.

2. Research question
In an eﬀort to investigate the use of games in a
chemical engineering course and contribute to the
evidence-based body of knowledge about the
impact of game-based instruction, we asked the
following research question: Does implementation
of a game-based learning pedagogy within an Introduction to Chemical Product Design course result in
any diﬀerence in learning outcomes when compared to
a class taught using active learning pedagogy? To
investigate this question, we compared student
performance both during and at the end of the
course on clicker questions as well as their performance on a term design project. Additional insight
on diﬀerences between the two classes was provided
through a semi-structured interview with the two
instructors who co-taught the course.

<-----Page 3----->Evaluating the Eﬀectiveness of Game-Based Learning on Improvement of Student Learning Outcomes

3. Methods
3.1 Study design
Two sections of the chemical engineering design
course, each having 57 students, were taught
during the spring of 2014 semester. One of the
primary goals of this course was to provide the
skills necessary to develop an appreciation for the
role of customers within product design. In addition, students worked on professional skills development. Topics covered included brainstorming
techniques, identifying customer needs, market
analysis, and ﬁnance. In addition to those topics,
the course also covered communication, teamwork,
decision making, leadership, and project management. Student enrollment in each section was done
randomly. A comparison of the average start-ofthe-semester cumulative grade point averages
(GPAs) of the game-based versus control group
was done to ensure that the groups were similar in
terms of previous achievement. It was found that
there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two
class sections in terms of the pre-course average
GPA (p = 0.912).
The control section was taught using a combination of diﬀerent active learning techniques and
traditional lecture. The active learning strategies
included think-pair-share, group discussion, case
studies, and role-play assignments. The students in
this section did not participate in any games in class
and were given regular weekly written homework
assignments. The experimental group was taught
utilizing these same strategies but also through
game-based learning elements, such as live in-class
games. Students in this section also completed
homework through a third party platform known
as 3D Game Lab [14].
The games played in class were relatively simple
games that varied in structure. Each of the games
was selected after consultation with a live game
designer who helped the instructor in selecting
games that showcased the principles relevant to
the course. Some of the games lasted roughly 5
minutes, while others took almost 30 minutes.
Additionally, some games were played with the
entire class, while others were played within a
group of students. At times, teams were randomly
selected, and at other times, they were selected based
on where the students were seated in the classroom.
In a few instances, each student comprised his/her
own team. An example of one type of in-class game
was the hula hoop race. In this particular game, ﬁve
students were grouped together and told to link
arms in a circle. A hula hoop was then placed on one
of the set of linked arms. The goal of the game was
for the students to get the hula hoop around the
circle in the shortest period of time. This game was

451

selected on the basis that it was a means to visually
demonstrate to students that the ﬁrst solution to the
problem might not always be the best approach. As
elaborated on later within this paper, this game can
lead to further illustration of pre-conceived constraints that students place on problems without
necessarily realizing it.
Students in both classes also completed semester
long design projects and were encouraged to
respond to the College and University Classroom
Environment Inventory (CUCEI) in the second-tolast week of the semester. Appropriate human
subjects clearance was obtained prior to the commencement of the study.
3.2 3D game lab
The 3D Game Lab platform, which was invented by
educational technologists and is currently available
through GoGo Labs, Inc., allows for students to
complete assignments using a computer and submit
them online [14]. The assignments covered all topics
that were relevant to course material. Often, they
involved reading an online article or watching a
video and providing a reﬂection on what was
observed. Later assignments in the course built
upon material that students had already worked
on, providing a scaﬀold for the students to expand
their knowledge in these topic areas.
Once an assignment was submitted, the instructor reviewed the student’s work and either
approved or rejected it. If the student’s work was
approved, he/she was given a set number of points
determined before the start of the semester. If the
student’s work was rejected, the assignment was
returned with comments indicating which aspects
of the student’s work could be improved. The
student then had the opportunity to make the
proper adjustments and re-submit the assignment.
The student’s work was again examined in the same
manner, and if approved, received the same number
of points associated with a ﬁrst-time acceptance of
the work.
During the semester, the students were required
to accrue 1750 points in 3D Game Lab in order to
receive a homework grade of 100% for the course.
Homework assignments accounted for 25% of the
ﬁnal grade in the course. Students needed to take
responsibility for completing assignments on 3D
Game Lab, as assignments were not collected on a
weekly basis.
3.3 Learning outcomes measurement
Students in both sections utilized audience response
systems, or clickers, during in-class lecture. Whenever the instructor asked a question, students
answered using the clicker. All of the questions
were multiple choice with no more than ﬁve options

<-----Page 4----->452

Cheryl A. Bodnar et al.

to choose from. During most lectures, a few questions were asked, and the timing of these questions
varied throughout the lecture period. The last
lecture of the course served as a review of course
material, in which approximately 40 questions were
asked. The questions were selected from previous
lectures as a method to determine how much material the students had retained. This approach
allowed for the collection of data related to student
learning outcomes from both sections without any
instructor bias.
Comparison of student performance on semester
long design projects was also done. Student teams
were required to develop a two minute infomercial
as well as a written report on a sunscreen product
they were to develop. Performance on each of these
individual components of the assignment along
with overall performance on the design project
was assessed by the instructor using an instructordeveloped rubric. In addition, there was a peerreview component. The infomercial represented
15% of the design project grade, and the written
report comprised 85% of the project grade.
3.4 Statistical analysis of learning outcomes
To analyze the results from the clicker questions, all
of the questions that were asked during the semester
were categorized based on the learning objectives
for the course. All of the questions that were not
included as part of the review session as well as any
questions that were opinion-based were removed
from the analysis. This left only questions that were
fact-based and used during the semester as well as in
the ﬁnal review session, enabling the most objective
comparison of learning outcomes. The percent of
questions answered correctly by all respondents
within a particular learning objective was calculated. This was done for all seven learning objectives in both sections. A z-test of proportions was
used to compare the percentage of correct answers
obtained by each section using a signiﬁcance level of
 = 0.05. To determine the impact of the gamebased learning on the students’ design project
performance, ﬁnal scores for the written, infomercial/oral, and overall design project performance

were compared between the groups using both a ttest and the Mann Whitney test, given the small
sample size.

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Impact on learning outcomes
All students were evaluated using a combination of
their responses to clicker questions during the
semester (formative) as well as in the ﬁnal review
session (summative) and their performance on a
semester long design project. These results are
described in the following sections.
4.1.1 Formative clicker questions
This course had the following seven primary learning objectives or topic areas: brainstorming, customer information, market analysis, communication,
teamwork, leadership, and decision making. In the
assessment of formative student responses, students
in the game-based class performed just as well or
better than students in the non-game class from a
statistical standpoint on all seven topic areas, as
shown in Table 1.
In particular, for the topic areas of brainstorming
techniques, market analysis, teamwork, leadership,
and decision making, the percentages correct in the
game-based class were higher than in the non-game
class. In addition, the two-proportion z tests for
each topic area showed that students in the gamebased class performed signiﬁcantly better in the area
of market analysis. These enhanced performances
by the game-based students in several of the topic
areas may have occurred because students were
allowed to move at their own pace with 3D game
Lab—potentially ahead of the instruction in the
classroom. With this self-paced method of instruction, it is quite possible that students in the gamebased class had already covered the material on
these topics before being exposed to them during
class
In addition, the increase in performance for the
topics of brainstorming, teamwork, and leadership
may have been due to the live classroom games that
students had the opportunity to participate in. For

instance, just prior to instruction on brainstorming,
students took part in two to three classroom games
that related to pre-conceived constraints that
impact the ability to generate ideas when brainstorming. One of these live classroom games was
the Hula Hoop Race mentioned earlier. In this
particular game, many of the students felt that it
was necessary to have each student step through the
hula hoop, eﬀectively moving it from student to
student in order to move it around the circle in the
shortest period of time. However, during debrieﬁng
of this activity in class, it was discussed that this was
a limitation the students had imposed on the problem, since it was not stated in the instructions that
the hoop had to travel from one student to another.
In fact, the fastest way for the hula hoop to go
around the circle is for the group of students to
make one complete circle. This experience can be
related back to brainstorming because in many
instances we impose limitations on design problems
that aren’t prescribed in the problem statement.
These perceived limitations then lead to the generation of fewer ideas or diﬃculties getting beyond the
initial solution to a problem. For this reason, it is
important for students to recognize the types of
limitations they might impose when trying to generate more diverse and creative solutions to the
problems they are presented with.
An example of a game that targeted teamwork
was ‘‘Star Wars,’’ in which a number of hula hoops
was scattered around the classroom ﬂoor, and
students were told they had to have a foot within
one of the hoops when time was called. This game
then required students positioned within the same
hula hoop to learn about each other and ﬁnd
interesting similarities. At each subsequent round
of the game, a few hula hoops were removed. By
playing subsequent rounds of the game, the students
began to know each other better, and they had to
work as a team to solve the ﬁnal problem of ﬁtting a
signiﬁcant number of students into a small number
of hula hoops. After completion of the game, a
debrief session helped students to connect the
experiences they had during the game with the
teamwork skills that were being covered in class.

453

4.1.2 Summative clicker questions
The results from the review questions presented at
the end of the semester showed a considerably larger
diﬀerence between the game-based and the nongame-based classes. In this review session, the
game-based class correctly answered more questions in six of the seven topic areas, as shown in
Table 2. The z test of proportions showed that the
game-based class performed signiﬁcantly better on
the market analysis questions (p = 0.002). Although
diﬀerences in brainstorming techniques and teamwork were signiﬁcant at p = 0.02, they would not be
signiﬁcant after correcting for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s adjustment. The formative
analysis also showed better performance in these
three topic areas as noted previously. The use of
both live classroom games and a game-based portal
likely helped students to reinforce these topic areas.
For example, with the brainstorming assignments in
Game Lab, students had to provide an example of a
new brainstorming technique and compare it to the
techniques covered in class. By asking students to
make this additional comparison, they had to revisit
the techniques covered in class, which helped in
making connections to the course material. There
were also several live games used to develop teamwork skills, including ‘‘Star Wars,’’ as discussed
earlier.
4.1.3 Design project performance
A major contributor to the ﬁnal grade within the
course was a semester long design project, which
was worth 40% of the grade. There were two
components to the project—an infomercial and a
written report for a new chemical product the team
was proposing to develop. For the infomercial,
there was both a peer and an instructor evaluation
component. The peer evaluation component, which
had a possible score of 20, contributed to one third
of the ﬁnal infomercial score. The instructor component also had a possible score of 20 and contributed to two thirds of the infomercial score. The
written portion of the design project was graded by
the instructor and had a possible score of 100. As

shown in Table 3, the written portion and the total
design project showed promising trends with the
game-based students, although the signiﬁcance level
did not quite reach  = 0.05. Given the small sample
sizes, we performed both a t-test and the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and observed that
the results from the two tests were generally in
agreement.
The promising diﬀerence in the written design
project performance between the two groups may
have been due to the nature of the homework assignments in the two classes. As discussed previously,
students in the game-based class were continually
tasked with working on individual assignments in
the 3D Game Lab portal pertaining to diﬀerent areas
of the course according to their own interests in the
pursuit of the 1,750 point goal. This required them to
use information they had seen in previous assignments as well as during class in order to successfully
complete the new assignments. This diﬀered from
the other section, in which the homework assignments only corresponded to material that was
covered in class the week immediately prior to the
assignment. In addition, the feedback element of 3D
Game Lab required the games-based students to
iterate on their technical writing assignments and
likely promoted better mastery of the material. In
this project based course with no examinations, the
non-games students didn’t necessarily have the need
to review and reinforce material.
The results obtained in the learning outcomes
analysis, although preliminary, show similarities
to other work that has been done in the gamebased learning ﬁeld. Our results from both the
clicker questions and the student design projects
demonstrated that the games-based students performed statistically similar to or better than students in the non-games based class. This coincides
with other work that has shown positive increases in
the performance of students exposed to game-based
learning [10–13, 15–19].
4.2 Classroom environment
As described in a previous article, we found that
students in the game-based class rated the classroom
environment better on all seven dimensions of the
College and University Classroom Environment

Inventory (CUCEI), although not signiﬁcantly so
when corrected for multiple comparisons using
Bonferroni’s adjustment [20, 21]. In particular,
students in the game-based class rated their involvement in the classroom as characterized by participating actively and attentively in class at 3.39 on a 5
point scale, in comparison to only 3.17 in the nongame based class (p = 0.12) [20]. It has been
discussed previously that learners need to be
actively engaged to promote meaningful connections with their prior knowledge [22], which the live
classroom games would have helped to do. The
personalization dimension of the classroom, which
measures the interaction between the students and
instructor, was among the classroom characteristics
of interest to the instructor. This dimension was
rated as signiﬁcantly better by the games-based
section based on a t-test (p = 0.039) as well as a
Mann-Whitney test (p = 0.015). However, these
would not be signiﬁcant at  = 0.05 if adjusted for
multiple comparisons. The eﬀect size for personalization, as measured by Cohen’s d, was 0.48, which is
in the medium range. We achieved a 71% response
rate with the CUCEI.
4.3 Interview of course instructors
The assessment analyst for the study conducted a
semi-structured interview after the course with the
two chemical engineering faculty members who
served as co-instructors. In the joint interview,
several issues pertaining to student behavior
within the course were discussed, including the
instructors’ perspectives on student engagement,
conﬁdence, and attitudes. Both instructors agreed
that students in the game-based class were more
engaged. This was observed through higher attendance in the games-based class (i.e., estimated 3050% higher) and greater involvement in class activities. This greater involvement entailed more students actively taking part in group discussions and
responding to the instructors’ questions as well as
comfortably participating in impromptu presentations during class. We believe this increase in
engagement may have resulted from the continual
change in classroom practices, with no two class
periods being alike. The instructors also observed
that students in the game-based class appeared

<-----Page 7----->Evaluating the Eﬀectiveness of Game-Based Learning on Improvement of Student Learning Outcomes

livelier and more alert during class. In the games
section, the students were participants in all the
activities, and the instructors noted a progression
from hesitancy at the beginning of the semester to
participation without hesitation (for the most part)
towards the end of the semester. This change may
have occurred due to gains in student self-conﬁdence, with the students in the games section
appearing more conﬁdent based on instructor
observations.
The instructors were also asked about their views
on which teaching method was the most eﬀective
instructional practice for this content area. Both
instructors agreed that game-based learning was the
better method from both a student engagement and
performance perspective. When asked to elaborate,
one of the instructors indicated that the gamesbased class provided a more realistic (i.e., authentic)
experience for the students. Speciﬁcally, the students had to get organized, and time management
was a large component. In short, the games helped
by ‘‘providing a more realistic situation for students, similar to what they will encounter later in
their professional lives.’’ When asked whether they
would use this instructional strategy in the future,
both instructors felt they would continue to use
game-based learning in this course.
4.4 Limitations of study
Although these results are very encouraging and
show that game-based learning may help students in
gaining and retaining knowledge, there are some
limitations to this study, including the small sample
sizes. Each class section had just ﬁfty-seven students. When the students were placed in groups to
work on their semester design projects, the sample
size was reduced to just 14 teams in the game-based
section and 15 in the other section. Although it
would be beneﬁcial to repeat this exact study in
future semesters and expand upon the dataset for
statistical testing, the instructor decided to move
forward with only game-based learning in the
course based upon review of teaching evaluations.
An opportunity that was missed with this study
was the gathering of student perspectives on the two
types of pedagogies. A focus group with students in
both game and non-game sections would have been
helpful for obtaining a broader understanding of
the diﬀerences in performance and engagement
observed. For instance, was it the live games in
class or the 3D Game Lab portal that was most
useful to the students in understanding the course
material? Did students feel that they were more
involved in their own learning when challenged to
take part in the game-based activities during class?
Future studies could work on gaining a better
understanding of the type of cognitive theory that

455

supports the changes that are being observed in
student performance with games-based instruction.
Additionally, there is a potential limitation due to
the method utilized for selecting the games that were
employed as part of this classroom study. As
described earlier, classroom games were chosen
based on their alignment with concepts that were
important components of this course and not necessarily on their alignment with the backgrounds and
characteristics of the students in the course. This may
have led to the games having less of an impact on
student performance than if they had been selected
based upon their ability to meet the needs of the
student population within the game-based class.

5. Conclusions
The application of game-based learning appears to
be increasing within engineering education, as evidenced by increases in the number of publications
on this subject. This study represents the ﬁrst
implementation of game-based learning within a
sophomore level Chemical Product Design course.
The results of this study show that inclusion of
live classroom games alongside a game-based portal
for completion of homework assignments may have
a positive impact on student learning outcomes. In
particular, students in the game-based class performed at a statistically similar or higher level
than students in the non-game class. Achievement
in particular topic areas, including brainstorming,
market analysis, and teamwork, showed evidence of
being greater in the game-based class. The use of
games that particularly reinforced these areas and
the iterative homework assignments in the 3D
Game Lab portal, which often included technical
writing assignments, may have contributed to better
understanding of these speciﬁc content areas and
enhanced writing skills. An interview with the
faculty members who taught the two sections
further supports the advantages of games-based
instruction. Students in the game-based class
appeared to be more engaged and enlivened
during class and possessed greater self-conﬁdence,
including with impromptu classroom presentations.
Both faculty members felt that this instructional
methodology had a positive impact on students, and
they planned to use it in future course oﬀerings.
It is of critical importance to engage students in
the learning process to help them achieve better
learning outcomes and retain their knowledge as
they progress through their technical courses and
beyond. Game-based learning is a pedagogy that
holds great promise for enhancing learning outcomes through increased student engagement and
participation in the learning process. In addition, it
may lead to a more positive classroom environment

<-----Page 8----->456

and student experiences. Thus, one of the research
questions to be further investigated is the impact of
this pedagogy on students’ perception of the classroom learning environment and their professional
skills development.
