The Emergence of
Evidence-Based
Entrepreneurship

Many companies and leaders show little interest in subjecting their business practices
and decisions to the same scientific rigor they would use for technical or medical
issues. (Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006, p. 12)

Introduction
Evidence-based entrepreneurship (EBE) pursues the science-informed practice of
entrepreneurship. A prerequisite is the systematic accumulation and interpretation of the
body of evidence from entrepreneurship scholarship (Rauch & Frese, 2006). EBE builds
on insights from the related practice of evidence-based management (EBMgt; Rousseau,
2012), itself influenced by evidence-based approaches in medicine, criminology, and
other fields.
At the same time, we must ask to what extent entrepreneurship can make use of
the still controversial ideas of EBMgt. EBMgt combines four fundamental practices in
making everyday managerial judgments and decisions: (1) use of the best available
relevant scientific findings; (2) systematic attention to organizational facts, indicators, and
metrics; (3) ongoing practice of critical, reflective judgment, and use of decision aids in
order to improve decision quality; (4) consideration of ethical issues, in particular, the
impact of decisions on their many stakeholders (Rousseau, 2012, pp. 4, 5).
This special issue takes stock of the current state of EBE as well as the opportunities
and limits of modeling it after evidence-based practice in other fields. Importantly,
differences between entrepreneurship and other fields are noteworthy. EBE faces challenges that are not equally present in the fields of management or medicine. First is the
typical requirement in evidence-based practice to establish standards based on the best
available evidence. For example, evidence-based medicine may lead to the recommendations that reduce variability in practice, such that doctors deliver a particular treatment for
a certain diagnosis in a well-specified fashion. Entrepreneurship, on the other hand, deals
with generating novelty and being different from other participants in the market. So the

<-----Page 1----->actual behavior entrepreneurs demonstrate may need to differ from other entrepreneurs,
managers, and people in general in order to be truly entrepreneurial (Sarasvathy, Simon,
& Lave, 1998). This may imply that entrepreneurs deviate from what is typically thought
to be good management practice. Entrepreneurs are often opportunistic. They base
decisions not on careful deliberations of pro and con, but on fast heuristics (Busenitz &
Alvarez, 2007) and rely on improvisation (Baker & Nelson, 2005). Thus, it is plausible
that evidence-based recommendations concerning entrepreneurship may be appropriately
made only at higher levels of abstraction than found in other evidence-based fields. For
example, entrepreneurs may be well advised to improvise in facing novel circumstances
while physicians and managers may be guided by recommendations to run a series of
experiments to see which best approximates the desired outcome (Rousseau, 2012;
Sarasvathy, 2001).
Second, dissemination of knowledge poses a particular challenge in entrepreneurship. The number of entrepreneurs, however defined, is large and constitutes a very
heterogeneous group of people. There are no credentialing systems for entrepreneurs,
and no required programs or professional schools for them to enroll in before starting
their businesses. In effect, passing information on to practicing and prospective entrepreneurs is difficult. Nonetheless, most advanced economies have extensive entrepreneurship policies that can be influenced by evidence-based insights and recommendations
which then have effects on entrepreneurs. Similarly, venture capitalists and banks can be
reached by evidence-based approaches which in turn will influence how entrepreneurs
behave.
Public policy institutions play an important role in the further development of EBE.
Most nations have programs that provide support to entrepreneurs, new ventures, and
small businesses. By designing such programs to allow appropriate evaluation of their
outcomes (cf. Storey, 2002), these institutions can contribute to the establishment of
EBE. We note that many programs would lend themselves to be designed as randomized
controlled experiment; in particular those that involve awarding grants and/or providing
training and guidance. This would be ideal for establishing not only the effectiveness of
government programs, but more importantly also what constitutes effective entrepreneurship and management of entrepreneurial firms more broadly.

Promoting Evidence-Based Entrepreneurship
With these challenges in mind, we turn to the ways we believe EBE might be
effectively promoted. A first step is to take stock of what we know. The most viable
strategy for taking stock of the scholarly literature is to systematically review it to identify
evidence relevant to important practice questions in entrepreneurship. Such reviews may
take the form of meta-analyses (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004) that generate nonbiased
estimates of relationships that matter to entrepreneurship practice and/or policy. Metaanalyses establish the empirical literature’s best estimate of the existence, strength, and
consistency in the relationship(s) between practically useful variables. A recent review
tallied over 20 meta-analyses in the area of entrepreneurship (Frese, Bausch, Schmidt,
Rauch, & Kabst, 2012). Sample research questions that have been studied with the help
of meta-analyses are the relationship of how personality contributes to entrepreneurship
(e.g., Rauch & Frese, 2007), whether planning helps entrepreneurial firms to be successful
(Brinckmann, Grichnik, & Kapsa, 2010), how training and which kind of training is
related to entrepreneurial success (Martin, McNally, & Kay, 2013), on strategic stance

issue (below).
Apart from taking stock of what already exists, EBE needs to encourage research to
generate new knowledge to inform the decisions, processes, and activities of entrepreneurs (Stokes, 1997). Other fields such as medicine, clinical psychology, and organizational psychology, have linked different research designs with degrees of evidence in order
to promote more useful research (Cook, Campbell, & Peracchio, 1990).
As in the case of evidence-based medicine, the randomized controlled experiment can
provide high-quality evidence of what works to promote effective entrepreneurial practice. (N.B. with randomization, at the start of the experiment the group receiving the
intervention is exactly comparable to the control group. The only difference between them
is the intervention.) Economists now increasingly use controlled randomized experiments,
particularly when studying the efficacy of interventions for entrepreneurs in developing
countries (Banerjee & Duflo, 2011; Karlan & Appel, 2011). Excellent examples include
providing microcredits in developing countries showing a high return on investment in
micro-businesses (de Mel, McKenzie, & Woodruff, 2008). Research on the effects of
training also uses randomized controlled experiments (Glaub & Frese, 2011; McKenzie &
Woodruff, 2012). There are a few examples in which training concepts have been shown
to provide better approaches to entrepreneurship and higher success rates (Gielnik et al.,
2014). More such studies employing controlled randomized experiments would be very
beneficial for the establishment of EBE. It attests to the rare nature of these studies that
there was no submission of such an experiment to our special issue.
Careful longitudinal studies, in particular panel studies, are also critical. The call for
longitudinal studies is by no means new, and the advantages of such designs are wellestablished including the possibility to study processes that unfold over time (Hassett &
Paavilainen-Mäntymäki, 2013). A problem of longitudinal research designs is that data
collection of course takes time and is expensive. Fortunately for entrepreneurship scholars, large-scale initiatives such as the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED;
e.g., Reynolds, 2010) and the Kauffman Firm Survey (KFS; e.g., Coleman & Robb,
2009) are now publically available for use in research. Although such initiatives are
costly, we strongly encourage additional efforts to build longitudinal databases. Given
the price tag, pooling of resources as done for the PSED is a valuable way forward in the
establishing of EBE.

Articles Included in This Special Issue
Four meta-analyses develop new knowledge in the field of entrepreneurship. The first
meta-analysis is by Bae, Qian, Miao, and Fiet, and examines the relationship between
entrepreneurship education and intentions (“The Relationship Between Entrepreneurship
Education and Entrepreneurial Intentions: A Meta-Analytic Review”). Its first finding is
that the correlation between business education and intention is smaller than the one for
specific entrepreneurship education—a finding that one would expect. Its second important finding is that in general, the correlations between entrepreneurship and business
education with intentions are lower than most entrepreneurship researchers would expect.
A further finding is that cultural practices influence the size of the correlations significantly. However, the most important finding for practice is a near zero and nonsignificant
relationship between entrepreneurial/business education and the intention to start a business, when prior intentions are controlled for. This means that by and large, students come

that same intention. Thus, a reverse causation argument is more likely supported here; the
intention to start a business determines whether somebody takes a course in business or
entrepreneurship, and there is no change of entrepreneurial intention because of education. Of course, as in all meta-analyses on entrepreneurship, there is a high degree of
heterogeneity in the empirical correlations. This implies that policy makers have to
assume differentiated response to education, and researchers need to do much more
research to find the best way to increase entrepreneurial intentions. But at least we
can conclude: “Not all is well in the state of entrepreneurship and business education,”
and future studies need to develop ideas, specifically on what influences entrepreneurial
intentions and entrepreneurial behaviors, and new research is called for in this area.
The second meta-analysis addresses cultural and macroeconomic moderators of
the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial performance
(Saeed, Yousafzai, & Engelen: “On Cultural and Macroeconomic Contingencies of the
Entrepreneurial Orientation–Performance Relationship”). There are, indeed, moderators
of the relationship, which includes cultural moderators (such as uncertainty avoidance,
power distance, and in-group collectivism), as well as politico-economic moderators
(such as developing country and political stability). It is important to note that even after
the introduction of moderators, there is still a sizeable heterogeneity of correlations left,
suggesting that there is a need to look at other moderators for researchers and for
practitioners to assume that there are important contextual conditions which are at this
point scientifically unknown.
A different type of analysis is presented in Schlaegel and Koenig in “Determinants
of Entrepreneurial Intent: A Meta-Analytic Test and Integration of Competing Models.”
Entrepreneurial intentions have been extensively studies, often as a proxy for actual
behavior. Different models intended to explain such intentions have been proposed.
Schlaegel and Koenig test the predictive power of the two most common theoretical
models, and then integrate them into a more powerful yet parsimonious model. Their
findings that some commonly used variables influence intentions to a large extent, and
other variables only to a small extent have implications for scholars, entrepreneurs,
and educators alike. For example, it is valuable for the owners of a family business to
know what makes their children more or less interested in pursuing entrepreneurship.
The article “A Qualitative Approach to Evidence-Based Entrepreneurship: Theoretical
Considerations and an Example Involving Business Clusters” by Rauch, van Doorn, and
Hulsink outlines principles, guidelines, and examples for synthesizing the findings of
qualitative research. Thus, this is the first qualitative meta-analysis reported in evidencebased management and entrepreneurship. As in quantitative aggregations, the purpose
is to generalize findings. Individual case studies and qualitative research more generally
typically don’t seek such generalizations, but the novel approach presented herein
allows for it. Given the strengths of case studies when it comes to providing contexts
to findings, and shedding light on minority phenomena, such qualitative synthesizing of
findings complements quantitatively-based EBE.
Next, in the article “Creating the Future Together: Toward a Framework for Research
Synthesis in Entrepreneurship,” van Burg and Romme suggest a research synthesis, to
take stock of findings from entrepreneurial research on exploitation of opportunities and
the results achieved. A research synthesis assesses the body of work relevant to a practical
question where both qualitative and quantitative studies are considered (Rousseau,
Manning & Denyer, 2008). Importantly, van Burg and Romme demonstrate the antecedents of opportunities, their exploitation and performance (such as entrepreneur’s personal
characteristics and beliefs as well as external and organizational factors), but also the
212

<-----Page 4----->factors that mediate their effect on entrepreneurial opportunities. These mediators include
entrepreneurial cognitions (searching, scanning, framing, and interpreting) as well as
social ties and interactions.
Importantly, Steffens, Weeks, Davidsson, and Issak “Shouting From the Ivory Tower: A
Marketing Approach to Improve Communication of Academic Research to Entrepreneurs,”
demonstrate that entrepreneurs can have particular preferences regarding the presentation
of research findings. They provide empirical evidence of a preference to receive research
summaries characterized by rich details but minimal use of jargon. Also important are the
details provided regarding the authors’ academic and industry credentials. The opportunities
to better present and publicize research findings in entrepreneurship are plentiful.

Attending to the Controversies in EBE
We are fully aware of the controversial nature of the idea of EBE, and this special
issue sought to generate thoughtful discussion of these disputed issues. We would have
preferred more controversial input regarding the pros and cons of EBE (perhaps the most
controversial here is the contribution by van Burg and Romme).
A controversy concerns the identification of effective entrepreneurial action, what
some might refer to as “best or promising practices.” The outcomes of entrepreneurial
actions are typically more salient than the outcomes of managerial actions since entrepreneurs often have a strong and sometimes even immediate impact on the very survival
of their firms. In one sense, the availability of clear outcomes might suggest that evidence
of what works is readily available. However, to date, systematic observations of the
practices of entrepreneurs and the outcomes of their actions have been rare (cf. Dimov,
2011). The tendency to treat entrepreneurial behavior as unsystematic and improvised
may have discouraged researchers from giving it more critical attention. Moreover, conventional wisdom asserts an immutable fact of entrepreneurship, that is, the high mortality
rate of start-ups. Acceptance of this “fact” as inevitable may have turned scholarly
attention toward matters that seem to be more controllable (such as entrepreneurship
training, funding arrangements, social networks, etc.).
Another example of the controversies in EBE is the debate regarding whether research
articles are really able to help improve science-informed practice. This debate exists in the
area of management generally (Pearce & Huang, 2012) and in human resource management (Rynes, Colbert, & Brown, 2002). One answer is provided by the thought-provoking
article by Steffens et al. in this special issue. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that
venture capital providers display little acumen in selecting good business partners. It also
shows how difficult is the prediction of good business opportunities as well as how little
professionals in this area know about making good predictions (Rosenbusch, Brinckmann,
& Mueller, 2013). We also believe that Bae et al.’s meta-analysis in this special issue
might lead to better intervention programs to enhance entrepreneurship than exists at the
moment in entrepreneurship and business courses. Finally, we think that the approach
by Schlaegel and Koenig of increasing synergetic integrations of competing models is
useful—and so is to develop clearly competing models in entrepreneurship research. More
such discussions are needed in EBE.

Conclusion
There are several constituents that can benefit from the establishment of evidencebased entrepreneurship (EBE). These include educators and trainers in entrepreneurship

practitioners who are willing and able to expand their knowledge and expertise. Consultants to entrepreneurial firms also would do well to consult EBE before they are advising
entrepreneurs on one remedy or another. Of course, the recipients of suggestions by
consultants may also be critical customers in the sense of examining results before
agreeing to follow the consultants’ advice. We (the authors) ourselves regularly consult
articles and abstracts disseminated by the Cochrane foundation before taking medicine
prescribed by physicians or undergoing an operation. Such abstracts are plentiful in
medicine and highly informative to people who understand a little statistics; and they are
also free. We anticipate a time in which science provides similar services to managers
and entrepreneurs. Similar to medicine, people will understand that context issues are
important and that in the last analysis, the individual case needs to be considered before
suggesting new behaviors and other advice to entrepreneurs; however similar to medicine,
people will become better consumers of such advice if they know the average outcomes
that have occurred from following it as reported in the literature.
Last, we propose that entrepreneurs make more regular use of the data they already
have in order to enhance their practice. The study of entrepreneurial practice and in
particular the reciprocal link between entrepreneurial action and environmental feedback
is hugely important input to EBE. Data that already exist in entrepreneurial firms may be
used in a more reflective fashion when EBE ideas become prevalent. One of the most
admired firms—Google—has developed an evidence-based approach to presentation of
Internet sites, marketing, and management and has grown considerably on the basis of a
strict empirical approach.
The articles presented in this special issue attests to the richness of approaches that
can help furthering EBE. We hope this issue inspires others to provide further evidence
regarding entrepreneurial practices that work (and those that don’t) and under what
conditions.
