Abstract
In this paper, we seek to explain venture capitalists’ reactions to disappointments caused by
entrepreneurs. Our basic assumption is that venture capitalists’ social environment, defined as
exposure to venture capital and business communities, will influence their responses to problematic
situations. The results of our study suggest that venture capitalists with strong ties to their colleagues
and with managerial experience are more inclined to use active and constructive approaches than
venture capitalists with a lesser exposure to the venture capital and business communities.

relationship between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur–a relationship characterized by open and frequent communication (Sapienza et al., 1996). However, previous
research indicates that cooperation between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is far
from ubiquitous (Sahlman, 1990), and that tensions and conflicts often arise in this
relationship—conflicts that, if not solved in a proper manner, could be disastrous for the
success of the venture. We are concerned with four sources of disappointments in the
venture capitalist and entrepreneur relationship: (i) disagreement; (ii) incompetence; (iii)
shirking; and (iv) opportunism. In particular, we are interested in how social environment,
defined as exposure to venture capital and business communities, affects venture
capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations.
This study is based on a self-report questionnaire survey conducted among 78 venture
capitalists in Finland and Sweden. Our results suggest that venture capitalists with strong
ties to their peers and local business communities plan to solve problems with portfolio
companies in a more active and constructive manner than their more isolated colleagues.
Our paper is one of the very first studies focusing on the management of unmet
expectations in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. As such, our paper takes a
preliminary step toward a better understanding of how the venture capitalist–entrepreneur
relationship faces disappointments so characteristic to most business relationships.
Interestingly enough, our study suggests that venture capitalists may nevertheless be
sensitive to the norms of the venture capital and business communities, despite their
extreme competitiveness with a tendency of being outliers. We suspect that this result may
reflect the willingness of investors to avoid such confrontations with entrepreneurs that
might tarnish their image in the eyes of the business and venture capital communities.
Furthermore, our study seems to contradict a commonly held belief in research on group
processes, according to which syndication might promote passivity among co-investors, as
the members of the investing team count on each others’ or the lead investor’s proactive
behavior (Early, 1989; Gifford, 1997; Olson, 1965).
Our findings are well in line with prior research suggesting that syndication relationships
improve the performance of venture capital firms in a variety of ways. Our study extends
this line of reasoning by proposing that syndication, or more generally, interaction with
peers may act as a channel through which attitudes and bbest practicesQ spread and get
reinforced. Interestingly enough, our study implies that syndication relationships exert a
much stronger influence on venture capitalists’ attitudes than venture capital experience.
We believe that this might be explained by the fact that norms are best transferred through
interaction with peers across organizational boundaries, rather than through years as
venture capitalist without such interaction. In a similar vein, syndication relationships may
offer venture capitalists a more accessible, day-to-day forum for learning than do seemingly
more distant venture capital associations. Finally, our results suggest that the managerial
identity of the past still matters in venture capitalists’ current role as investors, promoting
constructive and discouraging destructive approaches to unmet expectations.
The practical implications of this study are many. First, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to
understand that they are dealing with an active partner, not likely to overlook problems in
one of the portfolio companies. According to our study, entrepreneurs can expect more
sympathy and understanding from venture capitalists with strong ties to business and
venture capitalists communities, when problems in the venture capitalist–entrepreneurship

<-----Page 2----->A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

775

arise. For venture capitalists, the results of this study indicate that connections to and
interaction with their peers might also help them deal with disappointments so
characteristic to all business relationships in a more active and constructive way.

2. Introduction
Ever since the 1970s, a well-functioning venture capital industry has been regarded as
highly important for business development, and a key driving force behind a dynamic
economic sector. For many entrepreneurial ventures, the venture capitalists appear to be an
important bexternalQ resource. The prerequisite for the bvalue-added servicesQ provided by
the venture capitalists to their portfolio companies is the existence of an ongoing
cooperative relationship between the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur—a
relationship characterized by open and frequent communication (Sapienza et al., 1996).
Previous research indicates that cooperation between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs is far from ubiquitous (Sahlman, 1990; Fredriksen et al., 1997), and that tensions and
conflicts often arise in this relationship — conflicts that, if not solved in a proper manner,
could be disastrous for the success of the venture. Most of the studies focusing on the
bdark sideQ of the venture capitalist–entrepreneur interaction view contractual covenants as
a key to preventing and resolving problems emanating from this relationship (see, for
instance, Kaplan and Strömberg, 2000; Sahlman, 1990). However, not all the problems
between a venture capitalist and the entrepreneur fulfill the criteria of the breach of a legal
contract, nor can all the problems be addressed by contractual covenants. In this paper, we
seek to extend the analysis of relational problems beyond the scope of the breach of a legal
contract. We are concerned with four potential sources of disappointments, or deviations
from the psychological contract between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs (Rousseau,
1995): (i) disagreement; (ii) incompetence; (iii); shirking; and (iv) opportunism.
The basic assumption of this paper is that the venture capitalists’ social environment
will influence their responses to problematic situations. We define venture capitalists’
social environment as ties to the venture capital and business communities, such as
syndication relationships, interaction with venture capital associations, as well as prior
venture capital and business experience. Based on the social information processing, social
identity and social categorization theories, we expect that venture capitalists with strong
ties to their colleagues and business communities will respond to unmet expectations in a
more active and constructive manner than their more isolated colleagues. The study is
based on a self-report questionnaire survey conducted among 78 venture capitalists in
Finland and Sweden. As such, this is one of the very first studies focusing on the reactions
of venture capitalists to disappointments caused by the entrepreneurs.

3. Psychological contracts and unmet expectations in the venture
capitalist–entrepreneur relationship
The concept of a psychological contract has mainly been employed to describe the
disappointments and unmet expectations in the relationship between an organization

<-----Page 3----->776

A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

and its employees. However, it has been recently argued that the concept generalizes
to a wide variety of exchange relationships between individuals, individuals and
organizations, as well as between organizations (for a review, see Roehling, 1997). A
psychological contract has been defined as expectations about reciprocal obligations
composing an exchange relationship between the focal party and another party
(Levinson et al., 1962). Psychological contracts are perceptual and idiosyncratic in
nature in the sense that the expectations held by one party may or may not be shared
by the other party. In addition, psychological contracts are based on perceived
promises communicated through any means, such as a written document, contract, oral
discussion, or organizational practices (Morrison and Robinson, 1997; Rousseau,
1989).
In the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship, we may perceive the psychological
contract as a set of expectations about what each party is entitled to receive, and obligated
to give, in exchange for another party’s contributions. A common goal for both the venture
capitalist and the entrepreneur is to work together to maximize the value of the portfolio
company. In an ideal venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship, both parties exert
themselves fully and perform competently on behalf of the firm. In reality, either the
venture capitalist or the entrepreneur may fail to live up to the expectations of the other
party, an incident so characteristic to all human relationships.2
Following the logic of psychological contract literature, we may identify at least four
sources of dissatisfaction in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. First,
disagreements (inadvertent violations in Rousseau’s (1995) terms) refer to the situations
where both the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur are willing to keep their promises,
but fail to honor their commitments because of divergent interpretations, complexity and
ambiguity of obligations, or miscommunication. An example would be a disagreement
over the goals or strategies of a portfolio company. Second, incompetence (disruption in
Rousseau’s (1995) terms) refers to situations where the venture capitalists and the
entrepreneurs are willing to contribute their share, but are unable to do so. For instance,
the entrepreneur’s lack of ability may result in serious delays in product development or
in the loss of key employees of the firm. Third, shirking refers to one party not
exercising sufficient effort to carry out the task assigned to him or her. Shirking involves
a wide array of behaviors ranging from the failure of the entrepreneur to actively pursue
growth opportunities or recruit key personnel to missed deadlines or lower product
quality. Fourth, acting opportunistically implies seeking one’s own self-interest at the
expense of the other party and contrary to other party’s reasonable expectations.
Opportunistic behavior may be manifested in dishonesty or fraud in the entrepreneur’s
dealings with the company, possibly fulfilling the criteria of the breach of a legal
contract. In a less extreme case, we are speaking of an entrepreneur spending excessive
time and money on various perquisites, such as using the company’s expense account
more than is necessary. Prior literature refers to shirking and opportunism as reneging,
2

Whether or not this failure to live up to the expectations leads to a perceived unmet promise, perceived breach
of the contract, or a psychological contract violation depends on a host of contextual factors (Morrison and
Robinson, 1997; Rousseau, 1995). In our paper, we focus on situations where a venture capitalist perceives that
the entrepreneur has not been able to live up to his or her expectations.

<-----Page 4----->A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

777

denoting the refusal to fulfill the contract, albeit of being capable of doing so (Rousseau,
1995).3
Our four sources of disappointments derived from the psychological contract
literature play a key role in the prior venture capital literature and the agency theory
(see, for instance, Jensen and Meckling, 1976). Previous literature gives us a reason to
believe that the potential incompetence of the entrepreneur resulting from the adverse
selection mechanisms (Kaplan and Strömberg, 2000; Ruhnka and Young, 1987;
Sapienza and Gupta, 1994) may jeopardize the success of a portfolio company. In
addition, moral hazard taking the form of opportunism and shirking (Barney et al., 1994;
Gompers, 1997; Kaplan and Strömberg, 2000; Sahlman, 1990) may either lead to the
maximization of the private benefits of the entrepreneur at the expense of the venture
capitalist or to insufficient effort from the part of the entrepreneur. Divergent objectives
(Gompers, 1997; Sahlman, 1990; Sapienza and Gupta, 1994) may transform into
excessive risk-taking by the entrepreneur (Green, 1984; Cornelli and Yosha, 2003) or
disagreements over the direction of the development of a portfolio firm (Sorenson and
Stuart, 2001).

4. Venture capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations
Previous research distinguishes between four types of responses to unmet expectations
in an exchange relationship: exit, voice, loyalty and neglect (Hirschman, 1970; Farrell,
1983).
– Exit is a voluntary termination of the relationship (Rousseau, 1995) between the
venture capitalist and the entrepreneur. Exit is impersonal and indirect, and avoids faceto-face confrontation with the entrepreneur. In our study, exit may take the form of
replacing the entrepreneur or exiting the investment altogether.
– Voice refers to the actions of the victim to remedy, rather than to escape from or live
with an objectionable state of affairs. Voice can be graduated, all the way from faint
persuasion attempts to violent protests (Hirschman, 1970). Hagedoorn et al. (1999)
suggest that the voice option should be divided into two categories: Considerate voice
consists of attempts to solve the problem in collaboration with the other party, taking
into account the concerns of both parties. Aggressive voice consists of efforts to win,
without consideration for the concerns of the other party. It involves behaviors, such as
announcing your view and expecting changes to be made accordingly, or using your
power to resolve the problem your way. In the venture capital context, using aggressive
voice may include referring to legal contracts or working together with the board of
directors to get your point through.

3

We make a distinction between these two, since opportunism involves active self-serving behavior at the
expense of the other party to a relationship, whereas shirking is more passive, involving a failure to perform one’s
responsibilities. We believe that this distinction may prompt different responses from the dissatisfied partner to a
relationship.

<-----Page 5----->778

A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

– Loyalty or silence is a form of non-response. It involves passivity combined with
a feeling of optimism—patiently believing that things will improve without
intervention.
– Neglect involves the neglect of one’s duties to the detriment of the interests of the
partner (Rousseau, 1995).
According to the psychological contract literature, the exit, loyalty, voice and neglect
options differ from one another along two dimensions. The first dimension may be referred
to as constructiveness vs. destructiveness. Constructive responses, loyalty and considerate
voice, are intended to revive or maintain the problematic relationship. Destructive
responses, such as neglect, exit, and aggressive voice serve to end or destroy the
relationship. The second dimension indicates the activity vs. passivity of responses.
Activity is defined as dealing directly with the problematic situation, whereas passivity
denotes ignoring the problem all together. Exit and voice are, therefore, considered active
responses, whereas loyalty and neglect are passive responses (Hagedoorn et al., 1999;
Rousseau, 1995; Rusbult, 1987), as shown in Fig. 1.
According to Rousseau (1989, p. 129), bthe intensity of reaction is directly attributable
not only to unmet expectations, but also to more general beliefs about respect of persons,
codes of conduct, and other patterns of behavior associated with the relationships
involving trustQ (Robinson, 1996). Therefore, various actor-specific, relationship-specific
and context-specific factors may play a role in determining whether the venture capitalist
chooses to actively deal with the problem (considerate voice, aggressive voice or exit) at
hand instead of avoiding it (loyalty or neglect), or whether he or she decides to destroy a
problematic relationship (exit, aggressive voice or neglect) rather than trying to improve it
(considerate voice or loyalty). In this paper, we will mainly focus on the factors related to
the social context of the venture capitalist, while controlling for the impact of other
context, actor and relationship-specific variables. The factors related to the social context

include venture capitalists’ ties to the venture capital and business communities, defined as
syndication relationships, interaction with venture capital associations, and the prior
venture capital and business experience.

5. Social environment and venture capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations
The studies of social psychology and group processes in general and social information
processing, social identity and social categorization theories in particular seek to explain
the influence of social environment on individuals’ attitudes and behavior (Shah, 1998;
Terry and Hogg, 2000). The social information processing theory is instrumental in
describing the role of one’s social referents in attitude formation and behavior, whereas the
social identity theory and its close relative, the social categorization theory, focus on ingroup and out-group distinctions in social interaction. In the context of this study, the
social information processing theory helps us better understand how the ties of a venture
capitalist to the peer group (through syndication relationships, industry association
memberships and the length of experience as venture capitalist) shapes his or her reactions
to unmet expectations (Hypotheses 1a–3e). The social identity and social categorization
theories, in their turn, are helpful in analyzing the relationship between a venture capitalist
and an out-group (entrepreneurs) as a function of the venture capitalists’ prior business
experience (Hypotheses 4a–4e).
5.1. Influence of the peer group on venture capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations
(Hypotheses 1a–3e)
The social information processing model argues that the perceptions, attitudes and
behaviors of an individual are influenced by bsalient othersQ (Salanick and Pfeffer, 1978;
Rice and Aydin, 1991; Shah, 1998; Moscovici, 1976) through the diffusion and adoption
of norms characteristic to his or her peer group. Relative to the norms of the venture capital
community, the prior literature stresses the importance of venture capitalists’ active
participation in the management of portfolio companies (Gorman and Sahlman, 1989;
MacMillan et al., 1988). Venture capitalists serve as a sounding board to their portfolio
companies, monitor financial and operational performance, and assist in strategic and
operational planning, just to mention some of the bvalue-addedQ services provided by
venture capitalists (for a review, see Gorman and Sahlman, 1989; MacMillan et al., 1988).
Some other studies have found that venture capitalists are bfirefightersQ that allocate their
scarce time to portfolio companies with problems (Fredriksen et al., 1997).
Besides reinforcing active and repressing passive approaches, we assume that the
norms of the venture capital community promote constructive approaches and
discourage destructive approaches, when dealing with unmet expectations. Prior research
indicates that it is crucial for venture capitalists to retain a good reputation to signal their
trustworthiness and ability to potential investors (Gompers and Lerner, 1999, p. 239–
262), peers (Seppä, 2003), and potential investment targets (Smith, 1999). It has been
suggested that entrepreneurs select venture capitalists based on their reputation and this
may inspire venture capitalists to perform diligently and avoid opportunistic behavior

<-----Page 7----->780

A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

(Smith, 1998). Earning a reputation as a venture capitalist, who exits from an investment
as soon as problems arise or uses his power to get his way, is likely to make it more
difficult for the venture capitalist to attract the best entrepreneurial talent in the future. In
a similar vein, we believe that venture capital community is well aware of the link
between a maintaining good, ongoing relationship with portfolio companies and the
success of a venture (Sapienza et al., 1996). To sum up, we expect that the venture
capital community as a whole would encourage its members to engage in active and
constructive behaviors, while repressing behaviors with either destructive or passive
elements.
In this study, we assume that venture capitalists’ ties to the venture capital community
defined as syndication relationships, interaction with venture capital associations, and
length of experience as venture capitalist will diffuse norms characteristic to the venture
capital community and help investors in determining the boundaries of acceptable
behavior vis-à-vis entrepreneurs. First, intense interaction with peers associated with
syndicated investments may lead to the emergence of socially constructed perceptions and
behavior (Ibarra and Andrews, 1993; Roger and Kincaid, 1981). We believe that working
as a group may ease the identification and use of active approaches with problematic
entrepreneurs.4 In particular, shared responsibilities and joint effort provided by the
syndicate may reduce the time required for bdamage controlQ by a single venture capitalist.
Syndication may also improve the capability of a venture capitalist to deal with
problematic investments. For instance, prior literature suggests that the syndication
process provides an opportunity for venture capitalists to check their own evaluation of a
venture against the judgments of their peers, thus leading to better decisions and the
repression of escalation of commitment (i.e. neglect or loyalty) in badly performing
ventures (Birmingham et al., 2003). In addition, syndicating venture capitalists may also
feel social pressures to actively participate in the management of a portfolio company in
order to earn and maintain a good reputation as active investment managers in the eyes of
their co-investors.5 Working as a group, syndicating venture capitalists may also be better
able to resist the temptation of resorting to aggressive or destructive approaches, which
would tarnish their reputation in the market and prevent future collaboration with a
problematic portfolio company. Thus, we believe that syndicating venture capitalists will
be better able to avoid behaviors with either passive or destructive elements (such as

4
This argument may seem to contradict the literature on social loafing, referring to the reduced performance of
individuals who act part of group rather than alone (Latane et al., 1979). However, we do not believe that venture
capital syndicates create an optimal environment for social loafing. Most importantly, prior research indicates that
small groups, such as venture capital syndicates, generally provide one or more of their members enough
economic incentives to see that the collective good is provided even if a single member has to carry the full cost
of achieving this benefit. In addition, small groups may also provide social incentives that lead their members to
work toward the achievement of collective goods (Olson, 1965). It is also important to note that one of the
investors in the syndicate typically acts as a lead investor assuming the main responsibility for the management of
the venture. We admit that social loafing may be more of a problem among those syndicate members that are not
lead investors. Future studies should thus pay more attention to social loafing among lead investors compared to
other syndicate members.
5
Gifford (1997) discusses more in-depth the trade-off between focusing on problematic ventures as opposed to
saving time to more promising portfolio companies and investment prospects.

loyalty, neglect, aggressive voice and exit) and favor active and constructive behaviors
(considerate voice).6,7
Hypothesis 1a. Syndication is positively associated with the tendency to use considerate
voice.
Hypothesis 1b. Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use aggressive
voice.
Hypothesis 1c. Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use the exit
option.
Hypothesis 1d. Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use the neglect
option.
Hypothesis 1e. Syndication is negatively associated with the tendency to use the loyalty
option.
Second, social information processing model and prior empirical literature calls
particular attention to the professional associations and their potentially profound role in
shaping the behavior and attitudes of their members through the development of closer
collaborative links among organizations within an industry (Coleman et al., 1966; Rusaw,
1995). According to the home pages of the Finnish Venture Capital Association, its
objective is bto develop venture capital activities and practices in Finland, . . .to provide a
forum for the exchange of views and experiences between the members, . . .to arrange
courses and seminars and assist in improving professional practice. . .Q (FVCA, 2003). In a
similar vein, national and European-level venture capital associations organize luncheons
where venture capitalists can network, as well as provide training courses, and publish
ethical guidelines on proper code of conduct (Bushrod, 2003; Cowley, 2003). In the
context of our study, we expect that the venture capitalist associations are instrumental in
6
In this paper, we make an assumption that venture capitalists are likely to avoid behaviors containing either
destructive or passive elements. In other words, we assume that venture capitalists are likely to avoid exit (active–
destructive combination) despite its active dimension, since this option would mean destroying one’s relationship
to the entrepreneur and potentially ruining one’s reputation within the business community. In a similar vein,
venture capitalists are likely to avoid loyalty (passive–constructive combination) despite its constructive
dimension, because failing to react to problems in a portfolio company might tarnish their reputation within the
venture capital community. It would be also possible to argue that venture capitalists were more likely to avoid
neglect (passive/destructive combination) than exit and aggressive voice (active and destructive combination) or
loyalty (passive/constructive combination). However, we settle for making a distinction between negative and
positive interrelationships, not predicting the extent of a negative impact.
7
Our hypotheses are partly in line with the bescalation of commitmentQ hypothesis put forward by Birmingham
et al. (2003), according to which syndication decreases escalation of commitment in badly performing ventures.
In a similar vein, we predict an adverse relationship between syndication, neglect and loyalty. However, contrary
to Birmingham et al. (2003), we predict an adverse relationship between exit and syndication. The reason for this
deviation is that Birmingham et al. (2003) largely ignore the role of venture capitalists’ willingness to maintain
and improve their relationships with portfolio companies, even with the disappointing ones. As explained in
Footnote 6, we expect that this relationship orientation of a venture capitalist would manifest itself in the
avoidance of responses containing either passive or destructive elements, such as exit. In addition, the study of
Birmingham et al. (2003) considers only exit and passive approaches as venture capitalists’ responses to unmet
expectations, whereas our study also analyzes the use of voice in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship.

<-----Page 9----->782

disseminating the values characteristic to the venture capital community and in assisting
venture capitalists facing problems in their daily work, such as disappointments caused by
the entrepreneurs. For instance, the guidelines of European Venture Capital Association to
its members stress the importance of active participation in the management of portfolio
companies by saying bGood management of an investment is essential if a fund is to
maximize its returns. Value in an investment can be wasted and opportunities missed if this
part of the investment process is not undertaken properly. The principles of acting with due
skill, care and diligence, and managing conflicts of interest effectively are particularly
relevant in this contextQ (EVCA, 2003, p. 40). As an example of the promotion of
constructive approaches to solving problems with entrepreneurs, European Venture Capital
Association recommends meeting with the management of a troubled portfolio company
to agree jointly on a remedial action plan (EVCA, 2003, p. 43). To sum up, we believe that
the reinforcement of constructive and active approaches and the repression of behaviors
with either passive or destructive elements will best serve the interests of the venture
capital associations seeking to build solid and long-lasting relationships with the
surrounding business community. Thus, we hypothesize
Hypothesis 2a. Interaction with venture capital associations is positively associated with
the tendency to use considerate voice.
Hypothesis 2b. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to use aggressive voice.
Hypothesis 2c. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the exit option.
Hypothesis 2d. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the neglect option.
Hypothesis 2e. Interaction with venture capital associations is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the loyalty option.
Third, we believe that the length of experience as venture capitalist may promote the
internalization of norms and attitudes characteristic to the venture capital community, thus
encouraging the use of active and constructive approaches and discouraging destructive or
passive approaches, when dealing with problematic entrepreneurs. Experienced venture
capitalists are likely to have been exposed to more intensive interaction with their
colleagues than their less experienced counterparts. This intensive interaction is likely to
contribute to the emergence of homogeneous attitudes and behavior (Burt, 1987; Rogers,
1995). In addition, we expect that experienced venture capitalists are more likely to
understand the crucial role of an ongoing cooperative relationship with the entrepreneur in
promoting the success of a venture (Landström et al., 1998; Sapienza et al., 1996), and the
reputation of the investor within the business community (Smith, 1998, 1999). Thus, we
hypothesize that prior experience as venture capitalist is positively associated with active
and constructive approaches, and negatively associated with responses containing either
destructive or passive elements.
Hypothesis 3a. Venture capital experience is positively associated with the tendency to
use considerate voice.

Hypothesis 3b. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with the tendency to
use aggressive voice.
Hypothesis 3c. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with the tendency to
exit.
Hypothesis 3d. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with the tendency to
use the neglect option.
Hypothesis 3e. Venture capital experience is negatively associated with the tendency to
use the loyalty option.
5.2. Influence of business experience on venture capitalists’ responses to unmet
expectations (Hypotheses 4a–4e)
Social identity and social categorization theories (see, for instance, Tajfel and Turner,
1986; Turner, 1985) argue that people classify themselves as belonging to various social
categories according to demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, socioeconomic
status, interests, skills, or occupation. In-group and out-group distinctions are drawn
around social categories in a way that helps an individual to maintain high selfesteem.8 As a result, people enhance their evaluations of fellow in-group members, and
degrade their evaluations of out-group members (Hogg and Abrams, 1993; Tajfel et al.,
1971).9 Given the large number of groups to which an individual may belong, his or
her social identity may be an amalgam of identities (Ashforth and Mael, 1989; Brewer,
1993). These multiple identities may pose inconsistent demands upon a person, for
instance, a venture capitalist may primarily identify himself or herself with the venture
capital profession, but still relate to entrepreneurs because of his prior business
experience.
According to the social categorization theory, the availability of more than one
categorization may dilute the meaningfulness of in-group–out-group differentiation
(Vanbeselaere, 1987). Thus, we expect that venture capitalists with prior business
experience are likely to view entrepreneurs as more trustworthy, honest and collaborative
than venture capitalists without business experience. Therefore, venture capitalists with
start-up or managerial experience should be more sympathetic to the situation of the
entrepreneur and more likely to use constructive, rather than destructive approaches. Also,
we expect that business experience will make the venture capitalist more knowledgeable
about the antecedents and the potential cures of the problem and thus, more capable and
active in solving the problem with the entrepreneur. Venture capitalists without prior
business experience, in their turn, might form more negative impressions of the

A social group can be defined as a collection of individuals who perceive themselves to be members of the
same social category, share some emotional involvement in this common definition of themselves, and achieve
some degree of social consensus about their evaluation of the group and their membership of it (Hoggs and
Abrams, 2001).

According to the minimal group paradigm, a mere fact of being categorized as a group member might be
enough to produce in-group bias and out-group discrimination (Tajfel et al., 1971).

entrepreneurs, judging them dishonest, incompetent or untrustworthy. These negative
impressions may lead to a lesser degree of willingness to work on the troubled
relationship’s behalf. Therefore, the prior business experience of the venture capitalist will
encourage the tendency to use active and constructive approaches, i.e. considerate voice,
and discourage the tendency to use destructive or passive approaches, such as exit,
aggressive voice, loyalty and neglect.
Hypothesis 4a. Business experience of the venture capitalist is positively associated with
the tendency to use considerate voice.
Hypothesis 4b. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use exit.
Hypothesis 4c. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use aggressive voice.
Hypothesis 4d. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the neglect option.
Hypothesis 4e. Business experience of the venture capitalist is negatively associated with
the tendency to use the loyalty option.

6. Method
6.1. Data collection
Before data collection, we interviewed several venture capitalists, entrepreneurs,
and lawyers to ensure that venture capitalists truly perceive disappointments caused
by the entrepreneurs in terms of the psychological contract literature reviewed earlier
in this paper.10 We asked the interviewees to describe disappointments they had
experienced in prior venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationships and their ways to
respond to unmet expectations. These discussions gave us reason to believe that the
disagreements over the goal of the portfolio companies, as well as perceived
incompetence, shirking and opportunism of the entrepreneur are common causes of
disappointments in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. In a similar vein, we
asked the venture capitalists to assess our selection of responses to unmet expectations
based on the psychological contract literature (Hagedoorn et al., 1999). In addition to exit,
loyalty, considerate voice, aggressive voice and neglect, our interviewees emphasized the
role of written contracts and working through the board of directors, when solving
problems with entrepreneurs. These suggestions were integrated to the final version of the
questionnaire.

10

In Finland and the United States, we randomly selected two venture-backed firms in both countries and
interviewed a total of four entrepreneurs, four venture capitalists and two lawyers involved in the investment
process. In addition, we interviewed two more lawyers in Finland and Sweden, and two more Swedish venture
capitalists. The results of these case studies are reported in Smith and Parhankangas (2000).

Instead of addressing the questionnaire to individual venture capital companies, we
chose to contact all investment managers of the Swedish and Finnish venture capital firms.
This deviation from the traditional approach in venture capital research is likely to improve
the quality of the findings since the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship is more
likely to be based on the interaction between the individuals, i.e. the investment manager
and the entrepreneur, than on the interaction between organizations (the venture capital
firm and the portfolio company). We used the listings of the venture capitalists published
on the homepages of Swedish and Finnish Venture Capital Associations (2003), an
existing database of Swedish venture capitalists (see Karaömerlioðlu and Jacobsson, 2000)
and interviews of industry experts to identify venture capitalists to be included in our
study. The process of data gathering in Sweden and Finland took place in Spring 2001. A
total of 294 investment managers were included in the study. After three waves of
mailings, we received responses from 78 investment managers in 50 venture capital firms,
adding up to a response rate of 27%. A comparison of venture capital firms in the study
and non-participants reveal no significant difference in the number of employees, total
capital, and the number of portfolio companies.
6.2. Context and sample
We chose Sweden and Finland as a research setting for their high degree of cultural,
social and historical homogeneity (Autio et al., 2000) and the opportunity to include the
whole venture capital industry in our survey. The Swedish venture capital industry
essentially was founded in the 1970s, when the Swedish Government and the most
prominent Swedish banks established the first venture capital firm. The first venture
capital boom occurred in the early 1980s, but after a shake out period of the late 1980s,
most of the venture capitalists exited the industry. In 1992, the Swedish Government
intervened in the venture capital market by creating two large investment companies with a
venture capital focus. Through the remainder of the 1990s, new investors began to find the
market attractive, due to a dramatic growth in high technology sectors, an increase in
capital supply in general, and an introduction of new stock markets for young firms.
Today, the Swedish venture capital industry is recovering from the crash of the dot.com
industry in the early 2000s.
The Finnish venture capital industry is somewhat less established than its Swedish
counterpart, but its evolution follows a rather similar pattern. The first Finnish venture
capital firm was established in 1967 by the Finnish government. Its primary goal was not
to pursue phenomenal financial returns, but rather to develop Finland’s financial system.
By 1990, a total of 30 venture capital companies were established, of which as many as 17
were governmental venture capital companies. Instead of investing in technologically
ambitious early stage prospects, the venture capital firms had chosen solid cash-generating
businesses, such as real estate targets. It was not until the late 1990s, that the industry
expanded and assumed a role of more established international venture capital industries
(Seppä, 2000).
Our typical respondent works in a venture capitalist firm founded in the early 1990s,
has been working as venture capitalist for approximately 6 years and managed a total of 14
portfolio companies during his or her career. The average investment size is 1.86 million

<-----Page 13----->786

A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

euros (roughly equivalent to $2.07 million in 2001), with no statistically significant
difference between the Finnish and Swedish samples. We found that the rejection rate of
business plans is higher (92.57%) in Sweden than in Finland (87.95%), p = 0.04. In a
similar vein, debt funding is much more common in Finland (54.33%) than in Sweden
(14.20%), p = 0.000. It seems that both Finnish and Swedish venture capitalists make
investment in various industry sectors, such as biotechnology and pharmaceuticals,
electronics, computer hardware, medical devices, software and information services, as
well as retailing and consumer products.
6.3. Measures
6.3.1. Independent variables
Following Manigart et al. (2002), we calculated the ratio of syndicated investments by
dividing the total number of syndicated investments by the total number of investments
made by the venture capitalist. The frequency of interaction with national and European
venture capital associations was measured using a 6-point scale ranging from 1 bless than
once a quarterQ to 6 beverydayQ (Sapienza and Gupta, 1994). Venture capital experience
was measured as years as venture capitalist. Business experience was operationalized as
managerial and operational experience. Managerial experience refers to the number of
years in a general managerial position in a company. Operational experience is measured
as a number of years in research and development, production, or marketing and sales
functions, including also managerial experience within these functions (Sapienza and
Gupta, 1994).
6.3.2. Dependent variables
In our questionnaire, we asked the venture capitalist to describe their most likely
behavior (exit, loyalty, neglect, considerate voice and aggressive voice) in four
hypothetical situations, referring to disagreements, incompetence, shirking and opportunism. A more detailed description of the scenarios can be found in Parhankangas and
Landström (2004). The tendency to use of neglect, exit, loyalty, considerate voice and
aggressive voice was operationalized using a set of statements modified from
Hagedoorn et al. (1999) and Rusbult et al. (1988), as shown in Appendix A. Consistent
with previous literature, the respondents were allowed to choose more than one of these
options as their response to disappointments caused by the entrepreneur. It has been
suggested that the Exit–Voice–Loyalty–Neglect options are in fact continuous and
overlapping to some degree (Rusbult, 1987). Also, the related conflict management
literature suggests that rather than using a single conflict management strategy
independently, people tend to adopt configurations of conflict management strategies
(Munduate et al., 1999).
In order to investigate whether the five responses to unmet expectations were not only
theoretically, but also empirically separable, we carried out factor analyses using a
principal component method. Based on the theoretical assumptions and a scree test, we
settled for a five-factor solution using Quartimax with Kaiser Normalization as a rotation
method. Following the theoretical assumptions, the five factors could be labeled neglect,
exit, loyalty, considerate voice and aggressive voice. Items defining a factor were those

<-----Page 14----->A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

787

with structure coefficients greater than 0.65. To improve face validity, some items were
dropped, because they did not load on the factor they were supposed to, as explained in
Appendix A.11 Cronbach’s a values of the scales were satisfactory, ranging from 0.67 to
0.90.
6.3.3. Control variables
Prior literature on psychological contracts and venture capital investments gives us
reason to believe that it is necessary to control for several context-specific,
investment-specific and relationship-specific factors when testing the aforementioned
hypotheses. First, we controlled for country (context)-specific variation in venture
capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations (Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2002; Sapienza et
al., 1994). Second, we controlled for several investment-specific factors. For instance,
the average investment size relative to total invested capital represents the perceived
size of the loss for a venture capitalist unable to cash on his or her investment in the
portfolio company, and thus potentially affecting his or her responses to unmet
expectations (Rusbult et al., 1988; Rusbult, 1987). In a similar vein, prior literature
gave us a reason to believe that problems in the venture capitalists–entrepreneur
relationship may vary depending on the preferred investment stage of a venture
capitalist (Norton and Tenenbaum, 1993; Manigart et al., 2002). Therefore, we split
the sample into early-stage and later-stage investments following the example of
Manigart et al. (2002).12 We also assumed that domestic investments are associated
with more intense venture capitalist–entrepreneur interaction than foreign investments,
thus promoting active and constructive approaches (Hirschman, 1970). The frequency
of foreign investments was measured using the percentage of foreign portfolio
companies as a proxy. In addition, we controlled for some special characteristics of
the Nordic venture capital markets by including the level of debt funding in the
analysis (operationalized as a percentage of cases where the venture capitalist invests
also as a creditor).
Third, prior literature highlights the importance of relationship quality as a key
determinant of an individual’s response to dissatisfaction in a personal or business
relationship (Rusbult et al., 1988; Rusbult, 1987). Following Zaheer et al. (1998),
relationship quality was measured using three statements (Cronbach’s a = 0.70) relative
to degree to which the venture capitalist’s past relationships with entrepreneurs have
been conflict-free (e.g. bOur relationships to our portfolio companies have been
11
As a result, our constructs for exit, aggressive voice, considerate voice, loyalty and neglect are somewhat
different depending on the scenario used. This may be partly explained by the fact that our four scenarios are
different in nature and provoke different responses among venture capitalists. To ensure the stability of our results,
we also tested the hypotheses using uniform measures of exit, aggressive voice, considerate voice, loyalty and
neglect (by dropping items 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19) across the four scenarios. However, this change did not alter
the results reported in this paper.
12
The classification of European Venture Capital Association distinguishes between four investment stages: 1,
seed financing; 2, start-up; 3, growth (expansion); 4, replacement capital and buyout. A sum was calculated by
adding these numbers and dividing them by the total number of investments stages the venture capitalist invests
in. The sample was then split up between early stage (with a mean of 2.5 or lower) and later stage investors (with
a mean of 3 or higher).

<-----Page 15----->788

harmoniousQ). In addition, we controlled for the frequency of disappointments in the
venture capitalists’ past relationships with portfolio companies, assuming that even a
one-time disappointment early in the relationship may taint future perceptions. Finally,
prior research gives us reason to believe that the venture capitalist’s reaction may be
dependent on whether he or she is dealing with disagreements, incompetence, shirking
or opportunism (Rousseau, 1995; Morrison and Robinson, 1997; Parhankangas and
Landström, 2004). These four scenarios differ from one another at least in terms of
their voluntariness and the extent to which it is possible to impair the unsatisfactory
state of affairs (Turnley and Feldman, 1999). It has been shown that the venture
capitalists show more understanding and more frequently use constructive responses
when the problems are perceived to be beyond the control of the entrepreneur
(incompetence and disagreements over the strategy of the portfolio company). In a
similar vein, prior research gives reason to believe that venture capitalists most often
use destructive approaches in situations where they perceive that the problem with the
portfolio company is caused by rather permanent irreparable flaws of the entrepreneur,
i.e. lack of character or skills (opportunism or incompetence) (Parhankangas and
Landström, 2004).
Our measures of relationship quality, average investment stage and four types of
disappointments were constructed on the portfolio level because of our focus on social
environment in venture capitalists’ attitudes and behavior, as well as our reliance on a
scenario survey method. It should be noted, however, that venture capitalists’ attitudes
may vary a great deal depending on their perceptions of a particular portfolio company.
Our measures are thus reflections of the relationship characteristics between a venture
capitalist and an baverageQ company in his or her portfolio.

7. Results
In our questionnaire, we asked the venture capitalists to indicate how often they had
encountered disappointments from the part of the entrepreneur. Our results show that
disagreements and incompetence occur in as often as 60% of the cases. Shirking and
opportunism were present in approximately 40% and 30% of the investments, respectively.
These results seem to confirm that our four types of disappointments are, indeed, an
integral part of the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship.
Table 1 presents the Pearson correlations among the dependent, independent and
control variables.13 The inter-correlations among the independent variables were

elimination procedure are reported. The hypothesized relationships were tested separately
for four types of disappointments.
Our results confirm that syndication is positively associated with considerate voice and
negatively associated with aggressive voice in three out of four scenarios, thus supporting
Hypotheses 1a and 1b. Hypothesis 1c predicting a negative relationship between
syndication and the exit option was corroborated for all four scenarios. We found partial
evidence for Hypothesis 1d in the form of an adverse relationship between syndication and
the tendency to use the neglect option in the disagreement and opportunism options.
Finally, Hypothesis 1e proposing an adverse relationship between syndication and the
loyalty option was rejected.
Our data partly supports Hypotheses 2a and 2b, according to which interaction
with the venture capital associations is positively associated with considerate voice
and negatively associated with aggressive voice, respectively. Hypotheses 2c and 2e
stating that interaction with venture capital associations would decrease the venture
capitalist’s tendency to resort to the exit and loyalty options was confirmed in
three out of four scenarios. Hypothesis 2d proposing a negative relationship
between interaction with venture capital associations and the neglect option was
rejected.
Relative to Hypothesis 3a and 3b, we found that venture capital experience was
negatively associated with considerate voice and aggressive voice in two out of four
scenarios. Table 2 also reveals a positive relationship between venture capital
experience and exit. Hypothesis 3a, 3b and 3c were thus rejected. Hypothesis 3d
stating that venture capital experience is adversely associated with neglect was supported in three out of four scenarios. Finally, our data gives no support to Hypothesis
3e proposing an adverse relationship between venture capital experience and
loyalty.
In line with Hypothesis 4a, operational experience was positively associated with
considerate voice when dealing with shirking and opportunistic entrepreneurs. Hypotheses
4b and 4d predicting an adverse relationship between managerial experience, exit and
neglect were confirmed for disagreement and opportunism scenarios. Hypotheses 4c and
4e assuming a negative relationship between the managerial experience, aggressive voice
and loyalty were confirmed in three out of four scenarios. Hypothesis 4d assuming a
negative relationship between managerial experience and the neglect option was
confirmed in all scenarios.
Relative to our control variables, we found that Swedish venture capitalists are
more likely to use the exit option and less likely to use considerate voice than
their Finnish colleagues. Average investment size was adversely related to
considerate voice and loyalty. Foreign investments seem to promote loyalty and
neglect. The use of debt capital was positively associated with considerate and
aggressive voice. Except for the relationships reported above, we detected either no
relationship or inconsistent relationships between the control variables and
dependent variables across the four scenarios. This inconsistency across the four
scenarios gives us an additional reason to believe that it is important to control for
a type of a disappointment, when examining venture capitalists’ responses to unmet
expectations.

<-----Page 21----->794

A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

To summarize our results, we found relatively strong support for Hypotheses 1a–
1e, stating that syndication relationships encourage constructive and active approaches,
while inhibiting destructive responses to unmet expectations. Relative to Hypotheses 4a–
4e, we found some evidence suggesting that the business experience is positively
associated with considerate voice, while discouraging aggressive voice, neglect and exit.
Interaction with the national venture capital association, in turn, is negatively associated
with exit and loyalty options (Hypotheses 2c and 2e). In a similar vein, we received
partial support for the Hypothesis 2b stating that interaction with venture capital
associations encourages considerate voice and discourages aggressive voice. Finally, we
found little support for Hypotheses 3a–3e predicting that venture capital experience
promotes constructive and active behaviors, while discouraging destructive or passive
approaches.
A closer examination of Tables 1 and 2 reveals that the predicted relationships appear
only in the regression analyses, but fail to come across in correlation analyses. This gives
us reason to believe that investors’ responses are governed by various contextual factors.
Without controlling for those factors, it is impossible to predict the reactions of an
individual to disappointments in business relationships.

8. Conclusions and discussion
Our study proposes that venture capitalists with strong ties to their peers and with
prior managerial identity tend to solve problems with the portfolio companies in a more
active and constructive manner than their more isolated colleagues. Our study
contributes to the growing stream of international venture capital research in a variety
of ways. First, it is one of the very first studies focusing on the management of unmet
expectations in the venture capitalist–entrepreneur relationship. As such, our paper takes
a preliminary step toward a better understanding of how the venture capitalist–
entrepreneur relationship handles the disappointments so characteristic to most business
relationships. Second, this far, the psychological contract literature has been mainly
concerned with the characteristics of the parties to an exchange relationship, the
relationship between them, and the nature of disappointment when explaining human
responses to disappointments in business relationships (Robinson, 1996; Rousseau,
1995; Rusbult, 1987). Our paper extends the psychological contract literature by
analyzing the effect of the social environment on the reactions of an individual to unmet
expectations. Third, prior literature has primarily used social information processing,
social identity and social categorization theories to shed light on the emergence of workrelated attitudes (see, for instance, Chatman and Flynn, 2001; Flynn et al., 2001), the
evolution of inter-group relations within one organization (Ibarra and Andrews, 1993;
Rice and Aydin, 1991) and in cross-cultural settings (Pornpitakpan, 1999; Salk and
Shenkar, 2001). To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies applying these theories
to the entrepreneurship literature in general (Smeltzer et al., 1991) and venture capital
literature in particular. It is also interesting to note that our findings on the social
embeddedness of venture capitalists’ attitudes and behavior resonate with the
institutional theory, (Di Maggio and Powell, 1983; Bruton and Ahlstrom, 2002) more

<-----Page 22----->A. Parhankangas, H. Landström / Journal of Business Venturing 21 (2006) 773–801

frequently applied to analyzing the behavior of organizations than individuals within
them.14
Interestingly, our study suggests that venture capitalists may nevertheless be sensitive to
the norms of the venture capital and business communities, despite their extreme
competitiveness and a tendency of being outliers. We suspect that this result may reflect
the willingness of investors to avoid such confrontations with entrepreneurs that might
tarnish their image in the eyes of the business and the venture capital communities. Apart
from this explanation, syndication may make exiting the investment more difficult through
an escalation of commitment among co-investors. The escalation of commitment may
stem from the difficulty of admitting failure in the presence of co-investors, the emergence
of bgroup thinkQ within the syndicate or contractual sanctions imposed by syndicating
partners on those who decide to walk out of the syndicate (Guler, 2002). Furthermore, our
study seems to contradict a commonly held belief in research on group processes,
according to which syndication might promote passivity among co-investors, as the
members of a syndicate count on each other’ or the lead investor’s proactive behavior
(Gifford, 1997; Early, 1989; Olson, 1965).
Our findings are well in line with the previous research suggesting that syndication
relationships improve the performance of venture capital firms in many ways (see, for
instance, Bygrave, 1987; Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Manigart et al., 2002). Our study
extends this line of reasoning by proposing that syndication, or more generally, interaction
with other venture capitalists may act as a channel through which attitudes and bbest
practicesQ spread and get reinforced. Interestingly enough, our study implies that
syndication relationships exert a much stronger influence on venture capitalists’ attitudes
than venture capital experience. We believe that this might be explained by the fact that
norms and best practices of the venture capital industry are best transferred through
interaction with peers across organizational boundaries, rather than through years as venture
capitalist without such interaction. It is also possible that sheer venture capital experience
makes investors overconfident in their own capabilities and reputation (Shepherd et al.,
2003), thus promoting passivity and explaining the adverse relationship between using
voice and venture capital experience reported in our study. In addition, syndication
relationships may offer venture capitalists a more accessible, day-to-day forum for learning
than seemingly more distant venture capital associations, possibly explaining our failure to
find an association between interaction with professional associations and venture
capitalists’ responses to unmet expectations. Finally, our results suggest that the managerial
identity of the past still matters in the venture capitalists’ current role as an investor,
promoting constructive and discouraging destructive approaches to unmet expectations.
The practical implications of this study are many. First, it is crucial for entrepreneurs to
understand that he or she is dealing with an active partner, not likely to overlook problems
14

Institutional theory focuses on the behavior of organizations, as one of the core ideas of this theoretical
framework is that organizations take on lives of their own, divorced from the particular individuals and managers
within them. This study, however, is not at the organizational level of analysis. Rather, we focus on the attitudes
and behavior of venture capitalists (as individual actors and decision makers) not on the behavior of venture
capitalist firms. Therefore, theories explaining the behavior of an individual in their social context seemed to be
more appropriate as explanatory frameworks.

<-----Page 23----->796

in one of the portfolio companies. According to our study, entrepreneurs can expect more
understanding and sympathy from venture capitalists with strong ties to business and
venture capitalists communities when problems arise. In particular, our findings suggest
that venture capitalists with a CEO background will be more likely to solve problems in
collaboration with entrepreneurs, and less likely to resort to aggressive voice, exiting or
ignoring problems altogether than their colleagues without such experience. In a similar
vein, venture capitalists investing as part of a syndicate tend to adopt more constructive
and active approaches to conflict resolution than their more isolated colleagues. For
venture capitalists, our findings indicate that connections to their peers may help them deal
with disappointments so characteristic to all business relationships in a more active and
constructive way. This gives us a reason to believe that recruiting investors with business
experience and encouraging interaction with peers may help venture capital firms build
more harmonious relationships with entrepreneurs.

9. Limitations and suggestions for future research
The use of self-report questionnaires may have prompted a willingness to appear
as bsocially acceptableQ among our respondents, thus exaggerating their willingness to
compromise with disappointing entrepreneurs. Second, some other researchers have
addressed the question of how conflict, defined as cognitive or emotional friction,
affects the performance of the portfolio company (Higashide and Birley, 2001).
However, to our knowledge, no study to this date has attempted link the conflict
resolution strategies to the performance of a portfolio company. Third, an interesting
avenue of future research would be adopting the entrepreneur’s point of view when
analyzing the dissatisfactory aspects of the investor–entrepreneur interaction. Fourth,
prior research (Kaplan and Strömberg, 2000; Sahlman, 1990) and the agency theory
highlight the importance of contractual covenants in solving problems in the venture
capitalist–entrepreneur relationships. A future study could explore whether the social
environment exerts an impact on the completeness of the venture capital contracts,
and venture capitalists’ tendency to exert contractual rights. Finally, our study focuses
on two culturally homogeneous Nordic countries characterized by a relatively high
degree of individualism (Hofstede, 1984). Therefore, we suspect that our results
would apply to other countries with individualistic cultures (Early, 1989), i.e. most
countries in Europe and Northern America. However, a more detailed study is called
for to examine the cross-cultural differences in conflict resolution in the venture
capitalist–entrepreneur relationship.
