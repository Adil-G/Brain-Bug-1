ABSTRACT
We review the progress of naturalistic decision making (NDM) in the decade since the
®rst conference on the subject in 1989. After setting out a brief history of NDM we
identify its essential characteristics and consider ®ve of its main contributions: recognition-primed decisions, coping with uncertainty, team decision making, decision
errors, and methodology. NDM helped identify important areas of inquiry previously
neglected (e.g. the use of expertise in sizing up situations and generating options), it
introduced new models, conceptualizations, and methods, and recruited applied investigators into the ®eld. Above all, NDM contributed a new perspective on how decisions
(broadly de®ned as committing oneself to a certain course of action) are made. NDM
still faces signi®cant challenges, including improvement of the quantity and rigor of its
empirical research, and con®rming the validity of its prescriptive models. Copyright #

The study of decision making is studded by three-letter acronyms designating sub-disciplines which evolved
partly as extensions of preceding sub-disciplines, and partly as a reaction to them: the once-popular CDM
(Classical Decision Making), BDT (Behavioral Decision Theory), JDM (Judgment and Decision Making),
ODM (Organizational Decision Making), and, most recently, NDM (Naturalistic Decision Making). The
emergence of each sub-discipline can be conveniently traced to the publication of books or papers signifying
the time at which theory and research pursued more or less in isolation gathered suf®cient mass and coherence
to attract wider attention. CDM can be traced to Bernoulli (1738) and, more recently, to Savage (1954) and von
Neumann and Morgenstern (1944). BDT and JDM have their origins in Edwards (1954) and Meehl (1954).

ODM can be traced to Simon (1957), March and Simon (1958), and Cyert and March (1963). Finally, NDM
goes back to Klein et al. (1993). A decade has now passed since the conference that produced the last-named
volume, a suf®ciently long period to take stock of NDM: its essential characteristics, strengths, weaknesses,
and future prospects. After drawing a historical sketch of NDM, we present its essential characteristics and
examine critiques of its theoretical bases, methodology, and contributions, focusing on ®ve areas: recognitionprimed decisions, coping with uncertainty, decision errors, team decision making, and decision aiding and
training. We close the paper by drawing some conjectures regarding the future directions of NDM.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF NDM
The NDM framework was initiated in 1989 in a conference in Dayton, Ohio, sponsored by the Army Research
Institute. The conference enabled some 30 behavioral scientists working in academic and non-academic institutions to discover that they shared many common themes, regardless of domain. One theme was the importance of time pressure, uncertainty, ill-de®ned goals, high personal stakes, and other complexities that
characterize decision making in real-world settings. Although these factors were dif®cult to replicate in the
laboratory, they needed to be understood (Orasanu and Connolly, 1993). A second theme was the importance
of studying people who had some degree of expertise; novices were never used in the study of the type of highstakes tasks that were of interest (Pruitt et al., 1997). A third theme was that the way people sized up situations
seemed more critical than the way they selected between courses of action (Klein, 1993).
In the past ten years there has been an increasing amount of interest in NDM. The 1989 conference (Klein
et al., 1993) was followed by a second conference (Zsambok and Klein, 1997) held in 1994 and attended by
approximately 100 researchers. A third NDM conference was held in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1996 (Flin
et al., 1997), and a fourth conference was held in Warrenton, Virginia, in 1998 (Salas and Klein, in press).
In addition to the edited volumes emerging from each conference, Flin (1996) has written about the
issues facing critical incident managers, Klein (1998) has described the work of his research group, and
Cannon-Bowers and Salas (1998) edited a book describing the research program sponsored by the US Navy
in the aftermath of the Vincennes incident. Finally, Beach (1997) surveyed NDM from the vantage point of
his own work on Image Theory, a model that is aligned with the NDM framework. In addition to these
publications, the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society established a technical group in 1995, called
`cognitive engineering and decision making', partly as an outlet for research and development along the lines
of NDM. As of 1998 there were more than 500 members, making it one of the largest technical groups in the
Society.
ESSENTIALS OF NATURALISTIC DECISION MAKING
NDM is an attempt to understand how people make decisions in real-world contexts that are meaningful and
familiar to them. Ful®lling this `mission' produced research marked by ®ve essential characteristics: pro®cient decision makers, situation±action matching decision rules, context-bound informal modeling, process
orientation, and empirical-based prescription. These particular characteristics were derived by locating the
place of NDM in the study of decision making based on Rasmussen's (1997) observation that
In several human sciences [including decision research], a trend is found in modeling behavior: Efforts
are moving from normative models of rational behavior [e.g., CDM], through efforts to model the
observed rational behavior by means of models of the deviation from rational [e.g., JDM], toward focus
on representing directly the actually observed behavior [e.g., NDM], and ultimately to efforts to model
behavior generating mechanisms [i.e., models of system constraints, opportunities and criteria, e.g.,
ODM] (p. 75, material in brackets added by us).

Granted that reconstruction of history inevitably ®nesses subtle twists and turns in the actual turn of
events, Rasmussen's sequence does fairly well (ODM in fact preceded NDM and ®ts into Rasmussen's
sequence only in terms of the move from individual to system-wide models). Our historical perspective suggests that one way of deriving the essential characteristics of NDM is to examine its differences from CDM,
the preceding phase in Rasmussen's sequence.
The essential characteristics of CDM were (1) choice (conceptualizing decision making as choosing
among concurrently available alternatives, e.g. Dawes, 1988; Hogarth, 1987), (2) input±output orientation
(focusing on predicting which alternative will, or should be, chosen given a decision maker's preferences:
Funder, 1987), (3) comprehensiveness (conceptualizing decision making as a deliberate and analytic process
that requires a relatively thorough information search (Beach and Mitchell, 1978, Payne et al., 1990),
particularly for optimal performance (Gigerenzer and Todd, 1999; Grandori, 1984), and (4) formalism
(the development of abstract, context-free models amenable to quantitative testing, e.g. Coombs et al.,
1971). The history of decision research consists of the gradual replacement of these characteristics,
beginning with doubts regarding their effects on the descriptive validity of CDM and culminating in
the replacement of all four by other characteristics for descriptive as well as prescriptive purposes in
NDM.
Doubts regarding the validity of the rational choice model as a valid description of human decision
making probably preceded the work of Simon and his associates at Carnegie-Mellon University. However,
their contribution was seminal because it went beyond just pointing out that the informational requirements
(i.e. comprehensiveness) entailed in the model exceed limited human cognitive capacities. Through
the concept of bounded rationality, which points to attention as the scarce resource in human
decision making, Simon et al. showed that people's systematic deviations from the rational choice
model make sense from an adaptive perspective: under bounded rationality thoroughgoing information
processing is exhausting, and potentially futile. A second, and just as important though less publicized,
proposition of the Carnegie School was an attack on the prescriptive validity of the Rational Choice
model. As Simon (1978) suggested, real-world problems are typically loosely coupled, allowing
decision makers with bounded rationality to attend to them effectively in a sequential fashion. Thus,
effective adaptation does not require comprehensive analysis. Instead, all that are required are a
modest intellectual capacity, an ability to detect and prioritize problems, and the ability to learn from experience.
JDM/BDT further undermined the descriptive validity of CDM, showing that people tend to deviate
systematically from the rational choice model even when presented with relatively simple tasks which do
not severely tax bounded rationality (Kahneman et al., 1982). However, JDM/BDT retained the essential
characteristics of CDM and adhered to its normative models as standards for evaluating decision quality.
Thus, Elimination by Aspects (Tversky, 1972), Prospect Theory (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), and
Einhorn and Hogarth's (1986) Ambiguity Model, as three representative examples, are all formal choice
models that describe which alternative is chosen from an available set of alternatives based on different
comparison schemes. In addition, JDM/BDT texts prescribe Multi-Attribute Utility (MAU)-like and Subjective Expected Utility (SEU)-like procedures (Russo and Schoemaker, 1987) and `de-biasing' procedures for
correcting deviations from these models (Fischhoff, 1982).
Going beyond JDM/BDT's criticism of CDM, NDM replaced all the four essential characteristics of the
latter identi®ed above. Comprehensive choice was replaced by matching, input±output orientation was
replaced by process orientation, and context-free formal modeling was replaced by context-bound informal
modeling. It is fair to say that these characteristics followed once researchers within the NDM framework
embarked on the construction of descriptive models of pro®cient decision makers in natural contexts without
relying on normative choice models as starting points. Following the emphasis on bounded rationality of the
Carnegie School, NDM places the human (and hence boundedly rational) pro®cient decision maker at its
center of interest and as its basis for prescription.

Pro®cient decision makers
In the decade since the ®rst NDM conference in 1989, the de®nition of NDM has changed. It is marked by
a shift in the relative emphasis placed on expertise and features of ®eld settings in which decisions are
made. The original de®nition proposed by Orasanu and Connolly (1993) emphasized the shaping
features of the contexts in which many decisions of interest were made: ill-structured problems, uncertain,
dynamic environments, shifting, ill-de®ned, or competing goals, multiple event-feedback loops, time constraints, high stakes, multiple players, and organizational settings. Expertise was included as a secondary
factor.
By the time of the second NDM conference, an alternative de®nition had emerged. Zsambok (1997, p. 4)
distinguishes NDM in terms of the decision maker, positing that `NDM is the way people use their experience to make decisions in ®eld settings'.
Pruitt et al. (1997) went one step further, and concluded that the primary factor de®ning NDM studies is
expertise:
[I]t is possible to answer the question of knowing an NDM study . . . by looking at how the study handles
the subject's prior experience . . . Does the study treat prior experience as a nuisance variable (one to be
controlled, counterbalanced, or otherwise ignored) or does it view this variable as the focus of inquiry?
We would argue that CDM [BDT, and JDM] do the former and NDM does the latter . . . [T]he strength of
NDM is its emphasis on experience and knowledge which already is present in the subject. Looking back
at the short de®nition of Zsambok [above]. . . . we believe that the inclusion of `in ®eld settings' is only
secondary (pp. 37±38).
Still, we cannot ignore the in¯uence of ®eld settings because they establish the eliciting conditions for making decisions and shape decisions through their constraints and affordances. `Expertise' is about these ®eld
settings.
Granted that NDM is concerned with pro®cient decision makers, namely people with relevant experience
or knowledge in the decision-making domain who rely on their experience directly, the remaining four essential characteristics of NDM follow:
 Process orientation: In contrast to input±output orientation, NDM models do not attempt to predict which
option will be implemented, but describe the cognitive processes of pro®cient decision makers. This
difference in orientation has important implications for validation (Funder, 1987). To be valid, NDM
models have to describe what information decision makers actually seek, how they interpret it, and which
decision rules they actually use. This is another reason why NDM models tend not to be formal, and
especially not abstract. Initial studies of the process by which experts make decisions have yielded the
next distinguishing feature.
 Situation±action matching decision rules: Matching is a generic label for decisions with the
basic structure of `Do A because it is appropriate for situation S' (Lipshitz, 1994). The study of
pro®cient decision makers leads to modeling decision making as matching rather than choice. Numerous
studies have consistently shown that pro®cient decision makers typically make decisions by various
forms of matching and not by concurrent choice (i.e. `Do A because it has superior outcomes to its
alternatives'). For example, Newell and Simon (1972) modeled the decision making of expert
chess players as a system of nested matching rules, March (1982) suggested that decisions in
organizational contexts follow the logic of obligation (which dictates what is appropriate for persons
in speci®c roles to do in speci®c situations), and Carroll and Payne found that parole of®cers
make decisions by matching candidate features to different prototypes of offenders (Carroll,
1980). Matching differs from concurrent choice in three respects. (1) Options are evaluated
sequentially one at a time. Evidence exists that even when presented with several options, decision
makers quickly screen most of them by comparing them against a standard, rather than with one

another, and then focus on one, or at most two, options, which are compared (Beach, 1993; Montgomery,
1988). (2) Options are selected or rejected based on their compatibility with the situation (Endsley, 1997;
Klein, 1998; Pennington and Hastie, 1993), or the decision maker's values (Beach, 1990) rather than on
their relative merits. (3) The process of matching may be analytic but more often it relies on pattern
matching and informal reasoning (Cohen et al., 1996; Klein, 1998; Lipshitz, 1993; Pennington and Hastie,
1986). Some of these variations are discussed in more detail in the section on recognition-primed
decisions below.
 Context-bound informal modeling: As noted above, pro®cient decision making is driven by experiencetied knowledge. This puts a limit on the utility of abstract formal models for two reasons: (1) expert
knowledge is domain- and context-speci®c (Ericsson and Lehman, 1996; Smith, 1997); (2) decision
makers are sensitive to semantic as well as syntactic content (Wagenaar et al., 1988; Searle, 1995). For this
reason NDM models depict what information decision makers actually attend to and which arguments
they actually use, particularly if they are designed for applied purposes (e.g. Cohen and Freeman, 1997;
Crandall and Getchell-Reiter, 1993).
 Empirical-based prescription: JDM and BDT derive prescriptive models from normative models which
stand upon explicit formal proofs of optimization believed to be independent of the descriptive validity of
these models. This means that `ought' can be divorced from `is', namely that solutions can be prescribed
irrespective of the intended recipient's ability to perform them. NDM researchers believe that `ought'
cannot be divorced from `is': prescriptions which are optimal in some formal sense but which cannot be
implemented are worthless. This leads to empirical-based prescription, namely deriving prescriptions
from descriptive models of expert performance. The goal of empirical-based prescription, then, is to
improve feasible decision makers' characteristic modes of making decisions (e.g. sequential single-option
evaluation), rather than replacing them altogether, by basing prescription on demonstrations of feasible
expert performance.
Empirical-based prescription is consistent with the observation, noted in the section on context-bound
modeling, that decision makers in natural settings use situated content-driven cognitive processes to
solve domain-speci®c problems by taking concrete actions (Klein et al., 1993). This implies that
empirical-based prescription is valid only under conditions that permit the development of true expertise
(e.g. the availability of repetitive tasks and valid feedback; Shanteau, 1992). In addition, it implies three
tradeoffs with clear methodological implications. First, there is a tradeoff between the generality of prescriptive models and their applicability. Since general models are by de®nition non-speci®c, they are likely to
be misinterpreted (Reason, 1990) or fail to match critical requirements peculiar to the problem at
hand (Smith, 1997). Second, structural models that specify the general functional relationships among
variables, and which are tested, however validly, in laboratory studies, do not provide information on
how to change X in order to achieve change in Y. For example, a model which speci®es that decision effectiveness is a function of the optimality of information search is not informative as to how information search
can be optimized in a particular task situation. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the theoretical value of models and research methods and the `actionability' of the knowledge that they provide (i.e. its usefulness as
guide for action; Argyris, 1993). Finally, while formal analytic models can yield optimal solutions with great
precision and rigor, they can also be inef®cient owing to the cognitive effort which they require (Beach and
Mitchell, 1978), their poor compatibility with decision makers' problems (Humphreys and Berkeley, 1985;
Smith, 1997) and the non-analytic cognitive processes which decision makers typically use (Hammond,
1993).
Although a number of models fall within the NDM framework (Lipshitz, 1993), it is fair to say that the
RPD model (Klein, 1993, 1998) can serve as the prototypical NDM model. The next section goes into some
detail on the RPD model to illustrate the essential characteristics of this approach and how a naturalistic
account is used in research.

RECOGNITION-PRIMED DECISION MAKING
The RPD model was developed on the basis of cognitive task analyses of ®re®ghters (Klein et al., 1989). The
initial research was designed to better understand how experienced commanders could handle time pressure
and uncertainty. The purpose of this research was not to challenge traditional decision making but to conduct
a descriptive inquiry. The investigators hypothesized that under time pressure, commanders would not be
able to generate a large set of response options, but would be likely to fall back on a simple comparison
between a favored option and a comparison option. Probe question-based interviews were conducted with
more than 30 ®re®ghters with an average of 23 years of experience, to obtain retrospective data about 156
highly challenging incidents. The data suggested that in most cases the commanders were not comparing any
options. They were typically carrying out the ®rst course of action they identi®ed. This raised two questions:
how could the commanders rely on the ®rst option they considered, and how could they evaluate a single
option, without the decision maker comparing it to any others?
The model was formulated by synthesizing the descriptions provided by the commanders themselves. In
its current form, the RPD model has three variations. In the simplest variation of the model, a decision maker
sizes up a situation and responds with the initial option identi®ed. The hypothesis is that skilled decision
makers can usually generate a feasible course of action as the ®rst one they consider, which answers the ®rst
question above, about how commanders could rely on the ®rst option they considered. In this variation,
experience provides prototypes or functional categories. This is different from retrieving analogues, although
some analogical reasoning may be involved. Skilled decision makers perceive situations as typical cases
where certain types of actions are typically appropriate, and are usually successful.
The second variation (which emerged from a similar type of study with commanders of AEGIS cruisers,
conducted by Kaempf et al., 1996), describes what happens if the situation is not clear. Here, the skilled
decision maker will often rely on a story-building strategy to mentally simulate the events leading up to
the observed features of the situation. This type of strategy has been described by Pennington and Hastie
(1993) and by Klein and Crandall (1995).
The third variation describes how decision makers can evaluate a course of action without comparing it to
others, which is the second question raised above. The evaluation is conducted by mentally simulating the
course of action, to see if it will work, and to look for unintended consequences that might be unacceptable.
De Groot (1965) referred to this strategy as progressive deepening.
These three variations depend heavily on expertise. In the ®rst variation, expertise provides a sense
of typicality that allows decision makers to quickly categorize situations and to recognize how to react
as an aspect of the categorization. In the second variation, expertise is needed to construct the mental
models needed to ®nd one explanation more plausible than another. In the third variation, expertise
is de®ned as an ability to mentally simulate a course of action in a situation, and anticipate how it will play
out.
The three variations explain how decision makers can handle the constraints and stressors often found in
®eld settings. Under extreme time pressure, the ®rst variation will result in reasonable reactions without the
need to perform any deliberations or analyses. Under uncertainty, the second variation describes how the
plausibility of alternative stories can help a decision maker choose an interpretation, and categorize a situation. Under shifting conditions, the decision maker is prepared to react quickly, without having to re-do
analyses. When faced with ill-de®ned goals, the decision maker is not stymied because the RPD model is
aimed at working forwards, from existing conditions, rather than backwards, from goal states. Patel and
Groen (1986) and Larkin et al. (1980) have shown that people with greater expertise are more likely to
use forward-chained reasoning, whereas novices and intermediate subjects usually rely on backwardchained reasoning.
The initial ®ndings of the research with ®re®ghters have been replicated several times, by different
research teams (see Klein, 1998, for a review). These studies have been conducted with naval surface ship

commanders, tank platoon leaders, wild®re as well as urban ®re commanders, design engineers, offshore oil
installation managers, infantry of®cers, and commercial aviation pilots. The data have been coded for different types of decision strategies, and the RPD strategy has usually been shown to be the most common,
representing 80±95% of the cases. Only with very inexperienced decision makers does the proportion fall
below 50%.
Klein (1998) has described some of the boundary conditions for the RPD model. It appears to hold when
there is reasonable experience to draw on, when the decision maker is under time pressure, and when there is
uncertainty and/or ill-de®ned goals. The RPD strategies are less likely to be used with highly combinatorial
problems, in situations where justi®cations are required, and in cases where the views of different stakeholders have to be taken into account.
The RPD model has been used to generate testable hypotheses. One con®rmed prediction was that extreme
time pressure would have a minimal effect on chess masters, as compared with mediocre players.
Calderwood et al. (1988) showed that the proportion of poor moves was basically the same for chess masters
playing actual games, regardless of whether the games were played using regulation time (40 moves in 90
minutes) or blitz conditions (5 minutes total for the game). The mediocre players showed a sharp increase in
poor moves under time pressure. A second prediction is that skilled chess players could generate a reasonable move as the very ®rst one they considered. Klein et al. (1995) obtained think-aloud protocols from both
mediocre and skilled chess players working on a series of dif®cult chess problems. Grandmaster ratings of
these positions showed that only 1/6 of the legal moves were considered adequate. The ®nding from the
think-aloud protocols was that 4/6 of the actual ®rst moves considered were adequate, according to the
grandmaster criteria. Clearly, the subjects were not generating courses of action by randomly selecting from
the pool of legal options. They were using their expertise to generate a good move as the ®rst one they considered. We are not aware of any decision theories that predict the opposite, that people randomly generate
options, so this is not a critical experiment. Nevertheless, the ®ndings do contribute to our understanding of
how expertise can in¯uence decision-making strategies. The result has implications for prescriptions such as
multi-attribute utility analysis. If a moderately experienced person can generate a workable option as the ®rst
one considered, there may be reduced incentives and bene®ts from generating and evaluating additional
courses of action.
COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY
The attributes that Orasanu and Connolly (1993: see above) identi®ed as characteristics of natural decision
making can be clearly linked to the uncertainty and stress that accompany the making of consequential decisions in naturalistic settings (the exception being `organizational settings'). The RPD model accounts for the
fact that pro®cient decision makers perform reasonably (and at times exceptionally) well under these conditions by their effective use of pattern matching, forward-directed reasoning, and storytelling. Two NDM
models which focus on how decision makers cope with uncertainty, the RAWFS heuristic (Lipshitz, 1997a;
Lipshitz and Strauss, 1997) and the Recognition/Meta-cognition (R/M) model (Cohen et al., 1998), elaborate
these and suggest additional strategies.
The RAWFS heuristic addresses three questions: (1) How do decision makers conceptualize uncertainty?
(2) How do they cope with uncertainty? (3) Are there systematic relationships between different conceptualizations of uncertainty and methods of coping? Lipshitz and Strauss began by de®ning uncertainty in the
context of action as `a sense of doubt that blocks or delays action', an inclusive de®nition which is consistent
with Dewey (1933), and accommodates the numerous de®nitions of uncertainty in the JDM/BDT as well as
ODM literatures. The de®nition is also supported by ®ndings that people evaluate `decisions' as `certain',
`active', `quick', and `strong', and uncertainty as `passive', `slow', and `weak', on a set of semantic scales
(Teigen, 1996). Using this de®nition, Lipshitz and Strauss identi®ed three principal forms of uncertainty in

retrospective reports of decision making under uncertainty: inadequate understanding (a sense of having an
insuf®ciently coherent situation awareness), lack of information (a sense of having incomplete, ambiguous,
or unreliable information), and con¯icted alternatives (a sense that available alternatives are insuf®ciently
differentiated). (Orasanu and Fischer, 1997, proposed a similar conceptualization based on observations of
commercial airplane crews.)
In addition, Lipshitz and Strauss found ®ve principal strategies of coping with uncertainty: reducing
uncertainty (e.g. by collecting additional information); assumption-based reasoning (®lling gaps in ®rm
knowledge by making assumptions that go beyond directly available data); weighing pros and cons (of at
least two competing alternatives); forestalling (developing an appropriate response or response capabilities
to anticipate undesirable contingencies); and suppressing uncertainty (e.g. by ignoring it or by relying on
unwarranted rationalization). Similar lists of coping strategies were reported by Allaire and Firsirotu
(1989), Janis and Mann (1977), Klein (1998), and Shapira (1995).
Cross-tabulation of the three types of uncertainty with the ®ve strategies of coping revealed that inadequate understanding was principally associated with reduction, lack of information was principally associated with assumption-based reasoning, and con¯icted alternatives were principally associated with
weighing pros and cons. Forestalling and suppression were equally likely to be used with all three types
of uncertainty. Integration of these ®ndings with several models of naturalistic decision making produced
the RAWFS heuristic (the acronym designates the ®ve coping strategies), a descriptive model of how decision makers cope with uncertainty.
Although the RAWFS heuristic is descriptive, the logic of its pattern of contingent coping has a certain
normative ¯avor: begin by trying to reduce uncertainty by collecting additional information (`hard facts'),
use assumptions to ®ll gaps in understanding if that's not feasible, compare the merits of competing alternatives if more than one is available, retain a back-up alternative to guard against undesirable contingencies,
and resort to suppression only as a last resort.
The Recognition/Metacognition (R/M) model explicates the prescriptive facet that is implicit in any
descriptive model of deliberate goal-directed action (Cohen et al., 1996). Similar to the RPD model, the
R/M model assumes that naturalistic decision making relies primarily on pattern matching (Cohen et al.,
1996). Different from the RPD model, the R/M model focuses on what happens when recognition fails: if
stakes are high and time is available, decision makers revert to assumption-based reasoning which, as elaborated in the model, consists of meta-cognitive processes of critical thinking by which decision makers
identify and correct gaps in situation awareness and action plans owing to incomplete or con¯icting information, inconsistent goals, and unwarranted assumptions.
The R/M model served Cohen and his associates in the development of a generic prescriptive procedure
which they labeled STEP (Construct a Story, Test, Evaluate and Plan; Cohen and Freeman, 1997; Cohen
et al., 2000). STEP can be applied to improve performance on any decision task that involves perceptual
input. For example, based on interviews with active-duty naval of®cers on their experiences in the Persian
Gulf, the Gulf of Sidra, and elsewhere (Kaempf et al., 1996), Cohen and his associates developed a training
program for decisions that concern hostile intent in ambiguous situations (i.e. whether or not to engage an
approaching air or sea contact whose intent is unknown under conditions of undeclared hostility). This program illustrates how a descriptive model of pro®cient performance (the R/M model) can be used for prescriptive purposes.
 Story Even pattern-matching that yields only vague recognition generates a tentative assessment
regarding the nature of the situation, which can be enhanced by construction of a complete Story that
recounts past, present, and future events consistent with it. The ®rst component of the Hostile Intent STEP
module trains of®cers in the construction of such stories.
 Test Stories are used to test the plausibility of initial assessments by comparison of implications and
expectations derived from them with what is known or observed about the situation. When evidence

appears to con¯ict with an assessment, stories are revised to incorporate all available information into the
most complete and plausible account possible. The second component of STEP trains decision makers to
spot and correct gaps in stories owing to incomplete evidence and unwarranted underlying assumptions.
 Evaluate In the third phase of STEP, decision makers are trained to use a devil's advocate technique in
which an infallible `crystal ball' repeatedly insists that the current assessment is wrong and asks for an
explanation. When adjusted stories require too many unwarranted assumptions, decision makers may
begin the STEP cycle again with an alternative assessment.
 Plan Similar to Forestalling in RAWFS, a back-up best model or plan is available to decision makers
using STEP at any moment, quali®ed by awareness of its strengths and weaknesses. The ®nal component
of STEP trains decision makers to plan against the possibility that the current best response is wrong.
Similar to RAWFS, STEP captures tactics that decision makers use to cope with uncertainty, without relying
on a normative model. Its prescriptive validity has been tested in ®ve different studies (Cohen et al., 1996;
Cohen and Freeman, 1997), which showed statistically signi®cant improvement in the outcomes of the decision-making process due to training, as estimated by agreement of assessments and actions with those of
experts in the subject matter.
Uncertainty is intimately linked with error: the greater the uncertainty, the greater the probability of making an error. It is thus not surprising that decision errors attracted the attention of NDM researchers (Klein,
1993; Orasanu et al., 1993). More signi®cantly, the treatment of errors is an important issue that distinguishes NDM from BDT.

THE CONCEPT OF ERROR
Within the framework of BDT, errors are operationally de®ned as failures to adhere to normative models
such as Expected Utility theory and Bayesian statistics. Analytical normative models of optimal choice provide BDT with a basis for detecting errors as well as an engine for conducting research on `judgmental
biases' which produce sub-optimal decisions. By contrast, NDM lacks analytical criteria that serve as signposts for error. The absence of an analytic normative foundation led Doherty (1993) to claim that `naturalistic decision making is simply silent on what constitutes an error' (p. 380). Doherty has raised three
challenges to the NDM community (Lipshitz, 1997b): (1) What constitutes an error? (2) Has NDM made
any positive contribution to the understanding of error? (3) Can NDM researchers detect decision errors
without the bene®t of hindsight?
Rather than denying the reality of errors, ®eld researchers have given careful study to disasters such as
Three Mile Island, Bhopal, airline crashes, and the like. The Vincennes shoot-down was one of the prime
stimuli for the initiation of the NDM movement. For NDM researchers, an error is a useful concept inasmuch
as it serves as a ¯ag alerting us to possibilities where performance can be improved. However, under different
conditions, it makes more or less sense to talk about errors. And under some situations, talking about error
can be misleading. Therefore, in response to question 1, in situations where there are performance standards,
and where skilled personnel show consistent use of strategies, we can use these strategies and methods as a
basis for comparison and evaluation (while still allowing for the possibility that a departure from the methods
used by experts can be an innovation rather than an error). It may also be useful to study the compensations
when a person makes a departure from a preferred method. In many ®eld settings, standards do not exist.
Here, errors may have to be initially identi®ed through poor outcomes rather than through processes, as it
may be more useful to study the factors that in¯uenced the outcome rather than trying to quantify an error
rate.
Instead of prescribing reasoning strategies, NDM considers processes such as ineffective attention
management and inadequate problem detection, which are likely to result from factors such as workload

and lack of experience. Further, NDM uses the decision processes of experts as yardsticks for sub-standard
performance which can be detected without the bene®t of hindsight and as goals for emulation (e.g. STEP
above). Obviously, there are domains such as stock selection where `experts' do not perform particularly
well. Shanteau (1992) examined the conditions under which expertise leads to superior performance, a
necessary condition for adopting experts' behavior as a normative standard in NDM. Thus, years of
experience and formal titles are not a guarantee of expertise.
The answer to Doherty's second question, whether NDM has made any positive contribution to the
understanding of error, is that the understanding of human error is one of the cornerstones of the NDM framework. Woods and Cook (1999) have described the wide range of cross-disciplinary investigations into
human error. While it is beyond the scope of this article to review this body of work, we can at least mention
the study of Reason (1990) on latent failures, and that of Rasmussen (1987) on the distinctions between
errors made at different levels of cognitive processing. Rasmussen (1997) describes the organizational forces
that typically result in a movement toward the boundaries of safe performance. From this perspective,
research on errors has been an important opportunity for the ®eld of NDM to study the linkages between
different types of causal factors. Instead of tracing bad outcomes to human error as the end of the inquiry,
NDM researchers have learned to treat human errors as the beginning of the investigation. They are less
likely to attribute the error to faulty reasoning strategies, preferring to use the error as an indicator of poor
training or dysfunctional organizational demands, or ¯awed design of a human±computer interface in order
to reduce the likelihood of errors. While BDT generally tries to understand error as the result of faulty
decision processes and reliance on fallible heuristics, NDM generally tries to understand error in a broader
context, including insuf®cient experience. In complex settings, there are times when alternative courses of
action need to be considered, and times to proceed with the ®rst reasonable option. As people gain experience, and develop richer mental models, they gain the ability to anticipate problems, and to judge when to
perform workarounds from the of®cial procedures.
According to Tversky and Kahneman (1974), people are forced to rely on heuristics because of faulty
intuitions regarding probabilistic phenomena, in addition to insuf®cient processing capacity. These heuristics
can result in errors, and it may be tempting to explain some types of error in terms of inappropriate use of
heuristics. Nevertheless, we should be cautious in attributing errors to the use of heuristics. Klein (1989)
showed that the attribution of decision biases in the Vincennes shoot-down was ad hoc. The same base rate
bias would have been used regardless of whether the error was to shoot down a commercial airliner or to fail
to shoot down an attacking Iranian ®ghter. Therefore, there are times when BDT may rely on hindsight just as
NDM does in addressing errors in ®eld settings. If we follow BDT and assert that error is the result of faulty
decision processes, it becomes important to ®nd ways to reduce or eliminate errors. However, the NDM view
(e.g. Lipshitz, 1997b) is that in unstable settings, people may ®nd it adaptive to use errors as a means of
learning. A striving for error-free performance may be maladaptive in such settings. The commission of
errors per se is not necessarily a problem. We need to consider the consequences of errors, not just the reasoning processes.
The structure of the situation may further mitigate the effects of `faulty' reasoning. Shanteau (1992)
described a situation in which physicians exhibited decision biases, but in this natural setting the constraints
of practice make the impact of those biases negligible. Therefore, BDT and NDM have made different sorts
of contributions to our understanding of error. BDT has worked at the level of micro-cognition to investigate
the nature of error; this work entails carefully controlled experiments. NDM researchers have worked at the
macro level to understand the ecology of errors; this work entails a concern for applications.
Doherty's third question was whether NDM researchers could detect decision errors without the bene®t of
hindsight. The reason why BDT is able to de®ne errors without hindsight is that it can de®ne optimal choices,
and optimal choice strategies. However, Klein (in press) argues that the concept of optimization is only
meaningful in the context of a tightly controlled setting, where the task is for the subject to arrange the
information that has been given. Any attempt to broaden the task may render meaningless the calculation

of optimal choice. Allowing subjects to seek additional information creates an in®nite regress because the
subject has to estimate the costs and bene®ts of the effort required in information seeking, prior to seeking it,
and then must estimate the costs and bene®ts of estimating those costs and bene®ts, and so forth. Allowing
subjects to consider real consequences requires an exhaustive cataloguing and calibrating of values, looking
at long-term goals as well as immediate goals, and constructing simulations of future states marked by
considerable ambiguity and uncertainty. BDT researchers clearly recognize these problems. However, in
criticizing NDM research, Doherty appears to suggest that BDT can de®ne decision errors in natural settings
without hindsight. This is a different matter from setting up controlled studies where errors can be prede®ned. We would place the burden of proof on the decision analysis community, to demonstrate that it
has tools for de®ning decision errors in a broad range of natural settings, without hindsight.
NDM AND TEAMS
Decision making has been traditionally studied at three levels: individual, group, and organizational. Our
focus so far has been on the contribution of NDM to theory and research at the ®rst of these levels. We
now turn our focus to its contribution at the next level. As teams play critical roles in accomplishing complex, dif®cult, and often dangerous tasks, NDM researchers focused their attention on answering two questions: (1) What is effective team decision-making (Orasanu and Salas, 1993; Orasanu, 1997)? (2) What turns
a team of experts into an expert team (Salas et al., 1997)? These questions were aimed at understanding how
decision making evolves and matures in teams comprised of members with distributed knowledge, information, and expertise. However, NDM scientists were conceptually ill prepared to answer these questions.
Why? We elaborate below.
The focus of NDM work was on application and not on theory building. While some could argue that ®rst
you need to understand and observe how teams make decisions in order to build a team decision-making
theory, in fact one needs both. The observations shape the theory and the theory guides the way one studies
team decision making in complex environments. NDM researchers have tended to rely on theories and frameworks from other disciplines (e.g. industrial/organizational psychology, social psychology, cognitive psychology, and engineering). This has served as a good point of departure, and new conceptual developments
have emerged directly from the NDM paradigm. This includes concepts such as team situation-awareness
(Salas et al., 1995), shared problem assessment (Orasanu, 1997), team mind (Klein, 1998), and shared
mental models (Cannon-Bowers et al., 1993). These concepts have advanced our understanding of decision
making in complex environments.
For example, team situation-awareness (SA) is crucial for effective decision making. In fact, research
has demonstrated that obtaining and maintaining SA in teams is far more complex than in individuals.
Team SA is achieved, for example, when team members collect and exchange information earlier and
plan farther in advance (Orasanu, 1994) and when team members engage in closed-loop communication.
Shared mental models are thought to provide team members with a shared understanding of the task,
who is responsible for what, and what the information needs and requirements are. This understanding
allows team members to anticipate each other's needs without overt strategizing. Research has shown that
teams that possess shared mental models exhibit better communication and better planning, and improve
their team decision-making performance (Volpe et al., 1996; Stout et al., 1999). While this NDM-based
research has generated some rich theoretical notions, there are two additional important contributions of this
research.
First, NDM has brought renewed focus to studying teams in context. While this kind of research had been
going on for some time (see Hackman, 1990; Foushee, 1984), NDM researchers became more convinced that
to understand team decision-making, it had to be studied in its natural environment. This approach, of
course, led in turn to a number of conceptual, methodological, and practical problems.

For example, studying teams in context is expensive, labor-intensive, dif®cult, and frustrating. Results do
not come overnight. While these dif®culties are not necessarily unique to team research, there are some additional burdens. It takes a team to study teams in context. Tremendous resources and commitment by all
involved (sponsors, users, researchers, managers) are required to study teams in context. It takes the conviction, which most NDM scientists and practitioners endorse, that to enhance team decision-making one has to
understand the problems teams confront, the environment and situations they encounter, and the nature of
their tasks (see Cannon-Bowers and Salas, 1998; Orasanu, 1997; Salas et al., 1997).
We now know what teamwork consists of (McIntyre and Salas, 1995). Teamwork enables effective team
decision making. It is the process by which team members seek, exchange, and synchronize information in
order to decide on a course of action. McIntyre and Salas (1995) de®ned teamwork as `inclusive of the
activities that serve to strengthen the quality of functional interactions, relationships, cooperation, communication and coordination of team members' (p. 27). They concluded that teamwork is constituted of a
¯exible set of behaviors, namely adaptability, shared situational awareness, performance monitoring and
feedback, leadership, and closed-loop communication (i.e. the exchange of successful information from
one team member to other team members), all of which have been shown to contribute to effective team
decision-making (Cannon-Bowers and Salas, 1998).
We also know how to enhance team decision-making performance. That is, we know how to turn a team of
experts into an expert team. Many interventions can be used to enhance team performance. For example,
Cannon-Bowers et al. (1995) explored the ef®cacy of a variety of instructional strategies (i.e. task simulation,
role training, guided practice, lecture, passive demonstration, and role-playing). More speci®cally,
they identi®ed which instructional strategies would be most effective based upon the context, the
task, and the team. Recent research has also uncovered which interventions work and which do not
(e.g. Cannon-Bowers and Salas, 1998). The US Navy's multimillion-dollar Tactical Decision Making
Under Stress (TADMUS) research program afforded researchers the opportunity to examine theories of
decision making in depth (see Collyer and Malecki, 1998, for an overview of the program). Brie¯y, the
interventions introduced were aimed at increasing overall skill levels, introducing trainees to stress
during training, and targeting skills which were vulnerable to decay. Findings from this series of
studies can be used to help guide future efforts in NDM concerning teams. Speci®cally, many lessons
have been learned with respect to conducting large-scale NDM-based team behavioral research
(Salas et al., 1998).
We also know a great deal about aircrews, ®re®ghting teams, and medical teams (Zsambok and Klein,
1997). Aircrews in particular have been studied extensively over the past several decades. Variables such
as personality types, status differentials, and speech patterns have been examined to determine their effects
on decision making (Orasanu and Salas, 1993). These studies have yielded a vast amount of information,
which can be drawn upon for the study of other types of teams. For example, the effects of status differential
would almost certainly yield similar results in a surgical team where a tenured surgeon was leading a procedure and less experienced surgeons were assisting.
A second contribution of NDM to teams is the current research aimed at designing, developing, and testing
better and richer research tools. We know that we need much better methods and tools to capture the complexity of team performance in context. For example, research efforts are in progress to develop cognitive
task analysis tools and procedures for teams (Klein, in press; Blickensderfer et al., in press). Also, NDM
scientists are working on ways to develop and test knowledge elicitation techniques to evaluate shared cognition in teams (Cooke et al., 1997). Efforts are likewise being made to improve how we capture team performance in context (Cannon-Bowers and Salas, 1997) and how we can study teams in laboratory settings
and still have enough con®dence to generalize the ®ndings to the ®eld (Bowers et al., 1992; Jentsch and
Bowers, 1998; Johnston et al., 1998).
We have discussed the dilemma of rigor versus relevance that confronts NDM researchers who wish to
achieve rigor without the arti®cial context of controlled laboratory experimentation. For example, the key to

performing rigorous experiments on decision making in BDT is the availability of a de®nition for optimal
choice. However, if this concept is not meaningful in natural settings, as we have argued above, the models
and methods of BDT may be similarly restricted.
In sum, the NDM paradigm has focused our attention on real teams performing real tasks in real settings.
Further, NDM has required research focused on the process by which decisions are made and how information between team members is communicated and coordinated. And so some progress has been made in
understanding team performance due to the NDM paradigm. The next section addresses, accordingly, two
topics: the range of methods used by NDM researchers, along with their rationales, and the question of rigor
as applied to these methods.
METHODOLOGY AND RIGOR IN NDM
Understanding decision making in complex natural environments requires methods devoted to illuminating
the roles of domain knowledge, perceptual and cognitive processes, and situation, task, and information
management strategies. Most research is conducted in the ®eld, drawing on methods from anthropology,
ethnography, cognitive science, and discourse analysis. Efforts typically begin with descriptions of the phenomena, without prejudging what is or should be important to study. Descriptive approaches allow the
researcher to examine phenomena in their natural contexts rather than leaping to premature attempts to narrow the focus and to test hypotheses. While ®eld methods dominate, other methods may be used, such as
simulation and laboratory techniques.
Field studies
Field observations are critical to NDM research because real-world decisions are embedded in and contribute
to ongoing tasks. Researchers must understand the environments that demand decisions, the affordances and
constraints of those environments, and the kinds of knowledge and skills needed to respond to those
demands. Field observations also provide insights into potential sources of dif®culty, error, or non-optimal
performance, as well as how the larger system supports the decision maker. Methods used for eliciting
knowledge from experts (and sometimes novices) include: structured and unstructured interviews (e.g.
Cohen et al., 1996; Klein, 1989), retrospective analysis of critical incidents (e.g. Lipshitz and Strauss,
1997), expert drawing of domain maps, think-aloud protocols (e.g. Xiao et al., 1997), and videos of task
performance (Omodei et al., 1997). The tasks and materials may be taken from the actual or simulated work
environment, may be generated by the analyst or domain expert, and may be designed to be typical or anomalous, easy or challenging, constrained or unconstrained (e.g. in terms of time or information). Real-time
®eld observations (e.g. DiBello, 1997) involve ethnographic techniques. Observers may work in situ with
practitioners, asking questions such as `What are you doing? Why? How do you know what to do?' essentially working as `cognitive apprentices'. One may also conduct ®eld experiments in which a critical feature
of the environment is varied in a way that sheds light on how the practitioner thinks about the task (Roth
1997; Roth et al., 1992; Sarter and Woods, 1995).
A key technique of NDM research is cognitive task analysis (CTA). (See Gordon and Gill, 1997, for a
recent description.) CTA addresses `the need to capture the knowledge and processing used by experts in
performing their jobs' (Gordon and Gill, 1997, p. 131), as well as `uncovering actual demands confronting
practitioners' (Roth, 1997). A type of CTA that focuses speci®cally on decision making (rather than on an
entire complex task) is the Critical Decision Method (confusingly also labeled CDM: Hoffman et al., 1998;
Klein et al., 1989). Based on Flanagan's (1954) Critical Incident Technique, this approach provides insights
into challenging or unusual decisions. It involves multi-trial retrospection of a speci®c incident identi®ed by
the participant from personal experience. Probe questions are designed to identify important cues, choice

points, options, action plans, and the role of experience. As described by Hoffman et al. (1998) three `sweeps
approach the event from varying perspectives. `Timeline' veri®cation with decision point identi®cation
serves to structure the account into meaningfully ordered segments. Progressive deepening leads to a comprehensive, detailed, and contextually rich account of the incident. `What-if' queries serve to identify potential errors, alternative decision-action paths, and expert-novice differences' (p. 6.). Products from the CDM
analyses include situation assessment records, timelines, and decision requirements.
Full CDM procedures have been used in over 30 studies in domains as diverse as clinical nursing, systems
analysis, instructional design, graphic interface design, corporate management, and military planning,
command and operations. Products resulting from these analyses include materials that can be used
for training, taxonomies of informational or diagnostic cues, and as a basis for assessing skill levels.
Decision requirement tables can provide insights into similarities among tasks in terms of their cognitive
requirements.
Simulations
Simulated tasks elicit behavior that is similar to what might be seen in an actual situation, but without the
risks often present in those environments. Simulations may be extremely high-®delity, such as aircraft cockpits (e.g. Orasanu and Fischer, 1997), or low-®delity, such as several process control tasks (Roth et al., 1992)
or medical decision tasks (Gaba, in press). Realistic features can be built in, such as temporal parameters,
distractions, and workload, and subjects' behavior can be analyzed as a function of relevant factors, such as
differences in levels of experience or personality (Cohen and Freeman, 1986; Chidester et al., 1990), or
availability of tools or aids (Roth et al., 1987; Woods, 1993).
Laboratory techniques
Salas et al. (1995) argued that NDM both can and should be studied in the lab as well as `in the wild',
although doing so means giving up some of the contextual features that de®ne the phenomena in the
real world. In fact, NDM researchers have used laboratory methods when understanding of decision making
in a particular domain has advanced to a point at which predictions can be made on how decisions are
made in meaningful and familiar contexts. For example, Fischer and Orasanu (`Experience and role
effects on pilots' interpretations of aviation problems', submitted, 1998) used a sorting task followed by
hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling to validate aspects of their aviation decision
process model, as well as to determine whether the same dimensions were used by captains and ®rst
of®cers to interpret ¯ight decision situations. Klein et al. (1995) studied chess players and con®rmed a prediction from his recognition-primed decision model, namely that chess masters would generate acceptable
moves as the ®rst ones retrieved, in contrast to lower level players, who would engage in more extensive
search.
Laboratory experimentation involving large Ns, random assignment of subjects to experimental and control conditions, hypothesis testing, and sophisticated statistical tests to evaluate data are permitted in NDM.
Still, most questions and types of decisions with which NDM researchers are concerned are not amenable to
this type of approach. Consequently, NDM researchers wittingly forgo the type of rigor that guides laboratory studies in order to study decision-making performance in the richness of actual task environments. As
Woods (1993) noted, to the degree that decision strategies are task-contingent, one must study the decisions
in context. NDM researchers do not yet know enough about task features in most domains to design laboratory studies that will not change the phenomena of interest. Hammond (1988) also emphasized the need to
develop a theory of tasks in order to advance our understanding of performance in rich task domains. Considering that laboratory studies are often not suitable for NDM research and that the accepted canon of rigor
implicitly assumes laboratory methodology, has NDM given up on the issue of rigor?

Issues of scienti®c rigor in NDM research
NDM methodology has been criticized as being `soft' (Yates, in press). This appears to mean that researchers
do not adhere to the methods and standards appropriate for laboratory-based experiments. Just as the
methods must be suited to the research questions, the criteria for judging the quality of the studies must
be appropriate for the methods used. The central question of rigor is whether the methods used to collect
and analyze data support the conclusions that are drawn. Researchers working in the ®eld have been just as
concerned with issues of data quality and adequacy as those working in the laboratory.
Researchers using cognitive task analysis have asked: How `good' are the products of a CTA and how can
you tell? Concern is expressed over variation in the information generated by different CTA methods
(Gordon and Gill, 1997). Are the products biased in any systematic way? How comprehensive, inclusive,
and precise are the data?
Hoffman et al. (1998) reviewed numerous studies based on the Critical Decision Method (Klein et al.,
1989) from the point of view of reliability, validity, and ef®ciency. To determine reliability they investigated
how consistent participants were in reporting the same events, details, or gist of events in a retelling. Retest
reliability by ®reground commanders across several months averaged 82%. Another reliability check
addressed the coding of reported events: Do independent analysts generate similar results from the raw data?
Intercoder agreements across a number of similar studies with different participants averaged 85% or better.
NDM researchers are also concerned with the validity of verbal reports: Are distortions introduced in performance of the task due to thinking aloud and limitations on ability to introspect about one's own cognitive
processes (cf. Ericsson and Simon, 1984)? Despite these concerns, think-aloud protocols have been used
extensively in studies of expert/novice differences (e.g. Chi et al., 1981). Retrospective report techniques
raise concern about effects of memory limitations on the data (Loftus, 1996). These concerns suggest that
multiple approaches should be included to counteract the limitations of a single method. As Hoffman et al.
(1998) pointed out, CTA using any method is not like the mining of gold ore; rather, it is knowledge
co-discovery or co-creation.
The validity issue also must be addressed from another perspective that deals with the broader question of
what NDM research is trying to learn. To the extent that it focuses on interpretations and de®nitions of situations by expert decision makers, and the impact of those interpretations on task performance, traditional de®nitions of validity do not hold:
Reliability, falsi®ability, and objectivity are neither trivial nor irrelevant, but they must be understood as
particular ways of warranting validity claims rather than as universal, absolute, guarantors of truth. They
are rhetorical strategies (Simons, 1989) that ®t one model of science, experimental hypothesis testing and
so forth. . . . They are literally irrelevant to inquiry-guided research [a generic term denoting research in
naturalistic settings that typically uses qualitative methodologies] which does not ``test hypotheses'',
`measure variation' on quantitative dimensions or ``test'' the signi®cance of ®ndings with statistical
procedures simply because there is nothing in these studies to which to apply them (Mishler, 1990, pp.
419±436).
Using standards of rigor which are suitable for experimentation to evaluate studies that involve observational
methods is clearly inappropriate. Just as research methods should be made to ®t research questions and not
vice versa (Kaplan, 1964), research methods should drive the selection of evaluation criteria and not vice
versa.
If the standard criteria are not used to evaluate laboratory studies, then what criteria should be used?
Mishler (1990) suggests that inquiry-guided research studies be evaluated according to the criteria of
credibility and transferability. Credibility refers to the extent to which a study's ®ndings and conclusions
are warranted. It is established through information about (a) signi®cance of the research questions, (b)
methods for data collection and analysis and data upon which answers were based, (c) suitability of the
methods to the research questions and the research settings, (d) plausibility of the answers, and (e)

reasonableness of the assumptions underlying the choice of methods and interpretation of the data. Unfortunately, for researchers who hope to anchor science in a ®rm foundation of objective knowledge, questions
regarding the different facets of credibility, irrespective of the particular methodology employed, are answerable only by judgment calls.
Transferability refers to the extent to which a study's ®ndings and conclusions hold in other settings. It is not
based on extrapolation from sample to population based on random sampling and statistical tests, but on a caseto-case translation based on similarity in their signi®cant features (Firestone, 1993). Thus, the notion of transfer requires detailed description of features of the situation, which would be obtained from ®eld studies.
With respect to evaluating rigor, Howe and Eisenhardt (1990, p. 6) point out, `Failing to follow a given
theoretical perspective or methodological convention does not necessarily diminish the warrant of the conclusions drawn'. The central question remains: How good are the data obtained using NDM methods for
answering the questions posed by NDM researchers? We might turn the question around and ask: Could
traditional laboratory methods do a better job of answering the questions posed by NDM researchers than
the methods currently in use? How could their methods be used productively?
As Yates (in press) points out, NDM and traditional decision researchers are looking at different phenomena. They both call it decision making and assume that their own methods apply to the study of the other's
problems. This may well be a mistake, if in fact they are talking about apples and oranges. Traditional decision research focuses on theory building and testing, and is concerned with choice and con¯ict. NDM
researchers seek to understand ``cognition in the wild'' (Hutchins, 1995). We suggest that the scienti®c rigor
and credibility of each must be judged by standards appropriate to each venture.
IN CONCLUSION: CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUTURE CHALLENGES FOR NDM
To take stock of NDM, we reviewed some of the work which has been performed within this framework in
the last decade. Our review highlighted the contributions that according to one `outsider' NDM made to the
study of decision making (Yates, in press): the identi®cation of important areas of inquiry hitherto neglected
(e.g. complex and dynamic decision processes in naturalistic settings); the introduction of new models (e.g.
recognition-primed decisions) and conceptualizations (e.g. of uncertainty and error); the introduction of new
methods (e.g. Critical Decision Method); and the recruitment of applied investigators into the ®eld. Above
all, as the distinctive characteristics of NDM show, NDM contributed a new perspective on how decisions
(broadly de®ned as committing oneself to a certain course of action) are made. This leads us to believe that
NDM is a promising research paradigm to study decision making, linking this ®eld to applied cognition,
problem solving, and expertise. At the same time, as Yates (in press) points out, there are also signi®cant
challenges ahead.
The ®rst challenge is to develop NDM to be a better science simultaneously focused on solving real-world
problems and developing theory built on sound ®ndings, tools, and principles. To this end NDM needs more
empirical studies applying appropriately rigorous methodology. Progress in this direction can be achieved
via three complementary routes:
(1) Balance results from ®eld qualitative studies with ®ndings from traditional experimental work (e.g.
Klein et al., 1995; Cannon-Bowers and Salas, 1998).
(2) Develop simulation methods which allow observation of complex decision processes under controlled
conditions (e.g. Orasanu et al., 1998; Waag and Bell, 1997).
(3) Develop better understanding of and methods for rigorous observation (Lipshitz, in press) and knowledge elicitation (Hoffman et al., 1998) of decision making in naturalistic settings.
The availability of more and better empirical research should help NDM meet its second challenge, namely
the development of more comprehensive models and theories and well de®ned boundary conditions for what

NDM is and what it is not (Cannon-Bowers et al., 1996). The ultimate theoretical challenge for NDM,
according to these writers, is to specify the `link between the nature of the task, person, and environment
on the one hand and the various psychological processes and strategies involved in naturalistic decisions on
the other' (p. 202).
Finally, a third challenge for NDM is to start consolidating its applications. Five years ago we faced the
questions of what NDM means, and whether NDM has an impact. We have been busy developing applications since then (Zsambok and Klein, 1997; Salas and Klein, in press). Moreover, we have enjoyed some
measure of success. Now we need to converge on some of the more promising types of applications, and
conduct careful evaluations to better demonstrate the ef®cacy of our applications.
In sum, NDM faces challenges which it is well positioned to confront. Its success depends on the viability
of NDM's assumptions, theories, methods, empirical work, and applications. This, in turn, should foster a
fruitful dialogue among the various three-letter approaches to decision making, thus opening the ®eld to a
wider range of issues and a richer set of models, explanations, and applications. In taking stock of NDM we
hope to have contributed towards this goal.
