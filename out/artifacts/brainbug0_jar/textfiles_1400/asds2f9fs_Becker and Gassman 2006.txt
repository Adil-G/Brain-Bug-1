This paper analyzes the kind of knowledge that facilitates hatching and leveraging of
technologies through the incubation process. Four corporate incubator types can be distinguished according to their source and type of technology: fast-proﬁt incubators, market
incubators, leveraging incubators, and in-sourcing incubators. Applying the knowledge-based
view of the ﬁrm, four modes of mainly tacit knowledge were identiﬁed in respect to the
different incubator types: (1) entrepreneurial knowledge, (2) organizational knowledge, (3)
technological knowledge, and (4) complementary market knowledge. Knowledge strategies
include both the leveraging of internal knowledge as well as the in-sourcing of external
knowledge for the ﬁrm through the corporate incubator. The research is based on an analysis
of a European Commission dataset from a benchmarking survey of 77 incubators as well as 52
interviews in 25 large technology-driven corporations in Europe and the United States.

1. Introduction
1.1. Trends in R&D and business
innovation

T

he increasing competition and globalization
of industries, markets, and technologies have
raised the demand for outside-in innovation and
acquisition of technology through integrated
R&D networks, which Chesbrough (2003) calls
a new ‘open innovation’ paradigm. At the same
time, corporations concentrating on core competencies have tried to increase their internal technology utilization via the commercialization of
unused knowledge through licensing, selling, or
spinning-off (OECD, 2001).
Traditionally, research and development (R&D)
units have been technology-driven corporations’

source of future innovation and thus enable the
ﬁrm to maintain a competitive advantage (Porter,
1985). However, R&D’s traditional role has been
called into question. R&D units often act as an
ivory tower with minimal problem orientation,
while reduced R&D budgets produce people and
time constraints (Teece, 1986). These specialized
functional knowledge islands’ leveraging potential
is also limited because of a strong ‘not-inventedhere’ syndrome which is caused by negative reaction to borrowing or using knowledge sources
from other departments in or outside the ﬁrm
(Leonard-Barton, 1995). Nevertheless, an increasing share of total R&D expenditures is spent
externally to tap outside innovation sources (suppliers, customers, universities, research institutes).
In the face of these new challenges, corporate
incubators have recently emerged as a prominent

organizational form of R&D management. Corporate incubators are specialized corporate units
that hatch new businesses by providing physical
resources and support (Hansen et al., 2000;
Seidel, 2001; Colombo and Delmastro, 2002).
They support external start-ups or internal entrepreneurs with a promising business idea or
technology. All such businesses will henceforth
be referred to as technology ventures.
However, current research has not yet made a
distinction between the two fundamental business
models found in incubators: non-proﬁt and forproﬁt. While non-proﬁt incubators nurture a
social purpose, often as part of an overall economic policy, for-proﬁt incubators focus on offering their owners ﬁnancial returns. Incubators can
achieve positive gains by charging entrepreneurs
service fees for services provided and investing in
medium- to long-term equity stakes in new ventures (Hansen et al., 2000; Achtleitner and Engel,
2001).
Contrary to non-proﬁt incubators that have
supported the development of new ventures since
the 1960s, corporate incubators are managed as
professional service ﬁrms, acting in the larger
interest of their parent corporation while leveraging their knowledge and networks.
So what do Nokia, Siemens, Panasonic, and
Novartis – large innovative technology-intensive
corporations from different industries – have in
common? All have successfully established a
corporate incubator that continues to operate
despite the overall reduced incubation activities
in the poor economic climate since the bubble
burst. The corporate incubator can thus act as a
knowledge hub of business-building expertise
where good ideas can be nurtured and from which
knowledge is transferred to other units in the
corporation. However, researchers have neither
constructed a typology of these corporate incubators nor identiﬁed the different knowledge
modes most relevant in each.

1.2. Knowledge-based view as a
framework
The corporate incubator tries to accelerate the
development of new businesses by transferring
tangible and intangible resources. Traditionally,
the importance of functions and systems such as
ﬁnancing and infrastructure was stressed, but
recently the value of intangible resources, such
as knowledge and networks through physical colocation has been better appreciated.

Knowledge is one of the most strategically
important organizational resources. As the corporate incubator tries to support the development
of new businesses, the optimization of an efﬁcient
knowledge ﬂow between the incubator manager
and the technology ventures as well as the parent
corporation can substantially accelerate start-ups’
growth. In the following an attempt is made to
link the incubation process with the conceptual
framework of the knowledge-based perspective.
Different streams of literature comprise the
knowledge-based view: its link to the resourcebased view and the ﬁrm’s strategic capabilities,
deﬁnitions and modes of knowledge, knowledge
epistemology, knowledge creation, and sources of
knowledge. Furthermore, knowledge strategies
and interface management between the corporate
incubator and the corporation are also topics
discussed with respect to the resource-based view.
As part of the dynamic theory of the ﬁrm, the
knowledge-based view of the ﬁrm is an extension
of the resource-based view in creating competitive
advantages (Porter, 1985; Hoskisson et al., 1999).
As a component of the pre-eminent school of
strategic management, the knowledge-based view
is often process oriented and focuses on learning
and innovation (Grant, 1995, 1996, 1997). Its
emphasis on the learning in an organization
stresses the creation of new knowledge, sharing
knowledge through codiﬁed tacit knowledge,
transferring knowledge, and applying it to a
speciﬁc situation (Nonaka, 1994; Spender,
1996). The creation and sharing of knowledge is,
therefore, also of major importance in the incubation process.
Knowledge can be distinguished between explicit (formal, structured, and codiﬁed) and tacit
(informal, unstructured, and uncodiﬁed) (Polanyi, 1962, 1967). Explicit knowledge can be articulated and therefore, easily transferred and
imitated quite cheaply. Tacit knowledge, on the
other hand, is by deﬁnition uncodiﬁed, and is thus
more difﬁcult to transfer beyond arm’s length
(von Krogh et al., 2000). Entrepreneurs stress
the importance of intangible or tacit knowledge
such as regular or ad hoc advice, exchange of
lessons learned with other entrepreneurs and networks to contact new customers and suppliers.
To establish a knowledge epistemology, its nature should ﬁrst be understood. This includes the
concept of autopoesis, which is characterized by
(a) available relationships, (b) the self-description
of an organization, and (c) a self-referential
system to past as well as future organizational
knowledge (von Krogh et al., 1994; von Krogh
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

<-----Page 2----->Gaining leverage effects from knowledge modes
and Roos, 1995). The ‘epistemology of possession’ describes the preferred sequence of kinds of
knowledge. It ﬁnds that explicit knowledge is
preferred over tacit knowledge, while individual
knowledge is preferred over knowledge possessed
by a group (Cook and Brown, 1999).
In respect of the growth of knowledge, Nonaka
(1994) deﬁnes a spiral of organizational knowledge creation through combination, socialization,
externalization, and internalization (Nonaka and
Takeuchi, 1995). He also differentiates between
internal knowledge creation through conceptualization, which requires mutual trust within
self-organizing teams, and external knowledge
creation through concrete forms, such as products
or systems with quality standards.
Knowledge creation involves and combines
different sources of knowledge (i.e., internal research, market units, external customers, competitors/innovation partners). Thus, the locus of
knowledge can be found internally within organizational boundaries, or externally through intra-ﬁrm collaboration. Traditionally, acquisition,
joint ventures and hiring of new people have
been identiﬁed as external knowledge sources of
learning (Kogut and Zander, 1992). Recently,
corporate incubators supporting the growth of
external start-ups has become another method
by which to leverage external sources of knowledge. A ﬁrm’s ability to acquire external knowledge and utilize it internally (Cohen and
Levinthal, 1990) is captured in the concept of
organizational absorptive capacity, which reﬂects
the aforementioned process orientation of the
resource-based view.
The knowledge-based view, as part of the
resource-based view, is also used to explain the
existence of the ﬁrm (Conner, 1991; Conner and
Prahalad, 1996). Knowledge asymmetry, which is
based on the contract theory, provides reasons for
corporations being formed. First, the ﬁrm is
organized by employment contracts that increase
ﬂexibility, communication, and learning as well as
creating shared identities, which differs from
autonomous contracting in the market. Second,
ﬁrms beneﬁt through ‘the knowledge-substitution
effect’ of employees’ knowledge being substituted
by the manager’s knowledge (Knight, 1921; Demsetz, 1988). However, the argument for the ﬁrm’s
existence as based on employment contracts must
be enhanced with economic concepts such as
incentives, opportunism, property rights, and
moral hazard (Foss, 1996a, b).
Knowledge enables us to identify technological
and organizational complementarities (Kogut
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

and Zander, 1996). Thus, knowledge is contingent
on the organizational structure, which can be
characterized by observability and knowledge
functions’ embeddedness in the system (Birkinshaw et al., 2002). Knowledge strategies are
linked to practical implications for managers,
including offering the right space, decisions regarding the choice of knowledge source (internal
versus external), the scope of the knowledge base
(narrow versus broad) and the speed of learning
(fast versus slow), to name only a few variables
(Gupta and Govindarajan, 1991; von Krogh
et al., 2000).
In summary, previous research has covered the
knowledge-creation process in R&D as well as
the knowledge transfer mechanism itself. However, knowledge modes’ purposeful application to
the incubation process has neither been examined
previously nor has there been a special focus on
knowledge modes’ role in different types of corporate incubators.

1.3. Research context and methodology
Although corporate incubators use different
names such as incubator, accelerator, business
innovation or venture fund, they were included
in the study if their strategic mission dealt with
supporting young enterprises for technology development through the provision of physical
resources. As the corporate incubator phenomenon is relatively new, a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods was used
to ensure validity, reliability, and vigor (Flick,
1999; Keller and Erzberger, 1999). Following
Eisenhardt’s process of inducing theory and developing strategic implications using case studies
(Eisenhardt, 1989), the research generated constructs through case studies, case examples, and
standardized ﬁrm proﬁles (Dyer et al., 1991;
Tsoukas, 1994; Yin, 1994).
The aim of this paper is to enhance the understanding of how tacit corporate knowledge can be
leveraged through corporate incubators within a
ﬁrm. The analysis focuses on the business process
facilitating knowledge enhancement. It does not
contribute to input factors such as resources or
output performance such as these knowledge
modes’ value creation.
The research was carried out in two phases:
in phase 1 (2001), a quantitative analysis was
performed on the raw data and based on a
questionnaire of 77 managers of incubators in
the 15 EU-member states, Switzerland, and Norway. The size of the incubators, as measured by

the number of incubated ﬁrms, averaged 27 ﬁrms
that represented all major industries. The average
length of the incubated ﬁrms’ tenancy was 35
months, which reﬂected most of the surveyed
incubators’ maturity. This benchmarking study
increased the understanding of the knowledgeleveraging incubation process.
In phase 2 (2001–2002), a case study approach
and methodological triangulation were used to
identify organizational archetypes and corporate
incubators’ relevant efﬁciency and effectiveness
factors. Among the 25 researched European and
American corporate incubators, two-thirds were
US based, with one-third European-based technology-driven corporations with operations in
high-tech industries such as computers, electronics, and communications equipment manufacturing (see Figure 1).
The criteria used for selecting speciﬁc corporate
incubators for case studies included their business-to-business concentration, headquarters in
Europe or the United States, their focus on
high-tech industries as reﬂected in a high degree
of R&D intensity and the sales generated from
products less than 3 years old. These criteria stress
the importance of supporting young enterprises
or start-up ideas through special programs, including the provision of physical resources. The
majority of the corporate incubators surveyed
was set up between 1998 and 2000, and at the
4

R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

time of writing approximately two-thirds were
still operational. The ﬁndings are further based
on 52 semi-structured interviews with corporate
incubators’ managers.
The paper is structured as follows: after a
literature review of the knowledge-based view,
the enhancement of the knowledge process
through corporate incubators is examined. This
includes quantitative ﬁndings as well as an examination of the different knowledge modes in
respect of each incubator type. The following
section describes the corporate incubator’s role
in enhancing innovation through increased connectivity and interface management. The paper
concludes with a discussion of corporate incubators enhancing the locus of innovative knowledge
and the associated future trends.

2. Knowledge ﬂow in the incubation
process
Because corporate incubators as for-proﬁt incubators differ substantially from non-proﬁt incubators, a comparison of the knowledge ﬂow between
the two is needed. Community and especially
university incubators have been run since the
1960s by community development efforts, or
municipal organizations in order to fuel economic
growth and job creation. Non-proﬁt incubators
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

<-----Page 4----->Gaining leverage effects from knowledge modes
focus on transferring physical resources, such as
rentals that are below market value, ofﬁce support and the shared use of secretarial services. The
transfer of the knowledge ﬂow often occurs in an
ad hoc manner, i.e. through the incubator manager’s advice, or the daily exchange with colocated entrepreneurs.
By contrast, for-proﬁt incubators have adopted
a professionally organized knowledge ﬂow to
achieve proﬁts from their involvement in new
ventures. Having emerged with the Internet and
venture capital boom between 1998 and 2000,
they include (a) technology corporations’ corporate incubators to enhance technology development, (b) service providers’ incubators, such as
those found in consulting and accounting ﬁrms to
extend the services offered to their clients, and (c)
independent incubators managed as a holding
or virtual organization, or in line with venture
capitalists.
This paper focuses on corporate incubators’
knowledge ﬂow. In this respect, corporate incubators for the strategic enhancement of a corporation’s technology are particularly interesting
because they can tap a large pool of internal
knowledge on business development, on markets,
customers, suppliers, and technology, while having the additional beneﬁt of being widely connected with external partners.

2.1. Four-phase model of incubation
process
Knowledge ﬂow differs at various times during
the incubation process. As there is no model for
the incubation process, the four-stage process
from the venture capital literature is transferred
and enhanced in respect to their knowledge aspects: selection, structuring, involvement, and exit
(Gompers and Lerner, 1999; Lerner, 2000). Our
research has found variables in each of the four
stages on which incubator managers have to focus
during their interaction with technology ventures
(see Figure 2).
During the selection phase, for-proﬁt incubators decide what kind of technology ventures they
wish to attract and select. They look for innovative projects – either start-ups, or spin-offs from
existing companies – with a developed business
plan and a potential for high growth. In addition,
their ﬁt with the corporate technology strategy is
of the utmost importance for corporate incubators. While the number of requests for incubation
is high and is matched by the high number of
initial screenings, the rate of admission is low.
Once a technology venture has been selected,
structuring determines how it will pay for the
services it will receive. This is usually through
medium equity stakes (of about 20% in for-proﬁt

incubators), or through payment for services.
These legal arrangements also include nondisclosure agreements, premises offered, the technology ventures’ potential length of tenancy in the
incubator and the kind of support they will
receive as well as the possible exits to aim at.
The incubator managers’ involvement with the
technology venture is one of the most important
and longest phases in the incubation process
because it inﬂuences the scope and quality of
the technology venture’s value added. Incubator
managers and their staff support its growth by
providing management assistance via an extensive
ﬂow of resources, of which intangible knowledge
is the most important. Their involvement also
includes interaction regarding ease of access,
allocated time and intensity of exchange, the
passive or pro-active nature of the support, formal or informal performance reviews and the
long-term link to graduates (i.e., former incubated companies). Contrary to the hypothesis
that for-proﬁt incubators have professionally organized, continuous exchange and mutual feedback with their technology ventures, our research
revealed no particular support arrangements.
Surprisingly, 52.9% of for-proﬁt incubator managers said that they do not have clear monitoring
arrangements, monitoring only half of the time
compared with that of non-proﬁt incubators
(Figure 3).
However, they are good at informally collecting
comprehensive feedback from their technology
ventures (88.2%) through periodic meetings
(58.8%), or via surveys (58.8%) (see Figure 4).

informal methods and intermittent meetings. This
is important, because incubator performance is
correlated to the feedback to stakeholders, measured by the number of feedback methods
(0.476)a (with a ¼ Po0.001 being a high signiﬁcant level reﬂecting that there is almost certainly a
true difference and thus a low probability of
error). A better feedback system also increases
incubator performance.
During the ﬁnal incubation stage of exit from
the technology venture, the for-proﬁt incubator
follows speciﬁc exit criteria according to the
achieved milestones, or unachieved objectives.
The former can halt the incubation time at the
end of a ﬁxed incubation period, or limit the space
in the incubator itself.
The length of time at which a technology
venture remains in the incubator is correlated to
 whether the technology ventures originated in
incumbents’ units (0.438)a. This could mean
that incumbents’ technology ventures remain
in the incubator for a shorter time because
they have more experience to leverage.

 The total physical space of the incubator itself
(0.499)a. An incubator with large physical
space can accommodate a growing technology
venture longer.
 The incubator’s other rental income (0.488)a.
Income from rentals depends on how long a
technology venture remains in the incubator.
If an incubator mainly earns proﬁts from
service fees, it might want technology ventures
to remain in the incubator longer. By contrast,
an incubator that has high equity stakes in
technology ventures might focus mainly on a
fast exit by selling the start-up.
We hypothesized that for-proﬁt incubators
pursuing strategic interests in enhancing technology for a corporation are still driven by ﬁnancial
measures. However, our research shows that
ﬁnancial performance is a subordinate focus.
For-proﬁt incubators usually measure their performance by means of three variables of decreasing importance and with ﬁnancial performance
not being a top priority: number of graduates,
occupancy rate (i.e., the number of technology
ventures per size of the incubator), and ﬁnancial
performance.

2.2. Time of involvement during
incubation
One important measure of involvement is the
quality and quantity of the advice provided by
the incubator manager to the technology ventures, which also determines the knowledge
ﬂow. As the quality of advice is difﬁcult to
determine and is dependent on individuals’ subjective perception, the amount of time spent on
giving advice can be assumed to provide insights
into the advice’s quality. We hypothesized that
professionally organized for-proﬁt incubators
spent more time on involvement than non-proﬁt
incubators. However, our ﬁndings showed that
only little management time was allocated for
direct advising. Surprisingly, for-proﬁt incubators
spend less time per week advising their technology
ventures than do non-proﬁt incubators. About
56% of for-proﬁt incubators managers spend 20–
50 minutes with their incubating companies, while
37.5% spend no more than 20 minutes. Only
6.3% of for-proﬁt managers provide advice for
more than 50% of their working week, compared
with 23.2% of non-proﬁt incubator managers.
One could argue that for-proﬁt incubator managers are more efﬁcient at providing management
assistance, or that their time is more focused on
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

the selection and exit processes. Another explanation could be that start-ups in non-proﬁt incubators need more advice because technical or
university ventures have a higher incidence of a
non-business background.
The time that incubator managers dedicate to
advising and assisting is furthermore correlated to
 the total operational subsidies (0.423)a. The
more subsidies an incubator manages to attract, the more resources it can utilize to
advise technology ventures;
 the number of marketing services (0.434)a.
Incubators that carry out more advertising
and marketing might have more resources to
provide.
The knowledge process within corporate incubators is a reciprocal learning process for all three
of the actors involved – the corporate incubator
itself its manager, the parent corporation, and the
technology venture. The engagement of the incubator with a single technology can change over
time, because of the technology venture’s changing needs in its life-cycle, as was analyzed in
detail in the interaction between venture capitalists and start-ups (MacMillan et al., 1989;
Sapienza et al., 1996). Different knowledge modes
can therefore be identiﬁed within the various
incubator types.

3. Different knowledge modes by
incubator type
In the previous section four phases of incubation,
particularly on knowledge transfer during the
involvement phase as well as on the different
knowledge modes by incubator type were examined. The following section discusses the ﬂexibility of the developed classiﬁcation system and
describes the corporate incubator’s role in enhancing the knowledge base and improving interface
management. Resuming the main arguments in
the light of the empirical evidence, the paper
concludes by discussing the implications and
future research needs.
Based on our exploratory research of 25 corporate incubators, we identiﬁed four different
types of corporate incubators in large technology-driven corporations: fast-proﬁt incubator,
leveraging incubator, in-sourcing incubator, and
market incubator (Gassmann and Becker, 2006).
The typology of corporate incubators is derived
by distinguishing the corporate incubator’s mission according to its source of technology – from
R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

7

<-----Page 7----->Barbara Becker and Oliver Gassmann
within or outside the corporation – and by its type
of technology – either core or non-core. Diverse
knowledge bases are necessary, but certain knowledge modes are crucial for a speciﬁc incubator
type’s competitive advantage.

3.1. Entrepreneurial knowledge through a
fast-proﬁt incubator
The fast-proﬁt incubator commercializes noncore technology for later spin-off. It utilizes
internally developed technologies such as unused
patents by setting up and funding technology
ventures. Its end goal is exiting from these ventures through spin-off and proﬁt making. Examples of fast-proﬁt incubators are BT Brightstar,
Nokia Ventures Organization, and Siemens Technology Accelerator.
Siemens Technology Accelerator commercializes non-core technologies from Siemens’ patent
portfolio. As most of its ideas are sourced in the
central research unit Siemens Corporate Technology, the incubator is located at the central headquarters in Munich. It identiﬁes unused patents
and transfers their associated intellectual property
rights to the newly founded start-up to prepare its
later spin-off. By contrast, Siemens’ other incubator, Siemens Mobile Acceleration, is supported
as a market incubator by the business unit Information and Communication Mobile and not
by the central R&D, which usually identiﬁes
complementary knowledge.
Another example, launched late in February
2000, is BT Brightstar, an incubator, which,
rather similar to the above, tries to utilize communication technology patents ﬁled by British
Telecom’s engineers and researchers. In the beginning, they relied on internal sources to ﬁnd
promising technologies or patents and create
business plans that were then ﬁnanced by external
partnerships with institutional venture capitalists.
The fast-proﬁt incubator taps entrepreneurial
knowledge on how to start a company, builds the
technology venture’s skills and capacity, deﬁnes
and targets a market and transfers patents from
the parent corporation to the venture. Expanding
its horizon of possible solutions and alternatives,
it supports matchmaking with external markets.
In the end, it proﬁts from the impact of a
successful spin-off, while allowing the parent
corporation to focus on core competencies.
An example is Nokia Ventures Organization,
which was established in 1998 to source ideas
throughout the organization with most leads
8

R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

coming from Nokia Research itself. Its structured
approach reﬂects the utilization of entrepreneurial knowledge by the long-term support of ideas –
in the form of new technologies, or new markets –
conceived within the parent corporation, but outside the current businesses.

3.2. Organizational knowledge through a
leveraging incubator
The leveraging incubator strives to increase the
utilization of internally developed technology –
leveraging it to the market (inside-out innovation)
– thereby supporting the corporation’s growth.
By matchmaking the central R&D with market
units, it increases the commercialization of current or future core technologies that could be
integrated into the core business in future. Lucent
New Ventures Group, Reuters Incubator and
Siemens Business Accelerators are examples of
the leveraging incubator.
When Lucent was spun off from AT&T, the
incubator Lucent New Ventures was set up late in
1996. Its goal was to exclusively create ventures
from Bell Labs Lucent Technologies’ research
center in order to utilize technologies that were
not a good strategic ﬁt with their core business.
Another motivation included tapping technologies that had not been commercially exploited
because of a lack of ﬁnancial capacity.
This type of incubator leverages organizational
knowledge of how to activate the whole organization, build internally effective partnerships and
good working relationships with other corporate
departments and communicate within the corporate organizational boundaries. Its successful
matchmaking within the corporation furthermore
aligns the company’s core competencies.
The information distributor Reuters, along
with its major customers, banks and media companies, realized early the potential of leveraging
technological ideas through incubation. Founded
in early 1995, Reuters Incubator, later called
Reuters Venture Capital, connects different pockets of knowledge within the organization.

3.3. Technological knowledge through an
in-sourcing incubator
The in-sourcing incubator utilizes technological
knowledge to screen external markets for promising ideas and high-potential start-ups (its radar
function) that might be of interest to the corporation for potential spin-in (outside-in innovation)
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

<-----Page 8----->Gaining leverage effects from knowledge modes
and thus expand the corporation’s core competencies. It furthermore builds bridges from the
start-up to the corporation and vice versa. It exits
from the technology ventures through their integration into the corporation, either through an
existing business unit, or through the formation
of a new one. In-sourcing incubators can be
found at several corporations such as: Bertelsmann Corporate Ventures, Cisco New Ventures,
Ericsson Business Innovation, Motorola Ventures, Panasonic Internet Incubator, and UPS
Strategic Enterprise Fund.
Panasonic Digital Concepts Center was established in October 1998 to give its Japanese parent
company Matsushita visibility and access to technologies and players in Silicon Valley. Access to
core technologies is important for differentiation
and partnership-building purposes, as one of their
principle explains. Panasonic’s strategy of basically outsourcing R&D is unusual in Japanese
corporations, which tend to develop their own
core technologies. It thus moves away from the
traditional focus on international corporate
R&D, or investing in venture capital funds. Another example, Ericsson Business Innovation,
founded rather late in July 2000, mainly searches
for external technologies for integration into the
parent corporation.
UPS Strategic Enterprise Fund is a good example of how incubators can support a company
in its quest to be at the forefront of technology.
Operating since 1997, this incubator increases the
United Parcel Services’ knowledge about emerging technologies that could be helpful to the
company and its customers. For example, it
incubated start-ups such as Air2Web, a wireless
technology that allows the tracking of packages
by using wireless devices such as PDAs and
phones. Another technological solution tracks
packages with no labels, using RFID technology
developed by Savi Technology, which may have
enormous future strategic value.
Technology scanning can be initiated from the
incubator itself, but also from the business units
in a bottom-up approach to align it strategically
closely to its business units. Motorola’s business
units identify gaps in their product roadmaps
(long-range plans), and pass these on to the
incubator Motorola Ventures. Motorola Ventures
veriﬁes these identiﬁed requirements in discussion
with its partners and seeks to match them with
external start-up technology. The incubator thus
acts as a strategic investor by investing in technologies that will support Motorola’s existing and
emerging platforms and products. The company
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

emphasizes its long-range relationships with the
portfolio companies by transferring knowledge
both in and out of them. Joint development
agreements motivate both parties to integrate
their technologies through the same core design.

3.4. Complementary market knowledge
through a market incubator
The market incubator develops a market for a
complementary non-core technology to increase
demand for its own technology and products. It
takes a unique position in supporting the development of complementary technologies without
having a potential acquisition goal. Examples of
market incubator are Business-Incubator.com,
IBM Dotcom Incubator, Novartis Venture
Fund, and Siemens Mobile Acceleration.
Business-Incubator.com was set up by the partnering of Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Cisco Systems, and Exodus as part of their client
development, or marketing effort to build promising Internet companies in the long term. This
incubator offers newly founded technology ventures a comprehensive technology package.
This type of incubator uses complementary
market knowledge to segment customer demand
effectively, to ﬁnd satisfying solutions to related
customer problems and to be sensitive to markets
and customers’ needs. By analyzing current and
future technology standards, a company can
deﬁne its complementary technology position.
The successful matchmaking with external markets can also enhance its core competencies.
The Genomics Novartis Fund works with technology ventures to reﬁne their derived technology
platforms in the ﬁeld of functional genomics that
might become future technology standards. In
exchange for its development support of the new
ventures, Novartis can continue using the technology platform in future.

3.5. Different survival rates by incubator
type
Once the analyzed corporate incubators have
been grouped by source and type of technology,
an interesting distribution pattern emerges. Instead of an even distribution, most incubators are
either in-sourcing or market incubators, which
possess the highest potential for the external
sourcing of technology. However, one-third of
the examined corporate incubators have been
closed (as marked with italics and a cross in

Figure 5), or have been transformed into a pure
corporate venture capital model.
Based on our limited sample of 25 corporate
incubators, we have indicators that in-sourcing
incubators provide the most promising type of
corporate activities and will do so in future as
well. However, reduced R&D budgets, along with
people and time constraints, call for outside
orientation toward ‘open innovation’ and external knowledge sourcing (Teece, 1986; Chesbrough, 2003).
Knowledge creation and R&D management’s
core tasks in particular are increasingly sourced
through start-ups or re-delegated to academic
institutions or other corporations. For example,
in the biotechnology industry, established corporations co-operate with start-ups in respect of
radical innovation in order to reduce the time-tomarket when compared with that of the central
R&D (Pisano, 1990). Collaborative research arrangements are beneﬁcial for both sides: start-ups
can develop new products more effectively and
large corporations can provide the market testing
and marketing of the developed products. Insourcing incubators can be an intermediate phase
to determine the interfaces between the corporation and start-up in order to increase the like10

R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

lihood of a later acquisition (spin-in) of the
technology venture.
Market incubators were found to have the
second highest distribution of corporate incubators, which reﬂects their high potential and the
importance of their insights into complementary
market knowledge. However, market incubators are highly sensitive to changing market
demands, such as changing economic conditions,
or technical standards if they focus on speciﬁc
technologies. At the end of the Internet boom,
many more market incubators were closed than
other types. As they are built on the expectation
that a new technology standard or platform, such
as the Internet or mobile communication, will
materialize, the disappearance of such high-risk
ventures almost inevitably led to the closure
of market incubators. However, through knowledge access to local markets, complementary
market knowledge could be re-delegated to the
classical market function and away from R&D
management.
The two other types of incubators, fast-proﬁt
and leveraging, which optimize the internal sourcing of technology and thereby overcome organizational inertia, have approximately the same
distribution frequency.

<-----Page 10----->Gaining leverage effects from knowledge modes

4. Discussion
The developed classiﬁcation of knowledge modes
needs to be evaluated in respect of (a) the clear
assignment of each incubator to one incubator
type, (b) the categorization of speciﬁc knowledge
modes to speciﬁc incubator types as well as (c)
changes over time.
(a) Developing a taxonomy of corporate incubators is helpful in the more detailed differentiation of speciﬁc for-proﬁt incubators as far as their
mission and structure are concerned. However,
individual corporate incubators might also be
hybrids of two different types, or even overlap
three different types to different degrees, while
changing their prioritization over time. Furthermore, some corporations, such as Siemens, have
set up different incubator types for different
strategic purposes within a short time.
(b) Our limited research has shown that speciﬁc
knowledge modes can be assigned to one incubator type. By matching the four incubator types to
the nature of the relevant knowledge, a bi-univocal relationship could be assumed between
them.
For example, entrepreneurial knowledge is of
particular importance for the fast-proﬁt incubator, because it can accelerate the hatching of new
own ideas toward a fast spin-off for proﬁt. However, this could also slightly apply to the market
incubator, as it supports the fast development of
external start-ups for spin-off. Organizational
knowledge is fundamental for the leveraging incubator because it integrates internally developed
technology with core businesses. To a lesser
degree, this knowledge’s integration skills might
also be required by the in-sourcing incubator to
connect externally developed core technology.
Organizational knowledge thus supports integration, regardless of whether technology is developed within or outside the incubator’s parent
company. Scanning the environment for potential
technology externally, technological knowledge predominates in the in-sourcing incubator in order
to evaluate a venture’s acquisition potential. It,
furthermore, helps to evaluate how knowledge is
exploited both inside and outside the corporate boundaries. Internal knowledge exploitation occurs in the form of an exit through internal
integration, while external knowledge exploitation chooses spin-off and thus separation of the
technology venture from the parent corporation.
(c) In an extension of the discussion in Section
3.5, it should be noted that incubator types have
different survival rates and thus the importance of
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

knowledge modes might change over time. The
in-sourcing incubator’s success in focusing on
technological knowledge and the market incubator’s complementary market knowledge both
point to the importance of the outside-in paradigm of ‘open innovation’. R&D units, although
separate, are thus enhanced by the external scanning of technology and the utilization thereof in
their own organization.
The following section elaborates on the importance of knowledge sharing in the various identiﬁed knowledge modes per incubator type. The
three different roles in the incubation process are
also discussed in respect to how they can enhance
knowledge ﬂow capabilities. Finally, interface
management can optimize the intangible resource
ﬂow, particularly from the parent corporation to
the incubator manager and then to the technology
ventures.
Because fast-proﬁt and in-sourcing incubators
leverage either internal or external knowledge for
later spin-in, entrepreneurial and technological
knowledge remains in the corporation, making
knowledge sharing crucial. Organizational learning, in fact, stresses the creation of new knowledge by sharing codifying tacit knowledge and
transferring knowledge and applying it to a speciﬁc situation (Nonaka, 1994; Spender, 1996).
The corporate incubator can, therefore, support
knowledge sharing between the R&D and different
business units by making knowledge available for
absorption and use (Davenport and Prusak,
1998). Besides sourcing knowledge internally
from other departments (e.g., R&D or business
units), or externally from start-ups, the corporate
incubator can, furthermore, support the transfer
of knowledge on the experience with and application of technology between the research and
market units.
Knowledge is rich if it has a high informational
quality and is relevant to potential users. This
decreases venturing costs and realizes economies
of scale. However, there is the traditional tradeoff between reach (connectivity) and breadth
(customization, bandwidth) (Teece, 2000). The
incubator’s informal organic structure, with little
formalization and extensive contact to knowledgeable experts throughout the corporation,
behaves like a spider’s web, supporting the transfer of mainly tacit knowledge (Miles and Snow,
1986).
The process skills of selecting and supporting
technology ventures through ongoing advice, or
occasional ad hoc consulting if and when required
(e.g. ‘from experience with other start-ups we did’
R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

11

<-----Page 11----->Barbara Becker and Oliver Gassmann
best practice comparisons) can be transferred by
people working alongside the incubator staff.
An example of knowledge sharing being supported is Nokia Ventures Organization. It gives
managers the mobility in order to encourage a
steady ﬂow of information within the corporation. Employees from the business units can move
into the incubator for a limited time to support
their idea up to its realization. Following Nonaka
and Takeuchi’s identiﬁcation of knowledge transformation methods, a corporate incubator can
support socialization, the transfer from explicit to
implicit knowledge through co-location as well as
the transfer of knowledge from the incubator
manager (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995). Furthermore, it can support internalization of knowledge
from explicit to implicit knowledge through learning-by-doing in joint projects.
The leveraging incubator acts as a matchmaker
between R&D and market units, building on
organizational knowledge insights. However, barriers to innovation and limited knowledge ﬂows
can lead to a negative reinforcing cycle of low
credibility and inﬂuence, which may lead to low
attractiveness, low pay and thus hesitant performance (Leonard-Barton, 1995). These barriers
can consist of an information problem of ‘notknowing’ (knowledge gap), a motivation problem
of ‘not-wanting’ to know (motivation gap) and a
qualiﬁcation problem of ‘not-being able’ (capability gap) to break through administrative barriers.
The latter could lead to procrastination, could
even prevent new technology from being developed, or a technology venture from being established (Hauschildt, 1997).
In respect of the in-sourcing incubator, ‘notwanting to know’ might be particularly apt. For
example, the CIA Intelligence Incubator, called InQ-Tel, was launched in September 1999 by the
Central Intelligence Agency with the support of
the US Congress to accelerate the acquisition and
integration of new technologies. These technologies would be used to gather government intelligence, thereby improving the Agency’s
information gathering and analysis capabilities.
While they can successfully hatch an IT solution
in the incubator, one of the major issues is the
integration and insertion into the Central Intelligence Agency itself through an established In-QTel Interface Center. While the adoption of
technology is high at the senior management
level, middle management through its notinvented-here syndrome and resistance to change
is more reluctant to use the in-sourcing incubator’s external technologies.
12

R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

Establishing an open knowledge ﬂow, increased
motivation and an easier approval process are all
activities that can enhance innovation capabilities. A corporate incubator can provide the
internal support for innovative projects and thus
a knowledge base to realize innovative projects.
In this knowledge transformation process, three
roles can be distinguished.
Siemens Technology Accelerator provides a
good example how the fast-proﬁt incubator leverages its entrepreneurial knowledge. (a) The
researcher as a specialist develops his original
idea in Siemens’ central R&D department called
Corporate Technology. (b) The incubator staff,
such as personnel coaches, identify the project’s
potential, develop a business plan, support access
to internal and VC funding and manage the
transfer of the relevant corporate patents to the
technology venture. They also leverage Siemens’
wide internal network and provide access to
customers and suppliers. (c) Finally, senior management at the central R&D can support the
technology venture through the hierarchy.
The corporate incubator is the ideal location
for knowledge brokers – also known as ‘gatekeepers’, or ‘boundary-spanning individuals.’ – to
use their connection to communication networks
(Tushman and Scanlan, 1981) that improve information ﬂow by connecting the buyers with the
sellers of knowledge. Particularly, incubator managers as knowledge brokers often leverage their
large informal network. Cisco New Ventures is an
example of having an incubator linked to the
corporation through intra-ﬁrm networks. Once
the acquisition of a technology venture has been
decided, the incubator manages the diffusion of
the spin-in process of start-ups through a centralized cross-functional integration team (called the
SWOT team). Approximately 15–20 people from
human resources, sales, marketing and manufacturing all support the rapid assimilation of the
acquired company.
The corporate incubator can enhance entrepreneurial activity by tapping intrapreneurs’ potential in the organization. By combining the
cognitive differences between the entrepreneurs
and managers’ mindsets (Busenitz and Barney,
1997), corporate incubators can enhance organizational learning. Entrepreneurs, or intrapreneurs, deal with high uncertainty and are used
to making decisions with limited information. In
contrast, established companies, or successful
individuals face competency traps by not extending themselves beyond trajectories created by past
successes (Levitt and March, 1988; Levinthal and
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

<-----Page 12----->Gaining leverage effects from knowledge modes
March, 1993). Established corporations might
thus be unable to respond and adapt to the
environment because of core rigidities – the dysfunctional ﬂip side of core capabilities – through
which embedded knowledge inhibits innovation
(Leonard-Barton, 1992). The corporate incubator
can reduce the growing mobility of large corporations’ well-trained workers to technology ventures. Intrapreneurs can become involved in the
development of their own ideas and may beneﬁt
ﬁnancially from the upside potential without
leaving the large corporation.
All incubator types have to balance the parent
corporation’s co-ordination needs with the costs
of knowledge sharing in order to achieve a
common objective. Self-reliant autonomous units
have low communication costs, various interface
links, and increasing co-ordination intensity and
communication (Frese, 1995). Interface management needs to
 deﬁne the relationship between the incubator
and the rest of the organization (e.g. business
units, central R&D, and senior management);
 facilitate communication between different
business units;
 manage the expectations of the receiving operating unit; and
 ensure the continuous input of the technology
venture’s mentoring, or receiving business
unit, while avoiding becoming captive too
early.
The corporate incubator can co-ordinate its
formal interface with the parent corporation’s
centralized units through explicitly deﬁned contact
persons at the parent company. These interface
agents in corporate services such as R&D, legal
and ﬁnance, or market-near business units are all
part of a predeﬁned process of advice to optimize
the incubation process. If the incubator managers
and their staff need to further tap the parent
corporation’s information or networks, the deﬁned communication channels help to reduce the
incubator staff’s search time and ensure the
parent corporation’s commitment and support.
These interfaces also support the exit of ‘graduated’ technology ventures after a successful incubation process. For example, in the case of a
technology venture’s spin-off, corporate ﬁnance
and market business units might help to establish
potential buyers for a trade sale or acquisition.
Once the technology venture is incorporated back
into the core businesses, pre-established contacts
are even more helpful. Also, lessons learned
during technology ventures’ incubation process
r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2006

can be transferred back to the parent, particularly
in R&D or market units.
Siemens Mobile Acceleration has appointed
contact persons in the corporate center and major
business units to standardize the process of support that the technology venture receives from its
parent corporation. A godfather or mentoring
program ensures a close link and ﬁt with the
Siemens Mobile portfolio.
Interface management with functional and business units controls the co-operation of the corporate incubator team with other functional areas
such as production, marketing, and other R&D
units. This reduces the formal hierarchical communication paths and decreases cultural or linguistic barriers (Brockhoff, 1989). The corporate
incubator can view other units as internal divisional customers and try to utilize cross-fertilization through cross-functional integration and the
concentration of staff at the level where integration is most crucial.

5. Conclusions
Research needs to distinguish between the two
fundamental business models of non-proﬁt and
for-proﬁt incubators that support the development of new ventures. Applying the knowledgebased view as a framework to corporate incubators’ incubation process enhances insights into the
knowledge ﬂow during incubation. Contrary to
the hypothesis that for-proﬁt incubators, such as
technology corporations’ corporate incubators,
provide professionally organized advice, our research reveals that there is no particular arrangement for support and knowledge sharing.
Surprisingly, non-proﬁt incubators, such as community and university incubators furthering
social purposes, offer regular monitoring instead
of the assumed ad hoc advice. Of the incubation process’s four phases (selection, structuring,
involvement and exit), involvement is the
most important value-adding process, similar to
venture capitalists’ interaction with their new
ventures.
Four types of knowledge were identiﬁed as
being required by the aforementioned four types
of corporate incubators: (1) entrepreneurial
knowledge in the fast-proﬁt incubator, (2) organizational knowledge in the leveraging incubator,
(3) technological knowledge in the in-sourcing incubator, and (4) complementary market knowledge
in the market incubator.
R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

<-----Page 13----->Barbara Becker and Oliver Gassmann
Entrepreneurial knowledge is about how to
start a company, how to reach a market and
how patents can be moved out of an organization.
Organizational knowledge describes how to activate the whole organization to leverage internal
core technology in business units. External
knowledge is evaluated by technological knowledge for its ﬁt with the corporation’s goals.
Finally, complementary market knowledge provides answers on how to meet customers’ demands and how to segment the market into
different technological value propositions.
The in-sourcing and market incubators’ high
survival rate reﬂects the move toward external
sources of technology and thus the importance of
technological and complementary market knowledge. The corporate incubator enhances the
locus of innovative knowledge from internal to
external idea sourcing. This reﬂects the rise of
‘open innovation’ from external institutions, such
as entrepreneurs or universities, integrating external knowledge sources with integrated R&D
functions.
Evaluating the speciﬁc knowledge modes in
speciﬁc corporate incubators helps to improve
the incubation process and thus knowledge
transfer between the incubator manager, the parent corporation and the technology venture.
Through incubation, four different knowledge
modes can increase the likelihood that the most
promising ideas will be selected and then realized.
For example, Sulzer Innotec increases their quality of realized ideas through a structured selection
funnel of two committees – a general innovation
board and a more specialized incubator board.
While the number of ideas evaluated decreases
substantially with each ﬁlter, the number of
employees, and thus their time spent analyzing
each business idea, increases over time.
The knowledge modes identiﬁed per incubator
type is a ﬁrst step to linking the knowledge-based
view’s conceptual framework to the incubation
process. Further research is needed in several
areas: an in-depth longitudinal study on the
development of corporate incubators’ knowledge
modes would enhance the knowledge of whether
and how knowledge modes change over time.
This includes a quantitative analysis of the phasedependent knowledge ﬂow between the incubator
manager, the corporation and the technology
venture, with a particular focus on the early setup phase versus the harvest phase. The question
also arises as to whether speciﬁc industries call for
more external knowledge and will thus apply
‘open innovation’ more effectively than others.
14

R&D Management 36, 1, 2006

External knowledge integration by means of
standards applied and the realizing economies of
scale is of major importance, particularly in
industries with a high degree of technology.
Additionally, a survey of incubators’ success
factors regarding their knowledge activities would
be an interesting undertaking. How can the quality of the intangible resource ﬂow be measured in
addition to time? To what extent does the sophistication of management know-how and networking quality inﬂuence the knowledge ﬂow in the
incubation process? What speciﬁc functions are
more important for tapping from the incubator
than others? What is the impact of external
branding on incubation success?
Finally, it would be interesting to develop a
reference model for measuring knowledge input
and output to quantify the efﬁciency and effectiveness of the four incubation phases: selection,
structuring, involvement and exit. Our exploratory study provides a ﬁrst insight into corporate
incubators’ knowledge modes and invites further
development and applications.
