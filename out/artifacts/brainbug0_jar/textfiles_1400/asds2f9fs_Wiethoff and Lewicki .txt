Abstract
Most research on trust and distrust has proceeded from theorizing about the nature of
trust, and deducing the key definitions of the phenomena, key components of the definitions, and
important contributors to trust-building or distrust-building processes. While these approaches
are conceptually appealing and appear to have face validity, little research on trust and distrust
has evolved by beginning with layperson descriptions of actual trust and distrust events.
The purpose of this study was to examine detailed descriptions of trust and distrust events
and determine the most appropriate categories to distinguish within and between these events.
Stories of trust and distrust were solicited, and a grounded theory approach was used to develop
codes of these stories. Codes distinguished trust and distrust stories within and across the
following dimensions: types of trust, how knowledge about the other is derived (the role of
reputation), relationship between trustor and trustee, the role of time in trust-inducing and
distrust-creating events, and the role of volition. Implications of these findings for trust
theorizing, trust measurement and trust development are discussed.

Trust and Distrust in Work Relationships
Researchers have yet to agree on a widely-shared definition of trust or distrust (Belanger,
Hiller, & Smith, 2002; Bigley & Pearce, 1998; Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt & Camerer, 1998).
Perhaps the most commonly accepted approach defines trust as one person’s expectations about
another or, more specifically, “the willingness of a party to be vulnerable to the actions of
another party based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action
important to the trustor” (Mayer, Davis & Schoorman, 1995, p. 712). From this starting point,
scholars have begun to investigate various types of trust and the components of trust. Mayer and
colleagues (Mayer et al., 1995) contend that three core components of trust –ability, benevolence
and integrity– should be the focus of trust research. Lewicki and colleagues have argued for two
distinctions: calculus-based trust, or a market-based calculation determined by outcomes
resulting from maintaining the relationship relative to those of severing it, and identificationbased trust, where the parties understand and share fundamental values and can act as agents for
one another (Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2001). McAllister (1995) contends
that affect-based trust is a separate form, encompassing liking and feelings of affection for
another person.
Even fewer scholars have investigated the form and components of distrust.
Traditionally, distrust has been viewed as simply the opposite of trust, or the expectation that
another person will not act in one’s best interests or may perhaps even threaten injury (Lewicki,
McAllister, & Bies, 1998). Others contend that distrust is the absence of trust, or the belief that
individuals will not behave in a capable or responsible way (Barber, 1983; Lewicki, Tomlinson
& Wang, 2005). More recently, distrust and trust are viewed as separate, distinct, and co-existing
constructs within multi-faceted relationships (Lewicki et al., 1998; Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2001).

<-----Page 3----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 4
Not only are there divergent views of the structures of trust and distrust, but all of these
definitions have been derived from theoretical speculation. That is, trust and distrust research has
relied upon measures and calibrations which are derived deductively from theoretical
propositions about the nature and structure of trust and distrust; little work has been done
inductively, in which actual trust and distrust experiences have been used to explore how parties
in relationships characterize these events. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First,
we will explore how individuals describe trust and distrust experiences, to determine whether the
components of those descriptions reflect the significant theorizing about the structure of the trust
and distrust constructs in the research literature. Second, we will compare those descriptions to
determine if trust and distrust are indeed mirror image constructs, or possess different types and
forms. Because no existing research sheds light on this subject, we propose two research
questions, rather than hypotheses:
Research Question 1:How do individuals describe their own experiences of trust and
distrust?
Research Question 2: Do individuals describe trust and distrust in similar, mirror-image
terms or in different terms?
In addition to these two broad research questions, we propose to explore several
additional questions about trust.
Trust development. In the development of the trust literature, there have been a number
of implicit theories about trust development over time (see Lewicki, Tomlinson and Wang, 2005
for one review). Probably the most ubiquitous approach has been to assume that trust and distrust
were opposite ends of a single dimension, and that trust development was a relatively monotonic,
step-wise, linear process. For example, Lewis and Weigart (1985) contend that trust evolves

<-----Page 4----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 5
from a pattern of careful, rational thinking, coupled with an examination of one’s feelings,
instincts, and intuition. Trust develops from a process of thinking and feeling on the part of the
trustor (Morrow, Hansen & Pearson, 2004). Similarly, Brockner and colleagues (Brockner,
Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997) contend that trust is measured by asking trustors to assess
their general relationship with individual trustees. This is consistent with Lewicki and
Wiethoff’s (2001) contention that identity-based trust develops as parties gain knowledge of one
another, usually by sharing information with one another through a series of interactions that
leads the parties to discover commonalities in identities, values and reactions to people and
situations (Kwon & Suh, 2004; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996). This general prescription suggests
that trust develops relatively slowly and systematically over time (although exceptions are
noted—c.f. Myerson, Weick & Kramer, 1996).
On the other hand, research work on trust repair suggests that a trust violation can trigger
precipitous declines in trust over a short period of time (e.g. Tomlinson, Dineen & Lewicki,
2004). Several authors (Lewicki & Bunker, 1995; Lewicki & Wiethoff, 2001) have suggested
that trust functions much like the child’s game, “Chutes and Ladders”, trust building is like
ladder-climbing, slow and systematic; trust violations which produce distrust can be sudden,
precipitous and resistant to efforts at trust rebuilding or repair. Distrust is incubated when people
form negative assumptions about one another and treat these assumptions as fact (Hultman,
2004). This, while trust building is generally construed as being slow and systematic, distrustbuilding may be quick, episodic but yet enduring once created.
Hypothesis 1: Distrust is episodic, whereas trust develops over time.
The role of the trustee’s reputation. The reputation of the other should have a
significant impact on the decision to trust. In studies on the role of reputation in negotiation,

<-----Page 5----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 6
researchers have found that a reputation for distributive negotiation leads the other to trust their
counterparts very little, exchange very little information, and have poorer outcomes (Tinsley,
Sullivan and O’Connor, (2002). In contrast, a reputation for integrative negotiation leads the
other to expect less deception, engage in more candid discussion of interests, and be more
optimistic about reaching a win-win agreement—but not necessarily more trust (O’Connor and
Tinsley, 2004). Burt and Knez (1995) found that gossip from third parties amplifies trust when
pre-existing relationships are strong, but has a negative effect on trust when relationships are
weak. Their study suggests that negative information about a person may be likely to lead to
distrust, but that third party information will be less salient when trust has already been formed.
These authors further contend that third party gossip reinforces existing relationships, such that a
person’s existing trust (or distrust) for another person is made stronger by confirming third party
gossip (Burt & Knez, 1996). Hultman (2004) agrees, arguing that distrust is spread when people
share their negative views with one another. These results about the impact of trust and distrust
reputation information leads us to propose that:
Hypothesis 2: Reputation contributes more to distrust than to trust.
Trust and attributions. Finally, attributions of trustworthiness are typically thought to
be “earned” by the trustee (Perry & Mankin, 2004). For example, specific behaviors such as
truthfulness (Dasgupta, 1988), reliability (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982), and openness
(Gabarro, 1978) are known to contribute to one’s trustworthiness. In addition, research in the
role of various forms of accounts (e.g. explanations, apologies, etc.) has shown that the
effectiveness of these accounts is highly dependent on how the ‘victim’ of the trust violation
makes attributions about the controllability and causality of the violation (Weiner, FigueroaMunoz & Kakihara, 1991; Weiner, B., Folkes, V. S., Amirkhan, J., & Verette, J. A. 1987). That

<-----Page 6----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 7
is, some actors who attempt to deny responsibility for past transgressions account for the trustviolation actions as externally caused and uncontrollable, while those who employ promises and
apologies frame the transgression as internal and controllable (and take responsibility for the
violation by virtue of the promise and apology) (Tomlinson, 2004). The key role played by
attribution dynamics in explaining perceptions of trust violations, and accounts to repair that
trust, raise interesting questions about whether similar attributions are in play in accounting for
trust-development activities. That is, do trust-building behaviors need to be perceived as
volitional (internally caused and controllable) in order for trustworthiness to be assumed?
Similarly, do the perceptions of untrustworthy behavior also require assumptions of personal
volition? Given the paucity of research on this topic, we choose to pose this as a research
question rather than a hypothesis.
Research Question 3: Do ‘receivers’ in trusting and distrusting relationships perceive the
trustor’s actions as volitional?
Method
Participants
Participants were 287 students enrolled in MBA programs in three universities, two in the
Midwest and one on the East Coast. Most were enrolled in a class on negotiation skills. All
students received either course credit or extra credit for writing essays in which they recounted
episodes from their previous work experience that involved trust and/or distrust. Some of the
students (n = 164) wrote about a time when they did not trust someone in a work relationship,
and others (n = 119) wrote about a time when they did trust someone in a work relationship.
Four of the essays were eliminated from the study because students did not follow parameters for
the assignment. No demographic data was collected from the students.

<-----Page 7----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 8
Measures
We used a grounded theory approach to develop a coding scheme. The two authors and
two additional colleagues well versed in the trust literature each read a series of essays and
agreed on a coding schematic. Then, the first author trained four student coders. Each essay was
reviewed by the first author and at least 2 student coders to establish inter-coder reliabilities.
Inter-coder reliability rates for each variable, and frequency data, are shown in Tables 1 (trust)
and 2 (distrust).
==========
Insert Tables 1 and 2 Here
==========
Coding Trust Scenarios. Five major categories were derived to assess the trust scenarios:
Type of Trust, Knowledge about the Other’s Trustworthiness, Relationship With Other, Time,
and Volition.
Type of trust. To identify types of trust, coders were instructed to look for parts of the
essay that told then what the trust described in the scenario was based on. Multiple codes were
possible in this section, but coders were asked to make a designation of the primary type of trust
being described. Then they were to categorize types of trust as follows: Calculus-Based (the
system/environment protected me from acts of distrust, or the rewards for the person to be
trustworthy were sufficient to induce their behavior); Identity-Based (we had similar values, we
stand for the same things); Affective-Based (I liked this person, and knew he/she liked me too);
Ability-Based (I think this person could do the job appropriately); Diversity-Based (trust based
on common gender, culture, ethnic heritage); and Other (forms/kinds of trust that don’t fit these
three categories).

<-----Page 8----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 9
Knowledge of the Other’s Trustworthiness (Reputation). To identify how knowledge
about the other person’s trustworthiness was obtained, coders were instructed to look for key
events in the scenario that gave the trustor information about the trustee. The following
categories emerged: Reputation (other people served as “witnesses” or shared his/her reputation
for trustworthiness); Past Related Experiences (similar in situation and form to the central
situation in the essay); Past Unrelated Experiences (past interactions not similar to the current
situation); Role (person’s role indicated that I should trust them); and Other (other ways of
obtaining knowledge that don’t fit these categories).
Relationship with Other. We also sought to ascertain the nature of the relationship
between the parties in the scenario. These were coded as either Peer, Supervisor/Subordinate, or
Other relationships.
Time. On the Time variable, coders were asked to indicate if the trust was formed as a
result of Episodic (one thing/event was enough to prompt trust) or Time (events over time
prompted trust). An Other category was available for this variable as well.
Volition. Finally, coders were asked to evaluate Volition with the following instructions,
“Is the situation causing the trust seen by the person writing the essay as the “responsibility” or
“because of” the person being trusted? In other words, should the other person be recognized or
held responsible for the situation? Coders answered Yes, No, or Other/unclear.
Coding Distrust Scenarios. Coding instructions for the Type of Trust, Knowledge,
Relationship With Other, Time, and Volition categories were the same as noted above, with the
word “distrust” being substituted for “trust.” When coding types of distrust, coders used the
following descriptions: Calculus-Based (the system was not set up so that I was protected, or the
costs for the person to be trustworthy were NOT sufficient to deter them); Identity-Based (we

<-----Page 9----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 10
had differing values, did not stand for the same things); Affective-Based (I didn’t like this
person, and knew he/she didn’t like me); Ability-Based (I didn’t think this person could do the
job appropriately); Diversity-Based (Distrust based on differing gender, culture, ethnic heritage),
and Other (forms/kinds of distrust that do not fit these categories). Categories for Knowledge,
Relationship, Time and Volition were the same as the Trust codes.
Results
To investigate Research Question 1, frequency data from the coding categories was
compared. As can be seen from the Tables, overall frequency patterns of codes used to describe
trust events were comparatively quite different than frequency patterns of codes used to describe
distrust events. We thus moved on to Research Question 2. We first examined the types of trust
and distrust. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, ability-based attributions were significant precursors of
both trust (61%) and distrust (33%), but used more frequently to describe trust. The greatest
difference between trust and distrust was seen in the area of Calculus-Based attributions. These
accounted for 5% of the trust scenarios, but 41% of the distrust scenarios.
Hypothesis 1 predicted that distrust would develop in a single episode, whereas trusting
relationships would develop over time. To test this hypothesis, we examined the percentage of
responses in each time category for both trusting and distrusting relationships. We found that
85% of trusting relationships developed over time, whereas 8% were coded as episodic. On the
distrust side, results were more mixed. A majority (51%) reported that distrust occurred as a
result of a single episode, while 41% responded that distrust had developed over time. Still, the
dramatic difference between the reports of distrust developing as a result of a single episode
between the trust and distrust essays lends support to the hypothesis.

<-----Page 10----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 11
Hypothesis 2 predicted that Knowledge about the Other, particularly reputation, would
contribute more to trust than to distrust. Again, we examined the percentage of responses in each
Knowledge category for both trusting and distrusting relationships. As predicted, reputation was
a factor in distrust development in 30% of those cases – the second-highest antecedent reported.
However, none of the respondents discussing the development of trusting relationships listed
reputation as an important precipitating factor. Hypothesis 2 was supported.
Finally, Research Question 3 examined perceptions of volitional behavior in trusting and
distrusting situations. Results revealed differences between trust and distrust on this variable.
Specifically, in trusting situations, participants indicated that trustees were responsible for the
situation in only 13% of the reported cases. However, in distrusting situations, participants
indicated that the other party was responsible for the situation in 68% of the situations. There
appear to be major differences in perceptions of the other party’s responsibility when the
situation involves trust or distrust.
Discussion
This study can advance theory and practice in a variety of ways. While many scholars
theorize about trust, and use pre-existing scales to measure it in organizations, neither of these
practices gives us information about how organizational members really experience trust. The
value and power of soliciting their own, unprompted stories, and then organizing their
experiences in a meaningful way, is demonstrated by this data. While many of these descriptions
emphasize aspects of trust that have been reflected in previous definitions and measures of trust
and trust development, other elements have received less attention. Thus, some existing
conceptual categories can adequately be used to explain lived experiences of trust and distrust
(hence current theory and practice are not distant), but these approaches may be incomplete.

<-----Page 11----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 12
It is noteworthy that ability-based attributions were a significant predictor of both trust
and distrust in workplace relationships. Ability was mentioned as a reason to trust and to distrust
significantly more often than were shared or disparate values (identity-based trust/distrust) and
liking or disliking (affective-based trust/distrust). Moreover, ability was much more important
than diversity or similarity in culture and background. This bodes well for a U.S. workforce that
faces ever-increasingly diverse workforces in the years ahead. It appears that competent workers
will earn the trust of their peers and managers, regardless of personal differences between them.
The importance of ability as a significant contributor to trust reinforces its importance as a
component of the Mayer et. al. (1995) conceptualization of trust.
The strength of relationship between the dominance of calculus-based attributions and
distrust is remarkable. This suggests that people may only investigate protective systems, or
think about the costs of others’ behavior, when they feel threatened or unsure. On the other
hand, if all appears to be going well, calculating the costs of another’s behavior simply isn’t
salient. This finding lends support to those who have theorized that many people begin
relationships with a presumption that the other is trustworthy, and that a moderate to high level
of initial trust is warranted (Jones & George, 1998; Kramer, 1994). Our data shows that not only
may there be a presumption of trust, but a concomitant lack of attention to possible trust
violations. Future research will need to tease out these presumptions, but the importance of
further understanding attributional processes in trust-building and distrust-building interactions
is reinforced by our research.
The finding that trust develops over time, while distrust is episodic, has interesting
implications. Lewicki and colleagues (Lewicki et al., 1998) contend that most relationships have
elements of both trust and distrust. However, our data suggest that relationships in which initial

<-----Page 12----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 13
encounters produce distrust may be less likely to develop unless ongoing interdependence is
required. In addition to lending credence to conventional wisdom on the importance of first
impressions, these findings indicate that relationships without a prior foundation of trust are not
likely to survive perceptions of distrust. One practical implication of these results is that
companies should provide trust-building opportunities for work colleagues as they begin their
interaction, so that a foundation is built that allows the relationship to survive should distrusting
episodes occur.
Similarly, the role of reputation in creating distrust is noteworthy. Our findings suggest
that people develop trust based on their own observations, but are quicker to develop distrust
based on the claimed experiences of others. Marketing lore says that a dissatisfied customer will
tell more people about their bad experiences with a business than will a satisfied customer, and
perhaps this is true in relationships among organizational colleagues as well. Evidently, people
with a good reputation may need to continually prove themselves to new colleagues, whereas
those with poor reputations may not even get the chance to do so or may have a significantly
harder job building trust.
Finally, our research suggests that people blame others for distrust, but do not similarly
give others credit for trust. Additional perusal of the data gave us some insight into this finding.
It appears that, when people develop a trusting relationship, they either (a) congratulate
themselves on being able to “spot someone worth their trust” (Participant T-82), or (b) believe
that their own trustworthiness caused the relationship to develop positively. On the other hand,
people who experience a situation where distrust is paramount tend to either (a) attribute
injurious motives to the other person, as in “she was just out to get me” (Participant D-106), or

<-----Page 13----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 14
(b) blame themselves for being gullible, or less than properly diligent. In our study, as noted in
Table 2, the first reaction was much more common than the second in accounts of distrust.
Limitations
Participants were asked to recall experiences from their past, in the context of a
classroom. This limits the generalizability of our findings in three ways. First, it is likely that
memories of past experiences will be inaccurate, or colored by subsequent events or
interpretations. Parties may have reported idealized or exaggerated stories that are not
necessarily representative of their actual real-time experiences. Second, students were asked to
reflect on these experiences while enrolled in negotiation classes that emphasized discussions of
trust and distrust. This, too, may have skewed their presentation of events. Finally, since the
students’ papers were turned into professors for credit (papers were not graded but students were
given credit for completing the assignment), there may have been some social response bias in
this study.
Future Research
Replication and validation of these data will be an important next step. The coding
scheme we developed can guide future researchers to obtain stories and experiences from a
variety of populations. Continuing to explore the differences and similarities between trust and
distrust descriptions is important to both theory and practice. The findings from these stories can
help to sharpen the validity of various theories and models that propose definitions of trust and
distrust, and the dynamics of trust-building, distrust-building, trust-rebuilding and distrustreducing processes.
Future studies should also consider differences in outcomes of trust and distrust.
Similarly, it is important to consider situational contextual factors – such as rules, norms, and

<-----Page 14----->TRUST AND DISTRUST 15
time pressures – that contribute to the development of trust and distrust. It would also be useful
to study the ways that reputations are communicated, and the activities through which people can
convey that they can be trusted, or that a negative reputation should be ignored. Finally, future
research should investigate how interaction dynamics change as trust and distrust are developed.
