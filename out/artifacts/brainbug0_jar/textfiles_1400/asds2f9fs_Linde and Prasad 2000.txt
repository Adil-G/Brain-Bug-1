<-----Page 2----->Executive Summary
Angel investors are an important and growing source of financing for the start-up
and initial growth phases of technology ventures. This study focused on high net worth
angel investors with entrepreneurial backgrounds. Many of these angels invest in first
time entrepreneurs before the entrepreneurs secure venture capital financing. Besides
earning a strong return on their investment, these experienced angels are motivated to
“give back” to the community which helped make them successful. Very little published
data is available on angel investing and little research has been done on the experienced
angel investor. It may be valuable for first time entrepreneurs, venture capitalists,
regulators and other members of the venture community to understand, leverage and
support this growing class of experienced angel investors.
This study introduces and defines the experienced angel investor, outlines the angel
investing process, discusses the rise of organized angel groups, and provides advice for
high net worth individuals aspiring to become angel investors. The intended audiences
are business school students, aspiring entrepreneurs, aspiring angel investors, and other
members of the venture support system.
Some of the key findings of this study are:
•

Angels vs. Early Stage Venture Capitalists: The motivations and operations
of experienced angel investors are typically different than those of early stage
venture capitalists. First time entrepreneurs can benefit from approaching
experienced angel investors, prior to meeting early stage venture capitalists,
when seeking early stage funding. This study outlines the differences.

•

The “Network of Trust”: An angel’s personal network of contacts is a key
element in screening deals, conducting due diligence, negotiating terms,
adding value after the investment, securing additional rounds of funding and
executing the exit strategy.

•

“Not All Angels are Alike”: It pays for entrepreneurs to understand the type of
angels they need and the role that the angels will play in building their
company. We have categorized angels into four groups: Guardian Angels,
Operational Angels, Entrepreneur Angels and Financial Angels. We describe
how these various angel types operate and how they provide different value to
emerging ventures.

•

Systemization is on the Rise: Experienced angel investors are becoming
increasingly systematic in their operation. Systematic evaluation and analysis
help reduce risk, improve returns, and increase the number of deals
considered.

•

The Need to Clarify the Angel Investing Process and Terms & Conditions:
We found wide variation in the way angel investors conducted the investing
Page 2

<-----Page 3----->process, in particular, regarding the specific terms and conditions (T&C’s) of
the term sheet. We devote a chapter to understanding the angel investing
process and explain some common terms and conditions.
•

The Rise of Angel Groups: We identify and describe the recent rise in angel
groups. Angel groups are an important new development in venture creation.
These groups provide the fastest way for entrepreneurs to find angels and
provide a way for angels to leverage their combined skills, time, expertise and
networks. We outline four types of angel groups and define a framework for
growing and managing angel groups.

•

Becoming an Angel: Finally, we explored how wealthy individuals become
successful angel investors. In our survey, we sought advice from experienced
angels on this topic and summarized their thoughts.

In conclusion, the six chapters of this study are designed to enable the reader to
develop a good understanding of angel investing. We outline the chapters below:
Chapter 1 outlines the funding options available to entrepreneurs and describes how
angel investors fit within those options. We also highlight data on angel investing in the
United States and compare that with bootstrapping and venture capital investment data.
Chapter 2 introduces the experienced angel investor and the survey we used to collect
data for our analysis. We explain the factors driving the recent growth in angel investing
and outline the rich diversity of angel investing behaviors. Chapter 2 also describes a
model we constructed to understand the involvement and value of different types of angel
investors. Finally, we compare and contrast experienced angel investors with early stage
venture capitalists.
Chapter 3 describes the angel investing process from deal sourcing to deal exit. We
discuss the screening criteria, due diligence performed, terms and conditions, postinvestment involvement, and exit strategies of angel investors.
Chapter 4 outlines the different types of organized angel groups, angel businesses,
angel clubs and match making services. As we interviewed individual angels, we found
many of them belonged to 1 or 2 organized angel groups. We outline a framework to
characterize and compare the various angel groups. This framework can be used to build
and grow angel groups.
Chapter 5 is based on the advice experienced angel investors would offer aspiring
angels. We outline how to become proficient, and how experienced angel investors are
willing to help newcomer angels. We also describe some investment strategies commonly
used by experienced angel investors.
Chapter 6 concludes with some perspectives developed while conducting this study.

<-----Page 5----->Chapter 1. Context for Angel Investing-Overview of Funding Options
Chapter 1 outlines the funding options available to entrepreneurs and describes how
angel investors fit within those options. We also highlight data on angel investing in the
United States and compare that with bootstrapping and venture capital investment data.
This chapter serves as the foundation for characterizing angel investing.
1.1 How Do Entrepreneurs Fund Start-ups?
Entrepreneurs today have access to a wide variety of funding alternatives. Inc.
Magazine lists 20 ways to finance start-up businesses1. Fundamentally, the entrepreneur
must decide if the business will require outside equity capital for growth, or if the
company can be bootstrapped. When entrepreneurs bootstrap, they do not access external
equity capital, but rather fund growth by using founders’ capital, sales revenue, lines of
credit and other non-equity sources of capital. Table 1.1 shows the options available for
entrepreneurs to fund start-up companies. Usually if there is a need to establish market
share rapidly, entrepreneurs will seek outside capital to fund faster growth. Other reasons
may also drive their need for outside capital.
There is little definitive data on bootstrapping and capital raising in early stage
companies because there are minimal or no reporting requirements on the hundreds of
thousands of investors that inject private capital into small, private companies. Studies
based on surveys or interviews of entrepreneurs and angel investors have no scientific
means of verifying responses. Reliable data on venture capital financing is available
because venture capital companies are required to report on their investments.

<-----Page 6----->1.2 Bootstrapping, Angel, and Venture Capital Investment Data
1.2.1 Highlights from Limited Bootstrapping Data
There are only a few studies that shed light on bootstrapping and angel investing.
Amar Bhide reported that 80% of the 1989 Inc. 500 grew to be on the Inc. 500 list
through bootstrapping only.2 The Inc. 500 is a list of the 500 fastest growing private
companies over the previous 5 years. The companies represent a mix of high-tech,
service and retail businesses. He interviewed 100 founders and discovered they used
personal savings, credit cards, second mortgages, etc. to fund a median start-up capital
requirement of $10,000. Less than 20% of bootstrapping founders raised follow-on equity
capital within 5 years of founding their company. They relied on debt or earnings to
finance growth. Ross Perot’s initial investment of $1000 to launch EDS is perhaps one of
the most famous examples of venture bootstrapping.
Freear and Wetzel and the Center for Venture Research at the University of New
Hampshire conducted a study in 1987 on the financing of 284 New Technology –Based
Firms (NTBF’s) that had been founded in New England between 1975 and 1986.3 They
found that 38% (107) received no outside equity funding, preferring to bootstrap the
operations of their companies. For other companies, individual angel investors were the
most common source of funds providing 177 rounds of equity financing for 124 firms.
Ninety firms raised equity from venture capital funds in 173 rounds. Table 1.2 shows
how many individual angel investors and venture capitalists invested in the rounds of
financing tracked by the study. While the data is fairly old, this study is the most
extensive and systematic view into the early funding of high-tech ventures. The study
does not seek to describe which form of financing leads to the fastest growth or the
greatest long-term shareholder value.

<-----Page 7----->1.2.2 Highlights from Limited Angel Investing Data
Limited and fragmented data is available on angel investing. Gompers (1998)
references and summarizes the research studies conducted on angel investing.4 Two
studies, outlined below, estimate the number of angels investing and the amount invested
per year by angels. The two studies provide widely differing estimates of the capital
committed by angel investors each year to emerging companies.
Freear and Wetzel (1996) estimate that approximately 250,000 angels invest between
$10–20 billion in roughly 30,000 firms each year.5
Gaston and Bell (1988) studied the annual rate of informal venture investing based on
a sample of 435 individual investors drawn from Dun’s Market Identifier File.6 They
estimated that 720,000 investors annually made 489,000 informal venture investment
with a mean dollar value per investment of $66,700, implying annual equity capital
investments of $32.7 billion from individual investors.
1.2.3 Highlights from Venture Capital Investing Data
Table 1.3 (based on Venture Economics data presented in the Venture Capital
Journal) shows the explosive growth in funds raised and invested by the venture capital
industry. Even as the number of rounds invested has steadily risen since 1993, so has the
amount invested per round.
The buoyant stock and initial public offering markets of 1995-1997 has driven recent
high rates of return (IRR). This fact that has not been lost on the capital markets investing
in private equity. Limited partners committed a record $24.3 billion to venture capital
funds in 1998, up from $13.1 billion in 1997 and $3.0 billion, a cyclical low, in 1991
(Table 1.3). Record levels of funds have been committed by institutional investors such
as pension funds (60%), corporate funds (11%) and family/individual (11%). Remaining
VC funding sources include financial (6%), foundations (6%), funds of funds (3%), other
(2%), and foreign (1%).7

<-----Page 8----->Our interviews with venture capitalists, angel investors, start-up lawyers,
accountants, and other members of the venture support system revealed a widespread
feeling that angel investing has grown in a manner similar to the venture capital funds. A
large portion of our interviewees felt that the growing class of cashed-out entrepreneurs
and successful high-tech executives helped drive the growth in angel investing. Many
angels also commented that today’s angel investing is more organized and systematized
than ever before. Chapter 3 describes the range of organizations involved in angel
investing processes. Chapter 4 characterizes the organized angel groups that have
contributed to increased systemization.

1.3 Overview of Financing Over the Early Life of a Company
Table 1.4 identifies different equity financing rounds, the typical amount invested in
each round, and the investors who typically invest in such rounds. The typical investment
ranges are based on anecdotal information received from investors and are not based on
any systematic analysis. Generally speaking, the amount invested in each round depends
on the type of start-up, the industry of the start-up and other valuation determining factors
(such as recent stock market performance). Note: Investors in early rounds often
participate (usually on a pro-rata basis) in later rounds, though they may not be the
primary suppliers of capital.

1.4 Summary and Conclusions
Entrepreneurs starting ventures may have access to a variety of funding sources. The
late 1990’s have witnessed explosive growth in venture capital fund raising and
investing, driven by the buoyant stock and initial public offering markets. Based on
comments in our interviews, angel investing has probably experienced similar growth
over that time period.
Angel investing is a major source of funding for the seed ($25,000–$500,000) and
start-up ($500,000–$3,000,000) rounds. Estimates of total annual angel investments in
the United States range from $10–30 billion invested by 250,000–700,000 individual
angel investors.
It is an important dimension of the American high-tech culture that successful
entrepreneurs choose to invest part of their gains and provide active assistance to followon new ventures. Public policy initiatives, including tax policy, should continue to
support such pro-active reinvestment of money and skills.

<-----Page 10----->Chapter 2. Profile of the Typical Angel Investor
In this chapter, we characterize the angel investor based on interviews with angel
investors, venture capitalists, accountants, venture attorneys, entrepreneurs, and others;
and on data from the literature. The sections in this chapter:
1. Define and outline angel investing
2. Explain the factors driving the recent growth in angel investing
• Economic and environmental factors
• Non-economic factors motivating high net worth individuals
3. Characterize the rich diversity of angel investors
• Outline the attributes along which angel investors differ
• Understand their diversity of involvement and the value which angels
provide to emerging companies
4. Describe the similarities and differences between experienced angel investors
and early-stage venture capitalists

2.1 Angel Investors: Definition and Survey Background
The term “angel” originated in the early 1900’s and referred to investors on
Broadway who made risky investments to support theatrical productions. Today, the term
“angel” or “business angel” refers to high net worth individuals, usually “accredited”
investors as defined by SEC Rule 501, who invest in and support start-up companies in
their early stages of growth.11
For the purposes of this study, we defined an angel investor as a high net worth
individual (with investable funds >$1 million) who invests a portion of his/her assets in
high-risk, high-return entrepreneurial ventures, typically in the pre-seed, seed, or start-up
stage. In addition to providing financing, angels typically support the company by
actively providing advice and assistance with other activities, such as recruiting
management. The “3Fs” (friends, fools and family) sources of funding were not
considered in this study.
We focused on the experienced angel investor who repeatedly invests in start-up
ventures. We interviewed 26 experienced angel investors, of which 24 have more than 2
years’ experience as angels. The angels in our sample averaged 12 years of angel
11

According to SEC Rule 501, an individual must have net worth of at least $1 million or earn more than
$200,000 per year to qualify as an “accredited” investor. For a more complete description of unregistered
security offerings, refer to article by Jack Levin, 1994 “Structuring Venture Capital, Private Equity, and
Entrepreneurial Transactions, (CCH, Inc. Chicago). Further, see

San Francisco/Silicon Valley areas. Twenty-five of the 26 angels interviewed invested
primarily in technology-based companies. Most of the angels in our survey invested in
the seed and start-up stages. Together, these angels have invested in more than 407
companies over their angel-investing career, averaging 15 companies per angel. Angels
in our survey invested over $8 million in 1998 alone, averaging more than $335,000 per
angel. The average investment was greater than $80,000 per company per angel in 1998.
Besides interviewing angel investors, we also interviewed angel groups, lawyers,
accountants, start-up company founders, venture capitalists, and investment brokers to
better understand how angel investors operate. Some key statistics from our interview
sample are displayed in Table 2.1.

<-----Page 13----->2.2 Recent Growth in Angel Investing
In recent years, angel investing has seen rapid growth and increased systemization.
Though statistics are hard to find, evidence of increased activity and systemization can be
found by looking at the increase in angel group enrollment and activity. From 1995 to
1998, the number of members in the Band of Angels organization, a Silicon Valley angel
group, grew from 12 to 110.12 The Band of Angels invested in 19 deals in 1995 and 23
deals in 1997. The average investment per company increased from $290,000 to
$535,000. The growth in activity and systemization is occurring not only in Silicon
Valley, but also across the U.S., in Europe and in other countries. For example, in the last
five years, the Boston/Route 128 area has seen the emergence and growth of at least a
dozen new and different angel groups.
2.2.1 Economic and Environmental Trends Driving Increased Angel Activity
We identified four economic and environmental trends driving angel activity:
a. Secular Trends in New Technologies13
Secular trends in the Internet, communications technologies, life sciences, and other
technologies are providing start-up opportunities for entrepreneurs. These opportunities,
when combined with the availability of capital and the strong IPO and acquisition
markets, are allowing founders and executives of start-ups to amass wealth rapidly. A
number of these entrepreneurs have become angel investors.
b. Continued Strength in Financial Markets and Increased Capital Availability for
Private Equity
The strong stock market of the mid-1990s has provided lucrative exits for VC
portfolio companies through IPOs or by being acquired, both at high valuations, driving
high rates of return. Table 2.2 shows that although the aggregate capital raised by
venture-backed companies in IPOs each year is highly variable, the pre-IPO valuations
and median dollars raised have increased to record levels over the past 5 years.

<-----Page 14----->Large corporations have expanded liquidity opportunities for venture capitalists
by acquiring rapidly growing venture-backed companies. Corporations facing a fast and
competitive environment have found it is more financially compelling to buy a company
with a complete solution than to develop it in-house. M&A of venture-backed companies
remained steady as 190 venture-backed companies were acquired for $12.6 billion in
1998 and 198 venture-backed companies were acquired for $12.8 billion in 1997.15
Early stage venture capital funds have grown in size without similar expansion in the
number of experienced partners. To adapt, early stage venture capital companies are
funding larger but later stage deals, investing at higher valuations in high growth wellrounded ventures, establishing feeder angel and angel groups, or setting up angel
advisory teams to support their early stage investments. Venture capital firms have not
had the time to focus on “raw” early stage deals (deals with first time entrepreneurs). This
has provided angel investors and angel groups with an expanded investment range to
establish themselves in the early stage private equity market.
c. Returns of Angel Investors and Success Stories Profiled in the Media
The media has profiled the strong returns on investment experience by a large number
of angel investors. As a result, more high net worth individuals are interested in angel
investing.
d. Emergence of Angel Groups
Angel groups such as angel clubs and matchmaking services are systemizing the
angel investing process, providing support and information to their members, and raising
awareness about the angel investing process. High net worth individuals are finding it
easier to understand and invest in start-ups.
2.2.2 The Non-Economic Factors Driving High Net Worth Entrepreneurs to Become
Angels
Cashed out entrepreneurs regard angel investing as a way to stay involved in start-ups
without actually doing it again full-time. Though economic returns are important
objectives for these entrepreneur/investors, they indicate that the non-economic reasons
also drive them to become angels. The non-economic reasons are:
• Desire to Give Back: Angels enjoy the chance to mentor entrepreneurs. Having
founded and grown companies themselves, many angels they have empathy for
the extent entrepreneurs personally have to grow to lead their companies and to
accomplish their visions. Angels feel that if they had had similar coaching when
they were building their companies they would have reached greater heights or
not committed some of their mistakes.
• Involvement without Immersion in Start-ups: Angels enjoy the adrenaline rush of
emerging company volatility, but without the 80-hour workweeks and the burden
of ultimate responsibility for the company.

<-----Page 15----->•

Fun, Passion, Commitment: Since most angels no longer have to work to support
themselves, they angel invest because they enjoy investing in start-ups.
• Networking Benefits: Angels enjoy maintaining or building their personal
networks with similarly interested people while helping the companies.
• Technology & Markets: They keep abreast of rapidly evolving technologies or
markets.
• Intellectual Challenge: Angels keep their minds sharp through dealing with the
business issues faced by the companies.
• Creation of Societal Benefits: Some angels, especially those in the medical device
and biotechnology areas, take great pride in the fact that the products developed
by these companies save lives or make people’s lives better.
• Control of Time: Angels do not want to be full-time venture capitalists They want
the flexibility of investing without the pressures of raising funds, managing
limited partners’ expectations and optimizing IRR.

2.3 The Rich Diversity of Angel Investors
2.3.1 Attributes along which Angel Investors Differ
Angels are high net worth investors with varying styles, investment behavior,
experiences, judgement, networks and focus. Table 2.3 shows some of the richness.

Diversity among angel investors is wide. We have attempted to categorize angel
investors to help understand the involvement and value provided to start-up companies.
Our categorization is based on relevant industry experience and entrepreneurial
experience. Depending on the individual investment opportunity, an angel may operate in
more than one category.

a. Guardian Angels: (Primary target of this study)
General Description: These angels are active investors who guide and coach the
management team to help them grow the company. They
usually work with a limited set of start-ups. Guardian
angels can invest significant amounts of time in the
company, especially after they have developed confidence
in the entrepreneur.
Objectives:
They have strong non-economic reasons to work with
entrepreneurs, besides achieving high economic returns.
Geographic Focus: They invest within a 1 to 2 hour driving radius.
Investment Amount: These angels invest substantial amounts in a limited
number of start-ups. They often average $100,000–150,000
per company.
Number of
Investments per Year: Guardian angels invest in a limited number of companies,
(typically 2–4 per year), primarily in the seed stage.
Due Diligence:

Guardian angels rely on their network to source and screen
opportunities. They conduct their own due diligence and
consult experts to supplement their expertise.

Investors:

They usually take Board seats and provide guidance and

Board members, members of the management team and,
next round investors such as venture capitalists. They
provide assistance in other areas based on their expertise.
These angels usually experience high rates of return. Many
said they have recently achieved greater than 40% ROI.

Later stage investors often want guardian angels with
strong business credentials to remain on the board.

b. Professional Entrepreneur Angels:
General Description: These angels have entrepreneurial experience but are
investing outside their area of expertise. They may have
limited angel-investing experience.
They are usually followers and invest based on
recommendations of other angels they trust and whose
expertise they respect.
Angels in this category may be Guardian Angels for other
ventures.
Objectives:
These angels primarily seek high rates of return by
investing in start-up companies outside their area of
expertise, (e.g., investing in an unfamiliar industry). They
may also wish to build their expertise in angel investing

progress of the start-up. They conduct some limited due
diligence on their own, especially if they are trying to build
their angel experience.

Their involvement with the start-up is usually limited
though they may provide market research and other

the company.
Moderate. Returns not as high as Guardian Angels but
potentially not as low as some Financial Angels. (Based on
responses from Guardian Angels investing outside their
industry of expertise).

In most cases, these angel investors are patient investors
with a good understanding of start-up milestones and
growth stages.

c. Operational Expertise Angels: (Our characterization of this group is based on
complementary interviews with lawyers, accountants, start-up companies, venture
capitalists and investment bankers).
General Description: These angels, are or have been, senior executives in major
companies in the start-up’s target industry. Usually, other
angels approach Operational Expertise Angels for due
diligence insights and confirmation of the deal quality.
Objectives:
These angels invest for non-economic reasons as well as
for economic returns.

These angels usually provide active support to the company
(e.g.: take Board seats if offered, provide customer and
other strategic partner introductions, and provide other
operational structuring and guidance to the company).
Not determined in this study.

Having these angels on the Board is usually perceived to be
positive by later stage investors.

d. Financial Return Angels: (Note: We collected limited data on these angels.
Characterization is based on responses from lawyers, accountants, and other
members of the venture support system).
Page 19
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 20----->General Description: Financial return angels are high net worth investors who
have little relevant entrepreneurial experience and who
invest in companies in which they have little industry
experience.
Usually these angels are high net worth individuals who
have made money through the stock market, real estate,
inheritance, and through professional occupations not
related to starting up companies (such as doctors, dentists,
lawyers, accountants, engineers, consultants, brokers, etc.).
Objectives:
These angels are investors looking for high rates of return
by investing in start-up companies and do not desire to be
actively involved with the start-up.
Geographic Focus: No particular focus.
Investment Amount: Often <$50,000 per investment.
Number of
Investments per Year: The number of investments varies, depending on risk
profile, deals available etc. Quality deal flow can be uneven
because brokers, accountants or lawyers supply deals to
these angels on an ad hoc basis.
Due Diligence:

Post-Investment
Involvement:

Performance:
Potential Issues
With Later Stage
Investors:

Usually these angels use attorneys and personal
accountants to review paper work and perform limited due
diligence. Their networks usually do not include venture
capitalists or industry experts that could greatly aid due
diligence.
The value-add to the start-up company is usually limited to
financial support. Some Financial Return Angels will
provide general business and guidance support depending
on their background. They may also provide access to
friends and associates. Their interactions with the company
are varied and dependent on the individual’s temperament.
Not determined in this study.

Later stage, professional investors are less likely to invest
in deals that have too many financial return angels in the
previous rounds. These investors are less aware about the
ups and downs of start-up company investing and they can
become impatient or “spooked” when the venture
experiences a downturn. Usually these angels do not
protect themselves adequately when structuring terms and
conditions.

Page 20

<-----Page 21----->Though the above framework is helpful in characterizing most angels, other segments
of individual angel investors exist that do not align with this segmentation scheme (e.g.,
socially responsible angels do not map to the above characterization). Further, an angel
investor within a segment may not align with all the characteristics mentioned.

Angels are more willing to invest in a
first time entrepreneur and provide
coaching to the entrepreneur so that
he/she can grow with the business.
Some angels will invest in “lifestyle”
companies while VCs will not.

Angels do not promote themselves and
are not listed in any directory. The
number of deals an angel gets depends
on the angel’s network and the number
of entrepreneurs that the angel comes
across. They can be easy to meet in the
right places.
Angel investors do not need to invest.
Angels typically allocate less than 30%
of their total net worth to financing
early stage companies.

The angel investor is accountable to
himself/herself for the investment.

Early Stage Venture Capitalist (VC)
• Venture capitalists will provide
guidance and support to an
experienced team. Some early
stage venture capitalists allocate up
to 70% of their portfolio for seed
and subsequent round funding of
entrepreneurs they have previously
funded.
• Venture capitalists promote more
heavily than angels do. They are
easy to find but it can be harder for
first time entrepreneurs to receive
funding from venture capitalists.

evaluation. Their due diligence may be
less rigorous than venture capitalists.
Angels often base their decision to
invest on their personal (gut) assessment
of the entrepreneur, the technology and
the market.
Most angels look to one or two lead
angels to do most of the due diligence
and will invest if the lead angel invests.

VCs are paid to manage other
people’s money. They are required
to invest in a manner consistent
with the strategy they marketed to
their limited partners.17
VCs are measured on the IRR they
return to their limited partners.
They target IRR’s of at least 3035%. Consequently they focus their
investments in very high growth
industries.
Venture capitalists are usually
more rigorous in their due
diligence. A venture capitalist must
justify the investment to his other
general and limited partners.

<-----Page 24----->2.5 Summary and Conclusions
Angel investors are an important and growing source of financing for the initial startup and early growth phases of technology ventures. Secular growth in new technologies,
continued strength in financial markets, media coverage, emergence of angel groups, and
non-economic factors are driving the continued growth of angel investing.
Angels are a diverse group of individuals. We categorized angels into four groups that
supply different levels of involvement and value to start-up companies. We also outlined
the similarities and differences between experienced angels and early stage venture
capitalists.
This chapter introduced angel investors and their role in early stage financing. The
next chapter outlines the angel investing process and how angel investors operate.

With the explosion of the Internet, new medical technologies, IPOs and
entrepreneurism, there is no shortage of deals. Yet, it is hard for some angels to find the
deals that fit their background, ROI requirements and personal motivations. Most angel
investors establish a venture support network of trusted and known contacts to optimize
the time spent looking for deals. Passive angels without a strong network, often use
matching services to identify and screen deals.

3.1.1 Deal Sources
Figure 3.1 shows how the established angels we interviewed find investment
opportunities. Below we discuss the volume and quality of deals angels receive from
different sources:
a.
Deals Directly from Entrepreneurs
Experienced angels are more open to taking on deals directly from entrepreneurs if
they have a well-defined deal screening process with established criteria.
Angels agreed that deals received directly from entrepreneurs were typically of
poorer quality because they were unscreened by the angel network system.
Consequently, most angels do not want to publicize their names. Some angels will not
even consider deals sent directly by the entrepreneur without a reference or a
recommendation from an associate they trust.18

18

Some angels differentiate between a reference and a recommendation. A reference is a simple
introduction while a recommendation is an affirmation of the deal quality.
Page 26
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 27----->b.
Deals from Business Associates and Angel Groups
Trusted business associates and angel groups are the primary sources of high quality
deals for established angel investors. Other researchers report similar findings. 19,20
c.
Deals from Attorneys, Accountants and Consultants
Most experienced angels do not rely on attorneys, accountants and consultants as
primary deal sources. Angels feel that the quality of deals from these professionals
was not as high as the deals from trusted business associates and angel groups. We
did find exceptions to this rule, especially if the attorney sought to invest his/her
money in a recommended deal and had a track record of successful investing.
Attorneys may be an important source of deals for new angels who are starting to
build their network and who want to develop an understanding of the deals in the
marketplace. These angels tend to use and value attorneys more than established
angels.
d.
Deals from Investment Bankers
None of the angels we interviewed used investment bankers as a source of deals. The
major issue was quality. Major investment banks do not have expertise in early stage
investments and do not get involved. Most experienced angels we interviewed
questioned the quality of the deals they receive from smaller bankers and brokers.
Further, experienced angels with established deal flow do not want to pay for
investment opportunities.
Some angels do use brokers, but none were in the sample we interviewed. One
venture broker commented that he shows deals only to a well-defined set of angel
investors. Again, the “network of trust” was the key element in using brokers as a
source for deals.
e.

Deals from Venture Capitalists

Based on anecdotal evidence, venture capitalists have recently started sharing more
early stage deals with select angels. According to one venture capitalist, the angels
they work with must have:
•
•
•
•

An outstanding and relevant business background so they can add value
A strong track-record as an angel so they are efficient to work with
A “gold-plated” rolodex
A willingness to work hard with the company after the investment is made

As fund sizes have grown, venture capitalists have not had the time to nurture
“raw” early stage deals. They also value the industry-specific expertise angels can

19

Known and trusted business associates are defined as “associates”, who are familiar with start-ups, have
invested in deals themselves, and in whom the angel has faith. Associates are usually other angels. Angel
groups include angel clubs, third party matchmaking and investment services, and angel businesses.

<-----Page 28----->bring to early stage companies. Angels feel that deals from venture capitalists are
usually of high quality even though they require incubation.
f.
All Other Sources of Deals
All the other sources of deals were less frequently mentioned and were angel
dependent. For these sources, there was not enough data to extract meaningful
conclusions. The “Others” category included sources such as alma maters and
associations.
g.
Deal Quality
The angels we interviewed said they received the highest quality deals from their
network of trusted business associates. After business associates they ranked angel
groups, venture capitalists, attorneys and finally entrepreneurs as sources of high
quality opportunities. Other sources such as accountants, consultants, and investment
bankers were too infrequently cited to establish a consistent rating.
3.1.2 Building the “Network of Trust”
The “Network of Trust” is used to identify and screen venture opportunities.
Relationships and trust are built on shared experiences and working with the players
within the venture support network system over an extended period of time. Angels seek
to work and develop relationships with people who have similar or shared experiences.
For example angels who have started successful companies enjoy working with each
other. Thereafter, the relationship develops based on the experience working together.
If an angel receives a few poor quality deals from a source, that source is
downgraded in value. The angel will be less likely to further investigate opportunities
from that source. Poor deals weaken the bond; high quality deals strengthen the
relationship. This mechanism sets checks and balances in the network and helps optimize
the time angels spend screening deals. Time and resources are scarce commodities for
angels. Few angels will consider business plans faxed or emailed without a reference. As
Figure 3.2 shows, most angels rely on their networks to source and pre-qualify deals.

<-----Page 29----->Angels prefer to look at a 1–2 page executive summary of the opportunity before they
consider the full business plan. Angels typically will not sign a non-compete agreement
or a non-disclosure agreement before they read a summary or a business plan and only
some will sign one afterwards. The summary or business plan should allow the angel to
screen the deal. It should outline the market need, define the business model, highlight
the competition and other market issues, describe the product or the technology, outline
the financials, justify the financing need, and define the path to liquidity. Entrepreneurs
can help justify the desired valuation by citing the valuations of comparable start-ups.

3.2 Deal Screening and Due Diligence
In this section we characterize the opportunities that angels will most likely finance,
define the criteria they use to screen opportunities and to conduct due diligence, and
discuss a few approaches to due diligence.
3.2.1 The Types of Companies in which Angels Invest
a. Companies in which Angels will Most Likely Invest
Angels will easily invest in a start-up that employs a unique competitive advantage
(such as proprietary technology or well-protected intellectual property) to capture a large
new primary market, lead by a successful, experienced management team and priced at a
reasonable valuation.21 Usually, such strong companies seek professional venture capital
financing. However, some start-ups may approach angels to build out their Board of
Directors or to accomplish a milestone that will greatly increase their valuation in
subsequent rounds. Most angels will readily invest in such strong ventures, given the
opportunity.
b. Companies in which Angels will Least Likely Invest
Angels cited a few characteristics of start-ups that greatly decreased their likelihood
to invest: poor assessment of entrepreneur, lack of sustainable competitive advantage,
and limited markets.
A poor assessment of the entrepreneur and the management team will cause most
angels to balk at investing, even if the start-up is targeting a great market with a strong
technology. Reasons for a poor assessment can include inexperience in the marketplace,
poor previous track record, lack of drive, personal dislike and questionable integrity,

21

Other criteria may be used to define good start-ups. In section 3.2.2 we discuss different criteria used by
angels. Note: Strong start-ups are different from “hot” start-ups. “Hot” start-ups refer to deals that have
other investors such as VCs interested in them.
Page 29

<-----Page 30----->among others. Recently graduated MBA students typically do not have the business track
record that angels would easily finance.
Start-ups with no defendable and sustainable competitive advantage, such as a
protectable breakthrough technology or a compelling value proposition, are less likely to
be financed. Strong technology students, with a break-through technology that provides a
compelling competitive advantage, can provide the core of a successful start-up. They
can greatly benefit from the complementary business experience (and funding) that angel
investors can bring to the venture. Without a compelling competitive advantage, a
newcomer start-up will not be able to grow in an entrenched or crowded marketplace.
Companies that target small markets are not typically funded by most of the angels
we interviewed. Angels would rather direct their company-building skills and efforts to
companies that target large markets with a defendable value proposition.

c. Companies in which Angels Typically Invest
Hi-Tech Angels Investing in Technology Deals
Most of the angels we interviewed invest in technology-based opportunities.
Typically, hi-tech angels invest in seed-stage companies that have 2–3 people, a business
plan, a working prototype or, for medical technologies, some unique defendable
technology, and potentially a first customer or strong interest from initial customers.
Usually at least one person on the start-up team has technical expertise and another
person has business or market expertise. Strong consideration is given to the quality of
the team. Angels feel that the market opportunity may shift but a good entrepreneur can
evolve the offering and the technology with the market to make the company a success.
Most angels expect the major technical issues for the working prototype to be
resolved prior to their consideration. Angels expect that their investment will be used to
generate sales, build out the product, and recruit and build out the team.
Non-Technology Angels Investing in Deals
We interviewed only a few non-technology angels. One non-technology angel, with a
clear investment strategy, was most comfortable investing in consumer product
companies that could generate positive cash flow within a year. Typically he was the only
investor since he did not invest in deals requiring multiple rounds of financing. He
conducted little due diligence. His personal assessment of the entrepreneur and of the
business plan drove his decision to invest. We have no information on his track record to
verify the success of his strategy.

Note: Some angels mentioned that pre-money valuation was a key criterion for screening a deal, but we did not
get consistent data.

Figure 3.3 illustrates the criteria used by angel investors in conducting screening and due
diligence. The majority of our sample felt the five criteria listed below were the most
important:
•
•
•
•
•

Geography: location of the venture; near the angel
Industry: high growth industry usually within the angel’s expertise
Growth potential of the venture: high growth market targeted
Personal attributes of the entrepreneur and the management team
Track record of the entrepreneur and the management team

Table 3.2 provides specific insights on the screening and due diligence criteria mentioned
most often.

Page 31
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 32----->Table 3.2: Common Criteria for Screening and Due Diligence
Criteria
Context
Most angels will only consider deals within a targeted industry based either on
1. Industry
their personal expertise or on a desire to invest in a high growth industry.
2. Geography

Many angels, especially those playing an active role in start-ups, are particular
about the geography. Most active angels will not invest in opportunities outside a
1-2 hour driving range.

3. Market and
Growth
Potential

Market and growth potential are important criteria in selecting an opportunity.
Some angels define rate-of-return and sales-growth-rate criteria. Entrepreneurs
need to articulate how the market will develop and why they will command the
premier position.

4. Personal
Integrity and
Attributes

Integrity and other personal attributes of the management team are extremely
important considerations in the decision to invest. Some important elements are:
• Integrity: Angels look for trustworthy entrepreneurs who keep the investors’
interests in mind as they grow the company.
• Passion: Angels look for entrepreneurs who are passionate about their idea
and the market. They look for passion tempered by adaptability and
coachability.
• Coachability: Angels prefer entrepreneurs that can take advice from others
and are coachable.
• Commitment to the Company: The entrepreneur has to be committed to the
success of the company more than to his personal control of the company. If
need be, the entrepreneur should be willing to step aside and let a more
experienced management team/leader drive the company. (The entrepreneur
does not leave the company; he/she takes on other key roles).
• Confidence and Leadership: Angels rely on the entrepreneur to inspire the
team to achieve the vision they have articulated. Angels also look for
confidence and ability of the entrepreneur to grow with the venture.

5. Track Record
of the
Management
Team

Most angels consider a strong track record as a “nice to have” criterion but not a
requirement for investment. Most angels feel that companies with a complete,
experienced management team would approach venture capitalists rather than
angels. Experienced angels will not invest in people with poor track records;
however, they may invest in people that have not yet built a strong track record.

6.

Angels place varying importance on the source of the deal. Some angels
consider this criterion as a factor in catching their attention. Others, however, use
this criterion as a means of screening in/out deals, especially if they rely on their
network to provide part or all of the due diligence.

Referral Source

7. Track Record
of the Board

Many entrepreneurs do not have a Board at the seed stage, so this is not usually
an important consideration. Entrepreneurs often want angels to build the Board.

8.

Effort required from the angel: Some angels want to create winning companies;
others feel they should pick winning companies and it is up to the entrepreneur to
create the winning company.

Other Criteria

Different Angel Types Use Different Screening and Investment Criteria

Active Angels Use More Specific Screening and Investment Criteria
Active angels take an active role in the company, often occupying a Board seat or
serving as an interim member of the management team. Active angels typically have
stringent screening and investment criteria. For example, most active angels invest only
in their immediate geographic zone and are focused on one or two related industries.
Usually active angel investors invest larger amounts of money and time in fewer deals
compared to passive angel investors.
Passive angel investors have less stringent screening criteria. Passive angels, tend to
invest in local companies, so they can monitor progress. However, some will, on
occasion, invest in deals outside their immediate geographic zone and industry expertise.
Passive angels usually rely on the due diligence and the terms negotiated by active lead
investors. Angels that normally take the lead/active role can sometimes make passive
investments.
Different Industries Rely on Different Investment Criteria
Differences in criteria exist by industry. For example, some medical technology
angels will not consider a deal if the venture does not own intellectual property rights.
Many software and Internet-focused angels do not consider patents an important factor,
yet only consider deals with a working prototype. This area could provide a rich
opportunity for further research.
3.2.3 Variation in the Depth of Due Diligence Performed by Angel Investors
Due diligence conducted by angels varies widely. At one end of the spectrum, angels
primarily invest on “gut feel”. They will talk with the entrepreneur, ask targeted
questions, build impressions based on entrepreneur’s responses, and, in some cases,
discuss the opportunity with few trusted friends and business associates to make their
decision. Some of these angels rely on the network to screen the deals before they
conduct their minimal due diligence; others may piggyback on due diligence of other
angels or venture capitalists.
At the other end of the spectrum, some angels conduct detailed due diligence. They:
• Read through the business plan
• Speak extensively with the entrepreneur and the management team
• Check the references and background of the team
• Phone current and prospective customers
• Discuss and introduce the company to prospective customers and strategic
partners to gain a better understanding of market interest
• Ask technology experts to evaluate the technology
• Discuss the deal with targeted industry business associates

3.2.4 One Angel’s Detailed Due Diligence Checklist
The table below illustrates the information collected by a well-respected active angel
investor who performs detailed due diligence. The angel uses the checklist to capture and
summarize information collected from meetings and company interviews, reference
checks (e.g., previous employers of founders and management personnel), customer calls,
industry analysts, company lawyers and other sources.

<-----Page 35----->3.2.5 Angel Investment Statistics
We asked angels how many deals they screened and how many they conducted due
diligence on. Based on the numbers provided, angels typically invest in 3–4% of all deals
that come to them versus venture capitalists that invest in 1% of all deals they receive22.
They invest in 25–30% of all deals on which they perform due diligence.
Based on the interview responses, angels will invest, on average, three months after
they receive a deal. The minimum stated timeframe to invest was one month and the
maximum was seven months.
Angels exited their investments in a median timeframe of four years. Recent exits
have taken place as fast as six months. Angels commented that the strong stock market
and the rapidly consolidating Internet market place have shortened exit timeframes in the
late 1990’s. The longest exit timeframe was six years. These exit timeframes would be
longer if we conducted the surveys in a weaker economic period.

3.3 Negotiating Terms and the Term Sheet
3.3.1 Agreeing on the Term Sheet23
Once the angel has performed sufficient due diligence, the angel will present a term
sheet to the start-up. The term sheet outlines the key terms of the proposed financing. The
term sheet usually signals that the investor expects to work in good faith with the start-up
company as they negotiate the detailed terms and conditions of the business deal.
The term sheet should be agreed upon before substantial legal or other costs are
incurred in closing the deal. Venture lawyers can help explain implications of the terms
and conditions. One entrepreneur we interviewed recommended seeking outside advisors
to help the entrepreneur incorporate his best interests in the deal. He commented that
most company resources (e.g., company attorneys) are focused on the best interests of the
company and not necessarily the best interests of the entrepreneur. Usually the company
is responsible for all legal incurred once the term sheet has been signed.
Some term sheets have a “No-Shop” clause that restrains start-ups from showing the
deal to other investors while the terms and conditions are being negotiated. “No-Shop”
clauses are more prevalent with venture capitalists than with angel investors.

3.3.3 Discussion of Term Sheet Variations among Angel Investors
a. Informal Terms and Conditions
Some angels use informal or simple term sheets, or in some cases, there is no term
sheet. As a result these investments have limited, if any, protection. Usually these
investors:
• Invest primarily for non-economic reasons,
• Invest in limited number of deals, or
• Are new to angel investing.
Venture capitalists feel that these investors do not get compensated for the risks they
take. Because these investors are not protected, they can suffer dilution, poor step-up
valuation, and other negative impacts in later stage financings.

Page 36
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 37----->b. Venture Capital Terms and Conditions
Experienced and financially sophisticated angels negotiate terms verging on those
negotiated by venture capitalists. Because they have outstanding business or investing
track records, entrepreneurs are willing to agree to the terms and conditions outlined by
these angels. However, even experienced angels do not achieve all the stringent venture
capitalist terms. They do not have the negotiating power of venture capitalists and they
would much rather invest in a good deal with less stringent terms and conditions than in a
poor deal with stronger terms and conditions. Most of these angels develop a standard
term sheet over time.
Venture capitalists view experienced angels as early stage venture capitalists with
smaller funds. Organized angel groups (see chapter 4) use their negotiating power to
achieve terms similar to those negotiated by venture capital firms.
3.3.4 Comments on Valuations and Terms Used by Angels
Our data on valuations, terms and conditions is limited. Many angels felt
uncomfortable discussing terms and conditions. Also, due to the wide scope of our
interviews, we were only able to collect partial data on venture valuations.
The below comments on valuations and terms used by angels are based on what
angels desire rather than what they actually agree to in negotiations.
a. Valuations
The experienced angel investors we interviewed used a variety of methods to set
valuations. Anecdotally, the pre-money valuation of technology ventures at the seed stage
typically ranged from $500,000 to $3 million. Valuations greater than $5 million required
an extraordinarily compelling story. 24
Valuations are calculated on a fully diluted equity basis. This includes all equity,
loans (if convertible), options, share commitments to founders and lead employees, and
other financial instruments that affect the value of the company. Usually the fully diluted
equity basis also includes the option pools set aside for key employees. The fully diluted
basis becomes the basis for calculating the pre-money valuation.

24

Pre- and post-money valuation: If a start-up is looking for $200,000 for 20% of the company, the total
valuation of the start-up after the investment is made is $1,000,000 ($200,000/0.2). This total valuation
after the investment is made is called post-money valuation. The pre-money valuation is the value of the
company without the investment and in this case it is $800,000. For further information read: Johnson,
R.M., 1997. Valuing Start-ups & Early-Stage Companies: The Venture Capital Method, London Business
School Case Study, LBS-CS97-012.
Page 37
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 38----->Our study did not analyze valuation approaches. Harrison and Mason found valuation
methods to be characterized by entrepreneurs and angels as “arbitrary”, “informal” and
“by negotiation”.25 We found angels determine valuations using a variety of methods:
• Some angels adjust the entrepreneur’s financial projections by injecting their own
market and cost assumptions.
• Both entrepreneurs and angel investors benchmark recent, similar deals to help set
the valuation of the company. This assessment is based on deals in similar
industries, at comparable development stages and lead by comparable
management teams. Angels and early stage venture capitalists develop rules of
thumb to assign valuation ranges for deals with these characteristics.
• Some high tech angels try to anticipate the valuation of the next financing round,
potentially through discussions with venture capitalists, and assume a 30–50%
step up to back-calculate the valuation of the current round.
• Some high tech angels use convertible debt to avoid the battle over valuation with
the entrepreneur. These securities allow the venture capitalist or other second
round investors to set the value of the company in the next round (e.g. Series A)
and provide the angel seed investors a discount to that round.
b. Two Types of Security Offerings
In this section we discuss two types of securities used in angel seed or start-up
rounds:
• Convertible Debt
• Preferred Stock with Various Rights Impacting the Company Valuation
Convertible Debt: Recently companies that anticipate pursuing venture capital in
later rounds have structured their seed round as convertible debt. The convertible
debt is a bridge loan that converts to equity in the next equity round. These
convertible debt securities enable the next round investors (e.g. venture
capitalists) to set the value of the company in the later (Series A) round and
provide the angel seed investors a discount to that round.
We observed that angels target a 30% discount, though actual discounts ranged
from 10% to 30% based on discussions with venture lawyers and entrepreneurs.
The convertible debt mechanism allows venture capitalists to set the valuation and
eliminates the battle between the angel and the entrepreneur in setting the
valuation. Further, it allows the company to raise financing rapidly without
complex term sheet discussions. For example, it took only 6–8 weeks for one
company to close a convertible debt round.
Angels who used this structure expect that the company will successfully secure
professional venture capital financing within 6 months. Some angels attach terms
that specify the size of the next financing and the conversion valuation if the next

Post-Investment Experience and Investment Performance. Entrepreneurship and Regional Development,
8, 105-125.

<-----Page 39----->round is below that level. Further, these angels limit the amount of the convertible
debt to $500,000 to $1,000,000 because the debt increases the pre-money
valuation of the company. High pre-money valuations can deter venture
capitalists from participating in later rounds.
Some angels and entrepreneurs feel that convertible debt, while pragmatic, is a
risky financing mechanism since it assumes the next round of funding will
definitely happen rapidly.
Preferred Stock with Various Rights Impacting the Valuation of the Company:
Most angel investors seek Preferred Stock over Common Stock. Preferred Stock
provides priority rights to current investors over previous investors’ and founders’
interest. Usually these priority rights relate to Liquidation Rights and Voting
Rights. Liquidation Rights allow Preferred Stock holders preferential treatment to
dividends and payouts over Common Stock holders if any dividends or payouts
are declared upon merger, sale, or liquidation of the company. Voting Rights give
Preferred Stock holders higher voting privileges based on agreed terms that may
be different than that based on straight percentage equity.
Liquidation Rights commonly used by angels, which impact the valuation of the
deal, include:
i. Convertibility Rights (as in Convertible Preferred Stock).
ii. Participating Rights (as in Participating Preferred Stock).
iii. Redeemable Rights.
These features can be combined in a security offering. For example, some angels
negotiate Participating Convertible Preferred Stock. We discuss each liquidation
right below:
i. Convertibility Rights allow Preferred Stock holders to convert to Common
Stock at some predefined conversion rate. This right is normally invoked at the
time of an IPO or sale of the company. Convertibility rights can have significant
impact on the value of the company if the Common Stock is priced nominally.
ii. Participating Rights allow angels to “double dip” if the stock is liquidated.
Upon liquidation, Participating Preferred Stockholders will be “repaid” their
original purchase price (plus unpaid dividends, if any) and then share in the
remaining assets as if they held common stock. At low exit valuations, the
Participating Preferred Stockholder still earns a return, while common
stockholders realize little or no return. Participating Rights allow angels to take
lower equity at the time of financing.
The example below illustrates the impact of Participating Rights. Consider the
following cases:

Page 39
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 40----->Case A. Founders sell 40% of the company for $5 million of Preferred Stock with
Liquidation Rights for investors to preferentially receive $5 million but no
Participating Rights.
Case B. Founders sell 30% of the company for $5 million of Participating
Preferred Stock.
In Case B the company is valued at $15 million post-money $10 million premoney. In Case A, the company is valued at $12.5 million post-money and $7.5
million pre-money. Depending on the exit valuation, Case A may be the better
deal for the founders who own common stock.
Payout schedule for Case A
In Case A, the investors have preferential Liquidation Rights. As a result they
have the option of taking $5 million from the payout or getting 40% of the payout.
The payout schedule would look as follows for different exit valuations:
Exit Valuation ($M):

5

Payout ($M):

$12.5 million is the breakeven exit valuation. Below the $12.5 million sale price,
the investors get back only their principal back. Below the $5 million sale price,
the investors lose part or all of their principal. Above $12.5 million, investors
share in the payout at a 40% rate. This liquidation preference helps limit the
angel’s downside risk.
Payout schedule for Case B
In Case B, the investors first take out their $5 million initial investment, and then
share 30% in all remaining equity.

<-----Page 41----->Below $35 million exit valuation, the investors make more money in Case B than
in Case A. Above $35 million exit valuation, the founders make more money in
Case B than in Case A. The best deal for founders at the time of investment
depends on the founders expectation of what may happen at the time of exit.
iii. Redemption Rights allow preferred stock investors to redeem their
investments after a certain amount of time has elapsed, or in specific situations.
For example, Appendix B shows a redemption example where a mandatory
redemption will take place on the sixth anniversary of closing the investment
round and the investor gets 10% annual cumulative compounded dividends.
c. Anti-dilution Clauses and Protective Provisions
Anti-dilution clauses are usually standard in term sheets and protect the angel
investment from stock splits, unplanned stock dividends, recapitalizations, and other
events that dilute ownership. Full-ratchet protection makes the angel investor indifferent
to any changes. For example, if the angel investor bought the stock at $1.00 and then in
the next round that share was priced at $0.50, full-ratchet protection changes the angel
ownership structure so that the original angel investment gets priced at $0.50. However,
few new (subsequent round) investors will allow this to happen. The more common form
is weighted-average ratchet.
Right of First Refusal is usually standard and it allows Preferred Stock holders the
rights of first refusal on future issuance of stock.
Protective provisions usually relate to the sale of the company, certain issuance of
shares (senior/pari passu shares), change in business, and incurrence of debt.
d. Percentage Ownership and Control26
Angel investors, based on anecdotal data, look to own between 5% to 25% of the
company, and typically own 10% of the company in the start-up stage round. High
percentage ownership by angels can deter later stage investors from investing.
As low percentage owners, angel investors cannot exert formal control, though they
often do have contractual controls through:
• Board participation and predefining the number of Board seats: It is not
uncommon after the start-up round to have 3 directors on the Board27—the
CEO, an angel, and one unaffiliated member chosen by mutual agreement
during negotiations.

Restrictive and affirmative covenants
- On operational matters (e.g., capital investments, compensation, and
even approval of management personnel under certain circumstances).
- On corporate structural issues (mergers, sales of assets, purchases of
businesses, etc.).
- On equity matters (rights of participation in future financing; “ratchetdown” protection on future financing if valuation declines).

Founders anticipating raising several rounds of financing should be reconciled to
losing control of the Board and the company after completing the second or third round.
No one investor will control the company but outside investors as a whole will own more
equity than the founders. Strong founders, however, control the company not by equity
control but by consistently exceeding milestones set by the company and the Board
e. Exit Mechanism or Liquidity Contracts
Increasingly, angel investors are specifying liquidity terms such as redemption rights.
f. Key Employee Compensation and Incentives
Investors want to keep key management personnel “locked up” through employment
contracts, with appropriate non-compete, ownership of intellectual property and
confidentiality covenants. Some of the venture capitalists we interviewed felt that angel
investors were weakest in this area of terms and conditions. Some angels feel that it is
difficult for them as individuals to negotiate terms and conditions similar to that
negotiated by venture capitalists, as they do not have the same negotiating power.
Nevertheless, angels are increasingly introducing vesting schedules for key
employees and even founders who are key employees. These employees are asked to
place a predefined portion of their stock at risk for a predetermined period of time.
Founders are sometimes surprised that they are asked to vest their ownership when a
venture investor comes into the company. The vesting schedule is typically 4–5 years
with a 20–50% acceleration clause if the start-up is acquired prior to vesting completion.
Issues negotiated during vesting schedule negotiations include the amount of stock to
be vested initially, the time period or other milestones for vesting and what happens in
case of death, disability, or termination without cause. Besides vesting schedules, angel
investors set aside options, stock appreciation rights and profit interests to provide
adequate incentives for key personnel. The key employee option pool is created at the
expense of the current equity holder, not the new investor.

mechanism by which the management team’s percentage equity ownership can be
increased when certain company milestones are achieved.28
3.4 Post-Investment Involvement and Follow-on Financing
Angel investors can choose to play active or passive roles in the company. We
discuss each role for the angel investor.
3.4.1 Post-Investment Involvement of the Passive Angel
Passive angels do not take a Board seat and play a minimal role in the day-to-day
operations of the company. They stay in touch with the start-up company on a periodic
basis (monthly to quarterly) to keep track of their investment and the performance of the
company.
Wyatt Starnes, CEO, Tripwire Security, a start-up with passive angel investors, sums
up their activity, “Passive angel investors touch base with us infrequently. They send
articles from the Wall Street Journal, market research information, and other data they
come across that they feel will be helpful for the company.”
They want to stay enough involved with the company so that they can decide whether
to invest in subsequent rounds or whether to give up their option to invest. (Most angels
have the Rights of First Refusal clause in their terms and conditions).

<-----Page 44----->Active angels take a Board seat or take other advisory roles such as consulting to the
company. Figure 3.4 shows where active angels perceive that their contributions are
strong.
Note, angel involvement and contributions are strongly dependent on the angel’s
background, skill set and willingness to work with the company. Active angel investors
with strong business backgrounds bring relevant industry experience and high value to
the venture through his/her advice, network of contacts, and hands-on support. Their
presence on the Board gives credibility to the company.
Based on our interviews, we outline the post-investment support which active angels
typically provide to start-up companies:
Recruiting and Coaching Management: Helping in recruiting management is the most
widely performed role by active angel investors. Although they do help identify
management candidates, they are invaluable in assessing candidates and checking on
their track records. They also enjoy coaching the management team, helping them
overcome obstacles to their growth.
Recruiting the Board: Active angel investors help identify, recruit and select Board
members. Strong industry and venture contacts and prior start-up experience help angel
investors identify effective Board members.
Recruiting Venture Capitalists: Some of the angels we interviewed in the information
technology industry, particularly on the West Coast, feel that their primary postinvestment role is to incubate the company and help prepare it for subsequent venture
capital funding. Experienced angel investors have strong venture capital contacts and
help start-ups find the right venture capital partners to support their growth.
Assistance with Financial Structuring: Angels can help with structuring the option and
incentive plans. They can also help craft the company’s financial strategy, including in
raising capital. Many angels have deep experience in financial structuring for mergers,
acquisitions, and strategic partner investing.
Customer and Alliance Building: We were surprised to see how few angels helped build
customers and alliances, even though most of the angels interviewed had deep industry
experience and relationships. Only a few angels offered to attend customer sales calls.
Other Support Areas: Angels also provide support in organizational structuring; defining
and establishing the marketing, sales and distribution strategies and providing general
coaching and guidance. Some angels were willing to act as interim CEO or interim
member of the senior management team.
Our post-investment involvement findings are similar to findings in the literature.
Feear and Wetzel reported that Board representation was the most common form of
Page 44
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 45----->participation for angel investors, followed by consulting relationships.29 They found that
Board seats were held in 71% percent of angel investments and angels participated as
consultants in 65% of the ventures after investment. We did not scientifically validate the
percentage involvement data.
Freear, Grinde, and Sohl also researched the extent to which angels benefit emerging
ventures. Thirty-five start-ups responded to their research survey.30 Twenty-three (68%)
of the entrepreneurs believed that the angels had played a “productive” role in the
venture. Five (14%) believed their role was neutral while seven (20%) of the
entrepreneurs believed that the angels had played a substantially unproductive role.

Almost unanimously, we found that the role of angel investors decreases as
professional money enters the venture. Active angels are often requested to leave the
Board once professional investors participate in subsequent financing rounds. Angels
with exceptional business backgrounds, however, may be asked to remain on the Board.
As George Neble, Partner at Arthur Andersen, describes, “Experienced angels
understand that as the company grows and institutional money comes in, they take a more
behind-the-scenes role. Experienced angels are like parents as their kids grow up. Later
stage investors may put a more professional Board in place to support the company’s
growth. Inexperienced angels, regardless of the level of ownership, can feel that they own
and control the company. They sometimes resent being removed from the Board.”

evidence, both IPOs and acquisitions delivered strong financial returns. They cited some
differences between IPOs and acquisitions:
a. Non-ROI Reasons for Preferring IPOs:
• IPOs are more satisfying and provide more visibility. There is further upside
potential due to stock appreciation.
b. Non-ROI Reasons for Preferring Acquisitions:
• Acquisitions transactions are cleaner allowing the investor easier access to
cash. IPOs can require longer “lock-out” periods and have more restrictions.
• IPOs are too dependent on the stock market.
• For Internet companies, some angel investors found that they received the
highest and fastest returns when their company was acquired.

In our sample, most angel investors exited when the company was acquired. This
potentially reflects the high percentage of angel investors in our sample who invested in
the Internet and other related technologies. In our sample, we found that approximately
30% of angel investments turned into losses. Figure 3.8 shows how angels have exited.
In our sample, we found that most angel investors targeted and experienced a 5x to
10x return on their investment over five years. These returns were based on angel
responses to our questions and not based on evaluating their angel portfolios.
West Coast angels targeted higher returns and experienced higher rates of returns. West
Coast angels predominantly targeted 10:1 returns in 5 years while East Coast angels
predominantly targeted 5:1 returns in 5 years. West Coast angels stated that they achieved
10:1 returns in 5 years and sometimes 10:1 in 3 years while East Coast angels mentioned
that their returns were in the range of 4:1 to 10:1 over 5 years.
Page 47
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 48----->We asked some West Coast angels why they had higher ROI expectations than
their East Coast counterparts. They attributed this difference to their investments in the
Internet industry. They also commented that perhaps angels on the West Coast are more
willing to take on risk than East Coast angels are. West Coast angels felt they had more
and better access to market and technology to qualify risks, than did their counter parts on
the East Coast. West Coast angels could therefore conduct more stringent and
sophisticated due diligence.

A number of angels felt “trapped” in some of their investments as shown in Figure
3.11. Angel investors felt trapped when:
• Founders became emotionally attached to the company and did not want to
sell or commit to an IPO. As minority owners, the angels could not negotiate
alternate exit mechanisms, especially without redemption provisions in the
agreed-upon financing terms.
• These companies did not grow as expected. The companies continued to exist,
“going sideways” or “in the land of the living dead”.
• The management and angels lacked synergy.
3.5.4 How do Angels Ensure a Timely and Profitable Exit?
Angel investors employ a variety of methods to help ensure their company proceeds
to a timely and profitable exit:
•

Before investing, determine:
- The founder’s need for control and ability to be coached.
- The founder’s vision of the path to liquidity.

•

Negotiate liquidity and exit clauses in the terms and conditions.

•

After investing:
- If the entrepreneur does not have the skills to grow a company, bring
in a professional CEO to lead the company.
- Find products that are attractive to the market and to acquirers.
- Determine milestones for the exit path. For example, if the company
plans an initial public offering, they may need to broaden their product
line or their customer base and they may need to recruit new key
management. If the company seeks to be acquired, it should define the
potential acquirers and build relationships with them.

Page 49
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 50----->•

It is important to “get out” when the losses are small. Experienced angels
recommend that angels should take the opportunity to get out of deals that
have lost their upside. “Return on invested time” should drive the angels’
decision to “let go” and move on to other deals.
3.6 Summary and Conclusions

Experienced angels use their networks to source and screen deals. Networks help
angels optimize the number and quality of deals. Business associates and angel groups
are the best sources of deals and provide the best quality. Unscreened deals sourced
directly from entrepreneurs are usually the poorest quality deals. We also outlined how
angels prefer to be approached with opportunities.
We described the types of company angels easily invest in. We discussed the wide
variance in deal screening and due diligence approaches. Some angels are systematic and
detailed in their due diligence while others rely primarily on their “gut feeling”.
Experienced angels use industry, geography, growth potential, and their assessment of the
entrepreneur’s attributes and track record as criteria to screen deals and conduct due
diligence. We also attached an illustrative checklist used by an angel that conducts a
systematic and detailed due diligence.
We discussed the key terms and conditions used by angel investors. We quantified
the timeframe it takes for angels to invest and we outlined the support provided by angel
investors after they invest. We outlined the measures angel investors take to ensure
timely and profitable exit. Finally, we described the rates of return angel investors target
and experience. Our interview results show that currently West Coast angels target and
experience higher rate of returns than East Coast angels primarily due to investment in
Internet-related technologies and better systemization of the angel investing process.

<-----Page 51----->Chapter 4. The Rise of Organized Angel Groups
Angel groups are an important new development in venture creation. These groups
are transforming the venture creation process by their support of very early stage deals,
the value they add, and the volume of deals they handle.
This chapter describes the characteristics of organized angel groups, outlines why
they are becoming more prevalent, and provides a framework for comparing and
contrasting different types of organized angel groups. This framework has five elements:
•
•
•
•
•

Strategies and Goals.
Operating Structure.
Venture Selection and Support.
Membership Selection and Support.
Investment Returns.

The focus of this chapter is on operating, venture selection, and support elements.
Further work could profitably explore the strategies and goals; member selection and
support; and on the investment returns of organized angel groups.

4.1 What Are Organized Angel Groups?
In the late 1990’s, both the Route 128 and Silicon Valley areas have witnessed the
creation and growth of organized angel groups. These groups leverage the combined
expertise, negotiating power and contact networks of their members in executing the
steps of the angel investing process.
To define the terminology, we defined angel groups to refer to all four types of angel
groups. We defined angel clubs to refer to member organized angel clubs. We describe
four types of angel groups below.
4.1.1 Seed Financing Businesses
Seed Financing Businesses (such as Furneaux & Co. and BRM.) are full-time
businesses that provide seed, and routinely, follow-on financing. The firms’ principals
supply the capital and also provide emerging companies with “company growing”
expertise on a full-time basis. These businesses help recruit executives. Sometimes the
principals and employees of venture-launching businesses will assume interim operating
roles to jumpstart the initial operations of a new venture. They typically make a few
investments per year.

Page 51
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 52----->4.1.2 Member Organized Angel Clubs
Member Organized Angel Clubs (such as Band of Angels, Walnut Venture
Associates, CommonAngels) are groups of active angels that use their combined
networks to source, screen, investigate, negotiate, invest in, and manage emerging
company investments. Angel clubs build a club of peers; admission is by invitation only.
Members bring different skills to the group and value to the entrepreneurs. Each member
decides whether or not to invest on a deal-by-deal basis.
Some angel clubs make more than 20 investments per year. However, because most angel
clubs came into existence in the mid-1990’s, they are still ramping up and evolving their
investment processes. Members value the social and fun aspects of investing alongside
angels that they like and respect.
4.1.3 For-Profit Matching and Investment Organizations
For-Profit Matching and Investment Organizations (such as Garage.com and
VIMAC) are profit making third party organizations that provide screening, due diligence
and investment services for member angels. There is a wide variance in the models used
by organizations in this category. We will outline Garage.com and VIMAC to illustrate
some of the variances in this category.
4.1.4 Third-Party Matching Services
Third-Party Matching Services are non-profit matching service organizations that
match angels to ventures (such as the Technology Capital Network or the Investors’
Circle). Entrepreneurs list their venture opportunities with the matching services. Little or
no screening is conducted by the matching service organization. Angels are responsible
for due diligence, negotiation and investing. ACEnet and Technology Capital Network
(TCN) are in this group, though we did not interview them.
Note: Other organizations that actively and expertly match entrepreneurs to angel
investors, such as the MIT Technology Licensing Office (TLO), were not considered as
angel groups. The primary role of the TLO and other university licensing organizations is
to license technology and to ensure that the technology gets into the marketplace, and
hopefully earn a reasonable return for the university. Understanding TLO impact on
angel investing is an area of further research.

4.2 Why Are Organized Angel Groups Becoming More Prevalent?
The emergence of organized angel groups is a natural evolution of the growth and
maturation of individual angel investing. Angel groups seek to mitigate the problems
encountered in individual angel investing. Angel groups address some of these problems
because they:
•

Improve inefficient matching in the venture market: Identifying and matching the
right venture with the right angel is time-consuming and imperfect. Organized
angel groups leverage the networks of their memberships to access more high
quality deals. Most promote themselves discreetly to be slightly more visible to
entrepreneurs.

•

Leverage time and resources for due diligence and venture support: Angel
investors have little or no support staff. They have limited time and resources.
Their operational expertise is often in focused markets. Each step of the angel
investing process benefits from the combined efforts and skills of several or all of
the group members:
Deal Sourcing: The combined networks of the members can provide a
large, high potential deal flow.
Deal Screening and Due Diligence: Part- or full-time members/partners
define and apply screening criteria to new venture opportunities. Their
combined market expertise, technology knowledge, business perspectives

deal).

<-----Page 54----->and judgements of people can supply a powerful and efficient basis for
due diligence.
Term Negotiation: Members familiar with emerging venture terms and
conditions apply their expertise to standardize on terms and conditions.
Post Investment Involvement and Follow-on Financing: Angel groups can
leverage the membership’s expertise and judgement as their ventures
encounter new business issues. The membership can also introduce the
company to other angels and venture capitalists for follow-on financing.
Exit: Group members can leverage their contacts with the upper
management of large industry players (potential acquirers) or investment
bankers.
Other drivers of organized angel group investing include media promotion of angel
investing and the need for some angels to invest with people they like and respect:
•

Angel Group Success Stories are Celebrated By the Media: Just as individual
angel investors have been profiled in the media, angel groups are also receiving
extensive media coverage. Hans Severiens of the Band of Angels has been
interviewed by The New York Times, the Washington Post, Business 2.0 and Le
Figaro among others. Several of the angels interviewed said they greatly
appreciated the positive exposure Hans has brought to angel investing.

•

Networking, Fun and Other Social Reasons: Angels look to network with other
angels for social reasons. Angel groups, especially angel clubs, provide this
benefit. Many topics other than the deal at hand are discussed at angel meetings.

Page 54
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 55----->4.3 Understanding Organized Angel Groups
Some common elements emerged from our analysis of angel groups. Below we
utilize an “Organized Angel Group Growth and Management Framework” to characterize
the structure and operation of angel groups. Angel groups can use this framework to
evaluate and build their organizations.

Member Selection

Investment Returns

Strategies and
Goals

Organized Angel Group Growth and
Management Framework
Key Elements of the Framework:
1. Strategies and Goals: describes the investment strategies and goals pursued by the
angel group.
2. Operating Structure: describes the legal structure, staffing, promotion and
organization processes/rules. Operating structure is a key pillar that drives investment
returns for the angel group.
3. Venture Selection and Support: describes how the angel group executes the five
angel investing steps defined in Chapter 3 (see Table 3.1). This element also deals
with the involvement of members in the venture selection process.
4. Member Selection and Support: discusses how angel groups recruit and approve
new members, how they set size and growth parameters, and how they collect and use
membership fees.
Page 55
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 56----->5. Investment Returns: describes the economic and non-economic returns targeted
and experienced by angel groups.
6. Feedback, Learning and Growth: Angel groups are evolving their organizations as
they learn. Strategies and goals set the investment context and ultimately drive
investment returns. Feedback from both successful and unsuccessful investments
helps evolve the group’s strategies and goals.
In the next four sections, we will use this framework to analyze the four different
types of angel groups:
1. Seed Financing Businesses.
2. Member Organized Angel Clubs.
3. For-Profit Matching and Investment Organizations.
4. Non-Profit Third-Party Matching Services.
4.4 Seed Financing Businesses
4.4.1 Strategies and Goals
Full-time seed financing businesses not only fund emerging companies, but they also
jump start the emerging company operations by temporarily engaging the resources of the
seed financing business until the permanent management and employees are recruited.
Examples of seed financing businesses include The Angels’ Forum, BRM, Furneaux &
Co. and Seaflower Associates.
Among the seed financing businesses, total deal size varies considerably, from
$200,000 for seed investments to multiple millions invested in follow-on financings.
With the exception of The Angels’ Forum, these businesses tend to make larger
investments in a small number of companies.
a. Angels’ Forum Strategies and Goals
The amount invested per member varies widely depending on the business’
investment strategy and how the business is organized. For example in 1998 The
Angels’ Forum’s twenty members each invested, on average, was $25,000–50,000
per deal; in 1999, the average amount invested per member has risen. The Angels’
Forum does not limit the amount any member can invest per deal. In 1998, Angel’s
Forum invested in 16 companies over a six-month period. The Angels’ Forum
typically invests in the seed and start-up stages, and positions its companies for
subsequent venture capital investment.
b. BRM Strategies and Goals
Each of the four principals may average $1,000,000 per deal. BRM typically invests
in one to three new companies each year, along with follow-on investments in
portfolio companies. BRM also prepares its companies for subsequent professional
investment. BRM makes it a point to invest $2–4 million in every financing to
maintain, as much as possible, its equity position.
Page 56
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 57----->c. Furneaux & Company Strategies and Goals
Furneaux & Company has invested in 9 companies over three years. They invested
$1.0 million in 1997 and $1.9 million in 1998. Furneaux & Company invests in the
seed stage and routinely participates in the subsequent rounds. They work intensively
with the company to define products and markets, create early customer relationships,
and build the management teams so they achieve the milestones to qualify for venture
capital financing in subsequent rounds.
d. Seaflower Associates Strategies and Goals
Seaflower Associates started as an angel-lead venture launching business and evolved
into a venture capital firm. Jim Sherblom started by investing the capital of an
informal angel group, then raised a $5 million angel fund and, based on the fund’s
performance, raised a $20 million venture fund with institutional participation. The
investment strategy evolved from seed stage capital to larger investments including
later stages.
4.4.2 Operating Structure
Seed financing businesses have fairly formal operating structures.
•
•

•

•
•

Legal Structures: The businesses are incorporated as LLC’s or S-corporations and
the funds have legal structures such as limited or single purpose partnerships.
Staffing: These businesses typically have full-time paid administrative assistance.
The principals spend significant time engaged in operating roles in the new
ventures. BRM also retains 30 programmers, 2 business development managers,
and 2 human resource professionals to jumpstart new ventures.
Level of Promotion: Promotion can include websites, speaking engagements,
feature articles, etc. The level of promotion can vary widely depending on the
character of the principals. BRM sponsored a seminar in Fort Lee, NJ in
November 1998 entitled: How to Build and Manage a Great, Successful HighTech Company. The Angels’ Forum members speak at a wide variety of industry
organizations such as the Silicon Valley Software Developers Association and
The Indus Entrepreneur (TIE). Principals of Seaflower Associates belong to the
Massachusetts Biotech Council and the National Venture Capital Association,
among other organizations.
Club Processes and Rules: Not explored in this study
Membership Outreach and Coordination: The principals typically meet on a
weekly basis to address the issues of the portfolio companies.

4.4.3 Venture Selection and Support
a. Venture Investing Process
Sourcing: Principals use their combined contact networks for deal flow.

Page 57
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 58----->Due Diligence: Due diligence starts with the principals’ networks of contacts and
then the business pays for expert opinions as needed; patent searches, market
assessments, and background checks on the entrepreneur. The due diligence
process performed by the Seed Financing Businesses is intensive. For example,
Furneaux & Company’s due diligence has several levels:
1. 5-Minute Screen: They screen for location, industry, market potential,
management track record and valuation. They determine if it is in their
area of interest, discuss the referral source, and scope the size of the
opportunity.
2. 1-Hour Screen: They use most of the same criteria as the 5-minute
screen, but develop more detail. They also read the business plan,
assess competition, and evaluate how the opportunity stacks up.
3. 5-6 Hour Screen: Furneaux & Co meets with the management team.
They probe to determine the technological advantage and market
potential of the opportunity. They assess the personal attributes of the
entrepreneur and the management team.
4. Extensive Due Diligence: They contact world class experts to assess
the technology. Furneaux & Co. assesses the market place by meeting
with several customers and researching the competitors in depth. They
evaluate the soundness of market and financial projections and verify
technology ownership. They extensively check the management by
asking each member of the management team for three references.
They ask each of these references for three more references and ask
each of these references for three more, totaling 27 references in all.
Furneaux & Co. spends time with the entrepreneur to determine that
his/her team members have talent, believe in the vision, are coachable,
and have an enormous desire to win. They must be willing to sacrifice
and learn but they must also be strong enough to push back. They must
recognize the leadership role they play, yet be willing to accept their
sustainable position in the enterprise and be willing to make
appropriate transitions, if needed, when the company requires more
experienced management.
Term Negotiation: Each group stated they sought to negotiate terms similar to
those achieved by venture capitalists. Future research could compare terms
negotiated by the types of angel groups to those achieved by venture capitalists.
Post-Investment Involvement and Follow-on Financing: Seed financing
businesses intensively work with entrepreneurs to bring products to market
quickly and build out the management team.
For example, BRM supplies comprehensive assistance including programmers,
human resources personnel, product managers, etc. to shorten the initial product’s
time to market. BRM principals accelerate the company operations by taking on
Page 58
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 59----->interim management positions. It is expected that gradually the company will fill
the management positions with its own independent personnel and that the
dependency on BRM will decrease over time. They invest well over 30 people
days per month after investing in a company.
BRM takes responsibility for leading the next financing rounds of the company
and finding appropriate investors such as venture capitalists.
Furneaux and Company is also very active after investing. They take a Board seat,
help recruit the management team and help define the products to target the early
adopter market segments. They help write the business plan, secure the next round
of financing, and may even temporarily take on the VP of Marketing role. They
introduce the company to other angels and venture capitalists. They invest up to
15 days per month after investing in a company.
Seaflower Associates principals will on occasion become interim CEO or VP of
Marketing until the company recruits the management team. Otherwise, it acts
more like a traditional venture capitalist, taking an active Board seat, defining
financial strategy, helping recruit management and securing follow-on financing.
They typically invest 1–2 days per month per company after they invest.
Exit: Seed financing businesses are fairly young and do not have extensive
experience with exit. Although these businesses may have only executed a few
exits, most have principals with very deep experience guiding companies through
IPOs or acquisitions.
b. Involvement of Members in Ventures:
Members work full time in the angel-lead business.
c. Size and Growth Parameters
Some companies will continue to invest at their current levels. Other businesses
like Furneaux & Co. and BRM currently make one to four new investments per
year; and are assessing the implications of investing in more companies per year.

4.4.4 Member Selection and Support
a. Recruiting and Approving Members
Founding members start the business together because they trust and respect each
other and are committed to the same vision. Seed financing businesses recruit new
employees in a manner similar to any emerging business.
b. Membership Fees
Not applicable to these businesses.

<-----Page 60----->4.4.5 Investment Returns
a. Economic
Return on Investment is tracked by IRR. Because most of these organizations are
under two years old, their investments are still in process and a meaningful IRR
cannot be calculated. Most target 30–45% IRR. Because they are positioned as a seed
investor, Furneaux & Co. targets an IRR that reflects a meaningful premium to
venture firms, which invest post-seed.
b. Non-Economic
The non-economic motivations are fairly similar to those of individual angels. They
have fun being a part of the start-up adventure and networking with others.

4.5 Member Organized Angel Clubs
4.5.1 Strategies and Goals
Angel Clubs are groups of individual angels that use their combined networks to
source, screen, investigate, negotiate, invest in and manage emerging company
investments. Typically, one member sponsors the deal and engages a team of the 5–7
most interested members to conduct due diligence. The angels are not paid for their work,
although they often receive warrants in consideration for extra work. Some angel groups
pay for part-time or full-time administrative assistance.
East Coast angel clubs include CommonAngels, Walnut Venture Associates,
Winnipesaukee Investors Group (WIG), and Boston Medical Investors. West Coast
examples include the Band of Angels.
a. Venture Investment Strategy
Members typically invest $25,000–100,000 in a given deal for total funding of
$500,000–1,500,000. Often members can attract $500,000–$2,000,000 additional
capital through their network with other, non-member angels. Not every member
invests in every deal. Angel clubs can fund many early stage opportunities. In 1998,
for example, the Band of Angels (120 members) invested $17,000,000 in about 30
companies at an average pre-money valuation of $4.8 million and an average equity
stake of 15%. Through October 1999, CommonAngels invested $3.5M in 7 ventures.
b. Social Bonding
Social interaction and compatibility is crucial to the smooth operation of angel clubs
because the members participate on a volunteer basis. Members say they want to
work with people they respect and like. One angel assessed whether he would like to
receive a call at home from a prospective member.

<-----Page 61----->4.5.2 Operating Structure
•
•
•

•
•

Legal Structures: Angel clubs may or may not be incorporated. The group does
not necessarily invest as a whole. Each deal has different participation levels from
different members; some may not participate. Funds are not syndicated.
Staffing: Staffing may be entirely volunteer or supported by paid part-time or fulltime administrative staff. CommonAngels uses an MIT Sloan MBA student.
Level of Promotion: Some clubs are quite secretive and allow word-of-mouth to
attract entrepreneurs. Other clubs promote themselves through articles in
prominent business magazines, being profiled in business school cases, creating
websites and/or giving talks at industry conferences.
Club Processes and Rules: Not explored in this study.
Membership Outreach and Coordination: Coordination is accomplished through
weekly or monthly meetings, email and voicemail.

4.5.3 Venture Selection and Support
Angel club members usually meet monthly, at dinner or breakfast meetings. A few
pre-screened companies present their business plans in 15 minutes and handle questions
for 15 minutes. To present, a company has to be sponsored by a member.
After the company leaves, the angel club members discuss the venture opportunity. If
there is enough interest, the sponsoring angel will lead a due diligence effort that involves
the most interested members. Upon successful completion of the due diligence, the group
negotiates the terms of the deal. Usually the sponsoring angel takes a seat on the Board
and remains the most actively involved member. The other investing angels are typically
passive investors. Here are details on the specific angel investing process steps:
Sourcing: Most clubs source deals through their members. In the Band of Angels, an
angel can sponsor a company once the angel has already invested on the same terms
that will be presented to the group.
Screening and Due Diligence: The group leverages the membership’s combined
industry expertise, contacts and time to determine if the group is interested in investing
in a given venture.
Some groups perform screening and due diligence in a free form manner, often
described as “herding cats”. Other groups have rigorous and detailed screening criteria
and due diligence processes. Table 4.2 shows the CommonAngel’s Pre-Presentation
Questionnaire and Table 4.3 shows the CommonAngel’s Company Presentation
Evaluation Criteria.
The Band of Angels differs in that it will present a company to its membership only after
one of its members has already agreed to invest and is willing to sponsor the company to
the Band. Other members can invest on the same terms as the sponsoring angel.

<-----Page 63----->Term Negotiation: Each group has evolved to a fairly standard set of terms they
apply to their deals. Some clubs regularly negotiate a participating, convertible,
redeemable preferred stock. Other clubs use a wider variety of terms, depending
on the specifics of the opportunity.
Most of the groups have modeled their terms and conditions after venture capital
deals which include demand rights, voting rights/Board representation,
registration rights, piggyback rights, anti-dilution provisions and information
rights. Band of Angels32 and Walnut Venture Associate33 case studies provide
examples of term sheets used by these angel clubs.
Angel clubs typically invest in companies with valuations less than $4 million.
Several said that valuations above $4 million require a very compelling and extraordinary story. Nevertheless, a few clubs have invested in companies with $8–10
million pre-money valuations. It is too soon to judge what the returns on these
investments will be.
In most clubs, the individual members decide to invest on a deal-by-deal basis.
Some funds are considering a pooled side fund that the club would invest, but this
has not happened yet. There are multiple legal issues to sort out.
Post-Investment Involvement and Follow-on Financing: Members’ involvement
after investment ranges from minimal to 3–4 days per month. Members that
invested based on the due diligence team’s recommendation are often passive
investors. Members that are on the company’s Board or that decide to take a
temporary-operating role will spend more time. For example, Bob Carpenter
(Boston Medical Investor’s lead angel) sometimes becomes the CEO and
Chairman of the new venture on a near full-time basis, until the CEO has been
recruited. The Board member is often compensated in options or warrants, rather
than in cash.
The group will help the company recruit other Board members, recruit and coach
management, build customer alliances, define the financial strategy, recruit other
investors and help with business, marketing and technology plans.
Some venture capitalists do not feel that angel groups support their companies
well. They characterized angel clubs as dinner clubs in which members
participated in due diligence, but did not sufficiently leverage their expertise and
networks in building the company after the investment had been made.
Exit: If the angel club retains its Board seat to the time of exit or acquisition, the
Board member will have some say in the terms of exit. Some of the clubs have
been recently formed and have not experienced any exits to date.

b. Size and Growth Parameters
Band of Angels has grown to 120 members and has segmented its membership by
industry. CommonAngels now has 50 members and is considering the benefits and
costs of continued growth versus maintaining its current size. Boston Medical
Investors is stable at 18 members. Walnut has had 16-18 members over the past year.
Further investigation should be focused on optimal angel club size as the groups
evolve and their track records mature.
c. Membership Fees
Not explored in this study. Some of the angel clubs charge about $1000 per year.
4.5.5 Investment Returns
a. Economic
Band of Angels states they have an average 32% IRR. Some clubs do not rigorously
track IRR and the remainder have not been in operation long enough to have a
meaningful IRR. Jim Nicholson (WIG), says he feels more secure making angel
investments knowing that record levels of venture capital are available for follow-on
financing
b. Non-Economic
Perhaps more than any other type of organized angel group, the “fun” factor is
extremely important in a member’s decision to join an angel club. Members of angel
clubs commented that they enjoy investing alongside people they like and respect,
coaching entrepreneurs and the intellectual challenge of tackling new-business and
technology issues. The principals of angel clubs investing in medical technologies,
such as Winnipesaukee Investors Group and Boston Medical Investors, state they
enjoy building companies that provide societal benefits.

<-----Page 65----->4.6 For-Profit Matching and Investment Organizations
4.6.1 Strategies and Goals
For-profit matching and investment organizations represent a wide variety of third
party organizations that match angel investor funds with start-up companies seeking
investments. These organizations provide a variety of services to angels and /or emerging
companies for a fee. They usually have a side fund that invests in emerging companies.
Our characterization of this angel group is based on two companies: Garage.com and
Venture Investment Management Company (VIMAC). The information presented on
these companies is drawn from interviews and published material. We did not verify the
information through other interviews. Garage.com and VIMAC have very different
operating models; however, both companies are financial intermediaries that make
money by:
i. Charging start-up companies and/or angel investors for matching and other services.
Most of companies are not broker/dealers though the angels usually invest in a startup company through a broker/dealer affiliated with the matching service. For
example, Garage.com Securities, Inc is Garage.com’s broker/dealer;
ii. Investing company funds and any side investment funds raised; and
iii. In some cases, earning returns through a carried interest.
a. Overview of Garage.com
Garage.com is an Internet “market-making matching service” officially launched on
October 19, 1998. Their first deal closed in January 1999. Garage.com will identify,
screen opportunities, groom start-up companies and post investment opportunities on
its password protected Internet accessible on-line database called Heaven. These
opportunities are seed stage investment opportunities in technology with investment
needs of $500,000 to $2.5 million.
Interested and pre-screened accredited investors can select opportunities posted in
“Heaven”, contact individual start-ups, and initiate discussions for investment. Angels
are responsible for their own final due diligence, though Garage.com will do
significant up-front screening before they post the deal in Heaven. Subsequently,
Garage.com may be involved as the angel investors execute their due diligence.
Garage.com invests money from its own investment fund; at the same time and on the
same terms as when angels invest. Garage.com also has relationships with venture
capitalists and corporate venture programs to help fund subsequent rounds for the
start-ups. It provides several services to both start-ups and angel investors. We will
outline some of these services later. Garage.com has an associated broker dealer
group that helps place securities.

Page 65
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 66----->b. How Garage.com makes money
• Garage.com charges a placement fee (typically 5%) for all investments made
through their service.
• Garage.com has the right to buy 5% of the company at the founder’s price.
• The company has a right to invest $50,000 to $100,000 at the price set by angel
investors. Garage.com has raised a $5 million side fund (called Garage.com
Investments 1, LP) from a number of limited partners such as Advanced
Technology Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank. Angel investors such as Compaq
Computer Corporation’s chairman, Ben Rosen, have participated as well.
• Membership fees of $5,000 per year are charged for institutional investors and
$1,000 per year for individual investors. The fee for individual investors has been
waived, as of November 1999.
c. Overview of VIMAC
VIMAC identifies opportunities, conducts due diligence and allows angel investors to
invest in early stage deals through two approaches. In the first approach, member
angel investors invest on a deal-by-deal basis. In the second approach, member angel
investors invest in a side fund called “Vintage Trust” that invests targeted amounts in
different VIMAC deals. In addition, VIMAC has raised its own funds that VIMAC
invests at its discretion.
On a deal-by-deal basis, VIMAC puts together a term-sheet, creates a limited
partnership memorandum and passes the memorandum to prospective angels who can
then meet the entrepreneur and hear his/her presentation before they decide to invest.
The Vintage Trust side fund allows angel investors to contribute smaller amounts and
enables angel investors to diversify their investments across multiple ventures.
d. How VIMAC makes money
• VIMAC charges a one-time 11% fee to angel investors for investing in the limited
partnership. This includes a 10% management fee (based on 2% per annum for
five years, the typical duration of the partnership), and a 1% placement fee paid to
their affiliated broker/dealer. Should the partnership liquidate before the end of
the fifth year, VIMAC refunds the unearned portion of the management fee to its
investors. Limited Partners (angel investors) are also liable for extraordinary
expenses such as interest on loans or extraordinary litigation to protect the
interests of the limited partners.
• VIMAC also receives 20% of partnership capital gains after the principal has been
repaid to the Limited Partners (angel investors).
Partners at VIMAC have operating and venture experience. They provide support to
their start-up companies similar to that provided by a venture capitalist. In many
instances, VIMAC may hire an independent investment manager to manage a
transaction through the life of the investment. VIMAC will always seek to invest with
other venture capital companies and to retain a Board seat. It invests in seed stage
companies with investment needs as low as $100,000 and looks to support the
Page 66
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 67----->company in subsequent rounds of financing. Typical investments range from
$500,000 to $2.5 million. The targeted liquidation timeframe is three years for each
seed stage investment, though limited partnerships are set up for five-year periods.
VIMAC invests in information technology, telecommunications and medical device
companies.
4.6.2 Operating Structure
Both VIMAC and Garage.com have raised lines of credit and sold equity to pay
for operating expenses and investments by the company until they become cash flow
positive. Garage.com promotes itself heavily through the media and as a result, a number
of deals come over the transom (up to 50% according to Garage.com). However, angels,
attorneys, business associates, accountants and consultants also supply leads.
4.6.3 Venture Selection and Support
Both Garage.com and VIMAC invest in seed stage deals. Typically they look for
companies with working prototypes, proprietary technology, and lead customers or
prospective customers. We describe Garage.com’s investing process below:
Garage.com estimates that in1998, they looked at 1900 deals, conducted limited due
diligence on 100–200 deals, conducted significant due diligence on 75 firms, and took on
12 firms as clients.
To screen a deal, Garage.com considers the quality of the deal, the source and the
educational background of the entrepreneurs. To be considered, Garage.com asks the
company to complete an online Q&A that provides the basic information about the
company, market, and team. If Garage.com is still interested, they ask the company to
complete a detailed application online.
Based on the detailed application, Garage.com decides whether or not to proceed with
the due diligence. The due diligence process may be as simple as one phone call resulting
in a decision not to work with the company. More extensive due diligence may involve
several phone calls, meetings, and technical and market assessments. After the due
diligence, Garage.com negotiates the terms and posts the opportunity in “Heaven”. The
opportunity is also sent to select investors, who are likely to be interested, based on
preferences they have previously indicated.
A one-page summary, written by the entrepreneur, is posted in “Heaven” for
prospective investors to scan. Prospective investors email and meet with the start-up
company, do their own due diligence and invest in the opportunity. Typically, investors
take a 20–30% stake in the company. Ideally Garage.com expects valuations to be less
than $2 million and not more than $5 million.

Page 67
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 68----->Garage.com supports its start-up ventures by grooming them for angel investor
scrutiny and due diligence (e.g., helping them with their business plan). It also runs
“Boot-camps” for start-ups, provides access to literature through its web site, seeks to
provide media coverage for start-ups through its media network, and provides other
services which may be of help to start-ups.
4.6.4 Member Selection and Support
Both Garage.com and VIMAC seek accredited investors as defined by the SEC.
Garage.com also looks for investors familiar with the high-tech industry and they expect
lead angel(s) to take a Board seat on the company. Other angels involved in the deal can
be passive. Garage.com has a total of 100 angels, venture capitalists and corporations
with access to its on-line network.
VIMAC looks for high value add investors as part of its core group. VIMAC has 150
angel/high net worth individuals in its network. Of those, 50–55 angels and high net
worth individuals are very active. Since VIMAC is committed to managing each
investment at the Board level within its partner base, it can also work effectively with a
higher percentage of passive investors.
4.6.5 Investment Returns
Garage.com recently started its operations and cannot yet calculate relevant returns.
The first few deals have been very carefully managed and have received wide media
coverage. Many investors and venture capitalists are waiting to see how effective,
scaleable and sustainable the Garage.com model will become. In that regard, their
expansion plans on Route 128 are being carefully watched.
According to the information provided by VIMAC, it has invested more than $25
million in fifteen venture-stage private companies from 1990 to 1997. VIMAC exited six
companies in this period. Three went public, one was merged with another company, and
two were written off. VIMAC’s $8.6 million investment in these six companies had a
value of $38.5 million at the time of their IPO’s, merger or closure, $213 million at the
time of their highest public price, and $62 million as of October 1, 1997. $14.8 million is
invested in the remaining nine portfolio companies, which were valued at $19.9 million
in October of 1997. Eight of the nine companies are likely to increase their stock price in
the next round. It is curious, however, that VIMAC did not discuss data through 1998.

4.7 Non-Profit Third-Party Matching Services
4.7.1 Strategies and Goals
Third party matching services (such as the Investors’ Circle and ACE-Net) are nonprofit organizations that bring angels and entrepreneurs together through conferences,
workshops, informal meetings, and distribution lists. The matching efforts are often seen
as a way to promote more capital for entrepreneurial firms in areas under-served by
Page 68
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 69----->mainstream venture capital. These organizations make no investment recommendations,
do little or no screening, do not undertake due diligence and take no commissions on
investments made by investors.
a. Overview of ACE-Net
According to a recently published article34 by Paul Gompers, the largest and most farreaching non-profit third-party matching service effort to date is ACE-Net, the Angel
Capital Electronic Network launched by the U.S. Small Business Administration’s
(SBA) Office of Advocacy.
Entrepreneurs who desire exposure on the ACE-Net network fill out an application,
file financial statements with ACE-Net, and pay a $450 fee to appear on the network
for six months. The company must also have a qualified offering with the SEC and
state security agencies. Accredited investors (based on SEC Rule 501) receive a
password by registering with a regional ACE-Net office. These accredited investors
can view and target the types of investments they desire. To facilitate finding
companies, ACE-Net company listings are organized by region, industry, and the
investment sought. The typical investment range targeted through ACE-Net is
$250,000 to $2 million.
b. Overview of Investors’ Circle
Investors’ Circle is not a government organized matching service like ACEnet, but
rather, a privately formed non-profit matching service. Its primary focus is identifying
socially responsible venture opportunities for its members. The organization was
founded in 1991. Currently, it has approximately 150 members and in the last eight
years members have invested over $40 million in 60 companies. Typically, start-up
companies with investment needs of less than $5 million come to Investors’ Circle.
Very little research has been done on non-profit matching services and it may be a
good area for further research. Below, we use our “Organized Angel Group Growth
and Management Framework” to characterize Not-for-Profit Matching Services.
4.7.2 Operating Structure
These organizations are non-profit organizations though they may have
subsidiaries that are for-profit companies providing services to their members. In the
Investors’ Circle example, the organization has a Board of Directors responsible for the
overall guidance, financial management and for selecting the companies that present at
their conferences. They have two staff members for managing operations. Promotion is
through word-of-mouth and through news media coverage. A for-profit subsidiary
provides briefing summaries to the Investors’ Circle members.

Page 69
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 70----->4.7.3 Venture Selection and Support
In most cases, the ventures seek out the matching services; matching services
rarely seek out the venture. Members may refer opportunities to the matching service.
As mentioned earlier, Not-for-Profit Matching Services do very little screening or
due diligence; it is the responsibility for the investors to do their own due diligence.
Interested investors sometimes get together and undertake due diligence as a group.
Investors’ Circle will perform some preliminary screening to identify deals that meet its
social responsibility charter. Increasingly, however, these organizations are looking to
offer pooled investment vehicles and other services to members.
4.7.4 Member Selection and Support
Member angels usually have to be accredited investors. Little other selection or
screening is done for members. Members usually pay fees to access investment
opportunities and to attend events sponsored by the organization.
4.7.5 Investment Returns: Economic and Non-Economic Returns
Because the member angels do their own investing, the non-profit matching
services do not maintain a record of economic returns achieved by their members. Angels
we interviewed felt the quality of deals in the network was poor, because the deals were
not screened. Many angels felt that these services do not easily leverage the “network of
trust” that is at the heart of angel investing process, nor do they easily provide the human
contact needed as the basis of the angels’ judgements. Angels felt that the services are
useful in providing a quick scan of technologies and markets targeted by new ventures.
Increasingly, matching services offer conferences and seminars to increase the
interaction and learning among members. Investors’ Circle, for example, has conferences
twice a year to educate members on venturing. These events allow members to interact
with each other and enable companies looking for funding to present to investors.
Garage.com has started a showcase breakfast series, in which companies present to
interested angels.

4.8 Summary and Conclusions
The rise of organized angel groups makes it easier for prospective angels to invest. A
natural evolution is occurring as venture capitalists focus on larger and later rounds while
angel groups focus on the seed and start-up stages.
We expect to see the growth of all types of angel groups, especially the popular angel
club format. Angel clubs may find increased synergy by working together on
opportunities.

5.1 Advice from Experienced Angel Investors
5.1.1 Motivation: Understand the Reasons for Becoming an Angel
While most angels acknowledge that return on investment is an important part of their
motivation, for many angels, it is not the most important motivating factor. As discussed
in Chapter 2, angels invest in emerging companies not just for economic returns but also
for personal benefits:

Giving Back to Aspiring Entrepreneurs: Angels enjoy the chance to mentor
entrepreneurs. Many angels have been through the process of founding and
growing companies. They have empathy for the growing pains of the companies
and the entrepreneurs. They feel they can help entrepreneurs avoid common
mistakes and help their companies achieve grander goals.
Involvement with Entrepreneurs and Emerging Companies: Angels enjoy the
adrenaline rush of emerging company volatility but without the 80-hour
workweeks and the burden of ultimate responsibility for the company.
Networking Benefits: Angels enjoy maintaining or building their personal
networks with similarly interested people, while helping new ventures.
Technology and Markets: They enjoy keeping abreast of rapidly evolving
technologies or markets.
Intellectual Challenge: Angels keep their minds sharp by dealing with the
business issues faced by the companies they invest in.
Societal Benefits: Some angels take great pride in the fact that their companies
improve people’s lives through technology.
Control of Time: Angels do not desire a full-time venture capital career. They
want the flexibility of investing without the pressures of raising capital or
managing IRR for their funds.

Experienced angels felt that recent high returns from investing in emerging
companies should not be the only driver to invest as an angel. They advised that if an
angel’s only objective is to earn a high rate of return, they should consider investing in
venture funds. Venture funds do not require the time and effort of angel investing.
Several angels commented that the recent high returns achieved by angels and venture
capitalists are probably not sustainable over the long term. Angels who have invested for
longer than 10 years know that returns are cyclical with the stock, acquisition or IPO
markets. As seen in Chapter 1, The IRR of the Venture Capital industry dipped below
10% for several years in the early 1990’s. Angel investors probably did not achieve better
returns during that period. Angels that have invested through good times and bad are
driven primarily by the non-economic benefits of angel investing.
5.1.2 Temperament: Certain Key Personality Attributes Are Needed
Angel investing is not for everyone. Prospective angels should consider the
following:
•

Willingness to lose entire investment in a start-up: Many angels advise that if
the investor cannot face losing the entire investment in a company, either
emotionally or financially, he/she should not become an angel investor.

•

Ability to incorporate and adapt to new information: An angel investor should
be able to deal well with volatility and uncertainty and be able to adapt to new
information. Bill Sahlman, Professor of Entrepreneurial Finance at Harvard
Business School and an experienced angel investor, comments, “The journey
of an emerging company is a roller coaster, not a rocket ship. Every company
experiences volatility. Early stage investors need to be able to see beyond the
Page 72
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 73----->obstacles and clearly assess the potential of the venture. The outcome is never
certain; the opportunity is often not clearly defined at first. Sometimes new
information blocks the original premise of the business plan and presents new
opportunities.”
•

Ability to assess entrepreneurs: Many angels rank people-assessment skills as
very important. The early stage investor has to be able to assess the
entrepreneur’s ability to adapt to new conditions without losing focus or
spinning the company out of control. The angel is required to judge when to
keep helping, when to advise that a change in management be made, and
when to pull the plug.

•

Willingness to let someone else manage the show: High net worth
entrepreneurs are accustomed to controlling and driving their companies. As
angel investors, such entrepreneurs should feel comfortable with someone else
running the show, even when the situation seems bad.
Kanwal Rekhi sums it up, “At the end, you want to make sure it is the
entrepreneur’s deal and not yours. The primary job of an angel is to identify
winners vs. making winners. If you want to control and drive success in a
start-up, you should continue being an entrepreneur.”

5.1.3 Fundamentals: Learn the Basics of Angel Investing
Several angel investors and venture capitalists indicated that angels should educate
themselves on the fundamentals of angel investing. James Marten, who has founded five
medical companies, commented that there are aspects of angel investing that
entrepreneurs may or may not have learned in their operating experience. These items can
be learned by working with other angels, through interviews with members in the venture
support system (lawyers, accountants, other angels and others), and ultimately through
practice. Fundamentals include:
- Due diligence criteria relevant to the industry of the investment.
- Standard terms in the term sheet and their implications to the angel investor.
Protective provisions in the term sheet (How not to get mugged).
- Deal structure, development stages, milestones and valuations for companies
in high-growth industries.
- Board member best practices (Organizations such as the National Association
of Corporate Directors and Stanford University have materials and programs
dealing with Board membership).
- Conventions in executive compensation and options plans.
- Intellectual property: value in relevant industries.
- Raising capital and preparing the company for professional funding: the right
stage, the right milestones, the right management to justify the right valuation.
- Exit Strategy: the securities restrictions on the alternatives.
- Financial Strategy: sources of capital over the life of the start-up company.

<-----Page 74----->5.1.4 Experience: Build the Angel Investing Experience Base
Experienced angels recommended three ways to build an angel investing experience
base:
a. Use prior business experience.
b. Learn by doing.
c. Learn through investing with successful, experienced angels.
a. Use prior business experience
A majority of the angels interviewed advised prospective angels to invest in industries
and businesses they understand. Their prior experience can often provide substantial
value to start-up companies. A few angels commented that their poorest investments
were in areas where they lacked expertise.
The angels in our sample have extensive operating experience in growing small, high
tech companies and/or founding one or more companies. Individuals who most easily
stepped into the angel-investing role had business experience that taught them many
of the critical success factors of angel investing. Former venture capitalists, founders
of one or more successful companies or top management of successful start-ups bring
several or all of the following elements:
• Track record in launching companies: credibility and operational expertise.
• Extensive industry contacts.
• In-depth knowledge of a specific technology or market.
• Entrepreneurial agility to quickly target first products or markets.
• Knowledge of terms, valuations milestones for early financings.
• Knowledge of negotiating acquisitions and/or IPOs.
• Ability to assess management talent and make tough decisions.
• Ability to create new markets with limited resources.
While it is difficult for one individual to be proficient in all of these areas, successful
angels have found ways to supplement and build the skills they do not have.
b. Learn by doing
Many angels said the best way to learn angel investing was to “just do it”. Several
angels thought it was important to be actively involved with a small number of
companies. They advised spending the time to learn how emerging ventures grow and
to learn how to work with the entrepreneur and management as they dealt with
obstacles. James Dow recommended paying attention both to everything that goes on
both within the start-up company and in its industry. Kanwal Rekhi emphasizes that
angels should be willing to work hard for their companies, “Angels should expect to
match capital with energy.”
Some advised to take the time to learn from disasters and near disasters as well as
successes. As one angel stated, “No book can leave an imprint on you like the
experience of losing fifty thousand dollars.”
Page 74
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 75----->c. Learn through investing with successful, experienced angels
Angels employ a wide variety of approaches to the angel investing process, as
discussed in detail in Chapter 3. Many commented that they gained valuable insights
by working with other angels, angel groups or venture capitalists to improve their
angel investing processes. Carol Sands, founder of the Angels’ Forum, interviewed
200 people in the venture support system and crystallized the best practices. She then
recruited a group of advisors, created a model for her angel investing process and
launched her full-time angel business.
Working with experienced angels can improve the angel investing process in several
ways:
• Overall Investing Process: Experienced angels can help new angels
understand company growth issues, the investing process, investing strategies
and the language.
• Due diligence: Experienced angels know the few important items to check in a
new venture in a specific industry. They know the experts to contact to resolve
critical issues. Many are fairly systematic in their due diligence processes.
• Terms: Experienced angels know the standard terms and valuations that apply
to companies in a given industry and at a given stage. They know the terms
that will allow venture capitalists to invest in later stages.
• Post-investment involvement and follow-on rounds: Experienced angels know
how to serve as effective Board members, and how to help companies achieve
the milestones required for the next financing rounds.
• Exit: Experienced angels know the benefits and problems of alternative exit
strategies.
Members of angel clubs highly recommended joining an angel club because the
members all benefit from the collective perspectives, networks and negotiating power
of the group.
5.1.5 Network: Building the Angel Network
An angel’s network is crucial at each stage of the angel investing process. The
contacts in an angel’s network can provide high quality deals, expert assessments in due
diligence, and valuable perspectives on terms, valuations and Board involvement. The
network is also helpful when the company goes public or is seeking to be acquired.
Angels need to build and maintain their bridges to other experienced angels, angel
groups, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs as well as to lawyers, accountants,
consultants and industry experts.
Some of the best starting points for building a network are start-up related lawyers
and accountants, as well as other angels and angels groups. Start-up company lawyers
and accountants have a vested interest in introducing their clients to investors and
especially to investors with skills and resources to help grow their client company. As
with all networking, strong references help in setting up meetings.
Page 75
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 76----->Matchmaking services such as TCN and Garage.com allow angel investors to become
familiar with deals in the market. Matchmaking services are easy to join if angels meet
basic criteria. Some angels build their networks by speaking at clubs (e.g., Churchill
Club), the MIT Sloan Venture Capital Conference, the MIT Enterprise Forum and other
venture-related sessions at universities, law firms and accounting firms. It is crucial,
thereafter, to build a good track record.
5.1.6 Capital: Understand How Much Capital to Put at Risk
When investing, many angels recommend starting with small investments because the
missteps in early deals can cause the entire investment to be wiped out. James Dow
advises setting size of investment and risk guidelines you can live with and to start
investing with small amounts because early learning can be costly.
Angels in our sample set guidelines for the fraction of their net worth they are willing
to place in high risk, early stage investments. Experienced angels in our sample invested
22.5% of their investable net worth in multiple start-up ventures. Typically, angels in our
sample invested 4.5–5.0% of their investable net worth in a given year in start-up
ventures.
Figure 5.2 shows the distribution of total start-up investment as a percentage of
investable net worth. Figure 5.3 illustrates the percent of investable net worth that
experienced angels invest in emerging ventures each year. Investable net worth does not
include angel investment in residences and other personal fixed assets.

Experienced angels recommended against “betting the ranch” because of the volatile
nature of start-ups. One angel advised new angels to be ruthless about selling, he said he
made much of his money by selling before the company value had peaked. Bernard
Bausch said. “Nobody ever went broke taking a profit.”
5.1.7 Financing: Understand What the Next Round Investors Value the Most
Investors in emerging companies should define the valuation and milestones needed
to bring in the next round of investors. They should feel comfortable that the current
round of financing will be invested to reduce the risk factors that will most improve the
valuation of the company in the eyes of the next round investors.
Venture capitalists can help define valuation in subsequent rounds. The step-up
calculation allows angels to understand how seed valuations set the stage of later
investors. High valuations in early stages can deter later stage investors from investing in
the later rounds. Low valuations do not adequately compensate for the risks taken by the
angel or the entrepreneur.

5.1.8 Tools: Use Resources and Tools to Leverage Your Time
Some experienced angels have chosen to build a library of tools and resources for use
and re-use. Some of the tools and resources they suggested:
• Guidelines for types of deals they will consider.
• Due diligence outline.
• Standard term sheet as a starting point for investing.

<-----Page 78----->5.2 How Experienced Angel Investors are Willing to Help
High Net Worth Individuals Aspiring to Become Angels
Figure 5.4 shows how experienced angel investors in our study are willing to help
high net worth individuals to become angels. Most of the angels interviewed are willing
to speak at seminars or be interviewed by magazines. Experienced angels feel that
seminars and magazine interviews can raise the awareness about the common pitfalls and
process of angel.
Some will help aspiring angels by working with them on prospective deals, especially
if the aspiring angel brings a good deal to the experienced angel and can add value.
However, many indicated that they would only do this for the associates and family
members they wanted to mentor. Angel club members recommend that aspiring angels
join angel groups to meet other angels.

<-----Page 79----->5.3 Illustrative Investing Strategies Used by Experienced Angel Investors
Below, we examine two ways to build an angel investment portfolio and look at four
different investment strategies. This list is not comprehensive and any one angel may use
more than one investment strategy in their portfolio. We have also not analyzed which
strategies are more effective or whether they are valid strategies.
5.3.1 Portfolio Management Strategy #1: Diversification
Strategy:

Angels using this strategy invest in early stage deals, not in later rounds.
They place small bets on many companies each year.

Rationale:

•

•

•
•

Early stage successful deals can give 10–20x return on investment. As
a result, the angel only has to have 1–2 successful deals out of 20 to
make a profit. These angels feel that they can pick enough winners to
beat these odds. They feel they can effectively assess the people and the
concepts, which are often the basis for early stage investing.
In the later stages, these angels feel that both the risks and the return
potential decline. In their minds, the risk reduction does not
compensate for the reduction in potential return. Also, in the later
rounds, it is important to perform a more extensive due diligence on the
management, market, company and products, which requires
considerable time and effort.
The support required in later stages is more related to building the
company infrastructure. Angels may not have the time or expertise to
conduct such analyses or to provide the required support.
Angels using this diversification strategy typically will not devote
much time to each company.

5.3.2 Portfolio Management Strategy #2: Targeted High Yield Investments
Strategy:

Angels using this strategy invest substantial funds and effort in a few
opportunities that can benefit from their industry and operational expertise.

Rationale:

•

•

•

This strategy is a high involvement strategy. The angel strongly
believes in the opportunity and allocates significant investments of
funds and effort to help launch the company. Opportunities are in the
angel’s area of expertise.
These angels feel they can leverage their network and contribute to
building value/reducing risk in the company by helping build the team,
finding funding and identifying potential alliance partners or customers
by leveraging their network.
Usually angels using this strategy are very focused. They will take a
Board seat, work actively with the entrepreneur, and sometimes take on
an interim management role.
Page 79
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 80----->5.3.3 Rapid “Tee Up” for Subsequent VC Funding
Strategy:

•

•
•

Some angels select companies that have the potential for venture
capital funding. These ventures are often too “raw” for venture
capitalists to finance. Alternatively, the entrepreneur may want to
engage an angel as a high profile Board member to help justify a higher
valuation when seeking VC funds.
The angel’s involvement can help the company achieve key milestones
more rapidly (thereby reducing risk) to qualify for VC funding.
They structure the deal so that it is easy for venture capitalists to
finance the next round (e.g., use convertible debt that converts at a
discount when the VC invests).

Note: We found this strategy popular with Silicon Valley high tech angels.
Rationale:

•
•
•
•

These angels feel they can identify winners, help build out teams,
recruit the Board and position companies for financing by top-tier
venture capitalists.
They believe their involvement can accelerate company development
and achieve milestones that take the company to the next valuation
level.
They position the companies for VC funding because they feel venture
capitalists provide the support to quickly make start-ups successful.
Convertible debt allows the venture capitalist to set the valuation
thereby eliminating over-valuation by the angel investors

5.3.4 Invest in Retail Companies 1-Year Away from Becoming Cash Flow Positive
Strategy:

•
•
•

Rationale:

•

These angels seek retail and other non-technology companies with
significant growth and margin potential and real customers.
Companies should be one year away from becoming cash flow positive.
The are often the only investor in the company. Subsequent funding
should come from cash generated by the business.
They feel that they can only invest in real customers and real margins.
This strategy was not mainstream to our study.

5.4 Summary and Conclusions
Angels employ a variety of portfolio management and investment strategy
techniques depending on their style, time available and financial resources. Experienced
angels emphasized the importance of investing with people you respect and trust, to build
early stage investing expertise.

Page 80
2000 MIT Entrepreneurship Center

<-----Page 81----->Chapter 6. Perspectives
The angel investors interviewed for this study had impressive records of business
success. However, we found they were down-to-earth, approachable and very willing to
share their insights on investing in emerging companies. Perhaps most striking, is their
passion and commitment to “give back” to entrepreneurs and the businesses they build.
Despite the fact that each of these individuals has earned the right to retire, they choose to
share their experience and invest their efforts in the roller coaster world of business
creation. They work hard because they want to not because they have to. These angels
invest in early stage companies because they love the excitement of new venture startups. The insights, skills and funds they bring to emerging ventures are invaluable
resources.
We were surprised at the lack of data on angel investing. As we constructed
frameworks to characterize angel investors and angel groups, we found opportunities for
further research:
• The impact of investment strategy and Ts & Cs on multi-year returns.
• Specific detail on the role angels play in launching companies; e.g., impact of
recruiting and coaching management, accessing strategic customers, etc.
• Further research on the characterization and evolution of organized angel groups:
- Impact of investment strategy on returns.
- Member selection and support.
- Evolution of angel clubs and seed financing businesses.
• The role of the MIT Technology Licensing Office (TLO) in launching new
ventures.
• How angels successfully prepare and hand-off companies to VCs.
• How angels help the culture of the firms in which they invest, particularly with
regard to sales.
We hope that this study will help aspiring angels quickly develop the skills to invest
effectively. We also hope our work allows entrepreneurs, venture capitalists and other
members of the venture support system to better understand and work with angels.
Though we conducted interviews only in the Silicon Valley and the Boston areas, the
findings may be applicable to other areas of the US and overseas. Angels and angel
groups in other parts of the United States (and abroad) can be located through the MIT
Enterprise Forum local universities, small business development agencies, venture law
firms, venture related accountants and web searches for angel funds.
We are very interested in the current evolution of organized angel groups. The
organized angel group framework starts to outline the critical elements for employing the
power of angels investing in groups. We would be very interested in feedback as angel
groups evolve their models.

Company B (the “Company”)
Summary of Terms
Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock
To be Purchased by Individual Early-Stage Investors (Collectively “Angels”)
January 14, 1999
Summary:

This Angel round is intended to be provide Company B with seed capital and
advice from the Angels to help Company B grow rapidly and attract
additional Venture Capital (“VC”). It is proposed to be done at a valuation of
the lower of: $3,000,000, or a price such that there is a 30%-50% step-up to
the next VC round, depending on its timing, at terms no worse than future
rounds of financing. In the event there is no next round, because the
company self-funds or is sold, then the terms and conditions proposed are
those typically entered into in a VC round.

1. Amount and
Security:

$500,000 -$750,000 Series A Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock.
Company is or will be incorporated as a C Corp. in Mass. or Delaware.
Angels consists of individual accredited investors who are, individually,
solely responsible for their investment decisions and who each understand
the risks and have experience with investments in early-stage companies.
They are affiliated with Angel Club X, which has no involvement in this
transaction whatsoever, other than to have facilitated introductions between
the Company and Angels. Total investment amount to be estimated at time
term sheet is accepted. No commitment to close at this amount can be made,
and the amounts may vary as Angels make their decisions individually based
on terms, due diligence and advice of their counsel.

2. Price:

$3,000,000 pre-money valuation. Share price to be based on the fully diluted,
as-converted basis of: all equity, options, loans (if convertible), share
commitments to founders and lead employees, and a 20% option pool for
key employees to be recruited; by dividing $3,000,000 by the fully-diluted
total number of shares.

3. Adjustable
Warrant:

To provide an incentive to Angels for their early involvement and advice,
each Series A investor will receive an adjustable warrant to purchase
additional Series A at a price of $0.01 per share, the number to be
determined by the next round valuation. The next round to be considered as
the basis for a final computation of the adjustable warrant, shall be the next
one in which at least $2,000,000 is raised by the Company (the “New
Round”). The warrant shall expire and not be exercisable if the New Round
is raised at a per share price of at least 50% above the share price of the
Series A shares, on an as converted basis. Otherwise, the warrant will
convert into sufficient shares so that there is a 30% step-up in the effective
Page B-1

<-----Page 88----->price per share to the New Round, if completed within 3 months of closing;
or, the warrant will convert into that number of shares so that there is a 40%
step-up in the effective price per share if the New Round is completed
between 3 and 6 months from the closing; or if there are over 6 months until
completion of the New Round, into sufficient shares so that there is 50%
step-up in the effective per-share price. The warrant shall be exercised
immediately after completion of the New Round and will expire 60 days
following its closing.
4. Timing:

Company B will have until January 29, 1999 to accept this term sheet or
renegotiate its terms and return a signed mutually agreed-upon copy.
Company counsel will deliver initial document for review by Angels within
two (2) weeks from acceptance of this term sheet to John Doe, who will
coordinate the Angels review and negotiation of terms, but has no
responsibility for the decision of other Angels. The financing will be
completed within 1 week of when definitive closing documents are delivered
to interested Angels by the company’s counsel. The terms and conditions
will be structured as defined herein.

5. Board of Directors: Three initially: the CEO, One Angel designate, and one unaffiliated chosen
by mutual agreement during negotiations, and whose future replacement will
be chosen by majority vote of the Board.
6. Redemption:

Series A will be convertible into common stock at any time at the holder’s
option, initially on a 1-1 basis with common. The Series A shall be required
to convert automatically to common stock in the event that shares are offered
to the public at a minimum price of 5 times cost, as adjusted, with an
offering size of not less than $15 million. A mandatory redemption, with
10% annual cumulative compounded dividends, will be made at the sixth
anniversary of the closing of this round.

7. Voting Rights:

One vote per common equivalent share.

8. Anti-Dilution:

Preferred stock will have standard anti-dilution protection in the event of
stock splits, stock dividends or similar recapitalizations. In the event that
other shares (except to employees or under a board approved stock incentive
plan) are sold at less than the prevailing per share price, the conversion price
of the Series A shall be adjusted using the weighted average method.

9. Liquidation
Preference:

Series A Preferred has liquidation preference, including any dividends if
declared, on merger, sale or liquidation.

10. Negative
Covenants:

Approval by majority of holders of Series A Preferred on a common
equivalent basis of all major organic changes outside normal course of
business, including but not limited to sale, liquidation, or merger, increase in
board seats or change in election procedures, creation of new securities and
any material loans, investments or capital expenditures.

15. Best Term
Offered:

In the event investors in a future round negotiate better terms than the Series
A Investors, at the time of closing, the Series A Preferred Stock terms will be
amended and adjusted to terms no worse than those obtained by new
investors and all new rights will be apportioned pari-passu to Series A
shareholders. In the event the New Round is negotiated on substantially
different terms and to facilitate investment by VC’s, Angels will, on
recommendation of its Board Representative and upon approval of a
majority of Series A shares outstanding, modify terms of the Series A
Preferred Stock to coincide with those of the venture investors, with the
exception of the share price and warrants.

16. Founder’s Stock:

All equity allocation to founding employees is to be completed prior to
closing and to have vesting (or repurchase rights) similar to employee
vesting.

receive dividends at the rate of 10% per annum of the Purchase Price
whenever funds are legally available and when as declared by the Board
or upon the sale or liquidation of the Company. Dividends on the
Preferred A are cumulative. Dividends are forfeit if not paid prior to
conversion.
(2) Liquidation Preference: In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or

Preference”) equal to the Purchase Price, plus any dividends declared on
the Preferred but not paid.
(3) Conversion: A holder of Preferred A will have the right to convert
Preferred A, at the option of the holder, at any time, into shares of
Common.
(4) Automatic Conversion: The Preferred A will be automatically converted
into Common, at the then applicable conversion price, upon the closing
of a sale of the Company’s shares of Common Stock pursuant to a firm
commitment of underwritten public offering by the Company at a public
offering price per share (prior to underwriter commissions and discounts)
that is not less than $10.00 and in which the total gross proceeds to the

(5) Antidilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Preferred A will be

events; and (II) on a weighted average basis to prevent dilution in the
event that the Company issues additional shares at a purchase price less
than the applicable conversion price. Conversion prices will not be
adjusted because of (a) conversion of Preferred A Stock, or (b) the
issuance and sale of, or the grant of, options to purchase shares of the
Common pursuant to the Company’s employee stock purchase or option
plans (the “Reserved Employee Shares”).
(6) Voting Rights: Except with respect to election of Directors (see “Board
Representation” below), a holder of Preferred A will have the right to

outstanding Preferred A will be required for any action: (I) to sell or
merge or consolidate the Company with another entity; (II) to change the

except as contemplated by the terms of the Preferred A or from
employees, advisors, officers, directors, consultants, and service
providers of the Company on terms approved by the Board; (V) to in any
manner alter or change the terms or other rights of the Preferred A; or
(VI) to reclassify any Common or other “Junior” Stock into shares with a
preference or priority as to dividends or assets superior to or on a parity
with that of the Preferred A or which in any manner adversely affects the
rights of the Preferred A; (VII) Any additional rights granted to past or
future classes of stock that are superior to rights granted to Series A
Preferred will also be granted to holders of Series A Preferred.

Refusal:

In the event that subsequent to this private placement, the Company offers
equity securities (other than Reserved Employee Shares, or upon conversion
of outstanding Preferred, or upon exercise of outstanding options or
warrants, or in connection with an acquisition or in a public offering), each
investor who holds the Preferred A issued in this private placement shall
have a right of first refusal to purchase the same percentage of equity
securities issued in such subsequent offering as the number of shares held by
such investors bears to the outstanding securities of the Company. This right
will terminate upon a firm commitment of an initial public offering as
described above.

Co-Sale Agreement:

The founders of the Company have executed a Co-Sale Agreement (copies
available upon request) in which if any founder proposes to sell more than
25,000 shares of the Company, each investor will be entitled to participate in

selling of such founder’s Common. This right will terminate upon the
Company’s Qualified Public Offering.
