Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral
Perspective
Robert A. Olsen

Abstract  The generally accepted financial risk metrics, such as variance and Beta,
are axiomatic mathematical constructions. They have mathematical validity but can
be questioned on behavioral grounds. This chapter suggests a broader alternative
approach. First, perception involves experiential content acquired as a result of
human/world interaction. It is not merely the product of a passive internal “brain
process.” Second, financial risk is hypothesized to be primarily a perception of
potential loss as fabricated by an evolutionary dual decision-making process that
embraces both affect and formal cognitive analysis. Thus of necessity, perceptions
of risk contain both cognitive and affective attributes. Because man is by nature
a social creature, perceived risk also entails risk attributes that manifest group
concerns. These hypotheses are supported by a comprehensive literature review.
Evidence is presented suggesting that this alternative perspective parsimoniously
explains many current “risk/return” market anomalies.

4.1 Introduction
Defining financial risk has become much like defining pornography. There is no
universal agreement about the content but all believe that they “know it when they
see it”. Alternative approaches to financial risk involve objective probability distributions, Knight (1921), subjective probability distributions, Savage (1954), confidence in estimated probability distributions, Keynes (1936), and ambiguity about
probability distributions, Ellsberg (1961). Using “Support Theory,” Tversky and
Koehler (1994), replaced subjective probabilities with “felt confidence” while
Pennington and Reid (1993) suggested that probabilities are a function of the consistency, completeness, and coherence of “stories” about possible future events.
Others have suggested that risk is more a function of outcomes rather than
­probabilities. Shackle (1952), suggested that outcomes should be modeled as

“­anticipations of possible surprise” while others have suggested that risk is more
appropriately­associated with potential loss (loss aversion) rather than variability in
future outcomes, Shapira (1995). Many researchers have identified financial risk as
a combination of probabilities and outcomes, Kahneman and Tversky (1992). More
comprehensive risk theories hypothesize that financial risk is a multi attribute psychological phenomenon that involves other attributes besides probabilities and outcomes. Such attributes include dread, feelings of knowing, trust, fairness, voluntarism,
and even one’s “worldview,” Slovic (2000). Last but not least, it has been suggested
that formal “Fuzzy Logic” might be of use in understanding and integrating the
many conflicting definitions of perceived risk, Lopes (1997), Reyna (2004).
This chapter attempts to cut the definitional “Gordian Knot” of financial risk by
focusing on the risk perceiver rather than the financial hazard per se. This chapter
discusses the wellsprings of risk perceptions by reviewing the latest neuroscience
and decision-making literature suggesting that the human mind operates as a dual
process system. One system is more primitive, more affective, intuitive and rapid.
The second system is of a more recent evolutionary origin, but is more analytical,
conscious, and slower in operation. Recent research suggests that the brain has been
evolutionarily “cobbled together” such that these two systems simultaneously interact. Thus, perceptions of risk are not only likely to have affective and analytical
attributes but they may be expected to contain pluralistic or community focused
attributes as well.
The financial risk literature is extensive, and this essay is not meant to be an
encyclopedic review, and so I apologize for not mentioning all the excellent studies
that make up the literature. The more limited objective of this chapter is to make a
start at developing a more comprehensive and integrated risk paradigm.

4.2 Neoclassical Financial Risk: A Prequel
Neoclassical finance has tended to treat financial risk as a set of attributes of a
financial hazard; attributes independent of the investor. This chapter takes a broader
view wherein perceived risk also incorporates the cognitive and affective mental
processing of the perceiver. As Slovic (1987) has noted “Risk does not exist out
there independent of our minds and cultures waiting to be measured. Instead
humans invented the concept to help them understand and cope with the dangers
and uncertainties of life. Risk assessments are subjective, assumption laden and
depend upon judgment.”
While there is little doubt that financial decision makers are made uneasy by the
unpredictable nature of the future, there is no necessary psychological basis for
assuming that one’s mental unease is uniquely captured by some particular statistical
metric such as variance or standard deviation of the distribution of possible outcomes.
Nevertheless, this has been the path embraced by neoclassical finance. In addition,
neoclassical finance has promoted a false dichotomy between objective risk, that
which deals with known probability distributions and uncertainty, that which exists in

<-----Page 2----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

47

the realm of imperfect knowledge. In particular, quantum theory and omplexity
­theory have demonstrated that complete deterministic knowledge is humanly impossible, Hardin (2003), Peat (2002) and that all perceived risk is subjective because we
can only experience the “real world” through the filter of our brain.
More recently, it has been argued that perception is not just a process in the brain
whereby a perceptual system constructs an internal representation of the world.
Instead perceptual experience is intrinsically active whereby the perception acquires
content, thanks to the perceiver’s activity and experience, Noe (2004). Therefore,
just as a newly sighted formerly blind person can still exhibit experiential blindness
because of an inability to integrate sensory stimulation with thought-based experience, individual’s risk perceptions may be absent or faulty because they are not able
to integrate sensory stimulation with the experiences of uncertain outcomes.
Perception is not like the content of a picture where the scene is given to us all at
once. To perceive is to be able to interpret the situation relative to one’s experience
with the world. Perception is an “enactive” experience. Support for this argument
is provided by the many experimental studies, which indicate that investors place
much greater weight on concrete experienced risk-related attributes such as the
“experience of loss” and “feelings of understanding” rather than abstract statistical
metrics such as return variance and Beta.
Consciousness research suggests that perceived risk is phenomenological as
well as psychological, Chalmers (1996), Thompson (2007). The phenomenological
state of mind refers to how something “feels” rather than its simple “perception.”
For example, the redness of a rose and the melancholy of regret have a qualitative
feel to them that is something quite apart from the perception of the color or mental
condition. For this reason, the “feel” is referred to as the qualia of the perception.
Where qualia come from is still a matter of debate. However, qualia seem to be
neurologically associated with the pleasure and pain centers of the brain. Qualia
can be accompanied by both cognition and emotion but are usually more associated
with emotional affect. Qualia seem to be more akin to bodily sensations that arise
from some primal internal process designed to alert the decision maker to the quality
of their thoughts. The influence of qualia is especially obvious in situations where
the decision maker reports that a decision must “feel right” as well as “look right.”
Recent neurological studies suggest that decision makers’ “feelings of knowing” or
“familiarity,” usually interpreted as being thought based, are often qualia and involuntary, Burton (2008). The importance of qualia for risk perception is suggested by
investors’ statements that financial risk has a qualitative feel of unease or discomfort to it, apart from the obvious formal outcome, Gardner (2008), Loewenstein and
Weber (2001).
I would suspect that most financial professionals are so accustomed to thinking
about risk in statistical terms that they are almost unaware that the use of variance
(or it’s square root, standard deviation) as an operational measure of perceived risk
initially resulted from a purely axiomatic mathematical derivation. Specifically,
variance was the mathematical outcome of combining five standard axioms of utility
theory (completeness, transitivity, independence, measurability, ranking) with the
assumptions of non satiation and risk aversion, Alexander and Francis (1986).

<-----Page 3----->48

R.A. Olsen

In this context, it is crucial to remember that the risk aversion assumption does not
say anything about how investors perceive and experience risk. It merely states that
investors prefer a sure thing to a fair gamble with an equivalent expected value.
Statistical variance, now utilized as the primary metric of perceived risk, was mathematically derived from a Taylor series expansion on a utility of wealth function. It
was not derived from psychological assumptions about how people mentally perceived or physically “felt” uncertainty. As such, the term does not necessarily have
psychological validity. It has only mathematical validity. Whether people actually
do think, or even should think, in such terms is clearly open to conjecture and
empirical verification. Portfolio theory has further obscured the statistical arrogation of risk by piling on additional assumptions about investors’ abilities and need
to take proper notice of correlation between asset returns such that they might
choose efficient portfolios.
It is well recognized by psychologists that to make a decision, emotion is the
necessary trigger. Emotions make choices possible. In fact, emotion is what mattering actually means when a choice is made and an outcome is experienced! A central
problem with standard statistical risk metrics is that as metrics they have no inherent affective or emotional content. They are merely axiomatically derived abstractions. On the other hand, how people feel and behave toward uncertainty about the
future is primarily the result of an evolutionary process that has led to ways of feeling and acting that are adaptive and increase the odds of survival. It is of course
possible that some mathematical abstractions might become “marked” with affective content through experience. Unfortunately, neoclassical finance rashly implies
that such should be the case for the metrics variance and Beta.

4.3 Fear: The Foundation of Perceived Risk
In order to examine the notion of perceived financial risk, some basic information
about the brain, and its processes, cognition (thinking) and emotion, needs to be
discussed. To begin, a meaningful definition of “risk perception” must imply emotional content. This follows because investment decisions are physical responses
and emotions are the triggers or instigators of action. That is, emotions are responsible for the implementation of action tendencies oriented toward the attainment of
some goal. Assuming that the goal of the investor is to become better off in the
future (or at least not worse off), it seems reasonable to assume that perceptions of
financial risk must have to do with the possibility of not realizing this goal. There
are three primary emotions associated with negativity. These are anger, sadness,
and fear. Of the three, fear appears to be the most likely candidate as the motivator
of thoughts of negative future outcomes. While, ex post, we may experience anger
or sadness with the results of our investment choice, fear is the ex ante negative
emotion associated with coming up short.
While fear can be apportioned into finer emotional subcategories such as dread,
worry, anxiety etc., it is important to be aware that what is commonly called fear is

<-----Page 4----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

49

the internal “feeling” of bodily sensations that are triggered by stimuli associated
with danger. Emotions come first and give rise to sensations that we call “feelings,”
Damasio (1999, 2003), Johnston (1999). Sometimes emotions and their feelings
can even be triggered by stimuli outside of our conscious awareness, Berridge and
Winkielman (2003). These “background” emotions can be vague and influence our
conscious decision process in ways that we are unaware of, Erb and Bioy (2002).
Also, felt emotions are very often difficult to verbalize.
The term emotion is still widely misunderstood and usually viewed as the antithesis of cognition or rational thought. However, such is not the case, and in fact,
much of what we call cognition or thinking is actually modulated emotion, Gray
(2004). For example, humans appear to rely extensively on “feelings of knowing or
similarity” especially in complex decision situations and where time is short. These
“feelings” mimic sensations of knowledgeable contemplation but are instead affective responses to the unconscious recognition of previous similar situations, Burton
(2008). These feelings of knowing are akin to intuition, Reber (1993), Hogarth
(2001). As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio (1999) has noted “Emotion probably
assists reasoning, especially when it comes to personal and social matters involving
risk and conflict. Well targeted and well deployed emotion seems to be a support
system without which the edifice of reason cannot operate properly.”
The basic emotions such as fear, anger, joy, etc. are not something that “will to
occur.” Also different emotions are associated with somewhat separate brain subsystems, Elliot and Friston (2000), Breiter and Aharon (2001), Hamann and Ely
(2002), Smith and Dickout (2002), Berns and Chappelow (2006). Neurologically,
the emotion of “fear or risk of loss” does not appear to be the neurological flip side
of the emotion associated with the “anticipation of gain,” as Lopes (1997), had correctly anticipated. Emotions evolved over time to allow humans to adapt and reproduce. Thus, emotions might be viewed as the products of “evolutionary wisdom”
and from this perspective they are not necessarily adaptively irrational, Gilbert
(1998), Gaulin (2001). In addition, much emotion is nonconscious, just as is most
cognition, Geary (2005). It is important to note that emotions not only have visceral
effects but they also cause neural electrochemical changes in the brain that can alter
cognition in many unrecognized and subtle ways, Harlow and Brown (1990), Lane
and Nadel (2000), Erb and Bioy (2002), Gray (2004), Kosfield and Heinrich
(2005).
The old view of emotion was one where the process progressed as: stimulusfeeling- response. Currently, the debated process is: stimulus- appraisal- feelingresponse, Fisher and Shaver (1990). Appraisal is the focus of much current emotion
theorizing. Nevertheless, emotion gives rise to an “action tendency,” which has
valence (feelings of goodness or badness) sometimes called “Affect,” which leads
to a moving toward or away from some stimulus. It is still generally believed that
emotion has primacy over (can come first) and can be independent of (exist without) cognition.
The stimuli that trigger fear were originally natural and would have alerted
humans to dangers from predators, unsafe activities, etc. However, humans and
other animals can develop “learned triggers,” which are not natural but will also

<-----Page 5----->50

R.A. Olsen

unleash fear feelings and responses. That is people can be “conditioned” to respond
with fear just as Pavlov’s dog was conditioned to respond to the sound of a bell. In
addition, culture may also have an effect on the emotion of fear in that: (1) It can
alter what constitutes an adequate inducement of fear, (2) It can shape the expression of fear and (3) It can influence the behavioral response to fear. The usual fear
responses include withdrawal, immobility, defense, and submission. The investment behaviors of panic selling, holding on to unprofitable assets for too long,
purchasing fixed return annuities, and adopting a buy and hold strategy appear suggestive of these typical responses.
In summary, much emotional processing is unconscious just as is most cognition. What is different are the mental processing structures that are involved. The
fear response involves the transmission of electrochemical signals along two
separate pathways to the Amygdala, a key brain organ associated with fear and
alarm. The fear stimuli can go either the “high road” through the cerebral Cortex,
where it will be subject to more extensive cognitive processing and analysis and
then to the Amygdala or it can go the “low road” straight to the Amygdala,
LeDoux (1996). The primary advantage of the “low road” is a quicker behavioral
response. The advantage of the high road is a more complete analysis of the situation and a more nuanced response. Evolution has provided humans with the alternative routes because in some cases, reaction to a snake for example, a quick fear
response is the better alternative, while in other cases, the decision maker may
benefit from a little more careful thought. Conscious emotional thought (recognition of feelings) and conscious cognition (thinking) both involve the use of the
working memory, a key contributor to consciousness. A principal distinction of
emotion, however, is that it involves physical feelings and changes in mental
processing that have been evolutionarily inbred to automatically trigger adaptive
behaviors. However, it is most important to remember that both emotion and
cognition appear to be necessary for the execution of good conscious decisions,
Damasio (1999), Firth (2007)
In closing this section, it is important to note that the brain does not have a special system devoted to “perception”. The term perception describes in a general
way what the many sensory neural systems are doing when we experience the
world. It is in this sense that I use the word risk perception to refer to the way in
which investors experience the dangers of investing. How risky they perceive an
investment to be is a function of the amount and form of the data as well as the
context within which it is presented. The use of statistics and probabilities is just
one alternative way of presenting information, a form that is not evolutionarily
natural and one that would not be expected to be associated with much emotion
unless “statistical triggers” had been inculcated through conditioned learning.
However, even in this case, the learned triggers may not have much emotional force
unless emotional “as if” loops have been created that allow the decision maker to
mentally emote the bodily feelings of a naturally risky situation. Incidentally, creating
“as if” loops is what “method actors” attempt to do in order to theatrically portray
emotional states.

4.4 Dual Decision Processes: Thinking and Feeling
The previous section summarized findings from brain research by neuroscientists
and evolutionary biologists. In general, the picture presented was of a brain not
designed as a “general problem solver,” such as a computer, but instead physically
cobbled together to handle many specific tasks such as mate selection, locomotion,
etc., Campbell (1989). Brain architecture consists of interacting neural subsystems
and there is little evidence that optimization and efficiency were evolutionary
objectives, Restak (1994), Goldberg (2001). Mental function just had to be sufficient to allow some humans to survive and reproduce. Emotional brain structures
such as the amygdala, hypothalamus, and the basal forebrain appear to be older
than other structures that are generally associated with the type of cognition that we
call “rational thought.” As mentioned before, most of what the brain does is not
available to the conscious mind and the brain often perceives and responds to
stimuli that are not consciously sensed. For example, how many times have you
driven your car without consciously having to think about each action necessary to
arrive at your planned destination?
In this section, we will examine evidence provided by psychologists and decision researchers suggesting that the human brain functions in such a manner that it
appears to be utilizing two separate but integrated decision processes; one process
more intuitive and emotionally focused and the other more conscious and analytical. While no one suggests that decision makers actually switch back and forth
between pure forms of these two processes, the hypothesis of two alternative processes has helped decision theorists to understand and predict how decision makers
are likely to act under varying circumstances.
There is an extensive dual decision process literature, Hammond (1996), Over
and Jonathan St Evans (1996), Over (2003), Chaiken and Trope (1999), Forgas
(2000), Gigerenzer and Selten (2001), Gray (2004), Montague (2006). However,
I will confine my comments to dual process research that is relevant to risk perception and choice under uncertainty.
Most dual decision process models are based on a common set of general observations about decision making. First, they emphasize that perception and sensation
are distinct and that the mind actively imposes meaning on sensory data. That is,
“knowledge” is a mental creation. Nevertheless, decision makers generally don’t
experience judgment as a “construction”. Second, because the world is complex,
decision makers extensively utilize categorization procedures to simplify and sort
data. Third, motives direct perception. In effect, people most often see what they
are ready to see and different people may interpret the same data differently.
Nevertheless, cultural values and norms constrain and condition alternative perceptions, judgments, and choices. Fourth, decision makers don’t seek absolute truth as
much as they seek to terminate doubt by having their world appear satisfactorily
consistent. This creates tendencies to avoid ambiguity and discordant data and to
see new experiences as being similar to those already incurred. Fifth, the default
decision process tends to be heuristic (based on so called rules of thumb) because

<-----Page 7----->52

R.A. Olsen

it conserves effort, accelerates the decision process, and is generally perceived to
yield acceptable results in a less than fully understandable and predictable world.
Decision makers may make use of more effortful and systematic information processing in some circumstances but when they do, heuristic processing usually
occurs simultaneously. Time, cognitive capacity, and felt need generally determine
whether more systematic and effortful decision-making processes are utilized.
At one end of the decision process, continuum is a decision process usually
called “associative” or “experiential.” The associative or experiential process generates what are experienced as intuitive and affective responses. It is reproductive
rather than productive in the sense that it uses cues mentally retrieved from similar
past events when processing information. The experiential system encodes information in the form of concrete exemplars, images, and narratives. It appears to be
relatively nonsymbolic and not linguistic. For this reason, it is speculated that experiential processing is evolutionarily much older than “rational” thought. In general,
experiential information processing tends to be holistic, context sensitive, and flexible. Most importantly, experiential processing is emotionally driven and motivated
by anticipated affect. For this reason, decision makers often feel that they are “compelled” to make a decision that “feels right” as opposed to one that “looks right”.
In fact, there is substantial evidence that decision makers often use “rationally
derived” information as a cover for their more experientially based inclinations.
At the other end of the decision process continuum is the process called “rule
based” or “rational”. A defining feature of the rule-based or rational decision process is that it uses symbolically represented knowledge in processing. Processing
rules are culturally based and socially learned. Information is evaluated and integrated using logical analysis as opposed to informal associations. The rational
processing system requires greater mental focus and therefore tends to be used
where greater accuracy is an important consideration. The rational system is more
effortful and time consuming. Also, it performs well only where the decision situation is relatively simple and there is a unique goal or objective. Affect plays little
or no role in this decision-making process although some have suggested that affect
may be conceptualized as “deliberative” and thus treated as a rational element.
The two decision processes appear to act simultaneously but with different
weights depending upon the situation. Evidence of simultaneous operation is abundant. It ranges from such obvious evidence as people expressing irrational fears
while at the same time being aware that the fears are not realistic, to carefully controlled laboratory experiments where lack of experiential input leads to poor judgment even where rational processes are fully implemented.
Grossberg and Gutowski (1987), Hanoch (2002) and Reyna (2004) have developed theoretical models suggesting how the two decision systems operate in tandem. Grossberg calls his model “Affective Balance Theory” and he describes how
learning can instill affective influences into cognitive representations. Hanoch suggests that emotion influences reason in three particular ways. First, emotions
restrict the range of options considered. Second, emotions focus attention on specific parameters of the decision situation and third, emotions assist in terminating
any evaluation process. Reyna calls her model “Fuzzy Trace Risk Theory”. She suggests

<-----Page 8----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

53

that risk perceptions are represented in two alternative memory forms. The first is
a more computational, abstract, and individual in form. The second is more “gist”
oriented where the gist captures the emotion of the situation and embraces the consistency that people seek by relating the risk in a particular situation to other similar
situations. She hypothesizes that gist, and thereby affect, gets the greater weight in
complex decisions. In general, there seems to be common agreement that greater
decision complexity leads to increased perceptions of risk and a tendency to rely on
more holistic and affective evidence.
Other risk perception implications of the dual process have been suggested.
Gonzach (2000) and Weber and Siebermorgen (2005) note that familiarity leads to
greater emphasis on affective risk attributes. Investors perceive less risk in companies that they recognize and feel positive about. Loewenstein and Weber (2001)
also suggest that different decision attributes trigger different risk attributes. For
example, cognitive perceptions of risk are related to probabilities whereas emotional or affective attributes are related to outcome vividness and salience.
Brandstatter and Kubberger (2002) finds that, in general, emotion leads to the over
weighting of low probabilities and the under weighting of high probabilities.
Forlani (2002) finds that positive affect arising from feelings of control leads to
lower risk perceptions and increased risk taking while, Moreno and Kida (2003)
notes that, in general, positive affect induces risk taking.
The relationship between ambiguity and perceived risk has been the focus of a
number of studies by Sarin and Weber (1992), Hogarth and Kunreuther (1995),
Huber (1995), Ghosh and Ray (1997), Lauriola (2001), and Ho and Keller (2002).
They find that risk perceptions vary directly with ambiguity and that risk perceptions tend to increase with perceived decision complexity. Alhakami and Slovic
(1994), Jordan and Kass (2002) and Finucane and Holup (2006) note that risk
perceptions often are inversely related to expectations of return because of affect.
Good (bad) things are seen as being low (high) in risk and high (low) in return.
Eiser (2002) suggests that trust can have this effect as a positive affective risk
attribute but that affective and cognitive risk dimensions appear to have independent effects on hazard acceptance.
Perhaps the most important conclusion from studies of the simultaneous operation of the two decision-making systems is that because the experiential system can
operate outside of normal awareness, the rational system can be significantly influenced because it is unaware that there is any affective influence, Berkowitz (2000),
Frijida and Manstead (2000), Erb and Bioy (2002). A rather obvious example of
this can be seen in the situation where the experiential system directs attention to
more salient information and the rational system logically analyzes the information
unaware that the information selection process was biased from the start.
Decision makers’ ability to think “rationally” appears to increase with training.
It has been suggested that experts’ lesser perceptions of risk in their domain of
expertise are a function of their greater ability to focus on statistical facts, with less
affective interference, Barke (1995). Sjoberg (2002) disputes this contention. He contends that experienced decision makers are similarly influenced by the same mix of
affective and analytical influences as nonexperts. He concludes that positive affect

<-----Page 9----->54

is the primary reason that experts rate risks as less in their domains of expertise­.
That is what they do as work is seen as “good,” and what is “good” is usually seen
as less risky.

4.5 Risk: For Me or for Others Also?
To this point, I have examined the neural underpinnings of perceived risk and have
discussed the decision-making processes that would carry its influence. I have
implicitly assumed that risk perceptions would manifest attributes reflecting the
singularly selfish goals of the decision maker. In this section, I will briefly survey
research suggesting that an individual’s risk perceptions might also contain attributes that are pluralistic or group focused.
Man is a social animal and it would be surprising not to find traces of sociality
in his perceptions of risk. In particular, where personal survival and the transmission of one’s genes to the next generation are partially a function of group support,
it would appear likely that perceived risk might contain “group traces”.
Research from Evolutionary Biology and Neuroscience suggests that humans
have a significant proclivity to cooperate as well as compete and have evolved
neural hardware to enhance survival through “evolutionary and psychological altruism,” Cashdan (1990), Pfaff (2007), Wang and Johnson (1995), Ridley (1996),
Sober and Wilson (1998). As a consequence, humans seem to have some inborn
ability to detect social cheaters and free riders through observations of facial features, body posture, and speech patterns. There is also speculation that the naturally
occurring emotions such as anger and fear, outrage, etc. serve important roles in
encouraging social behaviors and norms that support group relationships and nonzero sum reciprocity. Shunning, ostracism, and disdain for hoarders are examples
of such derivative enforcement mechanisms. Humans also demonstrate a significant
ability to become empathetic by internally simulating the experiences of others.
Also humans have a strong innate predisposition to be socially influenced and to
imitate others, Dugation (2000). In this regard, “herding” and a type of “swarm
logic” become especially prevalent in complex and uncertain situations and there is
brain imaging evidence to suggest that it may be partly “hardwired,” Rizzolatti and
Craighero (2004).
Game theorists also point to evidence that cooperation seems to be a natural state
Axelrod (1997), Wright (2001), Skyrms (2004). Experimental results from “prisoner dilemma” type games indicate that in more natural settings, cooperation rather
than defection seems to be normal. Even more significant is the fact that in environments that contain some irreducible uncertainty, game outcomes with cooperation
are evolutionarily stable. That is, free riding and selfish behavior do not force
cooperation into extinction.
Finally, it has been argued that from an evolutionary perspective, humans
appear to have developed a feeling for a “logic of appropriate behavior,” Freeman
(1997). Based upon these considerations, it might be expected that individual’s

<-----Page 10----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

55

risk attributes­ might be associated with group concepts such as fairness, trust,
equality, etc. A number of studies have found elements of these concepts in risk
perceptions, Weber and Hsee (1998), Lupton (1999), Renn and Rohrnan (2000),
Nisbett (2003), Fehr and Fischbacher (2005), Olsen (2008).
At the most general level, a person’s “worldview” appears to influence risk perceptions. Studies by Bouyer and Bagdassaian (2001) and Slovic (1993) find that
that people with a more egalitarian or individualistic worldview tend to perceive
hazards as riskier than those with hierarchical or fatalistic worldviews. Wang and
Johnson (1995), Wang and Simons (2001) note that risk perceptions are related to
the size and relatedness of the group facing a hazard. Large group size and lack of
social relatedness are associated with lower perceived risk. In a related study,
Scherer and Cho (2003) find that people with stronger social linkages have more
similar perceptions of risk. Viklund (2003) finds that trust is related to perceived
risk. Where group trust is greater, people perceive risk to be lower. Siegrist and
Cvetkovich (2000) find that people trust most those who share their values. Renn
(2004) and Slovic (1987, 2000) note that perceived risk is a function of other social
factors such as perceived fairness, voluntarism, effect on future generations, and
group control.

4.6 Amplification
There is a growing body of literature revealing that information about hazards can
interact with psychological, social, and institutional processes in ways that can
amplify or attenuate perceptions of risk and return, Pidgeon and Kasperson (2006).
Amplification can occur at two points: in the transfer of information and in the
response of the receiver. Amplified risk perceptions in turn lead to behavioral
responses that can have secondary impacts such as requirements for new regulations or financial impacts on unrelated firms. Sometimes information about a perceived risk, such as the failure of Enron, has an amplified financial repercussion
that far exceeds the local impact, while at other times attenuation occurs.
Attenuation of perceived risk appears to have been the case with the failure of
Long-Term Capital Management, which went almost unnoticed by most investors
yet it threatened the survival of the US financial system.
In communication theory, amplification (attenuation) takes place in the information transmission stage. Each message not only has a factual content but also inferential, value related, and symbolic content. These additional dimensions have
independent influences on how a message is interpreted. For example, if the financial information comes from a highly respected and knowledgeable source, and
concerns an issue that is important to the investing public, the impact is likely to be
more significant than otherwise. Also, if a message is heard many times from a
variety of sources, or comes from a personal friend, the impact is likely to be greater.
Conversely, if the information is disputed, not very dramatic, or concerns some marginalized group, the impact is likely to be attenuated. It is especially important to

<-----Page 11----->56

R.A. Olsen

note that amplification is not just due to media repetition. More important­ is the
degree to which one is personally perceived to be at risk and that the message comes
from a trusted source. In extremely negative situations, the perception of risk can be
raised to such levels that a stigma may become attached to entire classes of activities
or financial assets. This may be seen in the labeling of lower grade bonds as “junk
bonds” and in the negative characterization of “hedge funds” by many investors.
As just mentioned, risk amplification primarily takes place at the information
transmission stage. Because transmission depends upon the dynamics of the information network, it is important to be clear how the financial information network
is structured (it’s topology). If it takes what is called a “small world” form with
many “weak” informational ties, we would find that information would travel fast
but be subject to considerable amplification.
First, a small world financial network describes a situation where there is a hub
and spoke arrangement in which many nodes (investors) are clustered around
informational hubs (advisors, financial institutions) that act as opinion leaders. In addition, there would be many “weak ties” (professional organizations and associations) that bring distant hubs into more frequent contact. Hubs tend to lower the
threshold of new information absorption and increase retransmission velocity.
Belief synchronization resulting in herd mentality and groupthink are enhanced in
the small world network as a result of sequential information transmission and
positive feedback. In addition, preferential attachment, wherein those hubs that
appear superior gain the most followers, exacerbates contagious behavior within
the network. Loss aversion, in the form of regret avoidance, also increases the
tendency for network compaction. The information amplification in the small
world network arises from positive feedback and path dependency. The significant
macro financial market result would be nonlinear price behavior wherein informational influences would result in stock price fluctuations that were nonproportional
to the initial informational content. That is security markets would exhibit excess
volatility. Most standard economic models do not assume a small world network.
Alternatively, they assume random networks where information is independently
evaluated by investors. In the standard economic model, investors’ preferences are
exogenous and not influenced by the “mind of the market” as formed by network
dynamics. Network influence is implicitly neutral.
Second, there is structural and market behavior evidence that financial information
networks are “small world networks” and subject to significant price amplification.
	1.	 Given the complexity of the investment process, most nonprofessional investors
rely heavily upon the advice of those seen to be experts. In this regard, trust in
the form of ability and integrity is given great weight. Affective information is
generally given greater weight than quantitative data. Portfolio Diversification
is generally insufficient (concentration in “good prospects”), and investment
horizons are usually short, (less than 3 years). Capon (1996), Clark-Murphy
(2004), DeBondt, (1998), Waynered (2001).
	2.	 Professional investors are very well connected through a web of educational,
social, and business associations. This milieu tends to result in beliefs and methods­

<-----Page 12----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

57

of analysis that are quite homogenous. They scrutinize competitors’ investment
behavior in the attempt to generate superior performance. The relative ease with
which funds can flow between financial institutions creates a relatively short
investment mind set. Professionals make greater use of formal analytical techniques but affect plays a significant role due to time pressure, informational complexity, and few if any audited “fool proof” valuation/management techniques.
Abolafia (1996), Fenton-O’Creevy (2005), Cetina (2005), Smith (1999).
	3.	 Empirical market data reveal that asset returns tend to follow power laws indicating
lack of randomness and conformity with small world network dynamics. Asset
returns also exhibit excess volatility that is consistent with market over reaction,
herding, and momentum investing arising from amplification. Ormerod (2000),
Shiller (1989).
	4.	 Survey data indicate that professional investors herd, momentum invest, over
extrapolate trends, exhibit wishful thinking, and over estimate the return/risk
ratio for investments believed to be familiar from an affective vantage point. In addition, they tend to be overconfident and give less weight to disconfirming evidence. Cooper (2005), Dennis (2002), Karceski (2002), Sias (2004).
In conclusion, it is most likely that information amplification will influence investment valuations. Because there appears to be an inverse affective relationship
between perceived risk and expected returns in the minds of many investors and
because affect is a significant influence in asset valuation, it is likely that positive
investment information will result in upwardly amplified market valuations.
Expected return will be biased upward while risk will be biased downward. Negative
information should have the reverse effect. However, the amplification of negative
information is subject to two complicating influences. Loss averse investors usually
react more strongly to identified negative information but investors often underestimate the potential of negative information because of “desirability bias” (positive
outcomes are seen as more likely than negative outcomes), Olsen (1997a).

4.7 Implications and Evidence
By now, it may appear that the variable called “perceived financial risk” might present market modelers with an iconoclastic nightmare. However, there are a few
identifiable overarching general implications. This section will identify those
important themes and briefly identify some of the more representative supporting
research.
First and foremost, perceptions of financial risk are dominated by fear of loss.
Although variability in potential return is also sometimes mentioned as a risk attribute, more detailed probing reveals that people are not especially troubled by
­unexpected gains but instead by the low side of the return distribution. Rode and
Wang (2000) present theory and evidence suggesting that this predisposition is an
evolutionary adaptation. In fact, animal studies identify loss aversion as a “common

<-----Page 13----->58

R.A. Olsen

denominator” underlying animal foraging behavior and investment selection, Olsen
(2008). The desire to avoid loss is also indicated in the tendency to prefer outcome
distributions with positive skew and an extreme dislike for return distributions
exhibiting the potential for very large losses, even where the chance of the loss is
very low.
Loss can be manifested in different ways. Sometimes loss is perceived in absolute terms, such as in dollars lost or a particular low percentage return. At other
times, it is expressed in qualitative terms, such as a future opportunity that would
have to be forgone. On other occasions, it is perceived in relative terms whereby the
loss is expressed as that of falling below some desired target or aspiration level.
Finally, it might be expressed as a fear of experiencing future regret, as in making
a choice that yields an outcome that would be disappointing or embarrassing,
Landman (1993). Much has been made of the observation that in some experimental situations described as “loss situations” investors tend to act as “risk takers”.
That is, they prefer the more risky gamble that might put them much deeper into a
financial hole if a positive alternative does not materialize. Examination of this
behavior in “real world” settings suggests that the decision maker is still attempting
to avoid a loss. He/she is usually trying to avoid an existing bad situation but one
that has not as yet yielded the “final blow”. Thus, the risk-taking behavior actually
represents a last ditch effort to avoid the impending calamity, which is not perceived as being made significantly worse by any additional negative results. When
one has his/her “back to the wall,” behavior that would be inappropriate in more
normal situations is often quite rational. For example, military combat, firefighting,
and even important athletic contests are rife with such behavior.
Some of the earlier studies of importance with regard to the avoidance of loss
are those by Alderfer and Bierman (1970) Gooding (1976),Cooley(1977), Laughunn
and Payne (1980). Later studies include those of Solt (1989), Harlow and Rao
(1989), Unser (2000), Ippolito (1992), March and Shapira (1992), Holtgrave and
Weber (1993), Shapira (1995), Olsen (1997a), Williman and O’Creevy (2002),
Kermer and Driver-Linn (2006).
The second major implication of risk perception studies is that most investors’
risk perceptions simultaneously contain affective and cognitive elements. By affective elements, I mean risk attributes that reflect the investor’s feelings of goodness
or badness toward an investment. These feelings can be nonconscious or conscious.
In general, good (bad) feeling leads to perceptions of lower (greater) risk. This
affective influence can also give rise to a negative, as opposed to a positive statistical correlation between perceived risk and expected return. Usually, affect has the
most significance where the decision situation is complex and effortful, information
is perceived to be incomplete or unreliable, the decision maker feels less confident,
is female, and the time for evaluation is short. Cognitive risk attributes, such as
statistics, tend to be more commonly used by experts and those who have been
trained to think in more abstract terms. However, it is not the case that experts are
uninfluenced by affective considerations.
Finally, it is important to note that current financial theory emphasizes the
importance of correlation for risk control in a portfolio context. That is investors

<-----Page 14----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

59

should diversify by investing in assets that have returns that are less than perfectly
positively correlated. Nevertheless, studies of nonprofessional investors indicate
that people do not follow this advice, Benartzi and Thaler (1995), Fisher and Meir
(1997). The reasons appear to be twofold. First, humans do not well understand the
formal concept of covariance in nonnatural and abstract circumstances. Humans do
not appear to recognize covariance unless it occurs in very repetitive and concrete
circumstances. Second, humans tend to mentally compartmentalize decisions by
goal and context. Thus, when they formulate an investment plan, they do not visualize the task as a whole but instead see a need to make separate investments for
retirement, the children’s education, etc. Therefore, the risk level of the individual’s
portfolio becomes a random byproduct instead of a managed attribute, Shefrin
(2000). “Total perceived risk” is not a naturally meaningful concept because it
entails multiple goals, timelines, and information types.
It is interesting to consider how affective risk attributes might offer the most
parsimonious explanation of many of the risk/return anomalies that have arisen
from tests of current financial theories,(the CAPM in particular). Take for instance
the observation that firm size and the ratio of book value to market value appear to
be risk proxies, Fama and French (1993), Fama and French (1996), Jensen and
Johnson (1997). More specifically, common stocks of small firms and those with
high book to market values appear to yield excessively high ex post returns, after
standard (Beta) risk adjustments. There is evidence that small firms yield higher
compensatory equilibrium returns because they are associated with increased negative affect due to difficulty of evaluation, Olsen and Troughton (2000). Assuming
risk aversion, these more negatively perceived firms require a higher compensatory
risk premium resulting in a lower market value. Thus, these more negatively
affected firms, with their higher BV/MV, yield higher conventionally risk-adjusted
ex post returns.
The observation that investors are subject to “home bias,” a predilection for the
stocks of “local” companies, has been widely noted, Huberman (2001), Grinblatt
and Keloharju (2001). Again, positive affect may be a reason for this behavior.
Affect research shows that decision makers see as more positive, and hence less
risky, those financial assets that are more familiar, Gonzach (2000), Weber and
Siebermorgen (2005), Cao (Cao et al. 2008). Thus, even if the “home firm” is cognitively seen as identical to a nonhome equivalent, the home firm is likely to be
favored because of the positive sentiment associated with familiarity.
There are many other anomalies that may result from affective influence, Thaler
(2005) Shefrin (2000). Herding and over reaction are likely related to the observed
positive affect and lower perceived risk associated with crowd following and group
membership, Wang and Johnson (1995), Wang and Simons (2001); Scherer and
Cho (2003). Likewise, the disposition effect is likely associated with the negative
affect associated with the formal acknowledgment of loss, Landman (1993).
Similarly, large IPO premiums quite probably are affect related. As an example,
expectations of gain may have an amplified influence on stock prices due to
the affectively induced inverse ex ante relationship between expected gain and
perceived risk.

Most of the studies that have investigated perceived financial risk from both
affective and cognitive perspectives are of more recent origin. Much of this
research has not received extensive publicity because of the traditional finance
emphasis on statistical risk metrics. Nevertheless, important affective/cognitive
financial risk perception research involving experts and novices, and utilizing
many different research designs can be found in Farrelly and Reichenstein
(1984) MacCrimmon and Wehrung (1986), Harlow and Brown (1990),
Goszcznyska (1991), Shapira (1995), Jungerman (1997), Lopes (1997), Olsen
(1997b), Olsen and Troughton (2000), Olsen (2001, 2002, 2004, 2008),
Jianakoplous and Bernasek (1998), Macgregor and Slovic (1999), Williams
and Voon (1999), Gonzach (2000), Diacon and Ennew (2001), Bohner and
Zeckhauser (2004), Dunn (2005), Koonce and Gascho (2005), Weber and
Siebermorgen (2005).
The third important implication of risk perception research is that risk perceptions can be influenced by cultural and group factors. That is investors’ perceptions
of what is risky involves cultural values as well as considerations of the distribution
of loss among group members. In this regard, studies by Renn and Rohrnan (2000),
Slovic (1993) find risk attributes, such as fairness, voluntarism, effect on future
generations, are important. Bouyer and Bagdassaian (2001) and Peters and Slovic
(1996) find world views to be important. Those who see the world from a more
egalitarian or individualistic perspective see hazards as posing greater risks than
those who believe in a more hierarchical society or whom are more fatalistic. Wang
and Johnson (1995), Wang and Simons (2001) find that risks are perceived as
greater by small close-knit groups while Scherer and Cho (2003) find that individual risk perceptions tend to become more similar as group interaction increases.
Nisbett (2003) notes that Asians are more likely to perceive risk in a more affective
fashion, be less overconfident in belief, less inclined to believe in continuity of
returns over time, and more likely to follow group convention than Westerners.
Finally, Viklund (2003) and Olsen (2008) note a strong inverse relationship between
personal trust and perceived risk. Siegrist and Earle (2003) note that as decisions
become more complex, trust appears to become the preferred affective substitute
for risk estimated in a more probabilistic fashion.
Johnson and Grayson (2005) note that investors’ trust in their financial advisors
appears to be influenced by both cognitive and affective attributes. “Cognitive
trust” is based upon perceptions of competence and reliability whereas “Affective
trust” is based upon care, concern, and familiarity.

4.8 Entrepreneurs: Confirmation About the Risk Perception
Process
Most discussions of entrepreneurial behavior are heavily weighted toward the subject
of risk because the activity is viewed as involving a willing acceptance of greater
financial uncertainty. Earlier literature suggested that entrepreneurs had a high

<-----Page 16----->4  Financial Risk Perceptions: A Behavioral Perspective

61

personal tolerance for risk that accounted for their risk proclivity. More recent
research has shown that risk tolerance has little explanatory value. Instead, it
appears that the nature of entrepreneurial activity causes budding entrepreneurs to
select and weigh information in such a way that risk perceptions are very often “low
side biased,” Krueger (2003).
The entrepreneurial milieu skews the decision process toward the use of more
affective decision rules that result in more favorably perceived risk/return opportunities. A critical element in this process is the affective tendency to equate opportunities with high expected return with lower levels of risk, Alhakami and Slovic
(1994), Jordan and Kass (2002), Finucane and Holup (2006). In addition, there is
evidence that entrepreneurs tend to give greater weight to expected outcomes as
opposed to prospective risk in investment decisions because of the affective influence of time constraints, incomplete information, and ambiguity, Baron (1998),
Palich and Ray Bagby (1995). Additional research has suggested that cognitive
errors associated with overconfidence, feelings of control, and a belief in the “law
of small numbers” further exacerbate the downward affective risk bias, Mitchell
and Busenitz (2002), Simon and Houghton (1999). In entrepreneurial environments, we see the full influence of the dual decision process and how it can lead to
biased risk perceptions. Entrepreneurs do not appear to have significantly higher
risk tolerance; they just judge the perceived risks to be less threatening.

4.9 Conclusion
In an earlier chapter, I discussed how neoclassical finance has become descriptively
hobbled and normatively suspect by adopting assumptions that are now scientifically untenable, Olsen (2001). Neoclassical Finance incorrectly assumed that
humans were, or at least could become, axiomatically rational optimizers, as
implied by the now outdated psychology of behaviorism. Second, it assumed a
deterministic reality that could be fully deciphered through reductionism; an
assumption that has also been overturned by complexity theory and quantum theory.
Until recently, with the reawakened interest in behavioral economics and the new
“behavioral finance,” finance appears not to have sought the necessary nourishment
from its social science roots while constructing elegant but fragile mathematical
edifices.
The quantification of risk is operationally convenient and necessary for
developing theories of market behavior. However, inattention to the more
complex affective side of risk perception is now limiting a more profound understanding of risk-driven investment behavior. Individual investors, industry, and
government are constantly looking for better ways to measure, communicate, and
contend with financial risk. Normative processes leading to better investment
results cannot be developed and enacted without understanding the psychology and
limits of the investing mind. Hopefully, this chapter will stimulate further research
along these lines.
