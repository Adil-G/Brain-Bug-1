Although research on the informal venture capital market has expanded in recent years our
current knowledge and understanding remains deficient in a number of respects. This paper
examines three aspects of the operation of the informal venture capital market where information is either lacking or based on anecdotal or impressionistic evidence: the investment process,
the post-investment experience and the investment performance. Information was obtained via
telephone interviews with 31 business angels and with 28 owner-managers. In 20 cases information was available from both the entrepreneur and the investor. The paper concludes that in
most cases the informal venture capital process has worked relatively well. Th.ere are few
situations where the relationship between investor and entrepreneur broke down.
Nevertheless, the naivety and inexperience exhibited by a minority of investors and entrepreneurs is striking. However, there are significant and consistent expectation gaps between investors and entrepreneurs in terms of the pricing of larger investments and the performance of the
business. Differences of opinion between investors and entrepreneurs concerning what constitutes a favourable perforrnance of the business may be a source of disputes in the future.

1. Introduction
T h e informal venture c.apita1market comprises many thousands of private individuals

- more commonly referred to as 'business angels' - who provide equity and other
forms of non-collateral finance directly to new and growing businesses with which they
have no family connection. Its importance as a source of finance for entrepreneurial
businesses, especially at start-up and early stage, is now widely recognized. Ihdeed, the
informal venture capital market is the largest single source of risk capital for entrepreneurial companies, exceeding the institutional venture capital industry. Estimates
for the U K suggest that small- and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) have riiised about
E2 billion from the informal venture capital market (Hamson and Mason 1993). T o
put this figure into perspective it has been estimated that the formal venture capital
industry has invested some E1.25bn in SMEs in the U K (Bannock and Partners
1991). This would suggest that the informal venture capital market is almost twice
as important to the SME sector as formal venture capital. However, the potential
scale of the informal venture capital market is considerably greater than these figures
suggest. First, most business angels cannot find sufficient investment opportunities that
meet their criteria and so have substantial amounts of finance available fix informal
investments. Second, many offers of finance by business angels are rejected by entrepreneurs: the experience of one business introduction service is that four tim~esas many

offers of investment are made as are accepted (LINC 1994). Third, 'virgin angels' high net worth individuals with an entrepreneurial background who have not, for
whatever reason, entered the informal venture capital market as individual investors considerably outnumber active investors (Wetzel and Freear 1995, Freear et al. 1994).
However, the importance of the informal venture capital market is not simply on
account of its size and untapped potential. Informal venture capital is also 'smart
money': most business angels are value-added investors, contributing their commercial
skills, entrepreneurial experience, business know-how and contacts through a variety
of hands-on roles (Harrison and Mason 1992a). Business angels will normally take a
seat on the board and, in addition, will often provide consulting help and may even
work part-time or full-time for the business. US research has noted that the majority of
firms that have raised finance from informal sources report that their working relationship with their investor has been moderately or very productive (Freear and Wetzel
1992). One study of firms that had raised finance from informal investors (Harrison
and Mason 1992a) identified a wide range of support, monitoring and strategic roles
played by business angels in their investee companies. Entrepreneurs regarded the
angels' role as a sounding board for the management team as being their most valuable hands-on contribution. The opportunity to be involved in an entrepreneurial
venture is a significant motivating factor for angels making informal venture capital
investments, as well as a means of protecting their investment (Mason and Lumme
1995).
Although research on the informal venture capital market has expanded in recent
years, with studies in the USA (Gaston 1989, Freear and Wetzel 1992, Freear et a1
1994, 1995, Tymes and Krasner 1983, Wetzel 1981), Canada (Riding et al. 1993), the
U K (Harrison and Mason 1992b, Mason and Harrison 1994a, 1995a, 1996, KPMG
1992, Stevenson and Coveney 1994) and the Nordic countries (Landstrom 1993,
Suomi and Lumme 1995), current knowledge and understanding remains deficient
in a number of respects.
First, the volume of research remains extremely limited, particularly in comparison
to the amount of attention given to the institutional venture capital industry that
finances only a fraction of the SMEs that raise finance from the informal venture
capital market (Wetzel 1994).
A second limitation is the narrow focus of much of the research that has been
undertaken. The focus of the majority of studies has been on the characteristics of
investors, their motivations and investment criteria and the characteristics of their
investments. A major contributory factor to this situation has been the desire of nonUS researchers to examine a similar range of topics to those addressed in the pioneering US Small Business Administration-sponsored studies (Wetzel 1981, Gaston 1989),
often using a similar survey instrument, in the interests of generating internationally
comparative findings (Harrison and Mason 1992b, Mason and Harrison, 1994a,
Landstrijm 1993).
A third, related, limitation of much of the research on the informal venture capital
market is that it has focused on the investor rather than on aspects of the investment
process, the characteristics of the deal or even the investee business. Studies that have
adopted a firm perspective have been restricted to just two issues: the significance of
informal venture capital in relation to other sources of finance (Freear and Wetzel
1990, Mason and Harrison 1994b), and the value-added contribution of business
angels (Harrison and Mason 1992a, Ehrlich et al. 1994).

INFORMAL VENTURE CAPI'TAL

A final limitation is that previous research has focused on investor expectations
rather than investment outcomes. Thus, there is no information available on the
performance of investments or the timing and nature of exit routes.
Thus, previous research has provided a fairly clear picture of who busi~~ess
angels
are, why they invest and what they invest in. Moreover, these findings exhibit a
remarkable consistency between countries. However, there are many aspects of the
operation of the informal venture capital market for which research-based evidence
is lacking, necessitating a reliance on, possibly inaccurate or atypical, anecdotal
evidence and speculation. This paper explores three important aspects of informal
venture capital activity where our information is either limited or non-existent.
The first is the investment process. The paper examines the types of information that
investors wish to see when considering an investment opportunity, the negotiation
processes, and in particular the issues that are the most difficult to negotiate, the time
taken to raise informal venture capital, the costs (in terms of professional fees) incurred
by businesses, and the ways in which the investments are structured.
The second is the post-investment experience. The issues that are explored include the
roles that business angels play in the businesses in which they invest, the helpfulness of
their contribution and the nature of the investor-entrepreneur relationship.
The third is the investment performance. The key issue here concerns the returns that
business angels achieve from their investments.
2.

Methodology

In order to address these issues it is necessary first to examine a sample of investments
involving business angels and second to obtain the views of both the investor and the
entrepreneur. Furthermore, some time needs to have elapsed since the investment in
order to allow the possibility of a successful exit by the investor, thereby enabling
investment performance and harvesting issues to be explored. In practice, however, it
proved difficult to meet this requirement: the older the investment the more likely it is
that the business has failed, ceased trading or is otherwise untraceable.
This study is based on investments that have been made through LIlVC (Local
service in
Investment Networking Company), a long-established business introductio~~
the United Kingdom. 1,INC provides a convenient source of informal venture capital
investments: the use of this source side-stepped the difficulty of identiFng businesses
that have raised finance from private investors, arising from the invisibility of informal
venture capital activity. LINC provided the names and addresses of over 60 businesses
that it has helped to raise finance since 1988, although upon contacting these businesses it was found that a small minority had not raised finance from outs id^: investors.
In most, although not all, cases LINC also provided the investor's name and address.
Inevitably, because of business failures and changes of address, it was not possible to
establish contact with every business and investor. In those cases where only the name
and address of the business was known, information on the investor was obtained fiom
the business owner. Clearly this approach was not possible when businesse:; could not

be contacted, for example on account of having ceased trading.
This reliance on deals made through
- LINC rather than through informal networks,
which is the most comnlon way in which business angels identify investmerlts (Mason
and Harrison 1994a), should not bias the findings in any way. LINC only provides a
channel of communication between investor and entrepreneur and is not involved

after the initial contact is made. Thus, the negotiation process, nature of the investment and post-investment experience should be unaffected, and no different to investments where the introduction of the investor to entrepreneur, or vice versa, has been
through informal channels or alternative formal channels. Nevertheless, in seeking to
generalize from the findings of this study it is important to recognize that business
angels who join business introduction services may be distinctive from the overall
population of business angels in terms of their demographic profile and investment
activity (Mason et al. 1995).
This present study is based on telephone interviews with 31 business angels who
have made investments in unquoted companies and 28 owner-managers who have
raised finance from private investors. Three investors had each made two investments,
thus there is investor information on 34 investments. In 20 cases there is information
from both the entrepreneur and the investor. Unfortunately, but inevitably, a significant number of businesses and investors could not be traced. I n most cases these
involved investments made between 1988 and 1990. Indeed, the vast majority of
the investments for which we have information from either the investor or entrepreneur (or both) occurred in 1992, 1993 or early 1994 (83%). The oldest investment was
made in 1988. The survey was undertaken between April and July 1994.
The response rate was satisfactory. I t proved impossible to arrange interviews with
just eight of the entrepreneurs who were contacted: three rehsed to provide any
information, another three said that they would complete a postal questionnaire
but failed to return it and the remaining two entrepreneurs were always too busy
to be interviewed whenever they were contacted. Thus, usable responses were
achieved from 78% of the entrepreneurs that were contacted. I n the case of investors,
five refused to agree to an interview; this included one investor who had made three
investments and another who had made two investments, plus a firm of accountants
who were trustees for a private trust. However, brief information was obtained from
three of these investors on the outcomes of five investments. I t was not possible to
complete an interview with one other investor despite calling back on several occasions. Thus, usable responses were obtained from 82% of the investors who were
contacted.
The majority of the business angels in this study are relatively inexperienced in
making investments in unquoted companies: over one-third had made just one investment and 71% had made only two investments. At the other extreme, only three
investors (10%) in the study had made more than three informal investments.
Moreover, only about half planned to make any more informal investments in the
foreseeable future. This limited level of investment activity is consistent with both a
previous study of LINC investors, which included both those who had made investments through LINC as well as those who had not (Mason et al. 1991). I t is also
consistent with LINC's own in-house study of London investors, conducted in 1993,
which concludes that although 60% of investors had made investments before almost
all of these investors had made no more than three previous investments. Thus, it does
seem valid to conclude that LINC is providing a service primarily for relatively
inexperienced business angels. I t is not known whether this is also a feature of other
business introduction services. However, it tends to confirm the observation by
KPMG (1992) in their study of informal investors in Scotland that new business
angels have difficulty in entering established informal networks and in establishing
their own, and so might be expected to show the greatest interest in joining a business
introduction service.

3. The investment opportunity: an overview
3.1 Investment characteristics
The majority (59%) of the businesses in the sample were start-ups (including prestart-ups) or at an early stage when the investment occurred, confirming the importance of informal venture capital as a funding source for this type of venture.
However, there is much greater diversity in terms of industry sector. Mar~ufacturing
accounted for the largest proportion, comprising just over one-quarter of the total,
with both retail and wholesale distribution and other services accounting for approximately one in five businesses.

3.2 Investment criteria
The key considerations in the investors' decision to invest were associated with the
attributes of the entrepreneurs and the market-product characteristics of the business
(Table l), confirming previous research on the investment decision-making process of
business angels (Mason and Hamson 1994a). Most investors were attrac:ted by the

expertise of the entrepreneurs; however, other factors were also important, notably
their personal qualities (e.g. honesty, trustworthiness) and enthusiasm. Four investors
noted that an important consideration in their investment decision was simply that
they liked the entrepreneurs. The most important of the market-product attributes
was the growth potential of the business. The quality of the product was also an
important consideration for a number of investors. However, a large number of
other key attributes were mentioned, in each case by just one or two investors, illustrating the high level of idiosyncrasy in the informal investment process.
The industry sector in which the business operated was an important consideration
in only eight investments (24%), involving seven investors. Given the unimportance
that most investors place on industry sector in their investment decision it is not
surprising to find that in only a minority of investments (35%) was the investor
familiar with the industry sector of the investee business. This confirms our previous
observation (Mason and Harrison 1992) that investors in practice find it easier to
identie those types of businesses that they are not interested in investing in rather than
identifying what kinds of investments they would consider.

3.3 Syndication and co-investment
I n the majority of investments (71%) the investor invested alone. While it is possible
that informal investors who engage in syndication are less likely to join business
introduction services, because they already have strong personal and/or business
referral and investment networks (KPMG 1992), this also provides further confirmation that syndicated investments are relatively uncommon in the UK informal
venture capital market (Mason and Harrison 1994a). Those cases where more than
one investor was involved were of two types. In six cases the investor group comprised family, friends or associates of the LINC investor, with the LINC investor
playing the 'archangel' role in each case: in these cases the other members of the
investment group contributed a majority (57%) of the funds invested. A further six
firms had separately raised finance from other investors unconnected to the LINC
investor (in only one case was the other investor also registered with LINC). While
most of the investments were made in a personal capacity, a small number were
made through the investor's company; these included both trading companies and
also private investment companies.

3.4 Size of investments
The median size of total investment was £30,000 (including LINC investors and any
co-investors); two-thirds of deals involved amounts of under £50,000. However, one in
five deals involved investments in excess of £100,000 (Table 2(a)). This bi-modal size
distribution of informal investments, involving a large number of smaller investments
and a smaller number of larger investments has also been identified in other recent
studies (3i plc 1994, Mason and Harrison 1995b). As noted above, 29% ofinvestments
involved more than one investor. The amounts invested by LINC investors only were
therefore somewhat smaller; the median amount invested by LINC investors was
420,000, with the majority investing less than E25,000 per deal. Nevertheless, one
in five investments involved an investment by the LINC investor of £50,000 or more

(Table 2(b)). Seven firms used the Business Expansion Scheme (BE!;)' to raise
finance, including three of the largest investments; in two of these castes the same
LINC investor invested less than E5,000 in each business.

3.5 Inuestrnent structure
The structure of the investments indicates that informal venture capital involves a
variety of funding mechanisms. Investments that involved just equity finance were in
the minority (40%) and just over one-quarter (29%) of investments involved only
loans (in each case involving amounts of less than &50,000). However, in just over half
of all cases equity finance accounted for half or more of the total amount invested. I n a
majority of the cases (56%) that involved equity investment the investoi: or investor
group took only a minority shareholding. The investor took a 50% holding in a
further six cases (19%), leaving only one-quarter of cases where the invcstor(s) took
more than 50% ownership. Just over half of the entrepreneurs considered that the size
of the equity stake was what they had expected; indeed, some entrepreneurs had
expected to have to give up a larger proportion. However, more than one-quarter
of entrepreneurs had exchanged a larger share of their business than they had
expected: in most of these cases the investor's shareholding (or that of the investor
group) was either 50% or more (Table 3).
Most of the equity investments involved straightforward investment instruments
using ordinary shares. Just 16% of investments involved more complex instruments
- redeemable preference shares, cumulative preference shares, convertible cumulative
preference shares - which enabled the investor to adjust his/her shareholding in the
light of the performance of the business. Each of these investments was for &50,000 or
more. In addition, two of the investments involving only ordinary shares (plus loans)
had ratchets to enable the entrepreneur to regain majority ownership if the business
met its targets. Each of these investments involved a total of more than iC;'100,000 and
the investors were the majority shareholders.

Total

The funding was staged in the case of nine investments (21%), mostly involving
total investments of over E50,000. This was planned from the outset in the larger of
these investments, with the funding being related to specific benchmarks such as
meeting financial targets or opening new establishments, but staging arrangements
tended to be ad hoc in the case of the smaller investments.
Investors provided follow-on finance in just over one-quarter of the investments (the
difference from staged investment being that the need for follow-on financing was not
planned at the time of the original investment). I n all but two cases the additional
finance was provided in the form of loans, often on a short-term basis. I n most cases
the finance was required to meet short-term difficulties. The amounts involved were
quite substantial, comprising 50% of the original aggregate investment in the firms
concerned. Although the supply of follow-on finance was unplanned at the time of the
investment, many of the investors were not surprised that the need for additional
finance had arisen. Some respondents commented that this is always a possibility in
a new business, while in other cases the investor was aware from the business plan that
the need for hrther finance might arise.

4. Negotiating the finance
The business plan plays a key role in raising informal venture capital. More than
three-quarters of the investors (27 out of 34) required to see a business plan before
making the decision to invest. Only a small minority of investors placed little or no
emphasis on the business plan. Three investors were rather sceptical about their value,
one commenting that they are 'produced for bankers and accountants who know
nothing about running a business', and another stating that a business plan represents
'hopes and aspirations7. Two other investors commented that the people and the
business idea were more important than the business plan. The implication for an
entrepreneur seeking to raise informal venture capital is therefore clear: a business
plan is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for raising finance. Most potential
investors will wish to see a business plan, and so the lack of a business plan is likely to
result in an unsuccessful search for investors; however, investors will not invest solely
on the basis of the business plan, so the preparation of a business plan will not
guarantee success in raising finance. Other research suggests that business angels
are most likely to be attracted by business plans that are comprehensive and have
assumptions and projections that are realistic (Mason and Harrison 1996). Wetzel
(1994) adds that winning business plans are investor-oriented, and should articulate

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 14:52 12 November 2008

the vision, goals and objectives of the entrepreneur and the strategy for achieving
them.
Investors wanted information on the financial structure of the business, notably
cash flow and profit and loss forecasts. Most investors also wanted detailed information on the marketplace and potential customers and to inspect the order book, if one
existed. Some investors talked to customers and one accompanied the entrepreneurs to
two trade shows. I n the case of manufacturing firms, most investors also required to
see the product, test it where possible and, if necessary, have the technical details
explained. Many investors also visited the firm's premises and talked a t length to the
entrepreneurs and in some cases to employees. However, despite the impclrtance that
investors give to the character of the entrepreneurlmanagement team in the investment decision-making process (Table l ) , relatively few actually undertook detailed
investigation of the entrepreneurs. The investor's judgement of the entrepreneur is
therefore likely to be based primarily or exclusively on hislher personal assessment of
the entrepreneur's character and expertise.
Only around one-third of entrepreneurs made any attempt to investigate the investor. Typically this involved either a search of Companies House for information on
their previous businesses or else making informal enquiries among industry contacts.
The majority of entrepreneurs therefore accepted the information that investors supplied about themse1ve:i on trust. However, Wetzel (1994) advises that entrepreneurs
should undertake a detailed investigation of their prospective investors: the entrepreneur 'will be living with . . . [the] . . . investor through stresshl times.' Hence,
'finding the right investor is worth the effort' (Wetzel 1994: 181). H e recommends
that entrepreneurs should ask potential investors for the names of their bankers,
accountants and solicitors and have their own bankers, accountants arid solicitors
check their professional reputations. He also advises that entrepreneurs should ask
for references and resumes and should talk to each of the references and to other
entrepreneurs who have raised finance from the investor.
Only a minority of investors (38%) and entrepreneurs (44%) identified any issues
that were difficult to negotiate. However, it should be noted that some of the businesses were fairly desperate for finance and so had limited scope to do anything other
than accept the inve!itorYsconditions. Not surprisingly, by far the mclst common
problem in the negotiations was associated with the investor's size of share shareholding and related issues of ratchet clauses and pricing (Table 4).
The pricing of the investment - the fraction of the equity that the entrepreneur
receives for the finance that they provide (Wetzel 1994) - is a difficult issue. There is
no universally agreed method of valuing a small company and there is ;I paucity of
empirical research into the small business evaluation techniques that have been used
in practice (McMahon et al. 1993). Market-based valuations are inappropriate
because small businesses are not continually valued by the market and appropriate
comparator stocks are unlikely to be available. Asset-based valuations are: more commonly used although finance theory prefers earnings or cash-flow basecl valuations
because they value an enterprise in terms of the h t u r e stream of earnings that the
shareholders might expect from the enterprise. However, these approaches are complex (McMahon et al. 1993). Valuation of start-up businesses adds h r t h e r difficulties
to the valuation process. For example, a start-up business may have only intangible
assets (e.g. intellectual property).
I t is therefore not surprising, particularly in view of the dominance of start-up and
other early stage businesses, to find that the method of calculating the equity stake was

remarkably imprecise. The majority of entrepreneurs and investors described the
process as 'arbitrary', 'informal' or 'by negotiation'. One approach was simply
based on calculating the amount required for start-up and basing the equity shares
on the amounts provided by investor and entrepreneur(s). I n some cases the entrepreneur's 'sweat equity' was also taken into account in such a calculation. Only 20%
of the investments involved any attempt to calculate the equity stake on a more
rigorous basis, typically on the basis of earnings multiples, but even in these cases
the calculation was often fairly arbitrary.
A majority of entrepreneurs (78%) sought professional advice from solicitors and,
less often, accountants in the negotiation process. In the majority of cases their role
was either to draw up the investment agreement or to review it; they were generally
not actively involved in the negotiations with the investor. The costs incurred were
usually modest: 65% of entrepreneurs paid less than £500 (80% less than £1,000) in
professional fees and 45% did not pay any professional fees, either because it was
provided informally or was costed as part of a larger package of professional services
rather than priced separately. Indeed, the largest costs paid by any of the entrepreneurs in the survey was £13,500, arising from a particularly protracted investment
process, but even in this case it represented a modest proportion of the total funds
raised ( A141,000). I n comparison, initial accountancy and legal fees involved in raising institutional venture capital are unlikely to be less than £50,000 to £70,000,
irrespective of the size of the prospective investment (Batchelor 1993).
In contrast, only a minority (38%) of investors used professional assistance. In the
vast majority of these cases solicitors were brought in to draw up the investment
agreement. Just two investors sought professional advice, in both cases from accountants, to assist them in their evaluation of the investment opportunity. Here again, the
costs were extremely modest, with 9 of the 13 investors incumng costs of less than
E500 (including two who passed their costs on to the entrepreneur).

The deliberation time of business angels is also significantly less than thcat of financial institutions. In most of the cases examined here the investment process extended
over less than three months. More than one-third of investors had com:pleted their
evaluation and negotiations' within one month and 82% within three months. Many
investors were unable to separately distinguish between these two stages. Of those who
could, it is clear that evaluation generally took longer than negotiations (in 10 cases
out of 12). Most negotiations with the entrepreneur took less than one week to complete whereas evaluations could take up to three months or more. This speed of
decision-making reflects the way in which most business angels invest. Typically,
they invest in an opportunistic, rather than a scientific, way, relying iu much on
instincts and character as on detailed documentation and do not calcillate IRRs,
payback and the like; rather, financial returns are assessed intuitively. (Timmons
1990, Baty 1991, KPMG 1992).
Looked at from the entrepreneur's perspective, 48% reported that less than a
month elapsed between meeting the investor for the first time and hisllher decision
to invest; a total of 85'K of entrepreneurs reported that less than three months elapsed
between meeting the entrepreneur and the investment decision. However, the receipt
of the finance following the decision to invest was not necessarily as quick: while 37%
of entrepreneurs reported that they had received the finance within a week of the
investor's decision to invest, and 70% within a month, a small minority of entrepreneurs had to wait for some time before receiving the finance. There was no relationship between the size of investment and the elapse of time between the: decision to
invest and receipt of funds involved.
A formal investment agreement was drawn up for about 70% of the investments.
These were primarily concerned with the financial details of the investment, covering
the shareholding structure (e.g. equity split, preference shares, buy-out and buy-back
options, ratchet) or terms of the loan (repayment schedule, interest rate, and in some
cases warrants and promissory notes). Some agreements also included the value of
cheques that could be written without the consent of the investor. Some of the more
detailed agreements also included employment contracts for the entrepreneurs,
restraint of trade, ren~unerationof entrepreneurs and directors' fees.
I t is, of course, important that the investor does not make the investmerit agreement
so one-sided that it affects the entrepreneur's motivation. This objective appears to
have been achieved in the majority of cases. Two-thirds of entrepreneurs and investors
felt that the investment agreement was equally favourable to both side:s (Table 5).
Indeed, a number of investors stated that the aim had been to produce a wellbalanced agreement. Seven investors (21%) believed that the investment agreement
favoured the entrepreneur, compared with only four (12%) who believed that the

agreement favoured them. Amongst the entrepreneurs five (18%) believed that the
agreement favoured the investor while four (15%) thought that the investment agreement favoured them.' Looking at the 20 investments where the views of both investor
and entrepreneur were available, it was found that in more than half of these cases
both investor and entrepreneur felt the investment agreement was equally favourable
-to both sides (Table 6). More importantly, only five entrepreneurs (25%) felt that the
investment agreement favoured the investor. However, two entrepreneurs now think
that the agreement favoured the investor.
For the most part, those entrepreneurs that were contacted did not perceive the
process of raising informal venture capital to be exploitative, despite the stumbling
blocks over pricing and equity shares. The inference is that potential difficulties in
general have been resolved amicably.

5. The post-investment experience
5.1 Handr-on involvement
Investors play a hands-on role in the business in more than three-quarters of investments. I n 60% of cases investors took a seat on the board of directors (in two cases
taking the position of Chairman). I n half of the remaining investments the business
was not a limited company and so there was no board of directors. A small minority of
entrepreneurs did not want, or did not expect, their investor to make any hands-on
contribution.
The main contribution of business angels is the provision of strategic advice, but
other important contributions include networking (especially with potential customers), marketing, financelaccounting management and general management
(Table 7). Investors believe that their single most important contribution has been
their general business experience. There is, however, no consensus amongst entrepreneurs in the identification of the single most important contribution of investors;
although there were a number of responses that noted specific contributions such as

accounting, project planning, guidance on marketing and financial coi~trol,many
responses also highlighted intangible contributions such as 'lifting the spirits',
'enthusiasm', 'sharing the burden' and 'providing a broader view', indicating the
important value-added contribution of the angel in the role of 'coach' o r 'mentor'
(Wetzel 1994).
Most entrepreneurs were at least moderately satisfied with the contri,bution that
their investor has made to the business. Indeed, one in five entrepreneurs reported that
their investor was extremely helpful, twice the proportion who considered that their
investor's contributior~has been extremely unhelphl (Table 8). Most eritrepreneurs
(65%) reported that there had been no change over time in the usefu~lnessof the
investor's contribution. Few entrepreneurs were able to identify any specific shortcomings in the skills or experience of investors that limited their contribution to the
business, and there was little unanimity in those that were identified. However, two
characteristics received more than one mention. First, the lack of speci6c industry/
productlmarket knowledge was noted as a weakness by four entrepreneurs (although
in two cases this was not considered to be a major problem). Second, two entrepreneurs considered that the large company background of their investors was a handicap, because they found it difficult to cope with the sense of urgency and hands-on
commitment required in a small business.
The involvement of investors in their investee businesses varies quite considerably.
About half spend at least a day a week (or the equivalent) in the business. At the other
extreme one-quarter of investors are involved for no more than one diiy a month.
More than half of all investors considered that the amount of time that thmey needed to
devote to their investment was as they had expected at the outset. However, 20% of

investors were spending more time with their investee business than they had originally anticipated and 15% of investors indicated that their time input was less than
they had expected, due in some cases to the long distance between their home and the
location of the business. Furthermore, in the majority (63%) of cases the nature of the
investor's contribution to the business has not changed over time. Where a change in
the role of investors has occurred this mainly reflects the differing needs of the business
as it has progressed from the start-up phase into production. This stability in the
nature of the investor's contribution contrasts with the time that the investor contributes to their investee business. One-third of investors report that the amount of time
that they devote to their investee business has declined while one-quarter of investors
have increased their time input; the increased time input has generally occurred in
situations where the investee business was in difficulty.

5.2 Investor-entrepreneur relationships
The investor-entrepreneur relationship was considered to be fairly productive by both
investors and entrepreneurs (Table 9). The proportion of investors who considered the
relationship to be productive outnumbered those who thought it was unproductive by
a ratio of 2: 1. Entrepreneurs had an even more favourable assessment, confirming the
value of informal investors above and beyond the provision of finance. Investors and
entrepreneurs also viewed the nature of the working relationship in a favourable light,
with those considering it to be consensual significantly outnumbering those who
viewed it as adversarial (Table 10). However, it is often the case that both the
entrepreneur and the business angel, who may also be an entrepreneur, are strong
characters, hence some conflict is likely to be inevitable. Moreover, a number of
entrepreneurs and investors commented that some adversarial situations are beneficial
to the productivity of the relationship. Entrepreneurs therefore need to consider
whether is it better to have money and excellent advice From an experienced investor
rather than deal with people who are nice but are less able to make a useful contribution (Wetzel 1994). There is no evidence from this survey to suggest that the reduced
time input from investors leads to increased dissatisfaction with the relationship by the
entrepreneur, suggesting that the value-added contribution of the business angel is a
function of the qualitative (expertise-based) element in the relationship rather than
the quantitative (time-based) one.

Investment performance

6.

Remarkably little is known about the returns from investing in the infonnal venture
capital market. I n this study there are two alternative measures of the investment
performance. First, an attempt was made to examine the outcomes of all of the 58
investments that were provided by LINC. Where possible, contact was made with
either the investor or the business, or both, to verify the current status of the business.
Considerable effort was devoted to tracking down the businesses; however, it proved to
be impossible to trace what had happened to 12 businesses. Thus, the on:ly definitive
statement that can be made is that 24% of investments have failed (Table 11).
Taking a worst case scenario in which the assumption is made that those businesses
that were not traced are no longer trading suggests that 41 % of the businesses that had
raised finance since 1988 had ceased trading (presumed failed) by mid-1994.
Conversely, under the best case scenario, which assumes that the businesses that
were not traced are still trading, only 21% of businesses have failed (Ta.ble 11). T o
put these figures into perspective, about 11% of VAT-registered businesses are deregistered each year. Erowever, the probability of closure is closely related to the age of
the business, with businesses at their greatest risk of closure in their second and third
years: three-quarters of VAT-registered businesses stay on the register for two years
but just 50% stay for five years and less than one-third for 10 years (Da:ly 1 9 8 7 ) . ~

C. M. MASON AND R. T. HARRISON

The high proportion of businesses in this study that have ceased trading and are
presumed to have failed is largely a consequence of investments made prior to 1991:
up to 87% of these businesses (under the worst case scenario) are no longer trading.
No doubt the severe economic recession of the early 1990s will have been a significant
contributory factor to this high failure rate. In contrast, even under the worst case
scenario 78% of the businesses that raised finance after 1991 were still trading in mid1994 (although this includes two investments in which the investors had sold at a
significant loss). No successful exits were identified.
The investor experience provides the second indication of investment performance.
The 38 investors that were contacted (not all of whom completed the full interview)
had made a total of 42 investments of which 14 had failed (33%) and a further two
had been sold at a significant loss. However, it is important to note that a failed
investment does not necessarily imply that the investor experienced a total investment
loss. Indeed, in the case of one failed investment the investor was able to recoup his
investment by selling the investee business's equipment, and in a further four failed
investments the investors suffered only a partial, although still very significant, loss on
their investment either as a result of receiving some loan repayments prior to the
failure of the business or through the sale of business assets.
None of the investors had made a successful exit from their LINC investments.
However, this simply reflects the dominance of investments made within the past
three years. The nature and timing of the exit was a minor consideration at the present
time, with most investors considering that this was still much too premature. Indeed,
investors in just six of the 24 investments for which there is information had established
the timing and method of the exit: in two of these cases this involved repayment of
loans and in another two cases there was a share buy-back agreement. Finally, two
investments were close to an exit at the time of the interview: in one case the investor,
who had not been looking to sell, had been approached by a potential purchaser, and
in the other case the entrepreneurs were seeking to find other investors to buy-out the
LINC investors. In both cases the investors expected to make a good return on their
investments.
Most investors were unable to put a value on their investments or to indicate the
extent of any paper profits. The general view was that it was too early for the investment to be showing any profit; indeed, a number of investors considered that their
investments were probably of little or no value at the present time. Just two investors
indicated that their investments had increased by a significant multiple. Moreover,
few investors were particularly satisfied with the performance of their investee businesses (Table 12). What is more significant is that for those investments for which
information from both the investor and the entrepreneur is available, the investor is
considerably more dissatisfied with the performance of the business than is the entrepreneur (Table 13). I t can be speculated that this might reflect differences between
investors and entrepreneurs in their initial expectations.
Although none of the investors had successfully exited from their LINC investments,
one-quarter had nevertheless received some financial remuneration, typically in the
form of directors' fee or, less commonly, consultancy fee. In addition, a number of
investors had received interest on their loans, and in a further 20% of investments
there was an agreement that the investor would draw a director's fee when the business was making sufficient profits. I n a substantial minority of cases, therefore, the
investor is effectively seeking to offset at least part of the risk of the investment by

drawing an income, cc~nfirmingthat while capital gains are the primary motive for
investing this is not the only motive (Mason and Harrison 1994a).
Finally, previous research has also established that although the prime motive for
investing is financial, many business angels nevertheless invest in part for psychic
income - notably the f i ~ nand satisfaction gained in being involved with enltrepreneurial businesses (Mason and Harrison 1994a). Most of the investors whose investee
businesses were still trading did confirm that they had derived enjoyment or interest
from their investments .- often more than they had anticipated at the outset. However,
it is also clear from the responses of those investors whose investments had failed that
enjoyment and interest does not compensate for financial loss (Table 14). In the final
analysis, fun and enjoyment are therefore related to the prospects of a financial return:
the generation of psychic income and the success of the investment in financial terms

Summary

Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 14:52 12 November 2008

The main purpose of the study has been to examine three particular aspects of the
operation of the informal venture capital market where information is either lacking
or based on anecdotal or impressionistic evidence, namely the investment process, the
post-investment experience and the investment performance. In order to address these
issues an unusual perspective in informal venture capital research has been adopted in
which the primary focus has been the investment, rather than the investor or investee.

7.1 The investment process
The vast majority of business angels have been shown to regard the industry sector of
the business as unimportant; very few have specific sectoral investment criteria. The
study confirms the overwhelming importance of 'people' and 'product/market' considerations in the business angel's investment decision-making process. I t also highlights the importance that business angels place on seeing a business plan and
emphasizes to the entrepreneur the need to have a comprehensive, realistic, investor-oriented business plan.
Raising informal venture capital has also been shown to be a relatively quick
process, particularly when compared with institutional venture capital, and is relatively inexpensive for both entrepreneur and investor. Informal venture capital is also
a very flexible source of finance. The form that the investment takes is varied, including equity, loans, debt-equity arrangements and even factoring. Many investors also
provide follow-on financing. Business angels are also fairly patient investors.
The investment process itself is remarkably unsophisticated. 'Ad hockery' and 'rules
of thumb' dominate in the pricing of the investment and only a small minority of deals
employed anything other than simple, straightforward investment instruments.

7.2 The post-investment experience
The study has provided further evidence that business angels make a valuable handson contribution to their investee businesses, typically in the form of strategic advice,
business skills and networking. However, it is important not to overlook their contributions as 'coach'/'mentor' which are equally valuable. In the majority of cases the
investor-entrepreneur working relationship is considered by both sides to be productive and consensual.
The findings from this study also serve to reiterate the importance of the geographical proximity of the investor to the investee business, a conclusion from earlier
research (Mason and Harrison 1994a) that has recently been attacked as a 'fallacy'
(Stevenson and Coveney 1994). One of the implications of the hands-on involvement
of most business angels in the businesses in which they invest is that it imposes a
significant distance barrier beyond which investors may be reluctant to invest.
Indeed, 12 of the 15 investors (80%) who are planning to make further investments

<-----Page 19----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 14:52 12 November 2008

INFORMAL VENTURE CAPITAL

123

in the foreseeable future will only invest within a certain distance or travelling time
from their home precisely because of monitoring considerations. One of the,se investors
stated that he only realized the significance of distance to the investee business after
making his first investment. Another investor, who had invested in a business that
proposed to develop a leisure facility and which subsequently failed, c1aimt:d that had
he lived locally he would have realized that the business was not viable. Some other
investors attributed their inability to contribute as much as they wished to their
investee business to the long distance between their home and the location of the
business. Geography is therefore an important factor in the operation of the informal
venture capital market. Distance is only of little or no consequence in two circumstances: first, in the case of hands-off investors, and second, when the investor has
overriding sectoral investment preferences. However, as noted above, only a small
minority of business angels have specific sectoral investment criteria.
These findings suggest that in most cases the informal venture capital process has
worked relatively well. There were only a minority of situations where the entrepreneur felt that the investment agreement favoured the investor, and ever1 fewer the
other way round. The few situations where the relationship between investor and
entrepreneur broke down arose when one or other side believed, rightly or wrongly,
that the other side had withheld important information. This serves to highlight the
importance of the due diligence process for both investors and entrepreneurs. I t is
clear from reviewing these few cases where relationships broke down that too much of
the information provided by one side was taken at face value by the other side.
However, the study has also identified two areas where there are significant and
consistent expectation gaps between investors and entrepreneurs; these concern the
pricing of larger investments and the performance of the business. The pricing of
investments - especially the larger investments - is one of the most difficult issues in
the negotiation proces!;. Differences of opinion between investors and entrepreneurs
concerning what constitutes a favourable performance of the business (e.g, profitability, turnover) may be a source of disputes in the future.

7.3 Investment #erformance
This study confirms that investing in unquoted companies involves high rislss. First, no
investor in the study has made significant financial returns from any of the investments
that were examined, although this is influenced in part by the recession, which seems
likely to have contributed to the high failure rate of investments made prior to 1991
and the consequent dominance of post-1991 investments in the study that are too
recent for exits to have occurred. Second, investors have lost money in a significant
proportion of investments, although in some cases this can be attributed to naivety
and inexperience. For example, one investor whose investment had failed, stated that
he trusted one of the p~rincipalsbecause of his American accent. Another investor in a
business that subseque~ntlyfailed admitted that, in retrospect, he did not q,uestion the
entrepreneurs thoroughly about their personal finances. Yet another investor
admitted that in retrospect he was wrong in taking what he had been .told by the
entrepreneur about the business at face value. Third, the study also reveals that
although investors are seeking significant capital gain, a number nevertheless obtain
some form of earnings stream, either through dividends, interest or, more commonly,

<-----Page 20----->124

director's fees and consultancy fees. This effectively 're-cycles' some of their investment
and also provides partial financial recompense in the event that the investment fails.

8. Conclusions
Although based on a small sample of investments facilitated through a single business
introduction service, this study has advanced informal venture capital research in
three respects: it has focused on the characteristics of the investment, not the investor;
it has, as far as possible, been based on matched dyads of investors and entrepreneur
experiences; and it has extended the range of issues examined to include more detail
than hitherto on the investment process itself, the post-investment experience and the
investment performance. As a preliminary exploration of these issues, this study provides a platform for developing and expanding the field of informal venture capital
research to place greater emphasis on understanding the processes at work in this
informal, largely hidden, market to complement existing research that has described
the characteristics of the actors in that market.

Notes
1. The Business Expansion Scheme was a tax incentive to encourage investments by private individuals in
unquoted companies (see Mason ct al., 1988 for further details).
2. Curiously, the investors in three of these businesses refused to be interviewed for this study.
3. Businesses that deregister are not confined to those that cease trading. There are four reasons why
businesses deregister: (1) trader gocs out of business, (2) take-over by another firm, (3) change in legal
status, and (4) trader falls below the VAT exemption limit. In 1987 only 58% of those that deregistered
went out of business, with a further 21% owing to acquisition (Daly 1987; also see Storey 1994: 84-85).
The life span of deregistered traders that have gone out of business is not separately available.
