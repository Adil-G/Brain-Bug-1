How can relationships be repaired after being damaged? There is a small but growing
body of work on the topic from a number of different disciplinary perspectives using
different theoretical lenses and at different levels of analysis. We begin by examining
the existing streams of work on relationship repair and organizing them into a
conceptual framework. We then consider four questions that probe assumptions or
overlooked issues in existing research with the intent of moving toward a more
comprehensive conceptual foundation.

ported that over half of their respondents felt
that their contractual relationship with their employer had been violated, while Conway and
Briner (2002) suggested an even higher percentage of violations. Researchers also have observed that even close relationships involve
negative events and conflict and that the resilience of relationships is contingent on how
those events are resolved (Driver, Tabares, Shapiro, Nahm, & Gottman, 2003).
The phenomenon of damaged relationships has
clearly been of interest to organizational researchers. For example, organizational researchers have
studied trust violations and the dynamics of distrust within and between organizations (e.g.,
Elangovan & Shapiro, 1998; Lewicki, McAllister, &
Bies, 1998; Robinson, 1996; Sitkin & Roth, 1993; Zaheer, Lofstrom, & George, 2002), violations of psychological contracts (e.g., Morrison & Robinson,
1997; Robinson & Rousseau, 1994), negative relations (e.g., Labianca, Brass, & Gray, 1998), feelings
of injustice (e.g., Barclay, Skarlicki, & Pugh, 2005),
revenge (e.g., Bies & Tripp, 1996), and defections in
economic games (e.g., Komorita & Mechling, 1967),
among other issues. However, much of the extant
research has focused on the processes by which
relationships are damaged and the implica-

How can relationships be repaired after being
damaged? The question is not new, but it has
been made increasingly salient in recent years
with reports of organizations damaging relationships with employees, shareholders, and/or
customers, and with even once-venerated institutions involved in situations causing constituents to question their trust in the institution and
their relationship with it (e.g., religious institutions, media companies, governments). Not by
coincidence, recent survey results have indicated that worldwide trust in companies and
governments is near a low point (World Economic Forum, 2005) and that in the United States
over half of employees do not trust the leaders of
their organization (e.g., Mercer Human Resource
Consulting, 2005; Watson Wyatt, 2007). More
common, albeit less spectacular, incidents also
arise in relationships between coworkers, leaders and subordinates, or departments for reasons such as conflicting goals, organizational
changes, and conflicting values or cultures. For
example, Robinson and Rousseau (1994) re-

tions of such damage, as opposed to how they
are repaired.
Only recently has the nascent interest in the
problem of repairing relationships begun to gain
momentum. For example, scholars have examined how to repair trust (Ferrin, Kim, Cooper, &
Dirks, 2007; Kim, Ferrin, Cooper, & Dirks, 2004;
Lewicki & Bunker, 1996; Nakayachi & Watabe,
2005), how to promote forgiveness and reconciliation (Bradfield & Aquino, 1999; Tomlinson, Dineen,
& Lewicki, 2004), how to restore cooperation (Bottom, Gibson, Daniels, & Murnighan, 2002), and
how to minimize the damage to reputations (Elsbach, 1994). Although these efforts are an excellent
start, they tend to take place in relative isolation
from each other, since they rely on a diversity of
theories, define the problem in different ways, and
have different foci. Furthermore, as yet, there are
no unifying conceptual foundations or theoretical
frameworks that will stimulate research and facilitate analysis directed at the broader problem of
relationship repair.
The purpose of this special topic forum (STF)
is to address these issues, with the central objective being to stimulate research on this important yet relatively underresearched topic.
The STF includes four articles using several different theoretical perspectives, involving different levels of analysis, and helping to build a
conceptual foundation for research in the field.
This introduction is also intended to address
this larger objective—providing a conceptual
foundation for future research— but in a manner
that is different from the four articles. Whereas
each of the articles in this STF contributes toward the overall goal by drilling deep into a
particular aspect of the topic, here we attempt to
provide a broader view of the terrain and to
raise critical questions for future research. We
begin by examining the existing streams of
work on relationship repair and organizing
them into a conceptual framework. In the second
section we consider four questions that may provide the basis for a more comprehensive and
unified conceptual foundation.

PROBLEM DOMAIN AND THEORETICAL
PROCESSES
Problem Domain
What does it mean to “repair” a relationship?
Existing research appears to have provided a

69

range of answers. For example, Kim and colleagues (2004, 2006) have investigated how trust
(perceptions) can be made more positive after a
trust violation (also see Lewicki & Bunker, 1996,
and Nakayachi & Watabe, 2005). Schweitzer,
Hershey, and Bradlow (2006) have adopted a
similar but slightly broader definition of repair
in examining how trust perceptions and behaviors (specifically, risk-taking behaviors) can be
made more positive following a transgression.
Taking a different view, Bradfield and Aquino
(1999) have examined the concepts of forgiveness and reconciliation, conceptualized as releasing negative affect and forgoing revenge
(also see Tomlinson et al., 2004). Taking a
slightly different focus, Bottom et al. (2002) have
examined the restoration of cooperation and
positive affect following a transgression. The
articles in this STF represent and advance these
different views.
Looking across these studies and the broader
set of work that they represent, we see some
convergence in terms of the general conceptualization of repair. Specifically, we propose the
following conceptualization, which is intended to span the cross-disciplinary work on
this topic: relationship repair occurs when a
transgression causes the positive state(s) that
constitute(s) the relationship to disappear
and/or negative states to arise, as perceived by
one or both parties, and activities by one or
both parties substantively return the relationship to a positive state.
As illustrated by the sample of studies cited
above, however, there is divergence in the literature in terms of exactly what factor of a relationship is damaged and, thus, needs to be repaired. Specifically, when a transgression
occurs, there are several interrelated factors
that are damaged and that need to be addressed
for the future viability of the relationship. Failing to identify the underlying structure of the
problem could cause researchers to overlook aspects of the broader problem of relationship repair, how related work is complementary or contradictory, and how future research could
holistically tackle the problem. We address this
issue by mapping the domain of relationship
repair.
As described below, existing research has
identified three factors that are consistently impacted by a transgression and that have important implications for the viability of the relation-

<-----Page 2----->70

Academy of Management Review

ship: trust, negative affect resulting from the
transgression, and negative exchange resulting
from the transgression. We suggest that each
factor contributes a unique and important perspective to what it means to repair a relationship, and, together, they provide an essential set
of factors that jointly comprise the domains of
relationship damage and repair.
Research consistently implicates trust and
perceived trustworthiness1 as cognitive factors
that are negatively impacted in damaged relationships (Robinson, 1996; Sitkin & Roth, 1993).
Specifically, as a result of the transgression,
individuals form inferences about the future behavior of the party, positive expectations disappear and are replaced by negative expectations,
and individuals become unwilling to expose
themselves to further vulnerability (Lewicki et
al., 1998). Trust is important for the future viability of the relationship because it serves as a lens
for interpreting the party’s behavior, as well as a
basis for making decisions about whether and
how to interact with that party (Dirks & Ferrin,
2001). As McEvily, Perrone, and Zaheer (2003)
have observed, trust operates as an “organizing
principle” for managing relationships both
within and across organizations.
Researchers have also pointed out that, in addition to a drop in trust, individuals experience
negative affect after a transgression. It is well
documented that individuals experience negative emotions such as disappointment, frustration, anger, and outrage following a transgression (Barclay et al., 2005; Bies & Tripp, 1996;
Conway & Briner, 2002; Lewicki & Bunker, 1996;
Mikula, Scherer, & Athenstaedt, 1998; Morrison &
Robinson, 1997). From the standpoint of repairing relationships, however, the transitory emotional states may be less important than the
implications that the transgression has for the
stable affective relationship with the offending
party (e.g., general dislike, feelings of injustice).
Negative affect has important implications for
the viability of the relationship because it may
negatively bias trust and because one party

Because trustworthiness is a dominant determinant of
trust (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995) and because trust
repair often occurs through the repair of perceived trustworthiness (Kim et al., 2004), both concepts are relevant.
Throughout the paper, however, we use the term trust for
convenience.

may terminate the relationship to avoid the negative state.
Finally, the above-cited research suggests
that individuals are likely to suspend positive
exchange (e.g., cooperation) and possibly even
engage in negative exchange (e.g., retribution,
revenge, withheld effort). For example, it is clear
that cooperation drops following a transgression and that this pattern is likely to continue
until cooperation is extinguished (Bottom et al.,
2002). In addition, the desire to punish the other
party in some manner following a transgression
appears to be a fundamental tendency, possibly
of evolutionary origins (de Quervain et al., 2004).
The implications of these negative behaviors
and the need to shift the relationship back toward positive exchange are obvious for the viability of the relationship.
Figure 1 provides a map of a representative
sample of studies that have examined relationship repair with regard to these three outcomes.
Readily apparent is that although studies have
examined one or two of the domains, there appear to be none directly addressing all three.
Does this present a problem for understanding
relationship repair? We explore this issue in a
later section. Related to this issue, the narrow
focus of many studies may obscure what is being violated, what needs to be repaired, and
what needs to be measured over time in this
process. We also consider this issue in a later
section.
Processes for Relationship Repair
If one were to select a set of studies from
Figure 1 based on the outcome studied, on the
level of analysis, or on the disciplinary basis,
one might see a relatively focused view but also
get the sense that other parts of the conceptual
landscape are obscured. As one looks across a
broader set of studies, however, a more varied
landscape emerges. In order to make sense of
this landscape, it is necessary to recognize that
there are three different theoretical processes
being advanced for the repair of relationships:
attributional, social equilibrium, and structural.
Table 1 provides a summary.
One perspective focuses on the psychological
processes of the party that perceives another
party to have committed a transgression. Specifically, this perspective suggests that a transgression provides negative information, which

<-----Page 3----->2009

Dirks, Lewicki, and Zaheer

71

FIGURE 1
The Conceptual Domain of Relationship Repair with Examples of Prior Research

the perceiver uses to draw a negative inference
about the traits and intentions of the other party
(e.g., the party is untrustworthy). Repair must
therefore provide information that can offset
and overcome that negative inference. In other
words, in order to repair trust, the wronged party
must perceive that the transgression does not
reflect the violator’s true nature, or the party
must perceive that the violator has experienced
redemption following the transgression. This
process has been modeled by psychologists under the label of attribution theory (Heider, 1958).
Tomlinson and Mayer (this issue), as well as
other researchers (Kim et al., 2004), have demonstrated how attribution theory is particularly
well suited to study the repair of trust. The principles of attribution theory can be applied when
the transgressor is an individual, a group, or an
organization, although there are some differences in the theory’s applicability across levels
of analysis (Hamilton & Sherman, 1996). Along

these lines, Gillespie and Dietz (this issue) describe how the attributional perspective relates
to the repair of trust in organizations; this perspective also underlies Rhee and Valdez’s (this issue)
view of reputation repair. Research has documented a variety of ways that transgressors can
attempt to rebuild relationships through managing the attribution process, including apologies
and accounts (Kim et al., 2004, 2006; Tomlinson &
Mayer, this issue), as well as substantive actions
(Gillespie & Dietz, this issue).
Although the attributional process is helpful
for understanding the cognitive intraperson
components of relationship repair, it is not well
suited to explain the social or interpersonal aspects of a relationship that are damaged following a transgression. Building on the sociological
work of Goffman (1967), Ren and Gray (this issue) propose that transgressions “disrupt the social order.” In other words, the transgression
calls into question the relative standing of the

parties, as well as the conventions or norms that
govern the relationship, thus creating social disequilibrium. To repair the relationship, it is important to reestablish the equilibrium by restoring the relative standing of the parties and to
reaffirm the norms that govern them through
various social rituals (Goffman, 1967). Examples
of such rituals include apologies, penance, and
punishment (Bottom et al., 2002; Reb, Goldman,
Kray, & Cropanzano, 2006; Ren & Gray, this issue). These rituals help to “settle the accounts”
in the relationship as well as to reestablish the
expectations in the relationship. Researchers
have suggested that this social equilibrium process is crucial across a wide spectrum of contexts, ranging from relationships within and between complex social organizations (Reb et al.,
2006) to straightforward exchanges between individuals (Bottom et al., 2002) and even primates

Gillespie & Dietz (2009); Lindskold
(1978); Nakayachi & Watabe
(2005); Sitkin & Roth (1993)

(de Waal, 1993). According to Ren and Gray, this
process is particularly useful for decreasing
negative affect and restoring positive exchange.
In the focus on the intrapersonal and social
processes involved, however, these perspectives
give little consideration to the formal organizational, group, or interpersonal structures, systems, and incentives that may be put in place
following a transgression and the role they may
play in repairing a relationship. More specifically, whereas the attributional process perspective focuses on relationship repair via the
cognitions of the violated party and the social
equilibrium process perspective focuses on the
social or interpersonal aspects of the relationship, the structural process suggests that it is
necessary to change the contextual factors
within which damaged relationships are situated and to install structures, systems, or incen-

<-----Page 5----->2009

tives that discourage or prevent future transgressions. To the extent that factors are put in
place following a transgression, the aggrieved
party may begin to form positive expectations
about the other party’s future behavior.
Several examples of this idea exist in the literature. Sitkin and Roth (1993) refer to the role of
“legalistic remedies”—that is, the use of various
controls (e.g., policies, procedures, contracts,
monitoring) that increase the reliability of future
behavior and therefore restore trust. In this issue
Gillespie and Dietz discuss a similar concept,
which they term a distrust regulation mechanism. Similarly, Nakayachi and Watabe (2005)
use the concept of “hostage posting,” which presumably makes it difficult or costly to engage in
future transgressions. The notion of repair in this
structural perspective is slightly different from the
other two perspectives, and its logic is more focused on restoring positive exchange than on repairing trust or reducing negative affect.
In summary, existing research can be classified as using one of these three processes to
study relationship repair. The processes tend to
be differentially suited for addressing the different aspects of this multifaceted problem. As we
suggested above, the attributional perspective
is particularly useful for addressing trust repair,
although it can also indirectly address issues of
reducing negative affect and restoring positive
exchange. The social equilibrium perspective is
particularly suited for addressing negative affect
and exchange, although it might indirectly address the repair of trust (Ren & Gray, this issue).
Finally, the structural perspective is particularly
effective for addressing exchange behaviors and
(indirectly) the repair of trust and affect (e.g.,
through fear of punishment or monitoring). A key
theoretical issue that arises is whether, in order to
fully understand the repair of relationships, researchers will need to consider the interplay between two or more of these processes.
BUILDING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND
UNIFIED CONCEPTUAL FOUNDATION
In the preceding section we attempted to map
the domain of existing research on relationship
repair and the theoretical processes covered by
the literature. The overview reveals a body of
work that spans several disciplinary perspectives and levels of analysis. Given the combination of the breadth of the topic and the limited

73

amount of research on it, it is not surprising that
a unified conceptual foundation for the notion of
relationship repair has yet to emerge. In this
section we examine four questions through
which we probe implicit assumptions or overlooked issues in existing research. In considering these issues, we hope to advance toward a
more comprehensive and unified conceptual
foundation for future research.
What Does It Mean to “Repair” a
Relationship?
As noted above, repair is conceptualized as
occurring when a transgression causes the positive state(s) that constitute(s) the relationship to
disappear and/or negative states to arise, as
perceived by one or both parties, and activities
by one or both parties substantively return the
relationship to a positive state. Below we raise
questions about two ways to view repair that fit
within the broad definition but depart from existing approaches found in the literature.
The first issue returns to the question of what
outcomes are being repaired. In many situations
an employee who has experienced a transgression is likely to lose trust, to have negative affect, and to be more likely to engage in negative
exchange compared to an employee who has
not experienced a transgression (Morrison &
Robinson, 1997). However, scholars have tended
to focus on only one or two of these factors in a
given study (see Figure 1). The following question arises from this approach. Is a relationship
truly repaired if only one or two of the outcomes
identified in Figure 1 are addressed, or must all
three be addressed? For example, if positive
exchange is restored, perhaps by putting structures in place to prevent negative behaviors, but
distrust and negative affect still exist, can we
consider the relationship to be repaired? As another example, if the party has been forgiven
(i.e., negative affect is eliminated) but trust is
not repaired, is the relationship repaired? In
short, does repair necessitate that the relationship be repaired across all factors that were
affected by the transgression?
The answer to this question is not straightforward. On the one hand, trust, affect, and exchange are clearly separate and distinct constructs, and each is grounded in a particular
literature base. Focusing on only one or two
factors allows researchers to probe with greater

<-----Page 6----->74

Academy of Management Review

depth into the theoretical processes involved
and may allow for more precision in explaining
why and when repair can be achieved. On the
other hand, the other factors are also important
components of the relationship, and they may
have implications for whether the relationship
can remain viable in the long run. Building on
the example described above, even though exchange may be restored, the lack of trust or high
levels of negative affect may eventually lead to
the dissolution of the relationship because of
the costs involved in maintaining the relationship in this situation. Or if negative affect is
eliminated in the short term, the lack of trust
may cause it to reemerge at a later point (see the
linkages described in Tomlinson & Mayer, this
issue). Thus, defining repair narrowly (e.g., only
focusing on affect) may mean that another critical state may be overlooked (e.g., trust); although this may not be problematic in the short
term, the overlooked state may eventually undermine the former in the long term.
We suggest that instead of a clear-cut answer,
the issue comes down to one of trade-offs. One
such trade-off is that theory cannot be simultaneously general, accurate, and simple (see
Thorngate, 1976). For example, the broader view
of relationship repair may provide a more general and perhaps more accurate view of the phenomenon, but simplicity is likely to be compromised. There may also be a trade-off between
more precise theory (current approach) and
more practical theory, to the extent that dealing
with violations in practice requires simultaneously addressing issues related to trust, negative affect, and exchange. Thus, researchers
might determine how to make these trade-offs
by considering the objective of the research. In
those situations where researchers choose to focus on a narrow conceptualization, we recommend that they explicitly recognize and discuss
the limitations of their approach.
The second issue involves what facet of the
relationship is repaired. This issue arises from
the assumption in existing research that repair
involves movement along a continuum, from
negative to positive valence for the factor in
question (e.g., trust, affect, exchange). This approach is represented in the majority of conceptual and empirical research on the topic (e.g.,
Bottom et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2004; Schweitzer et
al., 2006). In this conceptualization the negative
state is eliminated from the relationship by def-

January

inition. An alternative conceptualization will allow for the simultaneous existence of positive
and negative states of the factors in question—
that is, trust and distrust, positive and negative
affect, and/or positive and negative exchange
will coexist (i.e., the relationship involves ambivalence).
Lewicki et al. (1998) foreshadowed this idea
with regard to trust (similar ideas exist in research on affect and exchange). They argued
that as a relationship becomes multiplex or multifaceted (i.e., operates around different content
areas or domains), it can simultaneously involve
trust and distrust. This argument relies on the
notion that individuals can segment relationships and thus allow for the possibility that the
complex relationship can at the same time be
positive in some facets and negative in others.
Adapting their example, one may interact with a
fellow faculty member in several facets, including teaching, research, and outdoor pastimes
such as golf, and might trust the colleague as a
research collaborator, but not as a golf partner
(see also Rhee & Valdez, this issue). This idea
has potential implications for repair. For example, perhaps the research collaborator takes an
action that results in a loss of trust in his or her
work with data, but not in his or her work with
the theory. Repair might involve the coauthor’s
buttressing or proving his or her trustworthiness
in the empirical domain but not in the theoretical domain. This conceptualization of repair is
fundamentally different from the prevailing
view in the literature since it recognizes the
continued coexistence of positive and negative
states (i.e., ambivalence) across different facets.
The ambivalence conceptualization is worth
exploration because it may offer a different or
broader range of repair strategies than the existing literature, extending it to options such as
segmenting the relationship or downplaying the
negative facets while enhancing the positive
(for an example, see Pratt & Dirks, 2006). When
might researchers give consideration to this
conceptualization? We propose that a critical
contingency is the nature of the transgression,
since this will determine whether the relationship can be segmented. Researchers examining
all three repair processes (attributional, social
equilibrium, and structural) have identified the
nature of the transgression to be a pivotal determinant of the success of repair efforts
(Gillespie & Dietz, this issue; Kim et al., 2004;

<-----Page 7----->2009

Dirks, Lewicki, and Zaheer

Reb et al., 2006; Ren & Gray, this issue; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993). The nature of the transgression may
also be important for the present issue, since it
will determine whether a transgression in one
facet will spill over into other facets. To the
extent that a transgression in one facet has a
spillover effect (e.g., trust in multiple facets is
affected), it may be difficult to have a relationship that is simultaneously both positive and
negative.
Prior research has proposed that an important
distinction between types of transgressions is
whether they call into question the integrity or
values of a party versus the competence of the
party (Kim et al., 2004; Sitkin & Roth, 1993). Using
this distinction, we suggest that transgressions
that call into question the integrity or values of
a party have significant potential to spill over
into other facets. Sitkin and Roth (1993) proposed, for example, that a transgression involving values or integrity tends to be generalized
across facets because of stereotypes. Although
they did not elaborate, this tendency may result
when individuals have cognitive schemas encoded with the belief that negative information about integrity is not only highly diagnostic (e.g., see Reeder & Brewer, 1979) but also is
informative about an one’s character in a way
that transcends situations. The notion is aptly
represented with the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson that “no change of circumstances can repair a defect of character” (1876: 97–98). This
logic would suggest that individuals tend to assume that, for example, when a person cheats at
golf, he or she might also be likely to cheat in
other situations (business). In addition to this
cognitive mechanism, transgressions involving
integrity arouse greater levels of negative affect
than other forms of transgressions (Tranfinow,
Bromgard, Finlay, & Ketelaar, 2005), and the increased magnitude of negative affect may make
it difficult to isolate.
In contrast, transgressions of competence may
be more likely to be facet specific, since individuals are less likely to assume that skills or abilities are generalizeable across facets. For instance, individuals are likely to recognize that
lack of competence at golf is not diagnostic of
competence in business, or that lack of knowledge of tax codes is not necessarily diagnostic
of lack of knowledge in other facets. In addition,
to the extent that transgressions of competence

75

result in lower levels of affective arousal, they
may also be easier to isolate.
In sum, we propose that transgressions perceived to stem from a lack of integrity are much
more likely to spill over into other facets of a
relationship than transgressions that are perceived to result from a lack of competence. As a
result, the ambivalence model may be appropriate to consider when transgressions involve
competence but not necessarily integrity.
Are the Processes for Repair Independent or
Connected?
Earlier, we raised the question of whether researchers need to understand the interplay
among the three repair processes (attributional,
social equilibrium, and structural). As suggested above, researchers have focused on only
a single process and have tended to study only
one or two outcome variables related to that
process. For example, in this issue Tomlinson
and Mayer address repair as an attributional
process, whereas Ren and Gray discuss it as a
social equilibrium process. These articles do not
cross into each other’s territory (at least explicitly), and neither incorporates the structural perspective. Prior studies have tended to do the
same (e.g., see Kim et al., 2004, 2006; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993). In addition, the models make different assumptions about “where the action is.”
Whereas the attributional perspective suggests
that the locus of action lies within the individual, the social equilibrium model emphasizes
the relationships between individuals and the
structural perspective focuses on the context in
which the breakdown occurs. In short, because
past research on repair has implicitly tended to
take place within theoretical silos, limited consideration has been given to how these repair
processes might relate across these silos.
Separate development does not necessarily
mean, however, that the processes are unrelated. Understanding whether and how these
different processes might relate to each other is
important for several reasons. One reason for
understanding the relationship is that it informs
whether it is viable to try to utilize all three
processes and outcomes at once (see Figure 1). A
second reason is that some of the tactics for
repair have the potential to influence more than
one process. Consider the role of apology as one
example. Researchers have analyzed the effects

<-----Page 8----->76

Academy of Management Review

of apologies from both attributional (e.g., Tomlinson & Mayer, this issue) and social equilibrium (Ren & Gray, this issue) perspectives. Likewise, the notion of hostage posting studied by
Nakayachi and Watabe (2005) has its theoretical
roots in the structural perspective, but evidence
suggests that its effects operate at least in part
via attributions. Thus, understanding the full set
of effects may require the specification of the
linkages and interactions among theoretical
processes. A final reason for considering this
issue is that the violator may try to employ multiple tactics, the effects of which may either reinforce each other or perhaps cancel out each
other. For example, following an integrity violation, apologizing and accepting blame may reduce negative emotions (e.g., Ohbuchi, Kameda,
& Agarie, 1989) but may make it difficult to repair trust (Kim et al., 2004).
Is there a single or direct way to understand
the connections? Our analysis suggests that
there is not. Instead, in some cases one process
may facilitate another, in others one process
may inhibit another, and in still other cases
processes may be independent (see Figure 2).
Although our analysis is not intended to provide
an exhaustive review of a complex set of rela-

January

tionships, it is intended to illustrate some of the
primary ways in which they might relate.
The attributional and social equilibrium processes would both seem to have a limited effect
on the structural process and, thus, be relatively
independent in that sense. The assumption of
the structural process is that, given the right
opportunity or motivation, all individuals are
capable of engaging in a transgression. To the
extent that this is true, while attributional and
social equilibrium processes would seem to decrease the perceived risk related to a future
transgression by a specific party within a specific relationship context, structural processes
are intended to curb such behaviors in a uniform
way across parties.
In contrast, the attributional and social equilibrium processes are likely to mutually complement each other. For example, to the extent
that the social equilibrium process defuses
negative emotions (Ren & Gray, this issue), it
may also remove some of the negative biases
described by Tomlinson and Mayer (this issue).
Alternatively, if the wronged party shifts the
attribution such that he or she sees it as less
controllable or more unstable (Tomlinson &
Mayer), the negative emotion experienced may

<-----Page 9----->2009

be decreased and the need to reestablish norms
or rebalance the scales may be decreased (Ren
& Gray). Thus, in some circumstances activities
that support one process may support the other.
Structural processes have the potential to facilitate or complement social equilibrium processes. For example, structure might formalize
and (re)affirm norms about appropriate behavior in the relationship, particularly those related
to the transgression. In addition, structural processes might prevent future transgressions. Research on societal conflicts provides examples
of these ideas: peacekeeping forces are used to
limit retaliation between parties, and treaties
help define the roles and behaviors of the different parties (Gray, Coleman, & Putnam, 2007).
Finally, in some circumstances structural processes may inhibit attributional processes. Strickland (1958) conducted an experiment in which
a subject viewed two workers who provided the
same level of work, but one of the workers was
monitored by the supervisor and the other
worker was not. The former worker was seen as
less trustworthy (dependable). Malhotra and
Murnighan (2002) reached a similar conclusion,
finding that the use of binding contracts impeded the development of trust and diminished
existing trust. Both studies point toward the fact
that trust development may be inhibited in
these situations because perceivers may make
situational attributions for cooperation when it
takes place under structural constraints that
promote cooperation. In short, this work suggests that when structural constraints are in
place to ensure positive exchange, it is difficult
to distinguish their effects from the effects of
other actions designed to build or rebuild trust.
It is worth noting, however, that the relationship between structural processes and attributional processes is complex (Costa & BijlsmaFrankema, 2007) and the processes may relate in
other ways.
In summary, looking at the intersections
among these processes, it is clear that some
processes facilitate others, some undermine others, and yet others are largely independent. As
discussed above, structural processes are most
likely to operate independent of the other two,
and researchers will need to take this into account. Gillespie and Dietz (this issue) theorize
about steps that might be taken to address multiple processes, such as the structural and attributional. Specifically, they discuss the role of

77

“distrust regulation” to overcome confident negative expectations following a transgression.
Likewise, in earlier work on reducing interpersonal or internation conflict, Lindskold (1978)
proposed that in high stakes situations it is important, and perhaps necessary, to sustain the
potential to deter the other party from engaging
in a relationship transgression through punishment or other structures, even as one attempts to
reestablish trust. Thus, while the structures attempt to ensure cooperation or provide a foundation on which the relationship can survive,
the parties can work to build trust. Again, given
the fact that these processes often are not independent, we encourage future research to consider their various connections and the implications for relationship repair.
What Are the Implications of Viewing Repair
As a Temporal Process?
Existing research implicitly recognizes that
relationship repair is a dynamic process, but
much of the existing empirical research has
tended to examine it as one snapshot or a series
of snapshots. Theoretical perspectives, which do
not involve the constraints of empirical studies,
have provided a more dynamic view. The articles in this issue provide examples. Tomlinson
and Mayer discuss the series of steps involved
in transgression and repair as part of a larger
model of trust. Ren and Gray offer a face management perspective, which creates a time line
of sequential steps that provide insight into the
time sequence of events in a relationship transgression. Finally, Gillespie and Dietz describe a
four-step process for organizational trust repair.
In order to effectively map the domain of relationship repair and to understand how these
papers are located within that broad domain, it
may be helpful to “deconstruct” a relationship
transgression episode into four “stages,” each of
which has a different set of issues. (1) Pretransgression: What is the state of trust, affect, and
exchange in the relationship prior to the transgression? (2) Disruption: What factors are
changed by the transgression and how? (3) Repair: What actions are taken to repair these factors? (4) Postrepair: What is the state of trust,
affect, and exchange following trust repair actions?
Figure 3 depicts these four stages; we discuss
each briefly here. The discussion presumes that

FIGURE 3
Relationship Repair As a Temporal Process

the transgression is between a single actor (the
violator) and a single victim (wronged party)
and that the stages are perceived and interpreted from the wronged party’s perspective (actors may not recognize these stages or may view
them differently).
Pretransgression: What is the state of trust,
affect, and exchange? At the most basic level,
the state of the relationship prior to the transgression might be construed as the “raw” or
absolute level of trust for the other party. We can
assume that this level of trust is somewhere
above “zero”—that is, there is an amount of trust
that varies from low positive to high positive.
Moreover, as we noted earlier, research on trust
has shown that the construction of trust itself is
not unitary (Zaheer, McEvily, & Perrone, 1998).
Trust has cognitive components and affective
components that lead to behavioral intentions,
and there are other elements in the relationship
that may be affected (e.g., expectations of fairness that may affect judgments of trust; Lewicki,
Wiethoff, & Tomlinson, 2005). Therefore, a complex understanding of changes in the trust level
should specify the pretransgression level of cognitive, affective, and intention levels, as well as
other factors of the relationship, since any or all
of these trust components can be affected by a
relationship transgression.
Disruption: What factors are changed by the
transgression and how? An external event, presumably initiated by the actor or attributed to
his or her actions by the victim, creates a relationship disruption. The exact nature of this
event may be simple or complex and is highly
contextualized within the pretransgression state
of the relationship. As noted above, trust, affect,
and exchange may all be negatively affected, or
perhaps only a subset of them. Exactly how
much they are affected, as well as which facet of
the relationship the violation occurred within

(see above discussion), is also an important consideration.
Repair: What actions are taken to repair these
factors? The third box in Figure 3 indicates that
the violating actor initiates a set of actions
motivated by a desire to repair or restore the
relationship (the precise nature of the intent
and the consequence of these actions—repairing versus restoring—are addressed below).
Presumably, the actions themselves are directed
toward altering the negative consequences produced by the transgression (here and elsewhere
we have assumed the actor has a desire to deal
with or repair the violation). Consistent with our
threefold characterization of repair processes
discussed earlier, repair actions can target attributional processes, producing new or revised
cognitions (trust). Repair actions can restore
the social equilibrium to act on the affective
feelings of hurt, betrayal, and anger that may
exist. Finally, repair actions can involve instituting structures to facilitate future positive exchanges, such as contracts or covenants that
specify intentions, obligations, and penalties for
future transgressions (Loomis, 1959; Sitkin &
Roth, 1993).
Postrepair: What is the state of trust, affect,
and exchange? Finally, the last box in Figure 3
represents the state of the posttransgression relationship after repair initiatives have been attempted in Stage 3. If relationship repair is successful, it should be possible to measure the
impact of the repair actions on subsequent
states and actions. These measures may include
new or changed cognitions about the actor by
the victim, more positive (or less negative) affective disposition toward the actor, more positive
intentions to trust the other in future exchanges,
and expectations of more productive exchanges
within the specific facet of the interpersonal relationship.

<-----Page 11----->2009

Dirks, Lewicki, and Zaheer

Although we readily acknowledge that the
process is much more fluid in reality, we believe
that it is helpful to deconstruct and delineate
this four-stage process for two major reasons.
First, many studies of repair only focus on the
repair efforts themselves and their presumed
consequences, without calibrating either the
prior levels of key relationship variables before
the transgression or their subsequent levels after the transgression. Admittedly, there are significant problems in effectively assessing these
distinctions: the violating actor may have incomplete information about how the transgression was interpreted by the victim, or the actor
may not know the range of options available for
repairing specific types of wrongs. Second, there
are significant measurement problems for valid
and reliable data collection at all steps in this
flow, but this should not deter researchers from
attempting to be more precise about what data
are collected pretransgression and posttransgression and how the repair actions actually
attempt to operate on the damage created by the
transgression itself.
Connecting this issue with our earlier discussion about the nature of repair, one area for
future consideration is whether repair initiatives fully restore the relationship to the pretransgression state. For example, is trust (or affect or exchange) in its postrepair state the same
as in its prerepair state? On the one hand, it may
be presumed that Stage 3 efforts (Figure 3) fully
restore trust to its pretransgression state or condition—that is, there are no visible (or less visible) traces of the impact of the transgression.
On the other hand, it may be that Stage 3 efforts
only repair trust, but in a manner that now incorporates and cannot hide the impact of the
transgression—that is, the transgression has
transformed the underlying trust in a significant
way.
Several of the papers in this issue address
this problem, to some degree. Tomlinson and
Mayer address the problem most directly, referring to “updated evaluations” of trust and the
violated person’s judgments of ability, benevolence, and integrity following repair efforts.
Similarly, Ren and Gray write about a “restored
equilibrium” following restoration efforts, although this process receives considerably less
attention than the nature of the restoration activities and the cultural context in which they
occur (Stage 3). Neither paper, however, directly

79

compares the repaired trust or affect to pretransgression trust or affect, and both papers discuss
repair and restoration interchangeably. Nor do
the authors consider whether trust exists in the
same facets as opposed to being repaired in one
facet while distrust continues to exist in another
facet (see our discussion in an earlier section).
An appropriate metaphor to distinguish between these two alternatives (restoration versus
repair) may be a flower vase in which the broken pieces have been cemented, the joints
sanded, and the vase reglazed so that there is
absolutely no visible trace of the break, versus a
flower vase in which a simple cementing process has been used so that the fracture lines and
glue joints can still be seen. Research on relationship repair has not distinguished between
repair and restoration, either in conceptual distinction or empirical measurement. It may be
possible to gain a better understanding of these
dynamics by improved research attention to and
measurement of both pretransgression and
posttransgression cognitions, affect, and behavioral dispositions. Finally, it may be that, compared to a relationship that is restored, a repaired relationship may be more fragile and
susceptible to future transgressions because
there may yet be deep-seated scars from the
transgression so that the relationship can never
again become exactly what it was initially.
Is Repairing a Relationship the Same or
Different at Different Levels of Analysis?
As should be obvious, the problem of relationship repair is relevant at all levels of analysis.
There has, however, been little or no consideration
in the literature about the implications of different
levels of analysis. For the purpose of developing a
more comprehensive and unified conceptual foundation for relationship repair within and between
organizations, we suggest that it is important to
consider what might be the same or different
across a variety of levels of analysis.
To address this issue, this STF includes articles that span a range of levels of analysis and
also develop multilevel theories. Specifically,
Tomlinson and Mayer focus on repairing the
trust one individual has for another, Ren and
Gray theorize about the relationship between
individuals but focus on the dyad, Gillespie and
Dietz examine an employee’s relationship with
the organization, and Rhee and Valdez study the

<-----Page 12----->80

Academy of Management Review

relationship between external stakeholders and
the organization through its reputation, akin to a
collective-to-collective level of analysis. Thus,
this set of papers captures three forms of organizational relationships, varying the level of
analysis of both parties: a relationship between
two individuals (e.g., coworker-coworker), a
relationship between an individual and an organization (employee-organization), and a relationship between two institutions (stakeholderorganization). Below we develop the outlines of
a theory to systematically connect levels of
analysis with repair processes. In effect, we attempt to answer the question “What differences
exist between relationships at different levels of
analysis, and how do they affect repair processes?”
We suggest that the general concept of levels of
analysis is too coarse to provide traction for addressing the issue. Instead, we propose focusing
on two dimensions on which these relationships
might differ: compositional and contractual. We
discuss each dimension below, including what
they mean and why they have important implications. For the sake of simplicity, we consider two
kinds of relationships over different levels of analysis: individual-to-individual (hereafter “interpersonal”) and organization-to-organization (hereafter “interorganizational”).
By the term compositional we mean that the
interpersonal relationship is composed of unitary actors, whereas an interorganizational relationship is made up of collectives. For example, with the concept of trust, an interpersonal
relationship involves one individual trusting
another individual, whereas an interorganizational relationship involves one organization
(i.e., collection of individuals) trusting another
organization (i.e., collection of individuals).
Thus, this dimension derives directly from the
definition of an interpersonal versus interorganizational relationship.
This dimension has implications for the nature of the concepts themselves (e.g., trust), as
well as the processes involved in their repair.
We begin by conceptually distinguishing the
essential nature of interpersonal trust from that
of interorganizational trust. A well-known trust
model at the interpersonal level views trustworthiness as composed of ability, benevolence,
and integrity (Mayer et al., 1995). In their crosslevel model of trust repair, Gillespie and Dietz
also view the trustworthiness of an organiza-

January

tion, in the eyes of individual employees, as
composed of the same three factors. In contrast,
at the interorganizational level, trust has empirically been shown to be a composite of reliability, predictability, and fairness (Zaheer et
al., 1998). In sum, there may be some differences
in the structure of the constructs at different
levels, although research is needed to establish whether the constructs actually operate in
the same way despite the differences (e.g., see
Ferrin, Bligh, & Kohles, 2007). Similar issues
arise with the concepts of affect and exchange.
Not only may the concept of trust be different
for individuals versus collectives, but the processes by which trust arises and is repaired may
also be different. For example, if the perceiver is
a collective, judgments of trust may shift from
identifying underlying attributes of individuals
to evaluating the trustworthiness of the systems
and processes that make up the organization.
Along these lines, Gillespie and Dietz propose
that perceived organizational trustworthiness
involves judgments about the systems, processes, culture, and management practices of
an organization, as opposed to the personality
attributes of an individual.
Furthermore, there may be differences related
to the target as a collective versus the individual. Hamilton and Sherman (1996) proposed that
the attribution principles operate in the same
way for individuals and collectives in situations
where the organization is perceived to be a unitary and homogeneous collection. However,
when the organization is perceived to be diverse
(as opposed to unified), the attribution principles may be less applicable. These potential
differences have implications for repair processes. Repair at the organizational level may
be more difficult, owing to the compositional
dimension (i.e., if multiple organization members have to be convinced to recalibrate their
views toward a violating organization). Similarly, if the multiple and complex structures and
systems at the organizational level have been
modified to treat another organization as a violator, repair will involve the wholesale recalibration
of systems and processes in a coherent and systemic fashion (Gillespie & Dietz). In addition, a
greater range of options for repairing trust may be
available when dealing with two collectives (e.g.,
firing the person responsible for the act) as opposed to two individuals.

<-----Page 13----->2009

Dirks, Lewicki, and Zaheer

The second dimension is the contractual form
of the relationship. Macneil (1980) categorized
contracting processes in relationships as social
or “relational,” in contrast to the classical characterization—that is, purely economic, market
based, or transactional. Social elements such as
norms and expectations enter into and form part
of relationships based on relational contracting,
but not those based on classical market contracting. Another factor that distinguishes these
two types of relationships is the time horizon;
whereas relationships based on classical contracts are instantaneous, spot, arm’s-length
transactions, those based on relational contracting adopt an extended time horizon and promote
“serial equity” (equity calibrated over a series of
transactions) over “spot equity” (equity calibrated within the transactional exchange). Referencing essentially the same idea, sociologists
have distinguished social exchange relationships from economic exchange relationships
(e.g., Blau, 1964). Whereas relationships based
on economic exchange operate in a marketlike
relationship with specified obligations, relationships based on social exchange tend to operate
through trust and reciprocity, without specified
obligations. In addition, an affective element
also tends to accompany social or relational exchange to a greater extent than pure economic
exchange. According to Blau, “Only social exchange tends to engender feelings of personal
obligation, gratitude and trust; purely economic
exchange as such does not” (1964: 94).
It is possible for both interpersonal and interorganizational relationships to involve either contractual form. For example, Fiske (1992) discussed how interpersonal relationships can
operate according to norms associated with social or economic forms of exchange. Likewise,
interorganizational relationships include institutionalizing processes (Ring & Van de Ven,
1994), which extend the time horizon of relationships beyond the individuals involved in them
and thus allow for a relational exchange. That
said, comparing the two forms, it is often the
case that the exigencies of efficiency (“business
is business”) are likely to result in interorganizational relationships being more market oriented than interpersonal ones, and affective elements of the relationship that might overcome
pure business considerations may be reined in
by the threat or reality of audits and reviews. In
sum, relationships of either kind can be market

81

or relational, but interorganizational relationships are much less likely to be of the latter type,
and this issue might be confounded in the analysis of repair at different levels of analysis.
The contractual form is important for repair
because it may have implications for the effectiveness of repair processes (see Table 1). In
particular, to the extent that relationships involving economic versus relational contractual forms are governed by different rules that
reside in the schemata of the actors (Fiske,
1992), different repair tactics or processes may
be required. For example, whereas structural
remedies might be considered as highly appropriate in economic exchanges, they sometimes
may be difficult to impose in relational exchanges without violating the norms governing
the relationship. In examining repair from a social equilibrium perspective, Ren and Gray propose in this STF that the cultural context of the
relationship will determine which behaviors are
seen as transgressions and how effective remedies are offered as solutions. Extending this
idea, the contractual form of the relationship
may also determine the actions viewed as transgressions and the remedies that right them. For
example, while the social equilibrium process
may be particularly crucial to a relational exchange, the perspective may be less powerful in
the context of short-term economic exchanges
where affective components are less relevant.
In sum, we expect these two dimensions to
provide leverage for understanding similarities
and differences for repair of interpersonal versus interorganizational relations. Because the
two dimensions are largely independent, they
may be combined to form a 2 ⫻ 2 matrix—
contractual form: relational versus economic;
compositional form: individuals versus collectives—which may reveal interesting implications. For example, in the relational-collective
quadrant, the complexity of the transgression
discovery process; the disruption caused to the
large number of components, systems, and organizational members involved in the relationship; and the complexity of the repair processes
will together create a qualitatively different
phenomenon both in terms of the transgression
and the repair relative to all other quadrants.
Repair in the economic-individual quadrant is
also quite different from other quadrants. While
social equilibrium processes in this case will be
underemphasized relative to the relational

<-----Page 14----->82

Academy of Management Review

quadrants, the clarity of the locus of the transgression and, relative to organizations, the lack
of complexity in the nature of the relationship
mean that external attributions may need
greater justification. Consequently, repair in
this quadrant might involve significant mea culpas, economic reparations, and easily observable structural remedies, rather than just the
restoration of the affective state. However, as in
the collectives quadrants, the nature of repair
will also depend on the relative power balance
in the relationship (from, say, the existence of
alternatives).
While we have provided some ideas in this
direction, an important avenue for future research would be to empirically identify both the
presence and weight of different processes and
factors, as well as to identify boundary conditions (such as the power balance) in each quadrant. It is important to pursue this line of research because the nature of relationship repair
is likely to systematically vary in each of the
four quadrants, and such variation is grist for
the mill of a theory of repair at different levels of
analysis.
CONCLUSION
The question motivating this STF was “How
can individuals or organizations repair relationships once they are damaged?” Each of the four
articles in the STF, as well as this introduction,
makes the case that relationship repair is a fundamental but surprisingly understudied problem. The purpose of the STF is to stimulate work
on this important topic and to provide a stronger, comprehensive, and more unified foundation for such work, both as it exists now and for
the future to build on.
What might future work look like? The contributions that make up this STF provide the foundations for advancing different perspectives on
this problem and for systematically incorporating the different levels of analysis at which the
phenomenon is observed. The idea behind publishing the articles as a set, as well as this
introduction, is to reinforce the integration of
perspectives and to encourage extensions into
future work. Consequently, the spirit of the STF
advocates research that not only drills down into a
particular perspective but also takes into consideration and integrates these other perspectives. In
doing so, we hope that future studies will not only

January

develop more comprehensive theoretical insights
but also will be more likely to provide a window
into how relationship repair dynamics operate in
practice.
