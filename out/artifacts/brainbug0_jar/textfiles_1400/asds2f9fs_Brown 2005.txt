Abstract

of the effectiveness of teaching essential methods in
engineering design has a broad and significant impact
on adding value to the practice of engineering. The
contribution offered by the current work is to advance
the practice of teaching axiomatic design, particularly
in a course on manufacturing processes, while giving
proper perspective to the contributions of N.P. Suh
(1990, 2001).
In 1997, Campbell and Colbeck published an
insightful critical literature review on teaching and
assessing engineering design. They note that there
are no articles about how to assess students' designs
and that the literature on teaching engineering design
is relatively new, begun about 1987. Campbell and
Colbeck point out that the approach to teaching
engineering involves practice solving open-ended
p r o b l e m s , creativity, t e a m w o r k , teaching by
coaching, and experience for offering evaluation of
student work. They stress the need for more education
on teamwork.
Evaluation of engineering designs in the absence
of an underlying science is problematic. Love (1980)
showed how design evaluation could be based on
the degree of achieving objectives or functions. Pugh
(1991), taking a broad view that incorporates
m a r k e t i n g and selling as well as traditional
engineering design functions, also bases evaluation
on a student's level of success in achieving design
objectives.
The University of Maryland has made notable
contributions to the literature on teaching engineering
design, including Dieter's book (1991), which
emphasizes an algorithmic approach to design and
discusses evolution, iteration, trial and error, art, and
intuition in optimization of designs. Dieter also shows
a method for evaluating designs based on the degree
of achieving the functions. Parcover and McCuen
(1995) cite the need for curricular improvements.
They focused on the constructive learning method,

Axiomatic design (introduced and described by N.P. Suh in
1990 and 2001 books) shows that the engineering of good
designs can be taught as a science. There is a simple set of
underlying rules, or design axioms, on which good designs
are based. The design axioms provide the opportunity for teaching design as a science, in that it is based on some simple
underlying principles. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a
systematic approach to teaching how to engineer and critically evaluate good designs has been developed.
Three steps are used in introducing axiomatic design. First
is providing motivation, which is attempted by observing that
design is fundamental to all engineering. The purpose of
traditional engineering analysis, which is emphasized in
engineering studies, is to support design. Second is developing the concept that there are two simple axioms, independence and information, that govern design, just as
Newton's laws govern mechanics. Third is observing that to
apply the axioms designs must be decomposed into a hierarchical structure. This leads to stating that there are three
essential elements to engineering design: the axioms, the
structure, and the process for creating that structure.
A barrier to teaching and using this scientific, axiomatic
approach to design has been the difficulty of creating, modifying, managing, and communicating anything beyond relatively simple design hierarchies. Any design with more than
a few functional requirements was difficult to manage. Recently introduced design software (Acclaro, http://
www.axiomaticdesign.com) has overcome this barrier. It can
easily handle many hundreds of functional requirements and
facilitates the application of the independence axiom. The
impact on the teaching process is that the students learn to
construct large design hierarchies quickly and spend more
time on mastering applications.

Introduction
The objective of tiffs paper is to present a simple,
straightforward approach for teaching engineers the
theory and applications of axiomatic design in less
than a full course. Axiomatic design is especially
worthwhile because the design axioms elevate
engineering design to a science, governed by a few
basic rules, from what has been a kind of an art
integrated with engineering analysis. The importance

practices to independence analysis. He cites the
strength of axiomatic design in promoting a hieratical
representation that facilitates communication,
documentation, and evaluation. He also notes that
high-level restructuring of the design process in
industry is required to implement axiomatic design.
An axiomatic approach to design allows
engineering design to be taught as a science. As in
other sciences, basic underlying principles with broad
applications can be taught. These principles are
applied to solving design problems and are used for
evaluation. This approach has clear and important
advantages over the traditional approaches, which rely
on compliance with sometimes abstract algorithms to
attempt to ensure good results. These approaches
often include intuition, innate creativity, and evaluation
by experience, teaching by one-on-one coaching, and
a process based on time-intensive iterations of trialand-error work. A good design method should be self
consistent and could therefore be used to design the
content as well as the best approach for teaching
engineering design. This current contribution presents
a special approach to teaching axiomatic design, an
approach that has been developed over period of a
decade and a half of graduate studies at Worcester
Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

the content of which is process oriented, focusing
on individual problem solving. They emphasize
experience and iteration with prototypes and testing
for evaluating designs. Zhang (1999) discussed a
product-driven approach to teaching design to
hundreds of first-year students at the University of
Maryland that emphasizes experience, one-on-one
instruction, and is resource intensive.
Decomposition can be a useful approach for a
variety of e n g i n e e r i n g problems. Frindley,
Jorgensen, and Lamancusa (1997) discuss the use
of a kind of lateral decomposition, or product
dissection, divided into three segments: function,
performance, and manufacture. The purpose was to
facilitate the use of benchmarking in the design
process rather than assisting the design process itself.
In that work, it was enabling the application of
benchmarking that provided the motivation for
product dissection or decomposition. Their paper
focuses on development and applications of the
benchmarking process tbr classroom use.
In a landmark book for advancing a scientific
approach to design, Suh (1990) put forth a
proposition that good engineering design is governed
by two axioms" a x i o m o n e - - m a x i m i z i n g
independence (or minimizing coupling), mad axiom
two --minimizing information (or maximizing the
probability of success). This approach is refined and
further illustrated with expanded applications of
axiomatic design in a second book (Suh 2001). In
Sub's axiomatic approach, designs are evaluated
according to their compliance with the axioms, which
inherently incorporates the degree of achieving the
functional requirements. The design structure of
lateral decomposition into design domains and
vertical decomposition into hierarchies defines the
necessary parts of applying the axioms. Suh also
defines the process of creating the hierarchy by zigzagging between the domains at progressively more
detailed levels of the hierarchy, as well as by a process
of physical integration of the components. These are
excellent books (Suh 1990, 2001), although they
may be challenging for any teaching situation other
than a graduate or advanced undergraduate course
dedicated to axiomatic design.
For teaching axiomatic design, Bathurst (2004),
in a paper given at the Third International Conference
on Axiomatic Design and intended for those already
familiar with axiomatic design, emphasizes the
importance of examples and adapting existing design

Methods
The basic premise in designing the class is that
people learn best by doing. Therefore, the basics of
the principal elements of axiomatic design are
covered quickly and in just enough depth so that
they can be used at the beginning of the course.
Thereafter, the principal elements are elaborated,
decomposed, and expanded and used with greater
sophistication.
This teaching method for axiomatic design has
evolved over a decade and a half in the first part of a
graduate course at WPI on the design and analysis
of manufacturing processes. The class meets for
three hours one evening a week and includes 20 to
30 students. About half the people in the class are
working full time as engineers in industry. One
objective of the class is to have some of these fulltime engineers use axiomatic design within a month,
at least qualitatively, and do it because they believe
axiomatic design will help them to do their jobs better.
All the basic elements of axiomatic design and
the process to implement it are presented in the first

lecture so that the students can do an initial simple
design exercise. In the second and third weeks, the
basic elements are covered again, decomposed, and
reinforced and expanded with more detail and
applications. The students are given increasingly more
sophisticated exercises to verify their understanding
of the material. The students then work in groups to
do a larger design project on a manufacturing process
as part of the rest of the course.
The objective of the evaluation of the students' work
in the first month is not to find ways to differentiate
the students according to their abilities, but to verify
that they have a c h i e v e d a m i n i m u m level of
competency and to assist those who have not. The
homework ~ading is done in a way to show students
where they may be lacking basic competencies. Errors
are noted, with appropriate points deducted. Students
are encouraged to redo homework exercises for full
credit to verify their competency.
Class time is used for a combination of lecture
and d i s c u s s i o n , along with p r e s e n t a t i o n s of
homework. The lectures are based on modules,
which are introduced by discussion questions. The
class discusses a question, such as how can you tell
a good design from a bad one. A lecture module
follows the discussion, so that essential points that
are missed will be covered. Examples of the students'
homework efforts are presented and discussed.

have often been left up to intuition and inspiration.
Design courses that are intended to teach something
beyond drafting or analysis tend to try to coach some
kind of process, often abstract, for creative intuition
or inspiration. Many engineers leave engineering
school knowing little more about how to create a new
design than they did in high school. Axiomatic design
lifts engineering design from an iterative, abstract,
intuitive process, which relies on inspiration to achieve
creativity, to a science with clear and simple underlying
principles. Effective use of axiomatic design will
produce better designs in less time than any of the
other earlier educational design methods.

Basic Elements of Axiomatic Design
There are three basic elements that need to be
understood to get started teaching axiomatic design.
They are: design axioms, structures, and processes
(Table 1). The axioms are decomposed into the rules
or grammar that govern design, i.e., the two axioms,
already mentioned above and the corollaries and
theorems (Suh 1990, 2001). The structures are
decomposed laterally (Figure 1) into the design
domains and vertically (Figure 2) into the design
hierarchies (Suh 1990, 2001). The processes consist
of decomposition by zig-zagging between the design
domains (Figure 3) down to the "leaf levels" or "nitt3;gritty," for example, the most detailed or fundamental
level of the design hierarchy and physical integration
or composition of the final design (Suh 1990, 2001).
The lateral decomposition (Figure 1) has been
called the playing field for design, and the axioms,
corollaries, mid theorems have been called the rules.
While the domains are usually presented with the
customer domain (not shown in Figure 1) and the
process domain, the design exercises concentrate on
the r e l a t i o n s h i p s b e t w e e n the F u n c t i o n a l
Requirements (FRs) and the Design Parameters (DPs)
in the functional and physical domains. The process
domain is used as a check to see if a reasonable

Motivation
Motivation in students is essential for effective
teaching. The motivation for learning axiomatic
design is presented along the following arguments.
The basic function of engineers is to design, that is,
to create devices and systems that never existed
before. Nearly every aspect of the industrialized,
modern world is designed. The process by which
things are designed influences everything. The
design process is arguably the single most important
process in the modem world, yet the key components

of interest. The first assignment, using
the software, is to create a design with
at least 15 FRs and three levels in the
hierarchy. Deficiencies that are
c o m m o n l y found initially are
formulating good FRs, understanding
the difference between FRs and
constraints,
and
performing
reasonable decompositions.

Decompositions

At each level of the hierarchy, the
FRs must be collectively exhaustive
and mutually exclusive (CEME).
This means that the r e q u i r e d
functions are covered without overlap between the
FRs. The overlap would result in coupling and violate
the independence axiom. Also, the decompositions
must logically flow from one level to the next. If an
FR at one level, say FR1, is to guard against
mechanical impacts, then it might be decomposed
in one of several logical ways. One way would be
to decompose it into guarding against mechanical
impacts from different directions, so that, for
example, FRI.1 guards against vertical impacts,
FR1.2 is to guard against frontal impacts, and FR1.3
is to guard against lateral i m p a c t s . A n o t h e r
decomposition scheme would be to guard against
impacts of different duration. This could substitute
for the above decomposition or be useful in the
next level of decomposition. In the case of guarding
against shocks from different directions, while three
lower level FRs for guarding against impacts from
three different orthogonal directions appears to be
decoupled, i.e., mutually exclusive, it is not clear if
oblique impacts would be included; therefore, the
exercise would require some checking to be sure
that these l o w e r l e v e l FRs are c o l l e c t i v e l y
exhaustive.
In the initial decompositions, a common mistake
is to decompose an FR into only one other FR. This
results in either an incomplete decomposition, i.e.,
the lower level FR is not collectively exhaustive, or
else it makes the lower level FR redundant, just a redefinition of the higher level FR. In the FR decomposition structure, each parent must have at least two
children, unlike the biological metaphor.
The second homework is to apply axiom one,
the independence axiom, using a design matrix, as

mapping between the domains. Understanding the nature of the mapping is the objective
of engineering analysis and experimentation (Suh 1990. 2001).

manufacturing process and process variables exist.
This helps with c o n c u r r e n t or s i m u l t a n e o u s
engineering. Manufacturing process and tool design
are recast as product design problems aligned with
the appropriate customer FRs and DPs.
Defining the FRs properly is essential for a good
design. The final design cannot be better than the FRs.
Engineers have a tendency to jump immediately to
physical embodiments, DPs, in addressing design
problems. The result, frequently, is that the FRs are not
well defined. Understanding the difference between FRs
and Constraints (C's) is also essential. Guidelines for
these requirements are shown in Table 2.
The objective of the first homework exercise is to
verify the students' ability to create the vertical
d e c o m p o s i t i o n in the functional and physical
domains, as shown in Figure 2. (The design matrix
is discussed below.) This requires following the
process shown in Figure 3. In the zig-zagging
process, the DPs at one level supply a context, if not
a constraint, on the FRs and DPs at the lower levels.

exercise to a level where significant designs can be
considered. Without the software, it is cumbersome
to impossible to represent designs with a significant
number of FRs. About 15 FRs and three levels of the
hierarchy are about the m a x i m u m that can be
manipulated reasonably without software. Especially
important is the ability to hide levels of the hierarchy
so that the designer can focus on ouly the current level

shown in Figure 2, and to indicate with X's and O's
where the coupling is. The most desirable result is
a diagonal matrix, where each FR has its own DP
and each DP influences only one.? FR. If this is not
possible, then a triangular matrix is workable. Either in class or as homework, the problems in 3.10
at the end of chapter 3 in Principles of Design (Suh
1990) are worked out. This exercise shows that
design interactions can be represented compactly
and manipulated symbolically, according to simple
rules, just as there are mathematical representations
in the areas of mechanics, thermodynamics, or electrical circuits.

information. Without some historical and disciplinary perspective, it may not be fully appreciated why

as the log of the reciprocal of the probabilities of

about 15 F R - D P pairs, which are sometimes combined with D P - P V pairs. With the Acclaro software,
designs with more than 100 F R - D P pairs with several levels have been developed.
It should be noted that while the F R - D P - P V combination is useful for all kinds of product design,
when it is used for conventional, c o n s u m e r - t y p e
products, it is not necessarily suited for the corresponding process design. The PVs are essential for
the concurrent, or simultaneous, engineering aspects
of the product design. In a course on process design, the design of the process is a separate design
problem. In designing manufacturing processes, the
process should be viewed as a product, so it makes
sense to define a new set of FRs with the product
being the manufacturing process. This allows the
inclusion of FRs such as throughput rate, which is
not often a reasonable or appropriate consideration
in the design of the product being processed.

minimize a summing function that goes to zero, as
the information content does, than to maximize the
probability of a multiplicative function. The information content is discussed in the context of manufacturing tolerances, so that the probability of success
is the ratio of the c o m m o n range (the manufactured
parts complying with the design tolerance) to the
system range (the total manufactured parts). It is
shown how the information content can accommodate manufacturing capabilities similar to the Cj,kparameter and, in addition, include the inlbrmation
associated with a missed delivery.

Design Exercises and Term Projects
S u b s e q u e n t h o m e w o r k assignments are design
exercises and can contribute to the components of a
term project. The design projects are student selected
within g e n e r o u s b o u n d s for m a n u f a c t u r i n g processes. Without the software, these were limited to

191.

<-----Page 6----->Journal of Mam(facturing Systems

It is possible that a process will supply special
tooling. This can create another design layer. The
processing needs can generate FRs for the tool design, which then has tooling DPs and PVs. Historically, m a n y new products have r e q u i r e d new
processes and tooling. Before Watts could make the
cylinders for a steam engine, WiIkinson need to make
his boring machine. The design of tooling and machines for manufacturing is considered to be appropriate for the course.
Practical problems are often brought to class by
the practicing engineers. Recent projects have included:

elements of the design matrix that were represented
by X's and O's in the second exercise. These matrix
elements can be formulae, tables, ntles, or graphs
that explain the relation between the FRs and DPs.

Results and Discussion
The results of this approach have been overwhelmingly positive. Ever 3, time this approach has been
used, for more than 10 years, students have reported
using ,axiomatic design to some extent at work within
the first month. A survey was done of former students who could be contacted by e-mail. Comments
from former students who responded are in the Appendix. All who responded appear to be using axiomatic design qualitatively, primarily the axioms and
secondarily the structure. In one instance a former
student stressed its value in communication.
In one spectacularly successful case, a student
applied axiomatic design to a redesign of the production system he was responsible for, and it resulted
in savings of $2.4 million before the course finished.
The student was subsequently promoted, from tool
designer to manager of manufacturing engineering
to VP for engineering.
The introduction of Acclaro software has facilitated the teaching of axiomatic design, resulting in
significantly more sophisticated designs and deeper
understanding of the decomposition process and
hieratical structure. There is currently potential to
sell software to former students' companies.
Teamwork is facilitated by the structure required in
axiomatic design. This has been observed in two ways.
Conununication for mutual understanding is essential for good teamwork and is enhanced by practicing
axiomatic design, through the use of evaluation rules
mad the imposition of a structure on the design. Teamwork is also facilitated by the decoupled decomposition, in that different members of the team can more
easily and clearly divide the tasks and work on them
more independently when they are decoupled.
Using axiomatic design requires greater investment in the higher levels of the design than is the
practice historically. Engineers are often uncomfortable with investing so much time in design work,
without producing drawings. Managers need to realize the value of design effort at the higher levels.
For example, definitions need to be formulated to
facilitate exclusivity and decomposition. The goals
of the design need to be clearly and succinctly stated.

1. The design of a new fabrication shop with a
floor layout and machine placement that would
maximize value added and reduce waste for a
variety of small and large projects.
2. A multi-chamber ball mill with progressively
smaller balls, which decouples the optimal grinding configuration functional requirements from
the input feed-size design parameter. This hmovation also allows for a varying number of chambers based on grinding needs, which leads to a
more efficient process. An enclosed continuous
flow system using a vacuum extraction method
reduces possible operator error by limiting the
required information needed for a successful
product. The enclosed system also helps to minimize waste due to a reduction in contamination,
further reducing the required information.
3. An injection molding-assembly system, included modification to an existing process with
low yield, to break up the manufacturing line
into separate, modular cells. Each of these cells
will produce components that would feed intermediate inventory. A final assembly line
would use these three components as inputs and
perform only the final assembly of the container. This modified system would not only
decouple these workcells but would result in a
significant reduction in complexity. Information content would be reduced from 17-=0.9435
to I , ~ = 0.3150, a reduction of 67%.
4. A new assembly system for HVAC sheet metal
components fabricated from one stamping cycle
and one forming cycle, reducing the tooling and
maintenance and increasing the production rate.
In a portion of the term project, students seek references from the archival literature to understand the

192

Often it is clear from the homework efforts that there
is confusion between designing the product and creating the design process for designing the product.
Both exercises can have value, but they should be
distinct. Also, there is sometimes confusion between
designing the process and designing the tools to accomplish the process. These kinds of confusions may
only be apparent when a clear, systematic, and scientifically rigorous design approach is used.
The design axioms, like Newton's laws, cannot be
proven. Their legitimacy is derived from the fact that
they have never been observed to be violated, at least
within some domains of applicability. Students are
challenged to find exceptions to the axioms. Over the
years, all the challenges to the axioms have been resolved to the satisfaction of everyone in the class
through a caxeful consideration of the principles of
axiomatic design. In most cases, there is a misunderstanding of a definition or a poor statement of the
functional requirements. Of course, these resolutions
of alleged violations of the axioms are taking place in
a classroom under the guidance of a professor, who
the students know has yet to record their grades.
For teaching large design courses, such as have
been reported in the literature, it is possible that the
scientific, axiomatic approach to design will reduce
some of the resource demands. It should be possible
to formulate more general, universal instructions to
lead students through the design process, eliminating the need for some individual coaching. In addition, axiomatic design provides clear and simple rules
for evaluating the results of students' work, eliminating the need to get experienced designers to legitimatize the evaluations.

3. The use of specially designed software facilitates the process of teaching the decomposition of FR and DP hierarchies in axiomatic
design. The Acclaro software allowed the class
to do more designs, and more complex designs,
advancing the facility for practical applications.

Conclusions
l. Many of the difficulties with teaching traditional
design are avoided with axiomatic design. The
presumption is that basing design on the axiomatic approach provides clear underlying
principles on which to base design practice.
2. As presented in this implementation of teaching
axiomatic design, practicing engineers are able
to use axiomatic design on the job after four 3hour classes. Based on experience in an evening
graduate engineering class, some practicing engineers generally report that the3; start to use
axiomatic design at work within the first month.

Vermont. He spent the next four years at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne teaching labs in mechanical metallurgy and
doing research. For two years he then was a senior research engineer
at Atlas Copco's European Research Center before going to Worcester
Polytechnic Institute in 1989. At WPI, he teaches courses on surface
metrology, design and analysis of manufacturing processes, and the
technology of alpine skiing. Brown is the founder and director of
WPI's Haas Technical Education Center for CNC machining and V~rl?I's
Surface Metrology Lab. He has a patent on and develops software for
using fractal geometry to analyze surface textures. He is a fellow of
ASME, a past member of the SME board of directors, and an associate member of CIRP. He also consults on and teaches axiomatic design for industry and academia.

Appendix
"Axiomatic design takes you from argument to analysis
when evaluating designs . . . . used at preliminary stages of
concept selection/evaluation and high-level system design to identify fundamental high-level coupling. Always,
it comes down to seeing coupling and getting rid of it. I've
done it at the system level, at the sub-system level, and the
component level. Each has resulted in a better design. One
change in particular has resulted in improved dimensional
stability of our latest torch design. The simple change (let
the insulator insulate and not position/align) has fundamentally changed the performance of the torch. The locating
features do not change dimensionally over the life of the
torch. We have the data to prove it. Another was 'let the
water tube carD" the water and not align itself.' (We added an
alignment feature to align and another to position a~ally.)
One feature, one function. We use structured designs of experiments (one form is Taguchi - robustness) to verify the
stiffness of important interactions, and we use the experiments to choose an O or X if there is disagreement about
whether there is an interaction at all (O or X ) . We first use
our tribal knowledge and analysis to decide if it's an O or X.
We revert to experimentation when we can't choose AND we
think a strong interaction could be troublesome."

"We use axiomatic design for creating FRs and DPs to
ensure the incorporation of all necessary elements of a design and to stm't narrowing down possible solutions. [We]
created FR and DP lists with constraints. Used for being sure
all req's[requirements] are accounted for and to help narrow
down [choices] from many possibilities of designs. [We] used
axiomatic design also to show robustness of a particular
solution after the narrowing-down of solutions is complete.
We have used [a~omatic design] only for new designs and
concept generation. We have not used it much for rework, or
design improvement, or other possible applications.

-Michael Rufo, Project Engineer, Foster Miller hw.
"Two examples [from my previous job] come to mind.
The first was a design of a process line for a low production
sensor system used on a US Navy Submarine .... by considering a "decoupling of operations" approach, we were able to
optimize the man usage and layout of the sensors for concurrent assemblies (up to 3 at a time, as opposed to the original plan from start to finish). This also allowed us to speed
up our overall time from 8 weeks to 4.5 weeks (which we
held or beat consistently from the first unit on). The tools all
worked for their specific purpose, and although at first it was
a hard sell to go from the original 5 "specialized hand tools'
up to -12, once the workers had the "right tool for the job"
it went quickly, painlessly, and easily made back the additional money spent on the tooling . . . . we developed a conceptual tool design that met all the requirements individually
(again, decoupled) . . . . This tool saved 1 full week of our
schedule in itself. And due to the simplicity of the design,
...the cost of the part stayed low, the maintenance is easy
and inexpensive, and it performed flawlessly....'"

"The axioms have had a profound effect on my ability to
design effective code and in problem solving."

"This changes the way I think about everything."

-Owner, president, mamtger of a fabrication shop
"I have found that I have used the overal] structure of Ax
[axiomatic design] mostly to outline what the problem is
and what the main components for the design are going to
need to be. I also used it for brainstorming possible solutions to problems. One example is the development of a new
method to articulate an endoscope for my previous employer
(Optim, Inc, Sturbridge, MA). By reviewing what the doctors needed (CAs) along with what the doctors complain
about when using endoscopes, I was able to identify" the
functional aspects of a new design. From this, I was then
able to brainstorm physical designs that would meet those
requirements. Without getting into great detail, the new design will allow doctors to easily articulate an endoscope in
4-axis environment, with tactile feedback, using only one
hand, which will then allow doctors to operate other tools to
do biopsies or other procedures through the endoscope. The
new design was purely mechanical to eliminate the complexity of motorized systems. The previous method for operating an endoscope [required the use of] both hands and
an assistant and was nonintuitive. The new design has resuited in my first patent. The strong point [of the course] was
doing our own test exanaple and seeing other students' work."

"I have used the concepts to talk to strategic suppliers
overseas and domestic to alert them to what is important in
the design process and to make sure they can stream-line
their internal design process and give careful thought during their NPI stage, to pass on the cost savings to us. The
group projects presentation enabled me to hear from other
professionals and students their point of view when designing a new product."

-Po Tse
"I use axiomatic design...primarily in developing processes in electro-mechanical assembly. Most recently to decompose and existing process to diagnose the ' W H Y ' of the
root cause of a problem. The stren~h is the simplicity of the
concepts; the weakness is the language used to communicate them, particularly axiom 2, referred to as the "information content" and using a logarithm calculation. It may be
technically the best; however, if one of the functional requirements is communicating the results to nontechnical

people (management), then the term "information content"
and the log calculation are not the best DP."

A strong point [of the course] was that it showed us a
new and simple manner to begin the design process. A weak
point could be that you have to stay with it to fully use its
potential. If you miss a couple of steps when designing and
get lazy, then it doesn't help you in the end because you
could miss those small aspects. If you do keep up with it
though, you're sure not to leave out any necessary design
parameters."

Students f r o m first course to use Acclaro:
"I typically use the elements of the design concept when
designing machines and fixtures. I may not take the time to
write out the list or use Acclaro, but I have the process in the
back of my mind and try" to keep components and key elements decoupled as often as possible.
My first big project was a degating system to separate
two pieces post-shot that were connected by a runner. I
knew that I needed to move the pieces into position, cut
them, contain the pieces after cutting, and then bring the
pieces back to the operator. So, I designed a nest to hold
the pieces that were on a slide (all it did was slide the nest,
so, no coupling there), a piston to bring the cutter into
position, a slide on the end of the piston to adjust for width
variations, and the cutters. So, I broke down what needed
to be done at each step, and designed stand-alone (or semiindependent) components for each step.

-Timothy Baird, Project Engineer
"Its teachings definitely affect my thinking, planning and
engineering. Being self employed, my engineering time must
be optimized to the maximum, and I really don't have time
to write down nay customer restraints, functional requirements, and design parameters (must have learned something
there), but I live by the rules. It's like a Zen rule of life."
