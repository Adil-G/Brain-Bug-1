Research on personality aspects of entrepreneurship, recently summarized in ﬁve meta-analyses, has
intensiﬁed during the past two decades. Internationally, entrepreneurship has been recognized as highly
important for socio-economic prosperity. After discussing a few basic concepts relating task and context
of entrepreneurship to personality characteristics the main results of the meta-analyses are reported. In
the system of the Big Five, personality traits make a difference when entrepreneurs are compared with
managers (C+, O+, E+, N, A). They are also relevant in predicting entrepreneurial intention (C+, O+,
N, E+) and entrepreneurs’ performance (C+, O+, E+, N). For other more speciﬁc scales that have frequently enough been used and could therefore be included in meta-analyses (e.g., readiness for innovation, proactive personality, generalized self-efﬁcacy, stress tolerance, need for autonomy, locus of control)
have also been reported signiﬁcant correlations with business creation and business success. Risk propensity supports business foundation, but not necessarily business success. Achievement motivation is
favourable both for business foundation and business success. The effect sizes are mostly small, some
moderate. Complementing the results of the meta-analyses, some recent single studies on mediator or
moderator effects are brieﬂy reviewed.

1. Introduction
During the past two decades entrepreneurship has become a
very active ﬁeld of research in various social science disciplines
and a prominent concern of economic policy. Adaptation of economic systems to changing conditions, innovation of products
and services, creation of jobs, and economic growth is assumed
to be very much dependent on the readiness and willingness of
people to start an independent privately owned business and on
the founders’ skills and efforts to run it successfully (cf. Böheim,
Stiglbauer, & Winter-Ebmer, 2009; Erken, Donselaar, & Thurik,
2008; Van Praag & Versloot, 2007). This is particularly true in the
ﬁeld of new technology where entrepreneurial activities demand
a high level of knowledge in applying research and development
(R & D) and high creativity in taking advantage of market niches.
Decades after Schumpeter (1912/1988) convincingly pointed to
the importance of the entrepreneur for economic development,
looking for personality traits uniquely characteristic of entrepreneurs was occasionally the topic of research, albeit one with rather
modest success. Consequently, in the 1970s and 1980s the personality approach to studying entrepreneurial behaviour was discredited (e.g., Gartner, 1989). However, it gained new momentum in
the 1990s, which according to Zhao and Seibert (2006) probably reﬂected the increasing acceptance of the unifying ﬁve-factor model

(FFM) of personality and meta-analysis as technique for aggregating and generalizing the results of many single studies. Concurrently, the interest in, and appreciation of, the psychological subdiscipline of personality research has very much changed for the
better.
Most of the studies published during the past two decades have
already been reviewed in previous meta-analyses (Rauch & Frese,
2007; Stewart & Roth, 2001; Zhao & Seibert, 2006; Zhao, Seibert,
& Lumpkin, 2010, on personality including risk propensity; Collins,
Hanges, & Locke, 2004; Stewart & Roth, 2007, on achievement
motivation). Thus, the present paper focuses on these meta-analyses in a form of intuitive meta-synthesis (Sipe & Curlette, 1997) as
an attempt to integrate their results in the light of the FFM as reference system for personality traits. Single studies will be reviewed
only when their design or their results are of special interest – this
will be because they reveal mediator and/or moderator effects in
the inﬂuence of personality traits on entrepreneurial behaviour
that are not frequently enough encountered and are, therefore,
not reported as average effects in meta-analyses.
Meta-analyses are commonly designed not to test hypotheses
but to explore a ﬁeld of research for congruence or heterogeneity
of the results of many single studies reported in the literature.
Therefore, it seems neither necessary nor reasonable to explicate
in advance theoretical expectations about the effects of personality
traits on entrepreneurial behaviour. Theoretical implications and
interpretations of the results of the meta-analyses will be discussed later.

That personality has some inﬂuence at all should be evident
from basic characteristics of the entrepreneurial role: initiating a
life of self-determination and independence (Emotional Stability),
ﬁnding new opportunities and ways of structuring and developing
the enterprise (Openness to experience), hard working and persistent in goal striving (achievement motivation component of Conscientiousness), establishing a social network (Extraversion), and
taking the risk of failure (risk propensity, possibly a combination
of Emotional Stability, Openness, and Extraversion).
After clarifying deﬁnitions of entrepreneurship and personality
traits each of ﬁve meta-analyses are reported with their main results, summarized, integrated, and complemented by exemplary
studies of mediating and moderating effects. This should contribute to a base of knowledge from which future research can start
thinking about unresolved problems, necessary changes in research strategies, and promising theoretical and methodological
approaches.
2. Some preliminary reﬂections

decisions and entrepreneurial success. Obviously, a purely descriptive notion of traits would be of limited usefulness in personality
research.
Going beyond description, one may conceptualize personality
traits as complex, genetically co-determined psycho-physiological
structures (for genetic inﬂuences on entrepreneurial activity, see
Nicolaou & Shane, 2009) which originate and regulate the individual ways of experience and action. In this sense, adopted by the
author of the present paper, traits are viewed as causes of mental
and behavioural processes (John, Naumann, & Soto, 2008). Experimental research on individual differences and ﬁeld studies, including measures of experiential (cognitive and affective) or psychophysiological process measures, would have to rely on this theoretically richer notion of personality traits. Of course, the measures of
the traits are usually based on descriptions of how people think,
feel, and act in a variety of situations, but these reports are conceived of as indicators of real internal causes (interacting with
the external causes) of a person’s experiences and actions. Thus,
the intention of establishing a private business is not part of the
deﬁnition of the trait Openness, but an effect of this trait.

2.1. Deﬁnitions
2.2. Five-factor model of personality traits
2.1.1. The concept of entrepreneurship
Eckhardt and Shane (2003, p. 336) deﬁne entrepreneurship ‘‘. . .
as the discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of future goods and
services . . . [by] . . . creation or identiﬁcation of new ends and
means previously undetected or unutilized by market participants”. In this perspective, entrepreneurship could be an attribute
of managers as well as of business founders, and founding a small
private enterprise may not be an entrepreneurial activity per se,
but only if it is clearly characterized by novelty and creativity. Because such a deﬁnition of entrepreneurship, though particularly
relevant in the ﬁeld of new technologies, would exclude quite a
number of studies reviewed by extant meta-analyses, and because
it would blur the distinction between managers and entrepreneurs,
it is not adopted for the present review. The meta-analyses reported here deal with personality aspects of (a) founding a small
privately owned business and/or (b) running it successfully as
owner in the early stages of the enterprise.
2.1.2. The concept of personality traits
The concepts of personality and personality traits both in psychological research and in common sense understanding are rather
fuzzy. In a broad sense, personality traits include abilities (e.g.,
general intelligence as well as numerical, verbal, spatial, or emotional intelligence), motives (e.g., need for achievement, power,
or afﬁliation), attitudes (including values), and characteristics of
temperament as overarching style of a person’s experiences and
actions (Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, called the Big Five with the acronym OCEAN).
Personality traits may be conceived of as descriptions of a person’s mean level of her/his states (of Agreeableness, Openness, etc.)
varying across circumstances and events, partly haphazardly
encountered, partly deliberately chosen or provoked by the person
(Fleeson, 2001). Correlating personality measures with entrepreneurial behaviour (foundation decision) and behaviour results
(success of the enterprise) should be straightforward. The rather
simple question would be whether people who describe themselves, for instance, as open to new experience will more often
establish a private business than people low on Openness. Or we
might expect that people high on Conscientiousness will be more
successful with their recently founded small business than people
low on Conscientiousness. Nothing is said about the mental and
behavioural processes by which these traits inﬂuence start-up

Since the 1980s, the FFM is the predominant reference system
of personality traits (Costa & McCrae, 1992; Digman, 1990; Goldberg, 1990; John et al., 2008). Increasingly, research on personality
of entrepreneurs, too, is based on FFM. Nevertheless, not all personality aspects can be located in the Big Five system, as shown
by, for instance, Paunonen and Jackson (2000) and Ashton et al.
(2004).

2.2.1. FFM and other personality traits
Some of the rather global personality constructs outside of FFM
are rooted in speciﬁc theories (e.g., locus of control, self-efﬁcacy,
state vs. action orientation, regulatory focus) and have been applied now and then in entrepreneurial research where also speciﬁc
purpose scales like entrepreneurial orientation (Rauch, Wiklund,
Lumpkin, & Frese, 2009), proactive personality (Crant, 1996; Fuller
& Marler, 2009), or entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy (Cassar & Friedman, 2009; Townsend, Busenitz, & Arthurs, 2010) are found. More
often measures of need for achievement, internal locus of control,
risk-taking propensity, and personal initiative (see for example
Korunka, Frank, Lueger, & Mugler, 2003) have been used. Some of
these personality constructs proved to be weighted composites of
the Big Five (cf. Brandstätter, 2009; Crant, 1996; Zibarras, Port, &
Woods, 2008).

2.2.2. FFM and motivational constructs
Although ‘dynamic traits’ (Cattell, 1965) are different from personality traits in the narrow sense, there are relationships between
the two kinds of traits worthy of consideration. Bipp, Steinmayr,
and Spinath (2008) show, for instance, that various aspects of
achievement motivation as revealed in the prevalence of learning
goals, performance approach goals, performance avoidance goals,
and work avoidance goals correlate with the facets and global
scales of the Big Five just as one would expect. Particularly high
are the correlations between Openness and learning goals
(r = .40), Neuroticism and performance avoidance goals (r = .45),
and Conscientiousness and work avoidance goals (r = .30). Another example of the relationship between Big Five and measures
of achievement motivation is given by Heggestad and Kanfer
(2000). Thus, it seems justiﬁed to deal with the Big Five and motives in the same vein, although they are kept apart in most empirical studies and in meta-analyses.

3. Meta-analysis results of entrepreneurship research on
personality (1990–2010)
3.1. Risk propensity of entrepreneurs and managers (Stewart & Roth,
2001)
The ﬁrst in the series of meta-analyses on entrepreneurs’ personality traits performed during the last 10 years is that of Stewart
and Roth (2001), which included 12 studies (six using the risk scale
of the Jackson Personality Inventory, four the Choice Dilemmas
Questionnaire, two some other scales). They compared risk propensity between entrepreneurs and managers. Contrasting entrepreneurs with managers makes sense if other conditions such as
gender, education level, professional experience, type of industry,
and number of employees reporting to the entrepreneur or manager, respectively, are at least roughly kept equal. It is assumed
(a) that jobs characterized by speciﬁc demands and opportunities
attract people characterized by speciﬁc talents, motives, and personality traits; (b) that starting a professional career is co-determined by others’ (employers’ or venture capitalists’) judgements
about the aptitudes and motives (goals) of an applicant or aspiring
entrepreneur; (c) that those stay in the occupational group whose
performance positively impresses their employers or – in the case
of entrepreneurs – the business partners, and those who ﬁnd
their professional situation more rewarding than alternative positions (cf. the attraction – selection – attrition model of Schneider,
1987).
Based on 14 independent samples of 12 studies with about
3000 participants, the effect size of risk propensity (corrected for
reliability) amounts to d0 = .36 (entrepreneurs’ minus managers’
mean risk propensity scores divided by pooled standard deviations). The authors looked at possible differences in effect sizes
(a) between types of measurement (Kogan–Wallach Choice Dilemma Questionnaire and the Risk-Taking Scale of the Jackson Personality Inventory [JPI]; see Mandrik, 2005, for problems with risk
measures) and (b) between ‘growth-oriented entrepreneurs’ and
‘income-oriented entrepreneurs’. The effect sizes were higher for
JPI-risk-taking scale and for growth oriented entrepreneurs.
By including 13 additional studies in a complementary metaanalysis on differences in risk propensity between entrepreneurs
and managers, Miner and Raju (2004) arrived at lower effect sizes.
However, responding to this critique, Stewart and Roth (2004) convincingly pointed to problematic criteria by which Miner and Raju
categorized participants as entrepreneurs or managers, respectively. Moreover, according to Stewart and Roth (2004) the Miner
Sentence Completion Scale-Form T (risk avoidance subscale), used
in all studies included in the meta-analysis of Miner and Raju
(2004), seems to measure risk perception rather than risk propensity and that there are indications of a substantial negative correlation between these two constructs: people underestimating the
riskiness of decisions tend to risky actions. Stewart and Roth
(2004), supplementing their original meta-analysis (Stewart &
Roth, 2001) with ﬁve studies of Miner and Raju (2004) – these
authors criticized Stewart and Roth (2001) for overestimating the
effects of risk propensity – that met their original selection criteria,
provided evidence for differences in effect sizes between ’objective’
measures of risk propensity (mean d = .31) and ‘projective’ measures of risk perception (mean d = .35).

3.2. Entrepreneurs’ vs. managers’ Big Five (Zhao & Seibert, 2006)
These authors use the Big Five as reference system for their
meta-analysis. They subsume a personality scale under one of
the Big Five according to empirical evidence found in the literature.
A study was selected for the meta-analysis under the condition

3

that the trait correlated primarily and substantially with only
one of the Big Five. Contrasting entrepreneurs with managers
should most clearly make visible those characteristics of entrepreneurs that promote independent strategic decision making under
risk and strong competition. They are assumed to be crucial for
the survival and growth of the private enterprise as well as for
the family income. About the deﬁnition of entrepreneurs and managers Zhao and Seibert (2006, pp. 262/263) say:
‘‘We . . . deﬁned an entrepreneur as someone who is the founder, owner, and manager of a small business and whose principal purpose is growth . . . We take a relatively broad deﬁnitional
approach and include managers of all ranks and functions”.
For cross-cultural comparisons, the countries were classiﬁed as
low or high in uncertainty avoidance and low or high in performance orientation according to the data provided by the project
GLOBE (House, Hanges, Javidan, Dorfman, & Gupta, 2004). After
thorough and careful screening of the English language literature
23 independent studies (out of a preliminary number of 47 studies
from a variety of countries) met the selection criteria for metaanalysis.
Based on an intuitive understanding of the Big Five personality
traits and of the personality implications of entrepreneurial tasks,
complemented by some references to empirical studies, Zhao and
Seibert (2006) assumed that entrepreneurs would have higher
scores on Conscientiousness, Openness to Experience, and Extraversion, but lower scores on Agreeableness and Neuroticism.
The averages of effect sizes (entrepreneurs minus managers) d0 ,
corrected for reliabilities of the measures, are .37 (Neuroticism),
.22 (Extraversion; not signiﬁcant), .36 (Openness), .16 (Agreeableness), and .45 (Conscientiousness), just as expected. The effect
sizes for two components of Conscientiousness, identiﬁed by expert judgements, are .59 (achievement motivation) and .01
(dependability).
As moderators of the effects of Neuroticism and achievement
motivation in distinguishing entrepreneurs from managers, the
two culture dimensions, that is, uncertainty avoidance (‘‘the extent
to which a society relies on norms, rules, and procedures to alleviate the stress associated with unpredictability in future events”)
and performance orientation (‘‘the degree to which a society
encourages and rewards performance improvement and high standards of excellence”) were taken into account (p. 262).
It was expected that national cultures characterized by high
uncertainty avoidance would show larger differences in Neuroticism between entrepreneurs and managers (the latter with higher
scores). An argument is that people would manifest more easily
behaviour that is congruent with culture. However, this would
imply that we ﬁnd more often neurotic behaviour in societies characterized by uncertainty avoidance. How that should lead to a larger difference in Neuroticism between entrepreneurs and
managers in societies of high uncertainty avoidance is not quite
clear.
A plausible assumption could be that the percentage of people
courageous enough to start their own business venture would be
lower in societies characterized by high uncertainty avoidance
(than in low uncertainty avoidance countries), but there are no
data for testing this hypothesis. The OECD report on entrepreneurship (OECD, 2009) could provide the necessary information. However, even if there were such culture dependent differences, they
would not imply larger effect sizes of Neuroticism in comparing
entrepreneurs with managers.
In favour of the moderator hypothesis, however, one could argue (not argued by the authors in this way) that in a climate of high
uncertainty avoidance only persons with particularly high Emotional Stability (Neuroticism reversed) would become entrepreneurs whereas for managers a higher level of Neuroticism would

Please cite this article in press as: Brandstätter, H. Personality aspects of entrepreneurship: A look at ﬁve meta-analyses. Personality and Individual Differences (2010), doi:10.1016/j.paid.2010.07.007

<-----Page 3----->4

H. Brandstätter / Personality and Individual Differences xxx (2010) xxx–xxx

be a minor hindrance in performing their roles. From this perspective the moderator hypothesis may look plausible.
In respect of performance orientation as cultural dimension one
could say (not said by Zhao and Seibert (2006)) that entrepreneurs
are more susceptible to the cultural inﬂuence of high performance
orientation than managers. This could enlarge the positive difference in achievement motivation between entrepreneurs and managers (particularly high achievement motivation of entrepreneurs
in societies characterized by high performance orientation). Actually, the authors report effect size differences in the predicted
direction, more so for uncertainty avoidance than for performance
orientation, but the conﬁdence intervals overlap which means that
the differences are not signiﬁcant (p > .05).
In addition to the two culture dimensions, the authors looked at
the type of personality measures (questionnaire vs. projective
techniques) of achievement motivation and dependability (the
two facets of Conscientiousness) as possible moderator of the personality effects. For achievement motivation both types of measures resulted in moderate effect sizes (d0 = .54 for projective and
d0 = .61 for questionnaire measures). A moderator effect was found
for dependability: the projective measure gives a signiﬁcant effect
of d0 = .22 whereas the questionnaire measure came up with an
insigniﬁcant negative effect. The two conﬁdence intervals do not
overlap suggesting that the moderator effect is signiﬁcant
(p < .05). As one can see again, speciﬁc personality constructs
may have some merits beyond those of the global personality
constructs.
3.3. Speciﬁc personality traits predict business creation and success
(Rauch & Frese, 2007)
The meta-analysis of Rauch and Frese (2007) comprises 116
independent samples from 104 articles. It differs from Zhao and
Seibert (2006) by (a) using not only entrepreneurial status (entrepreneurs vs. managers), but also business success as criteria in estimating the validity of selected personality scales; (b) using Pearson
correlation coefﬁcients r as effects sizes; and (c) accepting the 51
different labels of the personality constructs used by the authors
of the single studies without an attempt to locate them in the
Big Five system. Thus, scales based on FFM are mixed with scales
rooted in speciﬁc theories (like self-efﬁcacy, delay of gratiﬁcation,
goal orientation, proactive personality) or scales characterizing
experience and behaviour in speciﬁc classes of situations (like
stress tolerance, innovativeness, passion for work).
Assuming that traits judged as particularly relevant for entrepreneurs would come up with larger effects, 10 experts rated the
importance of the traits for entrepreneurs on a ﬁve-point scale
(very unimportant to very important). Such a scale, however,
seems to be problematic with traits that have negative connotations like rigidity, dogmatism, or shyness and traits that are perceived as dysfunctional for entrepreneurs like conservatism or
norm orientation. The rating category ‘very unimportant’, applied
to negative traits, would imply rather high negative correlations
with business creation and business success, but these traits were
categorized as non-matching (Table 2 of Rauch & Frese, 2007).
Business creation was coded as dummy variable (1 = entrepreneur, 0 = managers or some other comparison groups). Business
success was measured partly by key informant ratings of success
and satisfaction, partly by ﬁnancial outcomes and ﬁrm growth.
The effect sizes were commonly higher with ratings, possibly as
a result of common method.
As average of N-weighted r coefﬁcients across all personality
scales and studies, corrected for reliability of predictors and success criteria, is reported: r = .19 for business creation and r = .20
for business success. It was expected and found that traits judged
as important or very important correlated on average signiﬁcantly

higher (p < .01) with business creation and business success (r = .25
and r = .25) than traits rated as unimportant (r = .13 and r = .03).
The difference between important and unimportant traits could
be, at least in part, a consequence of the above mentioned scaling
problem.
In subsets of studies the effect sizes (for business creation and
business success) of those eight traits were analyzed that both
were judged as important and were frequently enough studied that
it was justiﬁed to compute average effect sizes. These are: need for
achievement (.22, .30), innovativeness (.24, .27), proactive personality (.27, available for success only), generalized self-efﬁcacy (.38,
.25), stress tolerance (.10, .20), need for autonomy (.31, .16), locus
of control (.19, .13), and risk-taking (.10, .10).
Most (i.e., 16 out of 19) of the studies analyzed by Zhao and Seibert (2006) were also part of the studies analyzed by Rauch and
Frese (2007). Zhao and Seibert (2006) had applied a stricter selection criterion for contrasting entrepreneurs with managers than
Rauch and Frese (2007). Because the studies of Zhao and Seibert
(2006) overlap with those of Rauch and Frese (2007) it is not surprising that these meta-analyses arrive at similar conclusions. Together the two meta-analyses suggest that founding a business and
running it successfully is supported by the same personality traits.
3.4. Entrepreneurial intention and performance – Big Five (Zhao et al.,
2010)
The most recent meta-analysis complements that of Zhao and
Seibert (2006) by focussing (a) on the intention to found a business, and (b) on entrepreneurial ﬁrm performance, again with
FFM as reference system, supplemented by risk propensity as personality trait that cannot be equated with only one of the Big Five.
There is no overlap of studies between Zhao and Seibert (2006) and
Zhao et al. (2010), whereas many of the studies in Rauch and Frese
(2007) are not only found in Zhao and Seibert (2006) but also in
Zhao et al. (2010). A study focussing on a speciﬁc personality scale
was selected by Zhao et al. (2010) for their meta-analysis only if
there were empirically established links between this scale and
predominantly one of the Big Five.
Entrepreneur is again deﬁned as the founder, who also owns
and manages his small business. The authors distinguish proﬁtability/operational effectiveness and ﬁrm growth as the two global categories of performance measures with two subcategories of the
ﬁrst one: (1) proﬁtability (ﬁnancial indicators such as sales revenue, proﬁt, liquidity, return on investment, and return on assets)
and (2) operational effectiveness (ﬁrm size [number of employees],
productivity [output per man hour], ﬁrm survival, and subjective
ratings of overall performance). Obviously, these two types of success criteria are quite heterogeneous. They were subsumed under
the global category proﬁtability/operational effectiveness for the
meta-analysis in order to arrive at a sufﬁcient number of studies
for testing moderator effects. The second global category is ﬁrm
growth (i.e., relative change in proﬁtability and operational effectiveness over time). Proﬁtability/operational effectiveness combined with relative change form the overarching category
‘performance’.
By relating intuitively the content of personality constructs to
the entrepreneurial tasks, and taking into account what other
authors thought about the roles of entrepreneurs and the relevance
of personality traits, it was predicted that the meta-analysis would
come up with positive effects of Conscientiousness, Openness to
Experience, Emotional Stability (Neuroticism reversed), and Extraversion on both intention and performance, whereas Agreeableness was expected to have negative effects on intention and
performance. Risk propensity should have positive effects on
intention and negative effects on performance. The meta-analysis
conﬁrmed all hypotheses that actually cannot be understood in

<-----Page 4----->H. Brandstätter / Personality and Individual Differences xxx (2010) xxx–xxx

the strict sense of a priori theoretical reﬂections, because they
seem to be based, at least in part, on knowledge of previous research much of which was the object of the meta-analysis.
Risk propensity is the only personality trait where the correlations with intentions and performance were signiﬁcantly different.
It is a good predictor of intentions, but irrelevant for performance.
3.5. Achievement motivation of entrepreneurs (Stewart & Roth, 2007)
There are two meta-analyses on achievement motivation (Collins et al., 2004; Stewart & Roth, 2007). Because the second
meta-analysis deﬁnes ‘entrepreneur’ and ‘manager’ in a psychologically more meaningful and precise way and shares a larger part of
studies with the ﬁrst (10 out of 18), the second is used as main
source here. Based on the data of 18 studies (about 3000 participants), Stewart and Roth (2007) compared achievement motivation of entrepreneurs (i.e., someone who independently owns
and actively manages a small business) with that of managers.
Achievement motivation was measured partly by questionnaires,
partly by projective techniques. The N-weighted average effect size
is d = .35 in favour of the entrepreneurs. The effect size of the seven
US studies is d = .20, that of all others (n = 11) is d = .54* ( means
that the 90% conﬁdence interval does not include zero). The
authors assumed that outside the USA the entrepreneurial climate
is less favourable. Thus, for becoming an entrepreneur one has to
have more of the ‘entrepreneurial traits’. As to measurement type
(questionnaires vs. projective tests) no consistent differences were
found. Contrasting a subgroup of entrepreneurs (the founders)
with the managers, the effect size rises to d = .64*. Moreover,
growth oriented owners differ from income oriented owners by
d = .67*. One can see that with rising demands on initiative and
self-directed formation of the environment achievement motivation is becoming increasingly important.
4. Summarizing and integrating the results of the ﬁve metaanalyses
Most attention has been attracted by temperament traits (or
personality traits in the narrow sense), as represented by the
ﬁve-factor model, or by traits that can be located within the
FFM-system as equivalent to one of the ﬁve factors (Zhao & Seibert,
2006; Zhao et al., 2010), or as equivalent to a weighted composite
of several FFM-dimensions. Examples of the latter are proactive
personality and innovativeness among the traits dealt with in the
meta-analysis of Rauch and Frese (2007). Though motives (like
need for achievement, afﬁliation, or power), values, and attitudes
are not independent of temperament traits (Cattell, 1965; Olver
& Mooradian, 2003; Roberts & Robins, 2000), they are theoretically
and empirically distinct individual dispositions with different
causes and effects that may be relevant in different situations
and in different time perspectives.
4.1. Risk propensity
The meta-analysis of risk propensity (Stewart & Roth, 2001) and
its extension by Stewart and Roth (2004), in response to the criticism of Miner and Raju (2004), provides clear empirical evidence
that entrepreneurs are more risk prone than managers and that
growth oriented entrepreneurs are more risk prone than income
oriented entrepreneurs. More than managers, entrepreneurs have
to cope with situations that are unstructured and uncertain about
the outcome of decisions and, therefore, more problematic for risk
averse than for risk prone people. However, according to Zhao et al.
(2010) only entrepreneurial intention, not entrepreneurial performance, is (positively) related to risk propensity. Running a new

5

enterprise successfully demands careful and prudent decision
making. It reminds one of McClelland’s (1965) idea that entrepreneurs, in particular successful entrepreneurs, have high scores on
achievement motivation, characterized by hope for success rather
than by fear of failure, with a preference for moderate risks as condition of entrepreneurial success.
Zhao et al. (2010), focussing on entrepreneurial intentions and
performance, and Stewart and Roth (2001), comparing entrepreneurs with managers, refer to risk propensity in different studies
and with different dependent variables. Nevertheless, both metaanalyses agree on the importance of risk propensity in the context
of entrepreneurship.
There is still some debate about the best way to measure risk
propensity (Miner & Raju, 2004; Stewart & Roth, 2004). Relating
measures of risk propensity to the Big Five dimensions as reference
system helps clarifying their construct validity. An example is given
by Nicholson, Soane, Fenton-O’Creevy, and Willman (2005) who assessed risk propensity by asking people how often they have shown
risky behaviour in six areas of life (recreation, health, career, ﬁnance, safety and social risk-taking), resulting in a risk measure that
seems more similar to the Jackson Personality Inventory (JPI) risk
scale than to Choice Dilemma Questionnaire or Miner’s risk avoidance scale. With positive beta-coefﬁcients of Extraversion (.26) and
Openness (.36), and negative beta-coefﬁcients of Neuroticism
(.18), Agreeableness (.31), and Conscientiousness (.20) 41% of
the variance of their risk propensity measure is explained. The negative coefﬁcient of Conscientiousness is a hint of possible detrimental effects on business success when risk propensity is very high.
Presumably, not only risk propensity, but also many of other speciﬁc (special purpose) personality scales can be reconstructed as
weighted composites of the Big Five (cf. Brandstätter, 2009).
4.2. Achievement motivation
The studies selected by Zhao et al. (2010) – these authors look at
achievement motivation as a component of Conscientiousness –
and those selected by Stewart and Roth (2007) show no overlap.
Only one article that explicitly deals with personality traits (in
the narrow sense) and achievement motives of entrepreneurs is
found in both meta-analyses. Obviously, these two areas of research are unduly separated.
Stewart and Roth (2007) clearly conﬁrm achievement motivation as a prominent characteristic of entrepreneurs, in particular
of entrepreneurs who are the founders of their business and who
are oriented toward growth of their enterprise. Zhao and Seibert
(2006), analyzing a different set of studies and differentiating
achievement motivation and dependability as components of the
global dimension Conscientiousness, report a large superiority of
entrepreneurs (compared to managers) in achievement motivation. No difference was found in dependability.
As in any correlation or group comparison study, causal inferences are more or less problematic. People who have founded a
business (for whatever reason) might post hoc conclude from this
very fact that they must be particularly achievement motivated,
otherwise they would not have acted in this way. Logically, such
an interpretation cannot be excluded, although this causal path
seems much less plausible than the other way around. Properly designed longitudinal studies could better clarify this issue (see Escher et al., 2002; McClelland, 1965; Rauch & Frese, 2000).
Longitudinal studies focussing on the personality–entrepreneurship link are still rather rare.
4.3. More about entrepreneurs’ motives
Focussing primarily on achievement motivation as the driving
force behind entrepreneurial activities goes back to McClelland

Please cite this article in press as: Brandstätter, H. Personality aspects of entrepreneurship: A look at ﬁve meta-analyses. Personality and Individual Differences (2010), doi:10.1016/j.paid.2010.07.007

(1965). However, it would be a mistake to gauge the real importance of an explanatory variable simply according to a frequency
count of articles focussing on that variable. Meta-analyses could
even reinforce such a problematic conclusion because it tends to
include only frequently performed research. Thus, the effects of
subcategories of the achievement motive (e.g., hope for success
vs. fear of failure or approach vs. avoidance goals), although theoretically and practically important, may be missed in meta-analyses. Other motivational constructs like need for autonomy (Ryan
& Deci, 2000) may be important, too. Moreover, limiting the attention to traits that distinguish entrepreneurs from managers, and
not taking into account what they may have in common (cf. Holland, 1997, for ‘enterprising occupations’), could forfeit a thorough
understanding of the person by environment interaction in the
ﬁeld of entrepreneurship.
Starting with McClelland, Koestner, and Weinberger (1989), differences in antecedent conditions and consequences of implicit
(sub-conscious) vs. explicit (reﬂected) motives (reﬂected as component of the self-concept) are discussed with steadily increasing
intensity (Brunstein, 2008). One can expect that differences between implicit and explicit motives will be more important in future entrepreneurial research.
4.4. Big Five
Having summarized ﬁrst the meta-analysis results of risk propensity and achievement motivation with some peripheral connections to the Big Five, now the focus is on the contribution of the Big
Five (in the sequence of OCEAN) to a better understanding of the
entrepreneurial behaviour. Each paragraph begins with a short definition of the trait construct quoted from John et al. (2008, p. 138).
4.4.1. Openness to experience
‘‘. . . describes the breadth, depth, originality, and complexity of
an individual’s mental and experiential life”. According to Zhao and
Seibert (2006) entrepreneurs have substantially higher scores on
Openness than managers. Zhao et al. (2010) report higher correlations of Openness with intention and performance than for the
other Big Five dimensions. One can see some afﬁnity to innovativeness for which Rauch and Frese (2007) report positive effects on
business creation and business success. Correlations between Big
Five scales and cognitive styles, reported by Zang and Huang
(2001), are fully compatible with the link between innovativeness
and Openness.
4.4.2. Conscientiousness
‘‘. . . describes socially prescribed impulse control that facilitates
task- and goal-directed behaviour, such as thinking before acting,
delaying gratiﬁcation, following norms and rules, and planning,
organizing, and prioritizing tasks”. Conscientiousness is reported
by Zhao and Seibert (2006) as one of the Big Five dimensions where
entrepreneurs are superior to managers. Looking at two facets of
Conscientiousness (i.e., achievement motivation and dependability), only achievement motivation differentiated entrepreneurs
from managers. Obviously, it can make sense to look for lower level
components (facets) of well established global dimensions. For
Conscientiousness as global trait (without distinction of facets)
Zhao et al. (2010) report a positive correlation both with intention
to become an entrepreneur and with entrepreneurial performance.
4.4.3. Extraversion
‘‘. . . implies an energetic approach toward the social and material world and includes traits such as sociability, activity, assertiveness, and positive emotionality”.
Entrepreneurs are somewhat more extraverted than managers
(Zhao & Seibert, 2006) and Extraversion shows weak but signiﬁ-

cant correlations with intentions (of setting up a business) and
business performance (Zhao et al., 2010). One could think of a certain afﬁnity between Extraversion and proactive personality (i.e.,
initiating actions on opportunities, shaping the environment
according to one’s goals and being persistent in goal striving) for
which Rauch and Frese (2007) report higher scores for entrepreneurs than for managers. There is indeed a substantial correlation
between proactive personality and the assertiveness and activity
facet of Extraversion (Major, Turner, & Fletcher, 2006), but also
with facets of Openness (actions, ideas, values), Conscientiousness
(achievement striving, but not dutifulness), and Neuroticism (vulnerability, negative correlation). Obviously, the proactive personality scale (Crant, 1996) is like innovativeness (Zibarras et al., 2008) a
speciﬁc purpose scale encompassing various components that are
not necessarily correlated.
4.4.4. Agreeableness
‘‘. . . contrasts a prosocial and communal orientation toward others with antagonism and includes traits such as altruism, tendermindedness, trust, and modesty”.
Entrepreneurs have lower scores in this dimension than managers (Zhao & Seibert, 2006) while Zhao et al. (2010) found no significant correlation between Agreeableness and intentions (of setting
up a business) or business performance. Only in the context of a
special mode of multiple regression analysis (adapted for metaanalyses) low signiﬁcant negative beta-coefﬁcients were found
for both dependent variables. Support of rather negative effects
of Agreeableness can be seen in the positive effects of need for
autonomy on business creation and (to a lesser degree) on business
success reported by Rauch and Frese (2007), since Koestner and Losier (1996) provided evidence for a strong negative correlation between need for autonomy (i.e., to act independently of others or of
social values and expectations) and Agreeableness show.
4.4.5. Neuroticism
‘‘. . . contrasts Emotional Stability and even-temperedness with
negative emotionality, such as feeling anxious, nervous, sad, and
tense”. Zhao and Seibert (2006) report for entrepreneurs lower
scores on Neuroticism than for managers and Zhao et al. (2010) report negative effects of Neuroticism both on intention to establish
a private business and on performance. This corresponds to the effects of those personality scales, reported by Rauch and Frese
(2007), whose labels suggest a certain afﬁnity to Emotional Stability (reverse of Neuroticism), i.e., generalized self-efﬁcacy, stress
tolerance, and locus of control (for empirical evidence of this afﬁnity see Hartman & Betz, 2007; Judge, Erez, Bono, & Thoresen, 2002).
5. Beyond meta-analyses
5.1. Variables mediating the personality trait effects
Whereas the meta-analysis approach is quite efﬁcient in detecting, summarizing, and reporting personality main effects, it is less
apt in dealing with mediating and moderating effects, mainly because the number of studies reporting such effects is often not
large enough to allow a reliable estimation of means and error
variances of the effects across studies. It seems, therefore, advisable to pay special attention to some single studies that report theoretically interesting and practically relevant mediator and
moderator effects.
An example of the role of mediator variables in a complex design is a study by Göbel and Frese (1999) who correlate self-reports
on 29 speciﬁc personality traits, four human capital variables, and
13 entrepreneurial strategies (the latter as mediating variables)
with self-reported success (composed of business size, growth,

entrepreneur’s job satisfaction, and income) in a heterogeneous
sample of German small business entrepreneurs.
Marcati, Guido, and Peluso (2008) show that the inﬂuence of
general innovativeness (GI) on the intention to adopt innovations
(as proxy for actual innovative behaviour in one’s ﬁrm) is completely mediated by domain speciﬁc innovativeness (SI). In addition, they correlated GI and SI to measures of the Big Five
(n = 188 entrepreneurs of small and medium sized ﬁrms of various
industries) with the following results: O (.41; .38), C (.51; .21), E
(.24; .39), A (.38; -.34), and N (.22; .07). It would have been
interesting to see how the Big Five inﬂuence (indirectly and directly) the intention to adopt innovations, but this information is
not given by the authors.
How the effects of entrepreneurial orientation (with the components of innovativeness, risk-taking, proactiveness, competitive
aggressiveness, and autonomy) on performance (efﬁciency,
growth, and proﬁt) of newly founded ﬁrms in Taiwan is mediated
by knowledge creation processes (ways of sharing individual
knowledge and optimizing its use in solving of organizational
problems) is reported by Li, Huang, and Tsai (2009).

5.2. Variables moderating the personality trait effects
Intentions to found a private business can be conceived of as an
additive effect of perceived desirability (attitude to ownership) and
perceived feasibility (entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy). However, Fitzsimmons and Douglas (in press), controlling for some other variables possibly inﬂuencing entrepreneurial intentions, found in a
sample of about 400 MBA students from a variety of countries
(Australia, China, India or Thailand) a (multiplicative) interaction
effect of desirability and feasibility: there were main effects of perceived desirability (b = .36) and perceived feasibility (b = .30) complemented by a negative interaction effect desirability  feasibility
(b = .16), all coefﬁcients being highly signiﬁcant (p < .001). People
high on desirability form intentions, even if the perceived feasibility is low, whereas people with low desirability tend to abstain
from intentions only when feasibility is low, too. The authors classify entrepreneurs according to their pattern of perceived desirability and perceived feasibility.
Ensley, Pearce, and Hmieleski (2006) found that transformational leadership of entrepreneurs was particularly effective (in

7

terms of business success) with dynamic, fast changing environments, whereas transactional leadership turned out to be particularly unfavourable in such an environment.
Hmieleski and Baron (2008) present an example of three-way
interaction of entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy  dspositional optimism  environmental dynamism on ﬁrm performance (revenue
growth and employment growth): in dynamic environments entrepreneurial self-efﬁcacy (self-ratings of skills in various entrepreneurial activities) has positive effects on performance when
optimism is moderate, but negative when it is high. In stable environments self-efﬁcacy had only a weak effect on performance and
was not moderated by optimism. It seems that a very high level of
dispositional optimism implies overconﬁdence that is particularly
dangerous in dynamic environments where timely realistic judgements of opportunities and risks are ﬁrst and foremost important.

5.3. A look at a complex model of entrepreneurship
Meta-analyses cannot adequately mirror the results of studies
the design of which is highly complex (in terms of number of variables and connections between the variables). For the sake of brevity only one example is presented here that should give an
impression of how such complex models could look like.
From the perspective of a theory of action (Frese & Zapf, 1994).
Frese (2009) elaborated on the inﬂuence of the entrepreneur’s personality characteristics as well as of human capital on entrepreneurial success which is assumed to be mediated by action styles
like goal orientation and planning (Frese, Stewart, & Hannover,
1987). Several other individually characteristic ways of information processing and acting in the speciﬁc environment are taken
into account (Fig. 1). The environment is characterized by the
developmental stage of the ﬁrm (life cycle), the speed of change
(dynamism), adverse economic conditions like high competition
and lack of resources (hostility), and branch of business (industry).
In combination with personal characteristics, the environment
inﬂuences entrepreneurial activities which in turn change the
environment. Personality and environment are seen also as moderators of the inﬂuence of ways of actions on business success. All
these conditions and processes are embedded in the speciﬁc cultural context. For some of the theoretically postulated inﬂuences
the authors refer to supporting empirical studies.

5.4. Missing laboratory experiments in entrepreneurship research
Psychological research on entrepreneurship is almost exclusively based on questionnaires, usually applied in ﬁeld studies,
whereas econometric research on antecedent conditions and economic consequences of entrepreneurship commonly draws on
macro-economic indicators characterizing national or regional
economies. The advantage of the experimental approach in testing
causal inﬂuences is widely neglected in psychological entrepreneurship research. Experimental economics, too, has rarely focussed on entrepreneurial decision making. Examples of
experiments that have some afﬁnity to the tasks of entrepreneurs
are Dittrich, Güth, and Maciejovski (2005) for investment decisions
and Dimov (2007) for entrepreneurial opportunity perception and
action.

aim for, what they do, and what they actually achieve. The inﬂuence of personality traits may be stronger with entrepreneurs than
with most other professions, because the entrepreneurial role provides more freedom in choosing and changing the environment as
well as in acting according to personal preferences and goals. Helping aspiring entrepreneurs not only to learn about economic
opportunities, legal regulations, and ﬁnancial support of a startup, but also about the chances, limits, and risks given with their
personality structure (cognitive abilities, motives, values, and temperament) can now rely on the results of highly valuable psychological entrepreneurship research. This topic is a ﬁne example of
the value of integrating personality psychology and economic-related behaviour.

5.5. Personality in counselling and training aspiring entrepreneurs
Research on how personality characteristics inﬂuence business
set-up and success can improve counselling of aspiring entrepreneurs and the efﬁciency of business support. Since consulting
aspiring entrepreneurs has become quite common, thinking about
the opportunities and restraints given with one’s personality structure will be a useful part of counselling and self-reﬂection. Some
aspiring entrepreneurs will need encouragement, to others warnings of the dangers of overconﬁdence might be helpful.
6. Conclusions
Analyzing the tasks of entrepreneurs is an indispensable ﬁrst
step in entrepreneurial research. These tasks vary with circumstances such as the type of industry (providing service or material
goods, based on new technology or conventional techniques), region, competitors, social networks, founding a business as a matter
of necessity or opportunity, ﬁnancial resources, developmental
stage of the business. But techniques for systematic analyses of
entrepreneurial tasks under various circumstances still wait for
development. It should be an important project of future psychological entrepreneurship research. A systematic analysis of entrepreneurs’ tasks and socio-economic circumstances will probably
reveal that as yet neglected personality aspects like cognitive abilities or values are equally important as the Big Five personality
dimensions or similar constructs.
The prominence of FFM should not hinder development and
application of special purpose scales, but it should be standard,
actually a matter of routine, to include in any entrepreneurship
study on individual differences short, but sufﬁciently reliable and
valid measures of the Big Five. This is the only way to secure comparability of the results across the variety of personality measures
and studies, and to learn whether a speciﬁc (new) scale is redundant or has incremental validity beyond the Big Five.
In the future, longitudinal studies are very much needed in order to defend causal inferences from personality traits (in the
broader sense) to entrepreneurial intentions, set-up decisions,
and performance against common objections. Such studies could
also collect data on mental and behavioural processes that might
be conceived of as variables that mediate the inﬂuence of personality traits on the results of the entrepreneurs’ endeavours. Mental
processes are accessible mainly through self-reports when neurophysiological measurement techniques are not available or not
applicable, whereas behavioural processes can and should be assessed both with self-reports and reports of observers in different
roles.
There can be little doubt any more that personality traits contribute substantially to the way entrepreneurs think, what they
