ABSTRACT
Globalization and domestic competition are forcing businesses to rethink the human resources
utilization process, and one method for considering again this challenge is creating a team
culture. One key to this process for human resources development is the understanding of how to
create the most successful teams. The use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a tool
often used by business to achieve the goals of building work teams. College business majors must
be introduced to the MBTI and to the dynamics of team building as a measurable skill necessary
for their work environment. This research focuses on college classes in business communications,
the directed study of the MBTI, and the heterogeneous mix of type in teams necessary for high
learning outcomes. Specific pedagogical directions are provided for two team-building projects
in writing, research, and oral presentation to small groups, thus meeting multiple course
objectives.

INTRODUCTION

I

n the late eighties, I used the Myer-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) as a tool in my teambuilding
workshops and seminars for several major corporations. My emphasis was on how the MBTI could
help working professionals improve their communication skills by understanding the varying styles of
perceiving and processing information. Use of the MBTI produced dramatic results in breaking down
communication barriers, especially between departments that needed more collaboration to facilitate favorable
outcomes on strategically volatile projects. These corporations had much at stake, and the realization that success
for a particular project did not rest solely on their perception of communication was revelatory.
Once the MBTI was introduced and employees were trained in the use of this information, they were
amazed. It was a successful exercise, and the use of the instrument produced dramatic results in breaking down
communication barriers, especially between departments where little or no communication networks were in place,
prior to the testing. There was little lateral communication, and the organization relied on the bureaucratic methods
of top down communications. The implementation of the information from the MBTI helped to create a culture of
trust and aid in the establishment of a more flat and open communication system.
During the same time, I was teaching four sections of Business Communications at a small, four-year
liberal arts college where I introduced the MBTI to the students as a relevant instrument for communication in the
business world. While I was sold on the value of the MBTI in helping corporations communicate more effectively, I
did not see the same level of value in the classroom. I administered the MBTI to students, and we discussed the

13

<-----Page 2----->College Teaching Methods & Styles Journal – Fourth Quarter 2007

Volume 3, Number 4

relevance of the instrument for communications, but I did not grasp the impact of actually implementing its use in
the classroom. The MBTI was taught mostly as a concept, but not as a skill. That was then and this is now.
The business arena today expects that students with a Business degree demonstrate an awareness of
interpersonal skills with a working knowledge of team dynamics. All employees, in any of the professions, are now
required to work as a team and to display greater understanding for individual differences to meet corporate
objectives.
These skills were historically perceived as “soft skills” in the business and academic arenas, and, we, in the
college of business, consistently relied on Educational Testing Service (ETS) to validate our learning outcomes.
Times have changed, especially with demand for the seal of approval from the Association for Accreditation of
Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) and the other accrediting agencies for colleges. My on- going relationship
within the business community and the academic world provides a link on how the MBTI can be effectively used in
the classroom to bring about the same high level of team dynamics as required in the business arena.
This research and explication of the MBTI are intended for an easy and hands-on assignment for the
classroom instructor. It sets forth a procedure that will make teamwork in the classroom easier and forecast stronger
outcomes. The specific project contains not only the MBTI, but also uses a research assignment, a writing
assignment, and an oral presentation as team projects that accomplish more than one course objective.
Part of the reason for the success in business for the MBTI is the ability of the employer to provide work
time for employees to attend a MBTI workshop, which not only administers the MBTI to employees but also
provides feedback sessions tailored to meeting their communication needs. Employees are able to see instant
positive applications using the MBTI resulting in change in the workplace. For students to take the MBTI as
seriously in class performance, there must be a mechanism for the teacher to tie the grade of the student to the team
performance (performance in the team not just the outcome), as the employer can do for teamwork on the job. We
must move away from the concept that the classroom represents the study of theory only, intended for
practical application later. The students should have concrete experiences now, especially in the area of teamwork
(Coby and Lewis, 2000).
This research provides a mechanism for grading teamwork and presents a formula for teaching team
dynamics and creating teams in the classroom that will not require excess study or complete mastery of some of the
complexities of the MBTI.
BACKGROUND
The mother-daughter pair, Katherine Cook Briggs and Isabelle Briggs Myers, who created this instrument,
now translated into more than 20 languages, and more widely used in business than any other single tool for
facilitating people- outcomes in corporations, followed closely the work of Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung, and his
analysis of psychological type. Jung was a student of Freud and basically, Freud believed that as individuals we
have more differences from each other and only some similarities. Jung, his student, believed the opposite, that we
have more similarities than differences. Katherine and Isabelle, following Jung’s theory, began their research in the
1920’s to type these differences and show the similarities. This first premise of the MBTI instrument, the need for
understanding, sets forth a beginning goal and a major challenge, in and of itself. The MBTI simply identifies 16
personality types and shows the process by which a person perceives and evaluates information, considering four
dimensions of personality:
Extroversion-Introversion, Intuiting-Sensing, Thinking- Feeling, and JudgingPerceiving. The combinations for the 16 types are found in the appendix (Item 1). The four domains are the
places people prefer to live and operate from, and these preferences determine how the individual performs and
perceives the world.
An examination of the literature on use of the MBTI suggests that team building is enhanced by personality
diversity within the team (Hammer& Huszczo, 1996). The diversity needed within the team as noted by Dilworth
and Richter (1995) includes perceptual preferences and cognitive orientation to guard against perceptual errors. In
14

<-----Page 3----->College Teaching Methods & Styles Journal – Fourth Quarter 2007

Volume 3, Number 4

1974, Myers and McCaulley first used the MBTI as a tool to improve the effectiveness of teams (Myers, McCulley,
Ouenk & Hammer, 1998). In their manual Myers and McCaulley state: “the basic assumptions underlying using the
MBTI with teams remain the same. Knowledge of individual differences will help teams identify the particular
talents and gifts that each member brings to his or her task: and this knowledge can help reduce conflict by
reframing potential sources of misunderstanding as natural individual difference” (p.348). In the business world
today, the biggest missing element in teamwork is trust, and teaching about differences in personality domains in the
classroom can be a small part of recreating trust through understanding the gifts of personality types.
Extrovert and Introvert: Orientation to the world. Extroverts are energized by the world of people and things, and
prefer not to be isolated from people. Introverts, on the other hand, prefer time alone and need time to recharge their
batteries. They are energized by the world of concepts and ideas. Possible conflict occurs when the extrovert
perceives the introvert as too reserved, self-absorbed, aloof, and thinking without ever acting and/or when the
introvert perceives the extrovert as too talkative, superficial, intrusive, and acting without ever thinking.
Sensing and Intuitive: Perception of the world. Sensing individuals perceive information by their sense organs;
they use the five senses. They are drawn to the world of fact and the need to be precise and concrete. They are
practical and demand hard data that deal in specific information, and they usually like information broken down into
components. They like to develop a single idea in depth. The intuitive person sees the world of possibilities. They
are imaginative, look to the future, and always like to explore what is new. Possible conflict occurs when the
subject or the challenge of change occurs. The sensor may see the Intuitives as unrealistic, flighty, and living in the
future. The Intuitives may see the sensor as unimaginative, boring, lacking vision and clinging to the present, the
known.
Thinking and Feeling: Judgment about the world. The thinking individual is always concerned with fairness.
They tend to be scientific in their approach, and use analysis, hard facts, and logic to reach a conclusion. The Feeler
is most concerned with human values, and how other people in the team feel. They are emotional about feelings;
but not necessarily emotional people. Possible conflict occurs when the Thinker is viewed by the Feeler as too
impersonal, insensative, critical, and inconsiderate of how others may feel. The Thinker may view the feeler as
overly sensitive, irrational, and needing to please others too much.
Perceiving and Judging: Attitude to the world and people. The Perceiver is open to the world, to change and is
always curious. They expect the unexpected, and wait as long as possible to make a decision. Judgers make
decisions quickly and like a schedule, and they want to do things quickly. Possible conflict occurs when the
Perceiver sees the Judger as too rigid, controlling, and jumping to decisions with too little information or when the
Judger sees a Perceiver as disorganized, unreliable, procrastinating, and incapable of making decisions without more
information. The major areas of conflict between these types are over time and decision-making.
THE TEST
The career services department of your college or school can administer the MBTI, and there are two basic
versions of the MBTI. For purposes of this research, I used form M, which was administered online, and the
individual results were given to each student. The longer version, 126 question form G, is reported to be the most
reliable (Brightman, ND). However, the 96-question form M was easy to use and produced accurate results.
The students complete the test online and within a few days receive their profile along with other useful
resources. The information that it provided to the test taker with this form provides a general initiation, and a
sample profile is included in the appendix (Item 2). The career services department, in this case, absorbed the
cost of administering this test, which is $9 per students. The information from the Center for Applied Psychological
Type (CAPT) provides a spectrum that accompanies the type delineation and shows the student a scale for their
preference. This avoids the pigeon- hole effect and reveals the variance in type preference. Make sure, whatever
method you use, that a common and valid vocabulary can be established through the administering of the test. All
team members should have a common understanding of the terminology. The MBTI is by far the most reliable
instrument for determining personality type and the one the students will encounter most often in the business world.

The test should be administered at the beginning of the semester and the results can be utilized throughout
the semester. The first goals for the instrument’s use in the classroom are the following:





Understanding how the individual finds energy and how they focus their attention (extraversion or
introversion)
Knowing how the individual chooses to take in and process information (sensing and intuition)
Realizing how the individual prefers to make decisions (thinking or feeling)
Learning the way an individual relates to the external world (judging or perceiving)

THE PROCESS OF FORMING TEAMS
The first thing as instructors that you need to do is take the test yourself. The CAPT, which purchased the
instrument in 1985 and has the largest data bank on testing results, reports that the majority of university faculty are
introverts, and the majority of undergraduate students are extraverts. These results indicate that 56% to 58% of
16,000 freshman students at three state universities were extraverted. The data also shows that Phi Betta Kappas
were over 65% introverts, and leaders on college campuses were more than 85% extroverts. While this is not
surprising data, it is important that we remember this information when forming teams, and when we, as instructors,
create assignments for the teams. Assigning individuals to teams according to type insures that the team has
diversity and gives the instructor more control over outcomes.
Every process of communication must begin with knowing ourselves, and it is that understanding that
makes us more confident. Students, who read the profiles for the first time, express relief that someone actually
understands some things about them. The second realization, that other members of their class, their team, are
different and, in fact, do not “see” the world as they do, is the beginning of the most important process of honoring
difference.
One exercise that is very helpful is to allow students to share information about themselves informally in
the team. So much information is provided in the feedback on the type from CAPT that this is an easy and fun
assignment. One of the strongest motivations, outside of the grade, is that mastery of this information provides a
skill that will allow the student to fit in, which is a basic need of the human condition. To this end, the desire to
make the teamwork successful becomes also a part of the need to fit into the team. Another obvious value is the
knowledge and the acknowledgement of the different personality types that contribute to more successful problem
solving within the team (Bayne, 1995) (Varvel, et al., 2004).
While there is much attention in current research to types in teamwork, there is not complete agreement on
a particular composition that produces success every time. Factors of intelligence and situation must be included in
any evaluation of group dynamics (Neuman, et al., 1999). Diversity issues of gender and ethnicity must be
reconciled in the structuring of the teams. These areas are not the subject of this research. There is general
agreement across the major research that personality is a key factor in team performance. There is also
disagreement in some of the research. For example, Culp and Smith used a study by Blaylock that finds “that
project teams with complementary preferences for taking in information and making judgments outperformed teams
where all of the team members had the same preference (Culp & Smith, 2001). Complementary preferences for
information gathering would require a balance in the Sensing and Intuitive (S and N) domains in the team
composition. The point is that diversity is required to have the highest functioning teams. Although, for example,
the S and N have the most conflict in a group process, you cannot have a team with all S or all N. The perspectives
would be too much the same and much would be overlooked in gathering the information needed for the whole
picture.
Muschinsky and Monahan (1987) proposed a “A supplementary model of person-environment fit [that]
suggests that job performance is improved when team members possess characteristics that are similar to other
individuals on the team” (p 269). This research by Muschinsky and Monahan varies some from Blaylock and
suggests that work product is increased with similar types grouped into a team. While the two studies seem to
indicate the opposite, the reality is that they are saying the same thing. You must have some similarities for
16

<-----Page 5----->College Teaching Methods & Styles Journal – Fourth Quarter 2007

Volume 3, Number 4

common ground for communications to occur and yet, there has to be diversity for the whole picture to emerge.
Heterogeneous groups are preferred with strict attention to type strengths when formed.
The most effective teams must have a healthy component of E to promote intra-team communication; the E
is a natural communicator. If you have a team with too many of the I, the work will not move forward and certainly
not quickly. The I may be smart and a capable student/worker, but he or she just will not initiate enough to organize
or communicate with other team members. The I types make a strong record keeper; they pay attention when others
are talking and can take note of the process.
The best leaders are the ESTJ or the ENTJ depending on the project. The sensing leader is best if there is
nothing new to think, just organization and communication, but if the project calls for new thinking then the
intuitive leader is best. If the team has all E types, the team will experience confusion because the Es all need to talk
(at the same time) and will interrupt the other to speak.
In the domains of S and N, there is need for balance in assigning type in the team, and there is the greatest
chance for conflict between the S and the N. This is where dialogue is needed when teams are formed; when team
members can forecast problem areas, they can plan for conflict resolution. For the extreme S and N expect conflict
and prepare. Sensing types can easily perceive the facts and can easily communicate to other members of the team.
Sensing types make strong facilitators in the group. Intuitives develop complex ideas that are more difficult to
express, and require more listening.
In the domains of T and F, the thinking type is quick to make judgments and to verbalize the judgments,
and the feeling type may not express their thoughts because they are afraid of hurt feelings. The feelers make the
best harmonizer because this is their natural domain. They are the most capable of helping the team reach the trust
level of communication. Group cohesion is most impacted by thinking and feeling types. The thinkers are so quick
to voice directions that often frighten or intimidate the F. However, if you have all F types, you run the risk of
having no conflict, and without some conflict or differences, synergy is not achieved.
In the domains of J and P, there is need for acknowledgement of strengths of each type, and a plan on how
to incorporate these strengths into the group process. Just as one would not ask a person who is not a morning
person to be in charge of opening the shop at 5 o’clock in the morning, then one would not ask the P to make the
schedule. The J will keep the team on schedule, while the P will help the team consider other alternatives in the
decision-making process. Since the P is not limited by space and time in their thinking, they present creativity that
can enhance the end- product.
CAVEAT TO TEAM ASSIGNMENT
The MBTI instrument was introduced to all classes with a general discussion of its development and of
how it is used. In addition, it is imperative that the following disclaimers are provided the students during this
discussion and implementation of the MBTI:







Morality is not measured by the instrument.
Deviant behavior is not measured by the instrument.
Preference does not indicate dominance by a type, and the preference scale index should always be noted.
Results should seem like a match for your feelings; it should sound like you.
Superior type does not exist; one type is not superior to any other type.
Type may vary slightly over time on the preference scale, but will not change.

FIRST PROJECT: RESEARCH AND ORAL PRESENTATION
For the first project, teams of three to five students were formed with attention to type. Depending on class
size, there will be 4-5 teams per class. Students take the MBTI and review their Type and the Types of their team
members.
17

<-----Page 6----->College Teaching Methods & Styles Journal – Fourth Quarter 2007

Volume 3, Number 4

Students are assigned to find three journal articles online on the MBTI and team building, and to highlight
the information that relates to their type, and to the type of each member of the team. They are instructed to become
knowledgeable about how they operate in a team and how each of the other team members would work in a team.
The grading rubric for Myers-Briggs Assignment is in the appendix (Item 3). The students present their
highlighted articles to the instructor one-on-one, and they are required to speak individually and knowledgeable to
the instructor on the highlighted article information.
As part of this same assignment, students are instructed on preparing for a small group oral presentation
(verbal and non-verbal). The body of the oral presentation contained three parts: background on their type,
information on the other types within the team, and an outline or script of how each of the other team members
would work on a team project. The introduction for the oral presentation includes information on the MBTI in
general, and the conclusion includes a forecast on their team’s capacity to achieve team goals. This information is
presented in a small team meeting. Each team member evaluates the presentation in terms of verbal and non-verbal
skills. The grading rubric for Team Presentation is in the appendix (Item 4).
A note about the logistics of this assignment: Teams should be broken up initially for this part of the
project into separate, physical space that can be easily accessed by the instructor. The instructor should visit each
group to see that all groups are on task. The students present in their teams, and the team members evaluate each
oral presentation. The instructor can combine these two rubrics or use separately, and one grade is instructor
generated and the second is team scored.
This assignment educates the students to the MBTI, provides a grade for research, and a grade for an oral
presentation. It also sets up some experience working within the team and discussing the individual differences
based on the MBTI. The instructor needs to spend time with each team to analyze how the dynamic is working in
each team.
SECOND PROJECT: TEAM ASSIGNMENT AND RESEARCH PAPER
The class is instructed in the use of The American Psychological Association Manual (APA) for research.
A unit on research tools and methods is introduced. Students are lectured and directed on researching databases and
given specific guidelines on writing and professionally presenting an APA documented research paper. The topic
for the research paper is teambuilding or the creation of work teams for business.
The entire process of submitting thesis statement, outline, sources, and rough drafts is directed, along with
a timetable for deliverables. As with all research papers, reference articles are required to be copied, with all
material quoted or paraphrased, underlined, and submitted with the paper. This is manageable for the instructor,
remembering that each class will produce only 4-5 research papers.
A standard rubric for grading the written communication with attention to professional presentation,
writing style, amount of research, and APA formatting is used for the research papers. The students evaluate the
other team members’ performance individually at the end of the project, and this grade is recorded. The guide used
for the team evaluation is included in the appendix (Item 4). The team member receives one grade for the term
paper; the grade is the same for all members of the team.
Students are in the second team assignment for the semester when they are researching and writing this
project, and there is continuation of discussion of MBTI. When the team minutes are submitted to the instructor, the
minutes must reflect greater understanding of the team dynamic, and each member’s type is included with all
communication.
Teams are assigned with attention to type and structured for heterogeneous grouping. A discussion of team
formation and the four stages of team development: storming, forming, norming, and performing is presented. It is
explained that most teams will not reach the highest evolution of the team experience, but they may still produce a
superior product, roles are assigned within the teams. There is mutual agreement on team roles between the
18

<-----Page 7----->College Teaching Methods & Styles Journal – Fourth Quarter 2007

Volume 3, Number 4

instructor and the team members: facilitator, harmonizer, record/time keeper, presenter or reporter, leader. The
roles can be exchanged and kept fluid during the work process with the agreement of the members of the team. One
person may at one time perform more than one function. At some time, everyone may serve in the role of
harmonizer or may have harmonizing as part of their role at all time
The teams are given forms for recording team meetings and attendance. The students are also asked to
include in the team minutes experiences that occurred relating to their understanding of the MBTI. After each team
meeting, these forms are completed and e-mailed to the instructor, and the instructor responds to the e-mails of each
team. The record keeper forwards the instructor’s correspondence to all members of the team.
CONCLUSION
Understanding one’s own personality type and the type of other team members contributes to a higher
learning and is an essential factor in successful team performance and outcomes. The model for team composition
presented in this paper will aid in the formation of successful work teams in the classroom and will serve the
students well as they enter the work force. The current literature and the results of this research indicate that
diversity and balance in team members’ type are essential to produce a superior work product.
My experience is somewhat different than most literature indicates in regard to how students really feel
about being involved in a team process. Typically, students are not happy about working in teams and are often
vocal about the inequities. They think initially that it takes too much time. Stronger students see themselves
carrying most of the workload in the project. The use of the MBTI changes how students see themselves and how
they see other students. The work product of teams is enhanced, and some of the hatred and dread of teamwork is
eliminated. It is essential to make the link for the students that assignment to and work in a team is not an option in
the business arena.
It is unrealistic that in every case a full team dynamic of storming, forming, norming, performing may
happen in a 15-week semester; however, having two team projects with the first being more focused on
understanding team dynamics reinforces the use of type as a tool in the team. Students should view conflict or, for
example, lack of a plan by the second project session, as the result of type difference and be able to make the
necessary shifts in dynamics to achieve the goals.
The classroom assignments presented are intended as tools for the classroom instructor and can be
incorporated easily into team projects. As teachers in any field, it is essential that we stress to students that they do
self-examination to understand who they are and help them develop a clear picture of what they can contribute in the
classroom and beyond. Administering the MBTI and using the type information to form teams is a major step in this
process of forecasting stronger team outcomes in the classroom.
On a more lofty level, for us to move forward as a society, we must begin in the classroom. It is interesting
to note that the mother-daughter team, who created the MBTI that we use today in the classroom and the boardroom,
believed that their instrument, if utilized properly and widely, could bring about world peace. This is admittedly a
rather lofty ideal for just a test created by psychologists; but I have seen the impact on the work product and
relationships that can be achieved in the business arena and, now, in the classroom.
I welcome dialogue and sharing; please e-mail your questions, disappointments, and successes.
