Entrepreneurship involves identifying and exploiting entrepreneurial opportunities. However, to
create the most value entrepreneurial firms also need to act strategically. This calls for an
integration of entrepreneurial and strategic thinking. We explore this strategic entrepreneurship
in several important organizational domains to include external networks and alliances,
resources and organizational learning, innovation and internationalization. The research in this
special issue examines both traditional (e.g., contingency theory, strategic fit) and new theory
(e.g., cultural entrepreneurship, business model drivers). The research also integrates, extends,
and tests theory and research from entrepreneurship and strategic management in new ways
such as creative destruction (discontinuities), resource-based view, organizational learning,
network theory, transaction costs and institutional theory. The research presented herein provides
a basis for future research on strategic entrepreneurship for wealth creation. Copyright 

The age of progress is over. It was born in the
Renaissance, achieved its exuberant adolescence
during the Enlightenment, reached a robust
maturity in the industrial age, and died with the
dawn of the twenty-first century … We now
stand on the threshold of a new age—the age of
revolution … it is going to be an age of upheaval,
of tumult, of fortunes made and unmade at headsnapping speed. For change has changed. No
longer is it additive. No longer does it move in
a straight line. In the twenty-first century, change

is discontinuous, abrupt, seditious. (Hamel, 2000:
4–5).
Uncertainty can be used to your benefit if you
create and employ an entrepreneurial mindset—a
way of thinking about your business that captures
the benefits of uncertainty. (McGrath and MacMillan, 2000: 1).
Change is constant in the new economy landscape (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1998). For
example, the digital revolution is altering the
fundamental ways companies conduct business to
create wealth (Stopford, 2001). Such significant
changes challenge the essence of the business
model firms use to achieve various goals and as
such, they are curvilinear and complex (Hitt,
2000). As implied in the quotes above, this
change, largely driven by new technology and

<-----Page 1----->480

M. A. Hitt et al.

globalization, has created a competitive landscape
with substantial uncertainty (Bettis and Hitt,
1995; Ireland and Hitt, 1999). However, there are
opportunities in uncertainty. The firm’s focus
must be on identifying and exploiting these
opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000).
Entrepreneurship involves
identifying and
exploiting opportunities in the external environment (Ireland and Kuratko, 2001; Smith and
DeGregorio, 2001; Zahra and Dess, 2001); an
entrepreneurial mindset is useful in capturing the
benefits of uncertainty (McGrath and MacMillan, 2000).
While the fields of strategic management and
entrepreneurship have developed largely independently of each other, they both are focused on
how firms adapt to environmental change and
exploit opportunities created by uncertainties and
discontinuities in the creation of wealth (Hitt
and Ireland, 2000; Venkataraman and Sarasvathy,
2001). As such, several scholars have recently
called for the integration of strategic and entrepreneurial thinking (e.g., McGrath and MacMillan,
2000). In fact, Meyer and Heppard (2000) argue
that the two are really inseparable. McGrath and
MacMillan (2000) argue that strategists must
exploit an entrepreneurial mindset and, thus, have
no choice but to embrace it to sense opportunities,
mobilize resources, and act to exploit opportunities, especially under highly uncertain conditions.
Venkataraman and Sarasvathy (2001) use a metaphor based on Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet.
They suggest that strategic management research
that does not integrate an entrepreneurial perspective is like the balcony without Romeo. Alternatively, they argue that entrepreneurship research
without integration of a strategic perspective is
like Romeo without a balcony.
These arguments provide the foundation for
this special issue of Strategic Management Journal. The specific purpose of this special issue is
to encourage, nurture, and publish excellent
research that integrates both entrepreneurship and
strategic management perspectives. Furthermore,
we focus on research that addresses entrepreneurial strategies for wealth creation because of
the critical importance to management research
and practice for the twenty-first century. The
importance of the topic is exemplified by the fact
that we received 83 manuscripts in response to
our call for papers for this special issue. The
manuscripts published in this special issue

emerged from a rigorous review and development
process. This issue presents articles that make
important theoretical and empirical contributions
to our knowledge of entrepreneurial strategies that
create wealth. Some of these works develop new
theoretical perspectives, while others test previously unexamined theoretical explanations for
successful entrepreneurial strategies.
For the purposes of the research included in
this special issue, we define entrepreneurship as
the identification and exploitation of previously
unexploited opportunities. As such, entrepreneurial actions entail creating new resources or
combining existing resources in new ways to
develop and commercialize new products, move
into new markets, and/or service new customers
(Ireland et al., 2001; Ireland and Kuratko, 2001;
Kuratko, Ireland, and Hornsby, 2001; Sexton and
Smilor, 1997; Smith and DeGregorio, 2001). On
the other hand, strategic management entails the
set of commitments, decisions, and actions
designed and executed to produce a competitive
advantage and earn above-average returns (Hitt,
Ireland, and Hoskisson, 2001). Strategic management calls for choices to be made among
competing alternatives (Stopford, 2001). Alternative entrepreneurial opportunities constitute one
of the primary arenas of choices to be made.
Strategic management provides the context for
entrepreneurial actions (Ireland et al., 2001).
Entrepreneurship is about creation; strategic management is about how advantage is established
and maintained from what is created
(Venkataraman and Sarasvathy, 2001). Wealth
creation is at the heart of both entrepreneurship
and strategic management. Outcomes from creation (i.e., entrepreneurship) and exploiting current advantages while simultaneously exploring
new ones (i.e., strategic management) can be
tangible, such as enhancements to firm wealth,
and intangible, such as enhancements in the firm’s
intellectual and social capital. Thus, entrepreneurial and strategic perspectives should be integrated to examine entrepreneurial strategies that
create wealth. We call this approach strategic
entrepreneurship.

STRATEGIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP
Strategic entrepreneurship is entrepreneurial
action with a strategic perspective. In the words
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 2----->Strategic Entrepreneurship
of Venkataraman and Sarasvathy (2001), entrepreneurial action is the ‘Romeo on the balcony.’
One could also consider entrepreneurial action to
be strategic action with an entrepreneurial mindset. In short, strategic entrepreneurship is the
integration of entrepreneurial (i.e., opportunityseeking behavior) and strategic (i.e., advantageseeking) perspectives in developing and taking
actions designed to create wealth.
There are several domains in which the integration between entrepreneurship and strategic
management occurs naturally. With theoretical
roots in economics, international business and
management, organization theory, sociology, and
strategic management, Hitt and Ireland (2000)
and Ireland et al. (2001) identified six such
domains. Of these six, we examine the domains
most important and relevant to the research published in this special issue. The review of the
domains explores their theoretical bases, linkages
to wealth creation, and the contributions of the
specific research highlighted in this issue. The
domains include external networks, resources and
organizational learning, innovation, and internationalization.
External networks
External networks have become increasingly
important to all types of firms as the economic
environment continues to grow more competitive
(Gulati, Nohria, and Zaheer, 2000). Such networks involve relationships with customers, suppliers, and competitors among others and often
extend across industry, geographic, political, and
cultural boundaries. Networks have grown in
importance because they can provide firms with
access to information, resources, markets and
even, at times, technologies (Gulati et al., 2000).
Networks can also play an important role in
providing participants with credibility or legitimacy (Cooper, 2001). This is particularly true
for new ventures that participate in networks with
older, more established firms.
External networks can serve as sources of
information that help entrepreneurial firms identify potential opportunities. (Cooper, 2001). However, the greatest value of networks for entrepreneurial firms is the provision of resources and
capabilities needed to compete effectively in the
marketplace (McEvily and Zaheer, 1999). These
resources and capabilities are of most benefit in
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

networks when they are complementary to those
of partners in the network (Chung, Singh and
Lee, 2000; Hitt et al., 2000). The study reported
by Rothaermel in this issue clearly shows the
value of exploiting complementary resources in
alliances and networks. The results of his research
suggest that both smaller biotechnology firms and
the larger pharmaceutical firms benefit from their
alliances. The biotechnology firms provide new
technology and new products (innovation), while
the pharmaceutical firms provide the distribution
networks and marketing capabilities to successfully commercialize the new products. The larger
established pharmaceutical firms also gain value
through access to their partners’ new technology.
As a result of applying of the partners’ complementary assets, alliances help the larger, established companies adapt to the technological discontinuity created by the introduction of the
radical new technology. Indeed, radically new,
disruptive technologies often upset an industry’s
value chain, challenging firms to quickly learn
either how to create more of the value using
traditional practices or more likely how to create
value in ways different from historically practices
(Albrinck et al., 2001).
In particular, external networks can be valuable
because they provide the opportunity to learn new
capabilities (Anand and Khanna, 2000; Dussauge,
Garrette and Mitchell, 2000; Hitt et al., 2000).
Networks, then, allow firms to compete in markets without first owning all of the resources
necessary to do so. This is particularly important
to new venture firms because they often have
limited resources (Starr and MacMillan, 1990;
Dubini and Aldrich, 1991; Cooper, 2001). In fact,
research suggests that new start-up firms can
enhance their chances of survival and eventual
success by establishing alliances and developing
them into an effective network (Baum, Calabrese
and Silverman, 2000). The work by Amit and
Zott in this special issue provides an excellent
example. Based on a sample from the United
States and Europe, they identify the drivers of
value creation in e-business firms.. Two of the
drivers are complementarities and new transaction
structures with constituents in a network.
E-businesses use networks extensively to outsource
functions (e.g., distribution assets, warehouses),
particularly those usually performed by oldeconomy firms that cannot be replaced using the
new technology.
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 3----->482

M. A. Hitt et al.

Thus, firms usually search for partners with
complementary capabilities in forming an alliance
or network. However, research has shown that
equally important is the existence of social capital
(Tsai, 2000). Social capital is developed through
experience operating in networks. Over time firms
learn how to work effectively with partners and
build trusting relationships (Kale, Singh and
Perlmutter, 2000). While partners may use
alliances for learning races (Hamel, 1991), the
building of mutual trust among partners often
prevents the opportunistic outcomes of such learning (Kale et al., 2000). Yli-Renko, Autio, and
Sapienza in this special issue report results showing that social capital in critical customer relationships promotes both knowledge acquisition and
knowledge exploitation by high-technology ventures. Their findings support the arguments that
social capital facilitates learning. Interestingly,
they also find that high-quality relationships
between alliance partners promote trust and less
emphasis on knowledge acquisition. In other
words, high trust produces a willingness to
depend on the partner rather than to learn and
perhaps exploit the partner’s capabilities. An idiosyncratic trust-based relationship can be a source
of competitive advantage for the partner firms
(Davis et al., 2000).
Kogut (2000) argued that the most important
resource of networks may not be in the direct
bilateral ties. Rather, participation in a network
provides access to resources and knowledge of
all of the firm’s partners’ network ties. Thus,
both direct (i.e., relatively formal) and indirect
(i.e., relatively informal) network ties can be
valuable. One valuable outcome from direct and
indirect network ties, especially for newer entrepreneurial firms, is the status or recognition that
can come from linkages to respected and prestigious partners (Stuart, 2000). The research
reported by Lee, Lee, and Pennings in this issue
shows the importance of new venture firms’ linkages to venture capitalists. These linkages are
vital both for the financial support they generate
as well as the legitimacy their investments provide to other important external parties (e.g.,
financial institutions, suppliers, customers,
investors). Their research findings show a strong
positive relationship between venture capitalist
participation in a new venture and its financial
growth rate. Lee, Lee, and Pennings conclude
that internal capabilities are of critical importance

for creating value in new ventures.
Resources and organizational learning
In 1959, a British economist, Edith Penrose, suggested that the returns earned by firms could
largely be attributed to the resources they held.
Novel in its nature and scope, this perspective
was not shared by most of Penrose’s contemporaries. In subsequent years, others, particularly
strategic management scholars (e.g., Wernerfelt,
1984; Hitt and Ireland, 1985; Barney, 1986, 1991;
Rumelt, 1991; Amit and Schoemaker, 1993),
picked up the gauntlet arguing that firms’
resources, capabilities, and competencies facilitate
the development of sustainable competitive
advantages. The primary argument is that firms
hold heterogeneous and idiosyncratic resources
(defined broadly here to include capabilities) on
which their strategies are based. Competitive
advantages are achieved when the strategies are
successful in leveraging these resources. For
example, special resources held by Southwest
Airlines and not by its competitors allowed it to
implement an integrated low cost-differentiation
strategy such that it was successful in poor economic times when all of its competitors were
not. Competitors have tried but largely failed to
imitate Southwest Airlines. They employ a similar
strategy but do not achieve the same results
because they cannot imitate Southwest’s
resources. Organizational culture, leadership, and
human capital are the unique resources Southwest
Airlines leverages to compete successfully (Hitt
et al., 1999).
Similarly, Lee, Lee, and Pennings in this special issue found that the technology-based ventures they studied created value largely based on
their internal capabilities. Specifically, they found
that entrepreneurial orientation, technological
capabilities, and financial resources were primary
predictors of a venture’s growth. Yeoh and Roth’s
(1999) results show that a firm’s resources and
capabilities contributed to sustained competitive
advantages in the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, Baum, Locke, and Smith (2001) report
that a new venture’s internal capabilities are the
primary determinants of the venture’s performance. These research results support the Lee et
al. arguments and findings.
There are different forms of resources and
capabilities. For example, managers represent a
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 4----->Strategic Entrepreneurship
unique organizational resource (Daily, Certo, and
Dalton, 2000). Certo, Covin, Daily, and Dalton
in this special issue find that investment banking
firms are less likely to underprice a firm’s stock
in an initial public offering (IPO) when it
employs professional managers (vs. founder
managers). Thus, founders may be perceived a
less positive resource than professional managers
as new ventures attempt to take their stock public.
These findings resonate with agency theory arguments, in that at certain size and scale of
enterprise (in terms of sales, number of
employees, etc.), the separation of ownership (in
the hands of principals) and decision-making
authority (by individuals hired because of their
decision-making skills) is an efficient form of
organization. Likewise, Sarkar, Echambadi, and
Harrison report in this special issue that knowledge of and proactiveness in the establishment of
alliances are resources. They find that firms with
higher alliance proactiveness achieve better financial performance. This relationship is
especially strong in smaller companies and in
firms operating in dynamic markets.
Because they are socially complex and more
difficult to understand and imitate, intangible
resources are more likely to lead to a competitive
advantage than are tangible resources (Barney,
1991; Hitt et al., 2001b). One important intangible resource is a firm’s reputation (Deephouse,
2000). Reputation can be an important strategic
resource for many reasons, such as access to
resources (e.g., financial capital) and to help a
firm take advantage of information asymmetries
(Hitt et al., 2001b). Because it is almost impossible to determine the quality of services ex ante,
customers may rely on a firm’s positive reputation
as a selection criterion for a provider of desired
services. Moreover, a positive reputation creates
switching costs for customers that they may not
be willing to incur.
However, often new ventures have not been in
existence long enough and their product or service
may be novel, making it necessary for them to
search for surrogate means to establish a positive
reputation. Thus, they may negotiate an alliance
with a reputable firm to gain legitimacy.
Lounsbury and Glynn in this special issue
describe another way new venture firms may
gain legitimacy. They can do so with stories as
legitimating accounts of entrepreneurial actions.
These narratives can be used to show others that

their ventures are compatible with more widely
accepted marketplace activities. Stories provide
symbols and create meaning for others. As such,
they facilitate and support entrepreneurs’ efforts
to obtain access to needed resources such as
financial capital (e.g., venture capital).
Knowledge is another critical firm-specific
intangible resource. Grant (1996) suggests that
knowledge is a firm’s most critical competitive
asset. Spender (1996) argues that knowledge and
the firm’s ability to generate it are at the core of
the theory of the firm. Much of a firm’s knowledge resides in its human capital. Therefore, the
selection, development, and use of human capital
can be used to create firm value (Hitt et al.,
2001b). These arguments are supported by the
research reported by Yli-Renko, Autio, and Sapienza in this special issue. They find that knowledge acquisition and exploitation in young technology-based firms contribute to their ability to
build competitive advantages through new product development, creating technological distinctiveness, and implementing more efficient processes.
Knowledge is generated through organizational
learning (Hitt and Ireland, 2000; Hitt, Ireland and
Lee, 2000). Learning new capabilities helps firms
to compete effectively, survive, and grow (Autio,
Sapienza and Almeida, 2000). Changes that occur
in a firm’s context can reduce the value of its
current resources and knowledge. Thus, learning
new knowledge may be necessary to help a firm
adapt to its environment. Newman (2000) argues
that learning can help organizations to change.
As explained in earlier sections, learning is a
common reason for establishing alliances and participating in strategic networks (i.e., Gulati, 1999;
Inkpen, 2000; Steensma and Lyles, 2000). For
example, Rothaermel in this special issue finds
that incumbent firms are able to learn through
alliances with new entrant firms and thereby
enhance their own new product development.
Hitt et al. (2001b) found that the transfer of
knowledge within a firm builds human capital
(employees’ capabilities) and contributes to higher
firm performance. Furthermore, the firm’s human
capital is used to implement strategies that in
turn enhance performance as well. Thus, human
capital has direct and indirect effects on firm
performance. Diffusing this knowledge throughout
the firm can be a substantial challenge. Sorenson
and Sørensen in this special issue explore diffusStrat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 5----->484

M. A. Hitt et al.

ing knowledge in restaurant chains. They argue
that exploitation learning is the most effective for
chain-managed restaurants but that entrepreneurs
in franchised units are more likely to engage in
exploration learning. Firms operating in homogeneous markets will perform better by expanding
the company-managed units, thereby taking
advantage of learning how to operate in these
environments
and
diffusing
it
through
standardization. However, firms operating in heterogeneous environments will perform better
through franchising in order to learn through
exploration and adapt to the local environments.
Sorenson and Sørensen’s empirical results largely
support these arguments. To the extent that new
knowledge is exploited, learning can have a major
effect on a new venture’s performance (Zahra,
Ireland, and Hitt, 2000b). Of course, no firm can
remain static. As such, established firms and new
ventures alike must continuously learn to build
dynamic capabilities and competencies (Lei, Hitt
and Bettis, 1996; Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997).
Innovation
Innovation is considered by many scholars and
managers to be critical for firms to compete
effectively in domestic and global markets (Hitt
et al., 1998; Ireland and Hitt, 1999). Hamel
(2000) argues that innovation is the most
important component of a firm’s strategy. Others
(i.e., Germany and Muralidharan, 2001) believe
that successful innovation allows a firm to provide
directions for the evolution of an industry. Hamel
suggests that because the competitive landscape
is nonlinear, it requires managers to think in
nonlinear ways. Hamel (2000) reports the results
of as survey of approximately 500 CEOs who
largely agreed that their industry had been
changed in the last 10 years by newcomers, not
incumbents, and that they had done so by changing the rules. He concludes that the real story of
Silicon Valley is not e-commerce, but innovation.
Hamel refers to it as the power of ‘i.’ This is
supported by the reported findings of Amit and
Zott in this issue. They found one of the drivers
of value creation in e-business is novelty (e.g.,
introducing new goods and services to the
marketplace).
The research supports Hamel’s contentions. For
example, Roberts’ (1999) results show a relationship between high innovation and superior profCopyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

itability. Additionally, the results provide no support for the argument that firms can also maintain
high profitability by avoiding the competition
(while not being innovative). Furthermore, Lee et
al., (2000) report that early and fast movers
achieve the highest returns. First movers are the
first to introduce new goods or services (Grimm
and Smith, 1997). In doing so, first movers earn
‘monopoly profits’ until a competitor imitates
their new product or finds a substitute. Finally,
based on their empirical research, Subramaniam
and Venkatraman (1999) conclude that the capability to develop and introduce new products to
the market is a primary driver of a successful
global strategy.
There is a strong interrelationship between
innovation and entrepreneurship. Drucker (1985),
for example, suggests that innovation is the primary activity of entrepreneurship. Lumpkin and
Dess (1996) argue that a key dimension of an
entrepreneurial orientation is an emphasis on
innovation. Thus, an entrepreneurial mindset is
required for the founding of new businesses as
well as the rejuvenation of existing ones
(McGrath and MacMillan, 2000). Therefore, we
may conclude that an important value-creating
entrepreneurial strategy is to invent new goods
and services and commercialize them (innovation)
(Ireland et al., 2001).
Barringer and Bluedorn (1999) argue that
corporate entrepreneurship is important for firm
survival and performance. The results of their
study suggest that intensity in managerial practices is required for successful corporate
entrepreneurship. Their findings also show that
flexibility in planning, use of strategic controls,
and involving many people in the process produce
more entrepreneurial behavior. Increasingly, successful implementation of strategies is a product
of involving people throughout the organization
(Stopford, 2001). Likewise, Leifer and Rice
(1999) show that managerial practices differ for
firms that produce breakthrough innovations from
those in firms that produce incremental innovations.
Ahuja and Lampert in this special issue conducted research that adds considerable richness
to the conclusions regarding the development of
breakthrough inventions. Ahuja and Lampert
argue that many established firms encounter learning traps that serve as barriers to the development
of breakthrough inventions. Learning traps are
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 6----->Strategic Entrepreneurship
tendencies to favor certain forms of learning and
thereby disallow other forms. Ahuja and Lampert’s results show that experimenting with novel,
emerging, and pioneering technologies can help
firms overcome these learning traps to produce
breakthrough inventions. Ahuja and Lambert
argue that breakthrough (or radical) inventions
are at the heart of entrepreneurship and wealth
creation, calling on the work of Schumpeter
(gales of creative destruction) to support these
conclusions.
Hoopes and Postrel (1999) suggest that integration leading to shared knowledge among firms
is a resource that enhances a firm’s product development capabilities. Similarly, Verona’s (1999)
findings suggest that integrative capabilities serve
as a basis for new product development. These
conclusions are supported by the research
reported by Rothaermel in this special issue. He
found that an incumbent firm is able to enhance
its own technological capabilities (e.g., new product development) by learning from a partner that
had produced a major new technology creating a
discontinuity in the market. Similarly, Yli-Renko,
Autio, and Sapienza report in this special issue
that firms are able to use knowledge acquired
from partners to enhance their technological distinctiveness. Zahra et al. (2000b) found that firms
with greater breadth, depth, and speed of technological learning had higher levels of performance.
These results suggest that firms can employ strong
innovative capabilities to implement entrepreneurial strategies and thereby create wealth.
Internationalization
Internationalization has become a primary driver
of the competitive landscape in the twenty-first
century (Hitt and Ireland, 2000). And, the rate of
globalization continues to increase (O’Donnell,
2000), exemplified by the growing number of
economic transactions across country borders
(Rondinelli and Behrman, 2000). While the
increasing globalization of markets heightens the
complexity of doing business, it also enhances
entrepreneurial opportunities (Ireland et al.,
2001). Globalization requires that entrepreneurs
and managers develop a global mindset in order
to manage the complex interactions and transactions required in global markets (Hitt, Ricart i
Costa and Nixon, 1998; Murtha, Lenway and
Bagozzi, 1998).

The opportunities available, the facilitation of
international transactions by new technologies,
and the opening of international markets have led
to an increasing number of smaller, entrepreneurial businesses entering international markets
(Hitt et al.,1998; Ireland and Hitt, 1999). McDougall and Oviatt (2000) define international
entrepreneurship as innovative, proactive, and
risk-seeking behavior that crosses national borders
and is intended to create value in organizations.
Therefore, international entrepreneurship can
occur in large and small organizations as well as
in new or established companies. Several
researchers have found that moving into new
international markets has a positive effect on a
firm’s performance and creates value for the
firm’s owners (Hitt, Hoskisson, and Kim, 1997;
Geringer, Tallman and Olsen, 2000). Essentially,
firms learn new capabilities from each of the new
markets they enter and diffuse this knowledge
throughout the organization so that it can be
successfully used in other markets (Barkema and
Vermeulen, 1998). Of course, companies that
have internationalized experience economies of
scale and have a larger market from which to
obtain returns on their innovations. As such, internationalization is positively related to a firm’s
innovation (Hitt et al., 1997).
Lu and Beamish in this special issue present an
intriguing argument that moving into international
markets by small and medium-sized organizations
is a form of entrepreneurship. Specifically, they
explore the effects of internationalization on the
creation of value in small and medium-sized
firms. In a sample of 164 Japanese firms, they
find that these firms initially experience a
reduction in returns and thus face what some
have called a liability of foreignness. However,
after the firms gain some experience with operations in foreign markets, further foreign direct
investment (FDI) leads to increased profits. Supporting the earlier arguments of the positive
effects of networks, Lu and Beamish find that
these small firms experience greater profits when
they engage in alliances with local partners in
the new markets. In particular, their findings suggest that investing directly in new international
markets has a positive effect but that exporting
has a negative moderating effect. Thus, they conclude that investing directly in the new markets
to take advantage of unique opportunities is a
form of entrepreneurship. Their results receive
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 7----->486

M. A. Hitt et al.

support from a study by Song, Di Benedetto
and Yuzhen (1999). Their research suggests that
managers from nine different countries—the
United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan,
China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and
Singapore—all perceive pioneering in new markets to be positively related to higher returns for
the firm.
One reason for increased entrepreneurial
activity in many parts of the globe is the
increased privatization worldwide. Privatization
has become a popular strategy to promote economic development in developing, emerging, and
developed market economies. The intent of privatization is to unleash firms’ entrepreneurial capabilities, thereby producing more innovation (Zahra
et al., 2000a). Thus, privatization provides entrepreneurial opportunities. However, many privatized firms need resources and entrepreneurial
capabilities to take advantage of these opportunities. As a result, many attempt to form alliances
with firms from other countries that have greater
resources and capabilities on which they can draw
(Hitt et al., 2000; Hitt et al., 2001a). Certainly,
prior research has shown that entrepreneurial
firms can learn from their entries into international markets and this knowledge can be
applied to create greater value for the owners
(Autio et al., 2000; Zahra et al., 2000b). Gupta
and Govindarajan (2000) argue that multinational
corporations exist because of their ability to transfer and exploit knowledge more efficiently within
and throughout the corporation than can be
accomplished through the external market mechanisms. The current research on entrepreneurial
strategies suggests that the same is true for
smaller entrepreneurial firms.

WEALTH-CREATING
ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES
Drawing from contingency theory and other theoretical bases, Zajac, Kraatz, and Bresser (2000)
developed and tested a model of strategic fit.
They used environmental and organizational contingencies to predict changes in a firm’s strategy
and the performance implications of the change.
Their sample involved savings and loan financial
institutions. Robinson and McDougall in this special issue show that the concepts of contingency
and strategic fit also are highly relevant to new

venture firms as well. Integrating arguments from
industrial organization economics, strategic management, and entrepreneurship, they argue and
find that environmental factors (e.g., market entry
barriers) affect the performance of new ventures
after accounting for the moderating effects of
industry growth stage and new venture firm strategy. While their research shows that traditional
approaches and strategies apply to new venture
firms, several of the articles published in this
special issue focus on new or unique
(entrepreneurial) approaches or strategies.
For example, Amit and Zott examine the drivers of value creation for e-business strategies.
They found four drivers of value creation for ebusiness firms: efficiency, complementarities,
lock-in, and novelty. Thus, e-business firms have
strategies that create value when: (1) they make
the purchase more efficient for the customer (e.g.,
provide information to customers so they can
make an informed decision); (2) their services
are complementary to other important services so
that customers can purchase a bundle of services
(range of services broad because there are no
physical limitations); (3) strong incentives are
used to obtain repeat business (create high switching costs); and (4) the service they provide is
unique (novel—that is, the service is recognized
to be pioneering and thus creates previously
unrecognized value). These findings are valuable
not only for e-business firms. Gulati and Garino
(2000) argue that many of the most innovative
Internet-related businesses are integrating their
virtual and physical operations. Furthermore, a
number of old economy firms have developed
electronic operations and the most effective ones
have integrated them into their overall operations
(as opposed to maintaining them as separate
entities). The concepts of efficiency, complementarities, lock-in, and novelty are important for
value creation in all business operations.
Lounsbury and Glynn in this special issue
develop a concept which they refer to as cultural
entrepreneurship.
Cultural
entrepreneurship
involves telling stories to enhance the entrepreneurial firm’s (entrepreneur’s) reputation (building
legitimacy). The primary purpose is to leverage
the entrepreneurial firm’s resources to obtain capital resources. The entrepreneur, in turn, uses the
capital resources to leverage the firm’s other
resources (e.g., new technology) to create wealth.
Essentially, the stories are used to craft the idenStrat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 8----->Strategic Entrepreneurship
tity of the firm. This identity serves as the basis
for legitimacy with potential investors, customers,
and even competitors.
Ahuja and Lampert in this special issue explain
that radical breakthrough inventions are at the
core of entrepreneurial activity. Such inventions
best relate to Schumpeter’s gales of creative
destruction. They theoretically explain and test
entrepreneurial strategies that are most likely to
lead to breakthrough inventions. They find that
exploring novel, emerging, and pioneering
technologies are all related to the development
of breakthrough inventions. However, they also
suggest that to search for pioneering technologies
or experiment with novel technologies requires
slack resources. Without slack resources, firms
are unlikely to create breakthrough technologies.
Their work is highly important because smaller
entrepreneurial firms develop many of the breakthrough technologies. These smaller firms are less
likely to experience the barriers created by the
learning traps explained by Ahuja and Lampert.
Calori et al., (2000) argue that innovative strategies change the structure of the firm’s industry.
Further, they suggest that Schumpeter’s arguments encompass international development. Lu
and Beamish build on this notion to argue that
entry into international markets by smaller and
medium-sized firms is an entrepreneurial strategy.
Essentially, these firms expand into international
markets to pursue new opportunities by leveraging their current resources, capabilities, and competencies. Therefore, Lu and Beamish’s research
adds another dimension to the developing field
of international entrepreneurship. Their findings
support the arguments that exporting does little
to create value. Rather, the more entrepreneurial
actions accompanying direct investments in the
markets entered created value in the small and
medium-sized companies. As argued earlier, entry
into new international markets allows the firm to
learn and the development and diffusion of this
knowledge creates dynamic capabilities and competencies (Lei et al., 1996; Teece et al., 1997;
Luo, 2000).
Robinson and McDougall in this special issue
explain the importance of IPOs. During 1989–
999, $350.81 billion were invested in IPOs. There
were $69.2 billion invested in IPOs in 1999 alone.
Robinson and McDougall’s sample was composed
of IPO new venture firms. Similarly, Certo,
Covin, Daily, and Dalton in this special issue
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

examine the process of wealth creation and retention in IPOs through the practice of underpricing.
Given their results, entrepreneurial firms may
wish to consider using a smaller investment banking firm and to include more insiders on the
board, as both reduced the amount of IPO underpricing.
The other articles in this special issue examine
exploitation of complementary assets (Rothaermel),
different types of learning with company-owned
and franchised operations (Sorenson and
Sørensen), the effects of internal capabilities,
social capital (external networks) and knowledge
acquisition (Lee, Lee and Pennings; Yli-Renko,
Autio and Sapienza), and the proactive development of alliances (Sarkar, Echambadi, and
Harrison), all with a focus on value creation.

CONCLUSIONS
The research published in this special issue draws
on theory from multiple fields, including
entrepreneurship, strategic management, organization theory, and economics. Some of the most
common theories invoked by the authors herein
are the resource-based view, organizational learning, Schumpeter’s arguments on entrepreneurial
activity, network theory, and to a lesser extent
transaction cost economics, efficient markets, and
contingency theory. New theory (cultural
entrepreneurship, as argued by Lounsbury and
Glynn) was developed and existing theories were
integrated in unique, value-adding ways (see Amit
and Zott, and Lu and Beamish). Both the new
theory and the unique extensions of existing
theories provide foundations for important
future research.
The empirical research presented herein was
largely centered in North America (mostly the
United States) but also included firms from Europe (United Kingdom and several European
countries) and Asia (Japan, Korea). As noted
above, managers from multiple countries largely
perceive entrepreneurial activity in similar ways
(Song et al., 1999). That said, Lee and Peterson
(2000) effectively argue that there are cultural
and institutional differences in the entrepreneurial
orientation across countries. In fact, research
shows that some of the most prominent entrepreneurial activity in the world is occurring in the
United States, Brazil, and Korea (two of which
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 479–491 (2001)

<-----Page 9----->488

M. A. Hitt et al.

are highlighted by the research in this special
issue) (Reynolds et al., 2000). Nonetheless, with
increasing globalization and the liberalization of
markets, entrepreneurial activity is being promoted throughout the world (e.g., South America,
Eastern Europe, China, and Russia, among
others). Entrepreneurship is popular partly
because it is perceived as an engine of socioeconomic growth and development, providing new
job opportunities and diverse goods and services
to the population (Reynolds et al., 2000). Thus,
enhanced entrepreneurship in a country leads to
greater national prosperity and competitiveness
(Zahra, 1999).
Although entrepreneurship has existed as a
practice and field of study for quite some time,
there is no commonly accepted and welldeveloped paradigm for research in the field
(Aldrich, 2000; Aldrich and Baker, 1997). We
believe that the integration of theory and research
in strategic management and entrepreneurship, as
suggested by the research highlighted in this special issue, will help to develop such a paradigm.
McGrath and MacMillan (2000) integrated the
thinking from both fields in developing their
entrepreneurial mindset concept. They argued that
those with an entrepreneurial mindset passionately
seek new opportunities (entrepreneurship). However, they also pursue only the best opportunities
and then pursue those with discipline (strategic
management). Evans and Wurster (1999) argue
that e-business firms need effective strategies to
survive, thereby confirming the importance of
integrating entrepreneurial and strategic management activities for wealth creation.
The integration of entrepreneurial thinking is
important for strategic management as well. In
fact, Hamel (2000) eloquently argues that managers can enhance the probability that new
wealth-creating strategies will emerge inside their
firms by dreaming, exploring, creating, pioneering, and inventing. Furthermore, Hamel
argues that if firms do not engage in these activities, other firms will do so and will take their
markets, customers, best employees, and finally
their assets. Therefore, we believe that the integration of theory and research in these two fields
has the potential to enrich the research and practice of both entrepreneurship and strategic management.
Thus, we present the concept of strategic
entrepreneurship and the research in this special
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

issue to both fields. Strategic entrepreneurship is
an important concept suggesting that new ventures and established firms need to be simultaneously entrepreneurial and strategic. The
research published in this special issue suggests
that these firms require certain types of critical
resources and capabilities to achieve this integration and to create wealth. The theoretical and
empirical contributions reported in this special
issue and the research questions they suggest we
hope will serve as a catalyst to further integrative
research that increases our understanding of strategic entrepreneurship as a path to wealth creation.
