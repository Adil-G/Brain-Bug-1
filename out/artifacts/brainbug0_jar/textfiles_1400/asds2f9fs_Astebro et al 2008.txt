The Role of Cognitive Biases
Abstract:
We find that approximately one third (29%) of independent inventors continue to spend money
and 51% continue to spend time on projects after receiving highly diagnostic advice to cease
effort. Using survey data from actual inventors, this paper studies the role of overconfidence,
optimism, and the sunk-cost bias in these decisions. We find that inventors are more
overconfident and optimistic than the general population. We also find that optimism and past
expenditures increased perseverance after being told to quit, while overconfidence in judgment
ability had no effect. After being told to quit, optimists spend 166% more than pessimists and
those having already spent, for example, $10,000 spend another $10,000.

The expected internal rate of return to invention by independent inventors is negative and
switching to self-employment reduces lifetime earnings by 35% (Astebro, 2003; Hamilton, 2000)
Yet, inventors still invent and entrepreneurs still start new businesses. For example, in 2003 in
the United States, independent inventors represented approximately 15% of the creators of
patented inventions, a significant proportion (USPTO, 2004) 1 . If these activities have lower
expected returns than the 2nd best alternative, why do inventors invent and entrepreneurs start
new businesses?
One reason that has been offered is that entrepreneurs are unrealistic optimists and that
they greatly overestimate their abilities and likelihood of success (Arabsheibani, de Meza,
Maloney, & Pearson, 2000). Others conclude that entrepreneurs are strongly motivated by nonpecuniary benefits (Blanchflower & Oswald, 1998; Frey & Benz, 2002; Hamilton, 2000), others
raise the possibility that inventors are “skewness lovers” who are holding out for the small
chance to “strike it rich” (Åstebro, 2003). Rather than look at entrepreneurs, we examine
independent inventors decision making and why a significant number of these inventors
continue spending time and money on projects after obtaining highly diagnostic advice to
terminate their efforts.
This population provides an excellent quasi-experimental design where we can study the
effect of decision-biases “in the wild” on a unique pool of decision makers under relatively
controlled conditions. In order to explain why many inventors 1 continue to throw good money
after bad, we evaluate three of the most robust of decision making biases pointed out in previous
research: overconfidence, optimism and the sunk-cost bias. We examine how these three biases
1

In Canada, evidence points to an even more significant proportion of independent inventors. By the end of the
1970s approximately 42% of patented inventions of Canadian origin originated with individuals, a finding at least
partially explained by Canada’s reliance on firms in resource-intensive sectors that have low R&D activity (Amesse
et al., 1991.)

<-----Page 3----->Inventor Perseverance
affect two real and economically important decisions: how much money and time to spend on
further development after obtaining advice to stop. We also examine differences between the
inventor population and a matched sample drawn from the general population with respect to
their degree of overconfidence and optimism.
Three Common Decision-Making Biases
Overconfidence, optimism, and the sunk-cost bias have been shown to be important
predictors of decision-making errors in a number of experimental studies and across various
contexts. Some of these common biases have also been offered as the reasons for why people
enter into entrepreneurship. For instance, Camerer and Lovallo (1999) show that students in an
experiment forecasted below zero profits due to excess entry, but entered anyway and were more
likely to enter when they performed well on a skills test. They explain this as an optimistic bias
coupled with a neglect of the behavioral intent of others. In a similar experiment Moore and Cain
(2004) show that entrants are greater optimists when the skill test is easy, thereby inducing
greater rates of entry and lower post-entry profits. These authors go on to explain that the excess
entry and low returns in industries such as restaurants and convenience stores are caused by
excess optimism coupled with perceived task simplicity. For this study, we hypothesize that
optimism will play a role when an inventor is estimating the expected return from his or her
invention, while overconfidence will play a role when he or she is evaluating his or her skill at
being able to successfully develop an invention.
We also predict that previous expenditures on an invention will drive an irrational
escalation of commitment to a project. This is particularly damaging to inventors who receive
advice to terminate development. This is not related to optimism over the payoffs to the
invention, or overconfidence in judging the probability of success, rather it is simply a function

4

<-----Page 4----->Inventor Perseverance
of past expenditures. Each of these effects on the decision to continue will be expanded on
below.
Optimism. Many people display a consistent belief that they are less likely than others to
suffer from bad events and more likely to experience positive events(Weinstein, 1980). Such
beliefs lead people to overestimate positive outcomes and underestimate negative outcomes. This
optimistic bias has been shown across many domains, cultures, and age groups (Weinstein &
Klein, 1995). Research has shown that entrepreneurs (who often start out as inventors) are more
optimistic than employees about their future earnings, even though they actually realize lower
earnings (Arabsheibani et al., 2000). We believe that inventors will suffer from a similar
decision-making bias as entrepreneurs and that inventors will also be more optimistic than a
cross-section of similar people selected from the general population.
Our argument is one of self-selection and follows that made by de Meza and Southey
(1996): because of the inherent unpredictability of returns from invention only the extremely
optimistic will choose to exert effort on such activities. In addition, we rely on Weinstein (1980)
who argues that two conditions must be fulfilled for an optimistic bias to arise: a) the event is
perceived as controllable, and b) people have some degree of commitment or emotional
investment in the outcome. Both conditions are likely to occur for inventors. Our hypotheses also
build on research by Taylor and her colleagues (Taylor & Lobel, 1989) who find less realistic
expectations about events the individual believes they can control, versus less optimistic
expectations about events the individual cannot affect. We believe that since inventing is largely
an individual effort, inventors will believe that they have control of the innovation process.
Hypothesis 1: Independent inventors are more optimistic than the general population.
An optimistic bias would raise the perceived expected return on an invention, either by an
increased perceived probability of success and/or by an increased subjective expected return
5

<-----Page 5----->Inventor Perseverance
conditional on succeeding to commercialize the invention. This would raise the subjective
expected value of continuing with the project and tend to make inventors spend more on their
projects. In line with this hypothesis, Cooper et al. (Cooper, Woo, & Dunkelberg, 1988) found
that 81% of all entrepreneurs believe their chance of success to be 70% or above, while in
actuality 2/3 of businesses fail within the first four years.
Furthermore, optimism has been found to be quite resistant to many debiasing
interventions such as making people aware of the risks, changing the presentation mode of the
risks, changing the intensity of the risks, and generating reasons why these risks might occur (see
Weinstein & Klein, 1995 for a review of these studies). Consistent with the idea that debiasing
optimists is difficult, we propose that optimistic inventors would pay little attention to advice
that asks them to break their behavior and stop spending more. Since we are only interested in
the decision to continue in the face of receiving advice to cease efforts, we do not make any
predictions about the effect of optimism on those that receive advice to continue, since in this
case continuing is the correct decision. We extend previous research by not simply measuring
beliefs, but by measuring actual behavior.
Hypothesis 2: Inventors with higher levels of optimism will be more likely to continue
spending time and money after receiving advice to stop activity.
Overconfidence. Overconfidence is considered one of the most robust of all decision
making biases (DeBondt & Thaler, 1995). Individuals display overconfidence in two ways, both
representing an inflated sense of accuracy or ability in a specific domain. The first display of
overconfidence is the use of too narrow a credible interval when making predictions. For
example, when asked to create an interval such that there is a 90% chance that they are correct,
people often set intervals that contain the correct value only 50% of the time (Lichtenstein,
Fischhoff, & Phillips, 1977). Overconfident individuals are also shown to overestimate their

6

<-----Page 6----->Inventor Perseverance
accuracy on a general knowledge test. These same researchers found that individuals, who
thought they were right 80% of the time were, on average, only correct 60% of the time. It is also
interesting to note that experience does not necessarily make people more accurate, but it does
make them more confident in their ability (Camerer & Johnson, 1991). Overconfident forecasts
have been documented across a variety of decision-making situations and decision-makers
(Griffin & Tversky, 1992), and we expect that inventors forecasting the success of their
invention would also display overconfidence.
Overconfidence may be such a robust phenomenon because of the many potential causes
for it found in the decision making literature. Early work on overconfidence hypothesized that a
lack of meta-knowledge was the reason for overconfidence (Oskamp, 1965). Another source of
overconfidence arises from a phenomenon known as the confirmation bias (Jonas, Schulz-Hardt,
Frey, & Thelen, 2001; Klayman, 1995; Klayman & Ha, 1987; Koriat, Lichtenstein, & Fischhoff,
1980). A third source of overconfidence comes from ease of recall biases (Kahneman & Tversky,
1973). We expect that all of these potential sources of overconfidence will be present in the
population of inventors.
If an inventor has inappropriately high beliefs in his ability to bring a product to market,
this will raise the subjective expected value of continuing with the project. There are two
hypotheses originating from this prediction. First, because of the inflated subjective expected
value to invention held by overconfident individuals we expect a self-selection effect introducing
higher levels of overconfidence among inventors compared to a cross-section of similar people
selected from the general population.
Second, we expect that the inflated expected value to invent held by overconfident
individuals will make an overconfident inventor more likely to spend additional time or money

7

<-----Page 7----->Inventor Perseverance
on developing the invention, even when they are advised to stop. Even while the overconfident
inventors may use Bayesian updating taking into account advice to stop, which will then reduce
the subjective expected value, those with greater overconfidence will have stronger priors that
will weigh more favorably in terms of continuing with development efforts. As with optimism,
we are making no prediction for those that receive positive advice since continuing in this case is
the correct decision.
Hypothesis 3: Independent inventors are more overconfident than the general population.
Hypothesis 4: Inventors with higher levels of overconfidence will be more likely to
continue spending time and money after receiving advice to stop activity.
It should be noted that we believe that overconfidence and optimism are different, even
though many have claimed that they are at least highly correlated, while others have even
questioned whether they are different constructs. In this research, we believe that optimism is a
more global construct, in other words, a general feeling that good things will happen to a person.
Overconfidence on the other hand would apply to an inventor’s perceived ability rather than an
overall measure of belief in the expected occurrence of positive outcomes. Furthermore, we posit
that optimism has a direct effect inflating the subjective expected value of inventing, while the
effect of overconfidence is indirect by first affecting the inventor’s sense of beliefs that he or she
is able to bring the product to the market. Since the second effect is more indirect it may be more
difficult to detect in this study.
Sunk Costs. One final decision making bias that we predict has an effect on inventors’
investment behavior is that of commitment to sunk costs. If inventors who have committed funds
to an invention tend to increase their commitment to the project even when the expected
marginal costs are higher than the marginal benefits then they are influenced by a phenomenon
alternatively called the escalation of commitment or sunk costs bias.

8

<-----Page 8----->Inventor Perseverance
One argument advanced to explain the escalation phenomenon is the concept of selfjustification; where an individual stays committed to justify a past decision (Brockner & Rubin,
1985; Staw, 1976). Another argument is based on the psychology of sunk costs which argues that
people are more likely to spend money on a project simply because money has been spent on it
in the past (Arkes & Blummer, 1985). Other researchers have challenged studies on sunk costs
arguing that information about sunk costs was confounded with information about level of
project completion (Boehne & Paese, 2000; Conlon & Garland, 1993; Keil, Mann, & Rai, 2000;
Moon, 2001). Nevertheless, the sunk costs bias has been shown to be persistent. For example,
Tan and Yates (2002) show that escalation effects occur among experienced participants even
when explicit future costs and benefits are provided to them.
Our quasi-experimental design takes advantage of the fact that a recommendation to
terminate indicates that the marginal benefits of continuing are expected to be very low. We
would thus expect low invention quality to lead to no post-advice investments, unless the
decision-maker is biased. High-quality inventions that are recommended to go forward, on the
other hand, should rationally have both higher pre and post-advice investments. For those that
receive advice to continue it is likely that pre and post-advice investments are positively
correlated, simply because these are good inventions to invest in. We therefore only formulate a
hypothesis regarding the sunk cost bias for those that receive advice to terminate their projects.
For this subset we interpret any remaining effect of pre-advice investment on post advice
investments as an indication of sunk costs.
Hypothesis 5: Higher levels of pre-advice investment will lead to higher levels of postadvice investments for inventors advised to terminate their projects.

Data Source
We gathered information from actual inventors who had sought advice from the
Inventors’ Assistance Program (IAP) at the Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC). This centre was
initially established in 1976 at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada to help
evaluate early stage inventions and the likelihood of market success (Åstebro & Bernhardt, 1999;
Åstebro & Gerchak, 2001). By 1994 the Canadian IAP had a very strong presence as a
trustworthy and dominating supplier of unbiased invention evaluation in Canada. The system
they used to evaluate inventions was developed by Professor Gerald Udell at the Oregon
Innovation Center in 1974 as critical for the success of inventions and was based on accumulated
innovation research at that time (Udell, 1989).
The Canadian IAP evaluates potential entrepreneurs and their projects on 37 different
cues and provides advice on how and whether to continue. To have a project evaluated, the
entrepreneur fills out a questionnaire and pays a moderate fee ($250 USD in 1994, $750 USD by
2001). In addition to background information about the entrepreneur, the questionnaire asks for a
brief description of the idea and supplementary documentation such as patent applications,
sketches and test reports. An in-house analyst compares the project with other similar projects in
their library of previous reviews and other various databases. Personal contact with the
entrepreneur beyond the provided documentation is avoided by the analyst to ensure that these
discussions do not bias the evaluation. In addition to scores on the 37 cues, the analyst also
derives an overall score for the project using intuitive judgment and assigns one of five possible
scores shown in Table 1.
-------------------Insert Table 1 about here
--------------------

10

<-----Page 10----->Inventor Perseverance
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 1 report the frequency distribution of the IAP’s overall rating
from a survey conducted prior to this study (Åstebro, 2003). A majority of ventures (75% with
rating “D” or “E”) were advised to terminate efforts Two per cent received the most favorable
overall score “A”, 4% were given an intermediate positive recommendation “B”, and 19% were
advised that the project is suitable to launch as a limited (i.e. part-time) effort “C”. Column 6
reports similar frequencies found in our study, with 1% receiving an “A” rating, 7% receiving
“B”, 15% receiving “C”, 74% receiving a “D”, and 3% receiving an “E”. We code “D” and “E”
as ‘cease activity’ ratings.
Table 1 also reports the probability of commercialization for each of the different overall
scores (column 4). As seen, the probability of commercialization is strongly correlated with the
IAP advice, with a clear difference between those rated D and E (advised to stop) and those rated
A, B or C. These data provide evidence of the high diagnosticity of the advice. Other research
has shown that both positive and negative advice have similar prediction accuracy rates. In a
survey of 559 projects the IAP correctly forecasted 75.8% of the successes and 79.3% of the
failures (Åstebro & Chen, 2002). This means that both types of advice (continue and cease) are
approximately equally reliable. Column 5 shows that the advice is highly diagnostic of the
financial returns conditional on commercializing the invention. None of those rated E reached
the market so returns for those cannot be calculated and the return among those rated D was 28.5%. Given this high level of diagnosticity, inventors who receive negative advice (e.g. a “D”
or an “E”) should cease developmental efforts and move on to other activities rather than
spending additional time and money on an unlikely success.
While the inventors did not know the base rate accuracy of the IAP during the study
period, we believe that inventors would not willingly pay a fee of up to $1,000 if they did not

11

<-----Page 11----->Inventor Perseverance
believe in the value of the advice. This payment is large in relation to the total amount of money
they have put into the invention’s development up to that point (on average Cdn. $6,755.)
Outlays of such a large amount for the advice signifies that inventors must have some belief in
its value, ex ante.
The phenomenon we are studying can be seen in Table 2 that shows the spending of
resources for inventors who were given advice to cease effort (rating D or E). The first column
shows the ranges of percentages that inventors spent after obtaining the advice to cease
development. The next two columns show the fraction of inventors who spend that percentage of
resources. Even though most inventors who receive the advice to terminate their efforts follow
that advice (71% and 49% for money and time respectively), a significant proportion of
inventors continue to invest time and money in these endeavors. That is, ex post, some pay no or
little attention to the advice to stop. We expect that differences in overconfidence, optimism and
the sunk cost bias across inventors can at least partially explain these behaviors.
-------------------Insert Table 2 about here
-------------------Survey Population
Using records from the Canadian Innovation Center, we developed a list of 5,008
inventors who had submitted ideas for IAP review between 1994 and 2001. Of this number, we
were able to trace 1,352 current addresses. Of these, 1,272 addresses led to actual contacts. The
Survey Research Center at the University of Waterloo was able to interview 830 respondents,
780 of which fully completed the survey for an overall adjusted response rate of 61%. The
adjusted response rate is calculated as the contact rate (1,272/1,352) multiplied by the
cooperation rate (830/1,272). 2

<-----Page 12----->Inventor Perseverance
To examine whether inventors have greater decision-making biases than the general
population, we also obtained telephone survey data from a comparison pool of 300 Canadians.
The sample frame was a set of random household telephone numbers, stratified by province. The
sample was selected to approximate the distribution of gender, age, and work experience
obtained in the inventor sample. Sample quotas were set to mirror the distribution of the inventor
sample obtained approximately halfway through the survey of inventors. There was some drift in
the population of inventors as the inventor survey was completed making the matched sample
somewhat younger and more tilted towards males than the final inventor sample. Data are
displayed in Table 3, upper panel.
Dependent Measures
We measure the money personally spent by inventors after receiving the IAP report by
their own self-reported R&D cash outlays. We asked for all costs for product development,
marketing research, making of prototypes, etc. We further asked respondents to anchor these
expenditures in time to the year in which they spent the majority of the development costs, in
order to normalize all of these expenses to 2003 dollars using the Canadian CPI. To measure
time investment, we ask the inventor “What percentage of that time was spent after the invention
was evaluated by the IAP” where the time refers to that “…spent actually working on the
invention” as opposed to calendar time. As can be seen in Table 2, inventors are more likely to
continue spending time than money after being advised to cease efforts. We speculate that if
inventors are employed, as most in this sample are when inventing, the time spent on inventive
pursuits outside of working hours carries low or no opportunity cost. Furthermore, the inventor is
operating in an environment where he or she is not likely to be able to sell his or her inventive
abilities on a spot market.

<-----Page 13----->Inventor Perseverance
Since the effort may well have a low opportunity cost, the time spent, as opposed to the
money spent, may reflect many other decision making biases or non-monetary factors, such as
the intrinsic value of inventing. Research has further shown that individuals find it difficult to
accurately account for sunk time (Soman, 2001). Time may be a noisy measure for both these
reasons.
To reduce heteroskedasticity we transformed the raw data on expenditures and time using
the natural logarithm as the base. The distribution functions for the log of expenditures and time
spent, even without considering the large mass points at zero, are still skew after these
transformations, as indicated in Table 3, middle panel.
The dependent variables log(post-advice R&D) and log(time) are positively skew with
long upper (right) tails, while the measures of sunk costs [log(pre-advice R&D) and log(time)]
are negatively skew, with long lower (left) tails. All distributions with the log transform have
heavier tails than the standard normal. We therefore also tried more advanced transformations of
the expenditure and time distributions. We performed regressions where the expenditure and
time distributions were brought to zero skewness using the Box-Cox power transformation.
Results were qualitatively similar as those reported and we chose to report results with the
lognormal transformation for ease of interpretation and clarity.
Independent Measures
Optimism. To measure optimism we chose six optimism items from the 10 item
International Personality Item Pool personal attributes survey (Oregon Research Institute 2001;
Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994). 3 Two example statements are “I just know that I will be a
success” and “I am often in a bad mood”. For each item the respondents were asked the extent to
3

Pretests results indicated respondents’ difficulty with the items “I feel blue’ and ‘I dislike myself’.
After careful deliberations on the possible effects of the two items on the questionnaire response and
reliability, we decided to exclude these items and two other items that are matched with them.

14

<-----Page 14----->Inventor Perseverance
which they agree/disagree on a five-point scale, with 1 representing strongly disagree and 5
representing strongly agree. The order of the five items was randomized across subjects and
items for this variable were mixed randomly with all other items used. We averaged the item
scores for this variable obtaining a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.67 (inventor and general population
pooled).
Overconfidence. Consistent with previous research (Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Griffin &
Tversky, 1992) we measured overconfidence as the degree to which an individual expects that
they have made a correct judgment on a judgment task divided by the average degree of correct
judgments in the population. We ask respondents to judge which one of two cities that has the
larger population and to indicate the confidence in their judgment being correct on a half-range
probability scale (50% to100% certain). Five city comparisons were elicited; three pairs of cities
were Canadian, while two pairs were foreign. The order of the five comparisons was randomized
across subjects. The overconfidence measure was constructed as
overconfid ence =

∑ ( aik − bk ) / 5 ,
k

where aik is respondent i’s estimated confidence of being right on judgment k and bk is the
average percent correct choice of judgment k in the population. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale
across the five city size judgments was 0.70 (inventor and general population pooled).
Sunk Costs. As a proxy measure we use the natural log of the amount of personal
expenditures (cash or time) before obtaining the advice.
Control Variables
A number of other variables could, potentially, be associated with our outcome variables
and were thus examined. These variables have been raised in previous literature as possible
explanations for why certain individuals become entrepreneurs. The next four variables were all

15

<-----Page 15----->Inventor Perseverance
obtained by asking respondents to agree or disagree with a set of statements on a five point scale.
The scores were then averaged to come up with a common factor.
Risk Attitudes. People with higher risk tolerance might be more likely to continue
spending time and money on the inventions. We used seven items of risk taking aspects from the
Jackson Personality Inventory (Jackson, 1977) that were most germane to the domain of
inventing (Begley & Boyd, 1987; Busenitz & Barney, 1997). We obtained a Cronbach’s alpha of
0.60 (inventor and general population pooled).
Self-efficacy. During the invention process inventors may develop perceptions of
competence and beliefs in their capacity to perform the specific tasks they face . A selfefficacious inventor is more likely to perceive the feasibility of his invention’s success (Bandura,
1986, 1997). We used the self-efficacy items from Markman, Balkin, & Barron (2002);
Cronbach’s alpha = 0.82 (inventor and general population pooled).
Opportunity Recognition. Our final personality variable was adapted from work on
opportunity recognition (Gaglio & Katz, 2001). These authors hypothesized that entrepreneurs
would be better than the general population at recognizing new ideas or ways in which existing
items could be improved. A four-item scale with statements such as “I often find products that I
think can be improved upon” produced a scale with Cronbach’s alpha = 0.68 (inventor and
general population pooled).
Intrinsic Motivation. We had reason to believe that some people may invent because they
enjoy it. Therefore, we created a 7-item scale regarding the intrinsic motivation to invent after
reviewing the work of Deci, Koestner, and Ryan (1999). This scale had a Cronbach’s alpha =
0.80 and was only obtained for inventors.

16

<-----Page 16----->Inventor Perseverance
Personal/demographic Characteristics. Following Camerer and Johnson (1991) we
considered that more experienced inventors may be more confident in their estimation of the
success of their inventions. Information was collected on the number of years the inventor had
been working on developing inventions and the total number of inventions that the inventor had
worked on in his/her lifetime. We also measured education, being concerned that education
could proxy for the availability of outside job options that could pay more (i.e. more educated
people have more job opportunities) and thus be less likely to persist when recommended to stop.
Descriptive statistics on dependent and the independent variables found to be of statistical
relevance are displayed in Table 3 and Table 4 contains a correlation matrix.
Results
We first report tests on differences between the general and inventor populations
(n=1,130). The inventors reported to have higher degree of optimism t(1,128) = 2.48, p < .01,
and overconfidence t(1,128) = 1.97, p < .05 than the general population, supporting our
hypotheses regarding inventor personality. Furthermore, inventors reported to have much greater
risk seeking propensity t(1,128) = 5.76, p < .001, higher self-efficacy t(1,128) = 2.85, p < .01,
and greater opportunity seeking tendency t(1,128) = 7.52, p < .001 than the general population.
Data on optimism and overconfidence are reported in Table 3, upper panel.
We analyzed differences in cognitive biases between inventors receiving positive and
negative advice (n=758). Inventors with a positive evaluation were more optimistic t(756) =
2.77, p < .01 and risk seeking t(756) = 3.17, p < .01, but were neither more nor less confident,
self-efficacious, opportunity seeking, or intrinsically motivated (all p’s n.s.). Data on optimism
and overconfidence for inventors are reported in Table 3, lower panel. While many of the
differences reported above are significant they may not be economically relevant. We therefore

17

<-----Page 17----->Inventor Perseverance
continue analyzing how these established biases might affect real decisions. First, we report
some univariate analysis on the decision variables of interest.
----------------------------------Insert Table 3 About Here
---------------------------------------------------------------------Insert Table 4 About Here
-----------------------------------Inventors personally spent an average of $39,694 (Std. Dev. $256,900, maximum $5
million) on their inventions, showing that these inventions involved substantial development
efforts. 4 The inventions in the sample appear typical of independent inventions. A plurality of
the inventions were consumer-oriented, including inventions for household and general
consumer use (33%) and sports and leisure applications (27%). Successful consumer-oriented
inventions included a new milk container design, a washable sanitary pad, and a home security
light timer that imitates typical use. Other inventions had business applications, including some
that involved high technology (8%) or industrial equipment (14%). These inventions included an
aligner and printer for photographic proofs, a tractor-trailer fairing that enhances fuel efficiency,
a re-usable plug to insert in wooden hydroelectric poles after testing for rot, and a computerized
and mechanically integrated tree harvester. Thus the inventions varied substantially in market
potential. Those that were advised to terminate development efforts reported spending less (M =
$3,587, SD = $55,418) after receiving their advice than those who were advised to continue (M =
$28,523, SD = $94,856), t(756) = 5.58, p < .001.
It is illustrative to examine the distribution of spending: 50% of all inventors spend less
than $234 before the review, indicating that a majority of inventors have not done much
development work before approaching the IAP. This also supports that these inventors believe

18

<-----Page 18----->Inventor Perseverance
ex-ante that the evaluation has value. As indicated earlier 71% spent $0 after a negative review,
indicating a majority of inventors stop development efforts on the advice of the IAP. Considering
time spent developing their ideas, inventors spend on average 16% of the development time after
receiving a negative review, and 49% spend 1% or less of their time on the inventions after a
negative review.
Multivariate analysis of the Decisions to Spend Time and Money.
The distribution functions for expenditures and time spent both contain large densities at
zero (Table 2.) This indicates that there may be two decisions involved: a decision to continue,
and a decision on how much time and money to spend conditional on deciding to continue.
However, a likelihood-ratio test marginally rejected that the two equations were independent t(1,
N = 758) = 3.63, p = 0.06, indicating that it might not be useful to estimate two equations jointly.
An alternative approach is to estimate a censored latent-variable model of expenditures (time)
with the dependent variable censored at the value 0 (Tobin, 1958). We settled on the second
modeling alternative as it turned out to produce estimates that were more robust to alternative
specifications.
For this analysis we had complete data from 669 (81%) of the respondents with respect to
R&D expenditures and 677 respondents with respect to time. 5 We include measures of optimism,
overconfidence, sunk costs, and experience with inventing to examine the tendency to spend
money and time after receiving feedback.
Insignificant control variables were dropped (risk attitudes, self-efficacy, opportunity
seeking, intrinsic motivation, education.) Results in Table 5 are presented in two panels. The top

5

There were missing archival data on the ratings for about 100 observations. Respondents answering
“don’t know” on the amount of post-advice R&D and time spent were dropped from the analysis.
Respondents answering “don’t know” on independent variables had these data imputed assuming
missing data at random.

<-----Page 19----->Inventor Perseverance
panel reports coefficient estimates for those receiving negative advice; column 1 reports effects
on the amount of post-advice R&D expenditures, column 2 is the same regression with time
spent as the dependent variable. Panel 2 contains the same regressions for those receiving
positive advice.
----------------------------------Insert Table 5 About Here
-----------------------------------We found no effects for overconfidence, while optimism had one economically
meaningful and significant effect in the regressions. Above-average optimists that receive
negative advice have posterior expenditures 166% higher than below-average optimists (column
1). Optimism did not affect expenditures when obtaining positive advice and did not affect time
spent after advice. That is, those who are optimistic tend to continue spending money after being
advised to stop, while those advised to continue are not affected by optimism, supporting our
hypotheses regarding optimism.
Sunk costs had the effects anticipated, both for time and for money, as observed in Panel
1 of Table 5. There was approximately a one-to-one correspondence between previous resource
commitments and those committed after obtaining a negative evaluation. That is, when advised
to stop, those who already had spent for example $10,000, spent another $10,000. The only
situation where there was a lower effect was the effect of money spent before the feedback on
time spent afterwards. This coefficient was approximately one fourth the size of the other effects.
One could argue that optimism would have an effect on people obtaining positive advice,
as research has shown that pessimists tend to discount positive information. Since we found
people high on optimism more likely to continue efforts when given negative advice, it could be
that pessimists receiving positive advice would be less likely to continue. However, our findings

20

<-----Page 20----->Inventor Perseverance
suggests that optimism only seem to kick in when inventors face large adversities such as
receiving advice to stop.
One control variable that had important effects was the experience with inventing.
Compared to those with less than three years of experience, inventors with three or more years of
experience developing inventions spent 301 percent more money and 175 percent more time
after being advised to stop (columns 1 and 2). The effects of prior experience were on the other
hand not significant when obtaining positive advice. (Results did not change qualitatively when
we used as a proxy the total number of inventions worked on by the inventor instead of the
number of years of experience inventing.) A summary of the hypotheses and their results are
shown in Table 6.
----------------------------------Insert Table 6 About Here
-----------------------------------General Discussion
One key finding is that as many have speculated, independent inventors are “different”
than other people. We found that inventors are more optimistic and overconfident than the
general population. These effects are consistent with our belief that only extremely optimistic
and/or overconfident individuals self-select into inventing because of the low expected returns.
Our position is that inventors will be optimistic about future returns and overconfident about
their abilities to ensure success. They were also more risk seeking, opportunity seeking, and had
higher levels of self-efficacy than the general population.
We also found a significant and positive effect of optimism on spending for those who
had received advice to cease activities. For optimism, there is a possible signal effect where
optimism may attract outside financing, in-kind efforts, and other resources that are useful to a
venture. If convincing others to contribute by signaling high abilities is beneficial to the venture,
21

<-----Page 21----->Inventor Perseverance
then self-deceptive optimism may be the key to most effectively produce such signals
(Arabsheibani et al., 2000). However, we do not believe that this is the mechanism at work. If
this were the case then all inventors would have expenditures a function of optimism, which is
not the case in our data. We observe that only those obtaining negative advice are affected by
optimism in their spending behavior. We interpret these findings to show that a high level of
optimism may act to keep inventors going in the face of adversity (Armor & Taylor, 1998,
2002).
Our results also indicate inventors to be strongly affected by the self justification/ sunk
cost bias. The more money and time spent on the invention before the advice from the IAP, the
more time and money spent after the evaluation. While this is not technically a bias for those
receiving positive advice, those that receive advice to stop should be spending no additional
resources. For these inventors, a positive coefficient on sunk cost and sunk time demonstrates a
sunk cost bias.
That we found no effects for overconfidence on the decision to continue and on the
amount of resources allocated was somewhat surprising in view of the large and robust effects
often reported in the literature. One potential explanation for this deals with the possible
existence of two general “types” of overconfidence: confidence in judgment and in abilities
(Burson, Larrick, & Klayman, 2006; Kruger, 1999; Kruger & Dunning, 1999; Yates, 1990.) Our
measure using city pair comparisons likely captured the former, and therefore was able to
distinguish between inventors and the general population. However, it may be the second type of
overconfidence that causes inventors to move forward with their inventions after being advised
to stop. If this is the case, our measure would not capture it.

22

<-----Page 22----->Inventor Perseverance
One indication that overconfidence in ability does affect expenditure is the observed
effect of inventive experience. We expected most experienced inventors to have made a few
costly mistakes in the past and therefore more appreciative of expert advice. However, the results
suggest that similar to being optimistic, experience makes inventors more likely to disregard
outside expert advice and place more weight on their own assessment of the quality of their
invention. Those with greater inventive experience had greater expenditures after obtaining
advice to stop, which is consistent with our hypothesis. We interpret this similarly to Camerer
and Johnson (Camerer & Johnson, 1991) in that greater experience makes inventors more
confident in their abilities, but no better at evaluating the promise of their invention.
A second potential explanation of the zero correlation between the overconfidence
measure and expenditures is that extremely overconfident inventors may not approach the IAP
since they believe (incorrectly) that their invention will be a success, and thus additional
information is of little value. This could reduce the range of overconfidence in our sample and
lower the chance of finding an effect.
There is a common thread that the effects of the decision-making biases of optimism and
escalation of commitment play in conditioning the behavior by inventors who obtain the advice
to stop. There is also a parallel effect of inventive experience which may indicate overconfidence
in judgment. The three biases seem all to induce a coping mechanism which is to put little or no
weight on the review, and instead greater belief in their own judgment. Therefore, there is an
interesting change between the ex ante and ex post value of the IAP advice if it is negative. Ex
ante it is valued (since they pay for it), ex post it is not (or at least heavily discounted.) All three
decision-making biases (optimism, escalated commitment and experience induced
overconfidence) seems to lead to higher distrust in the review if it is negative.

23

<-----Page 23----->Inventor Perseverance
Limitations and Future Research
One potential drawback of our methodology is that we relied on self-reports of past
activities. This may have created a hindsight bias in recall which might depend on the outcome
of any additional money spent (e.g. commercialization). For example, those who continued to
spend money and later succeeded although advised to stop may have become generally more
optimistic at survey time because they succeeded with their invention – causing a spurious
correlation between optimism and post-advice expenditures. We do not believe this to be a
significant problem. First, only a small percentage of those advised to stop who continued
actually did succeed in commercializing their inventions (6.9%). Second, if there was such a
recall bias it should appear more clearly among those advised to continue since a larger fraction
among those individuals actually succeed. But we do not find a correlation between optimism
and expenditures for these.
Some form of socially desirable response may have occurred as well, since inventors may
not want to admit that they spent additional time and money on an invention that eventually
failed. We believe that if this were the case, it would simply depress the number reported after
receiving negative advice. This would make it harder rather than easier to find an effect, so we
are not as concerned about this.
We believe that this sample is representative of serious inventors who are looking to
commercialize their inventions. Informal surveys by the CIC suggest that nine of ten inventors
who approach the Canadian IAP abort the submission process after considering the examination
fee to be too high, suggesting that inventions with low prospects are excluded from the sample.
This is a positive way to trim the sample, as it likely limits our sample population to only serious
inventors. There may however be some additional uncontrolled sampling biases. For example,
inventors who are already well informed about the commercial prospects of their invention may
24

<-----Page 24----->Inventor Perseverance
consider the additional information from the IAP to be of marginal value. This could imply that
the quality of inventions in our sample is biased, although it could be misstated in either
direction.
While both effects are a possibility, we do not feel that it damages the results we find
within those inventors being advised to cease effort. Another limitation of our study is that we
are drawing conclusions about inventors who are at an early stage of their development process.
They are a subset of all inventors/technological entrepreneurs, where the subjective expected
value of their invention is at least that of the examination fee, which was approximately U.S.
$250 in 1994 and U.S. $750 in 2001. We make no claims that the sample is representative of the
general population of inventors. However, there is no alternative efficient method of obtaining a
representative sample of inventors and our method allows us to efficiently obtain a reasonably
large sample that is likely to represent a fairly broad cross-section of independent inventors.
Conclusion
This paper is important because it provides some plausible reasons for the excess entry
and concomitant observed negative expected rate of return for inventors. Excess entry has been
observed in several experimental studies. Some have argued that overconfidence in one’s own
skills and the neglect of others’ skills and decisions cause excess entry (Camerer & Lovallo,
1999; Moore & Cain, 2004). While we do not find any evidence of this, it may be due to the two
suggestions made earlier regarding the measure of overconfidence used and the population
studied. Other researchers argue that excessive optimism is the main culprit (Arabsheibani et al.,
2000; de Meza & Southey, 1996). This claim is consistent with our findings. The magnitude of
the optimistic biases is quite large and on the same order as that obtained by Arabsheibani et al.,
(2000). We also find that the sunk cost bias is an important explanation of additional spending
when spending should be curtailed.
25

<-----Page 25----->Inventor Perseverance
This paper contributes to the decision making literature by adding more evidence of a
pervasive sunk cost bias, even among experienced inventors. In addition, it shows that while
optimism can be healthy for the psyche, it may lead people to spend money on losing
propositions. This paper contributes to innovation research by showing the effects of optimism
and the sunk cost bias on inventor effort. As inventive activity creates a net benefit to society,
understanding the factors that lead to the decision to continue on less than promising inventions
could provide a positive step in the better utilization of inventor efforts. Finally, this paper could
contribute to policies regarding how to more efficiently allocate inventive activities.
