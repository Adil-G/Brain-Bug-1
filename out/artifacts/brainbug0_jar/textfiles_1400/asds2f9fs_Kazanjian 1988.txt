RELATION OF DOMINANT PROBLEMS 

TO STAGES OF GROWTH 

IN TECHNOLOGY-BASED NEW VENTURES 

ROBERT K. KAZANJIAN 

University of Michigan 

Two studies investigating the growth patterns of new ventures are
presented. In the first study, a stage-of-growth model theorized to apply
specifically to technology-based new ventures was developed from two
cases. Stages are described as a configuration of organizational design
variables representing a firm's response to the sets of dominant problems it faces at sequential times. The second study explored relationships between stages of growth and a theorized pattern of dominant
problems using a data base of 105 firms. Partial support emerged for the
link between dominant problems and stages of growth.

Technology-based new ventures play an increasingly important role in
the development and commercialization of new products, processes, and
technologies. In fact, such organizations have been instrumental in the creation of entire industries such as personal computers, genetic engineering,
machine vision, and robotics. The popular press has given considerable
attention to the growth-related strategic and managerial problems of such
firms. Articles about the computer industry alone have addressed internal
organizational problems and transitions (Uttal, 1985), loss of market share
attributed to a hesitancy to embrace new technologies (Wiegner, 1986),and a
lack of focus on manufacturing efficiency (Wiegner, 1986).
However, little is known about how the models of organizational growth
and development found in the management literature and typically theorized to hold for all organizations apply to technology-based new ventures.
A better understanding of the growth patterns of such firms will sharpen the
descriptive power of management theories and ultimately advance our ability to influence organizational performance.

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
Traditionally, scholars have used a biological analog to explain the growth
patterns of organizations. The most recent examples are life-cycle perspectives on individual organizations (Kimberly & Miles, 1980) and on groups of
organizations (Hannan & Freeman, 1984; McKelvey & Aldrich, 1983).

A rlulnber of multistage models have been proposed in which predictable patterns in the growth of organizations are assumed to exist and to unfold
as discrete time periods best thought of as stages (Scott, 1970; Smith, Mitchell,
& Summer, 1985). Examples range from three-stage models (Blake, Avis, &
Mouton, 1966: Cooper, 1979; Smith et al., 1985) and four-stage models
(Hosmer, Cooper, & Vesper, 1977; Rhenman, 1973), to models of five or more
stages (Adizes, 1979; Miller 8r Friesen, 1984; Van d e Ven, Hudson, &
Schroeder, 1984). Reviewing much of this literature, Quinn and Cameron
(1983) integrated nine separate models into a summary model with four
major stages. A major strength of the literature on life-stage models is that it
adds to our understanding of the rather complex phenomenon of growth,
describing how growth happens and the effect that it has on organizations.
As it presently stands, however, work on growth has several shortcomings.
All stage-of-growth models can be seen as what Starbuck (1971) termed
metamorphosis models, i n that they describe problems organizations i n
differing circumstances are likely to encounter and the corresponding organizational forms likely to result. As its problems change, an organization
must alter its form accordingly. For example, Greiner (1972) explicitly viewed
the growth of organizations as a series of evolutions and revolutions precipitated by crises related to leadership, control, and coordination. Alternatively,
Chandler (1962) viewed stages of growth as responses to a firm's search for
new growth opportunities. In other metamorphosis models, an underlying
theory is implicit, but many such models lack theoretical explicitness and
rigor and offer little explanation of why the characteristics of a particular
stage of growth emerge. The determinants of a firm's position in a particular
stage of growth and the factors that precipitate a shift from one stage to
another are at best implied. This deficiency limits the ability of researchers
to conduct empirical tests and to explore the constructs further.
Second, as Kimberly noted, "there is no inevitable linear sequence of
stages in organizational life, although there may be remarkable similarities
among the developmental patterns of certain clusters of organizations" (1980:
7). Yet most models do not take into account the role of industry, technology,
and other situational variables. Their proponents seem to have postulated
them as applying to all organizations, regardless of context.
Finally, the work related to stage of growth has been overwhelmingly
conceptual and subject to challenge. For example, some scholars have seen
the concept of an organization developing through a series of predictable
stages as an overly simplistic view (Tornatsky et al., 1983). Miller (1981)
found that firms do not necessarily demonstrate an inexorable movement
through a linear sequence of stages but rather attain gestalts or patterns of
strategy, structure, and environment that may emerge for any number of
reasons. Romanelli and Tushman (1986) argued that firms evolve through
periods of convergence and divergence related more to technological shifts
in their industry than to issues of growth. Further, several authors have
proposed typologies that categorize organizations into a number of profiles

<-----Page 3----->1988

259

but suggest no developmental sequence among types (Gartner, 1985; Hosmer
et al., 1977).
The literature on stages of growth has little empirical basis for countering
such criticisms. The empirical work that has emerged in recent years (Miller
& Friesen, 1984; Smith et al., 1985; Van de Ven et al., 1984) has focused
primarily on differences in internal organizational characteristics across theorized stages. However, the researchers seem to have assumed a priori the
existence of stages.
To investigate the growth and developmental patterns of technologybased new ventures, I employed a multimethod research design intended to
address several criticisms of the literature on stages of growth.

STUDY ONE: DEVELOPING A GROUNDED BASE 

FOR THEORY BUILDING 

My initial step in studying the growth patterns of technology-based new
ventures was undertaking two case studies. In general, the theory-building
process associated with this research can most accurately be described as
inductive; it was similar in some respects to what Glaser and Strauss (1967)
termed grounded theorizing.

Methods
Both of the firms studied were manufacturers of computer-based office
products. After initial contact with the firms through a consultant, I defined
a research project to describe the growth experiences of each firm. One firm
was in a small town in rural eastern Pennsylvania. The other had operations
in central Florida. I collected all data. The case studies cover the histories of
the ventures from their creations through August 1979, when the interviews
were conducted. Considerable time was spent at each company in interviews with the chief executive, all managers who reported directly to him,
and the heads of each function and selected subunits. People who were early
employees of the firms and were still with them were also interviewed. To
provide balance, I also interviewed several employees of less than three
months and some individuals who had recently left the companies. In all,
over 60 managers and employees were interviewed at the two ventures. To
fully capture the richness of the data and to avoid biasing the findings
toward one theoretical construct or another, interviews were unstructured
and open ended. Inquiries centered around decisions, actions, problems,
and patterns of growth since the inception of the firms. Particular attention
was paid to how and why each organization took the form that it did over
time.
Detailed notes were kept from each interview and were regularly reviewed before later interviews to validate assertions across interviewees. I
gathered additional data from an archival review of documents like business
plans, organization charts, employee rosters, and internal memoranda. I then
integrated the interview notes and other data into histories, each approximately 50 typed pages in length. Each firm's CEO reviewed its history for

<-----Page 4----->260

accuracy. Interpretative disagreements between the CEOs, the other managers,
and me did emerge and were noted. In such instances I put both interpretations in the case study. Burgelman (1983) and Dean (1987) used a similar
method of data collection.
The following synopses of the cases provide some flavor of the firms'
experiences. The names of the organizations and of individuals have been
disguised at the request of the participating firms.
Alpha

The origins of Alpha are traced to 1974 and to Tom Kiley, the founder
and driving force of the firm. Working with semiconductor technology, he
developed what became one of the first commercial electronics-based office products in a market then relying on mechanical technologies.
By early 1976, the firm was primarily concerned with developing and
refining the product idea. In August, the firm had grown to 40 employees
and had completed a prototype of the product. It began manufacturing and
marketing efforts. At this point, little structure or formality existed and planning was limited to budgeting and financial forecasting.
Most of 1977 was dedicated to preparation for launching the product,
which entailed finalizing the marketing strategy and building a sales and
support organization. The firm announced and offered the product in January 1978, by which time it had about 500 employees. Initial demand exceeded projections, and growth in both revenues and the number of employees picked u p markedly.
From January 1978 to April 1979, the number of employees increased
from approximately 500 to 1,000. The firm hired many of those individuals
i n response to specific pressures and needs in functional areas. Each function faced a series of problems related to its specific tasks, which served as a
precipitating factor for the introduction of greater structure and rationality,
typically in the form of increased specialization or the addition of new
integrating and planning processes. At the end of this research, Alpha had
about 1,400 employees, three products, and five plants, all in the eastern
United States.
Beta

The genesis of the firm's low-cost fiber-optics-based product can be
traced to John Thomas, developer of the product and first president of Beta.
Starting i n 1969 with a series of small seed grants, the evolution of the
product from initial conception to the first contracted development work
took approximately two years and represented a transition from very informal product experimentation to the beginnings of the organization. In 1971,
Thomas developed a working prototype of the product on his own. Shortly
thereafter, after several rejected proposals, he gained financial backing, dedicated himself full-time to the firm, and hired several engineers. During the
prolonged start-up period, requiring several funding proposals, consultants

<-----Page 5----->1988

Kazanjian

261

handled the marketing, financial, and administrative functions on a contractual basis.
The product was announced and offered for sale in late 1973, and by
May 1974 demand exceeded manufacturing capacity. This was a period of
rather intense growth in which the firm experienced some highly focused
internal organizational problems. During this time many new positions were
created and filled.
In June 1977 a new president was brought on board as a result of pressures from investors concerning performance, and Thomas was appointed
chairman of the board. A gradual transfer of authority and responsibility
transpired over the next six months. By January 1978 the new president had
completed some consolidation, mostly within the marketing function, and
had created new functions in planning, international sales, and marketing
through outside appointments. At the end of this research, Beta had over
1,000 employees.
A Stage-of-Growth Model
The growth histories of Alpha and Beta strongly suggest a stage developmental pattern. Managers at both firms described their experiences and the
history of their growth in terms of stages without my referring to the
construct. Much of the discussion of stages, however, emphasized the role
played by problems the firms faced.
The managers of these technology-based new ventures faced strategic
and operational problems from the time of product conceptualization through
organizational maturity. Further, some of those problems seem to have been
more dominant than others at times, and a sequential pattern of dominance
seemed to exist. The particular problems faced at a given time appeared to be
strongly associated with a venture's position in a particular stage of growth
(Block & MacMillan, 1985; Galbraith, 1982). As the dominant problems
change, an organization's configuration of organizational design variables
changes in response. Figure 1 shows the proposed associations. Although
previous research (Miller & Friesen, 1984; Rhenman, 1973) and the grounded
case examples (Kimberly, 1979) generally support the model, it is not proposed as universally generalizable. Both Penrose (1952) and Rhenman (1973)
argued that there is no life cycle or phased sequence applicable to all organizations and that the recurrent cycles and patterns in organizations that can
be observed are a product of specific environments. Influential environmental factors include technological discontinuities that introduce radically new
technologies to existing industries (Tushman & Anderson, 1986), the emergence of new industries, and shifts in demand patterns.
This research should be seen as generating a midrange theory (Pinder &
Moore, 1979) of growth, applicable only to certain organizations. Specifically,
the assumptions of this model are: (1)it holds only for technology-based new
ventures, (2) it explains only internally generated growth, not growth by
acquisition or merger, (3) for its focal population of firms, a market segment
or niche exists such that demand conditions are not limiting, and (4) the

population's focus is on initial growth within a single product-technology
base.
The third assumption is not unreasonable for firms in an emerging industry experiencing extraordinary growth. Firms in some computer components
markets and those in the personal computer, genetic engineering, and robotics and related markets have seen times when demand was not a limiting
factor. New firms in such environments attempt to increase their customer
base with the growth of the market. Additionally, the short and overlapping
product life cycles characteristic of such technology-intense industries tend
to fuel growth further, because products frequently become obsolete.
Although consistent with several models found elsewhere in the literature (Blake et al., 1966; Galbraith, 1982; Normann, 1977; Rhenman, 1973;
Quinn & Cameron, 1983), this model, grounded in the experiences of two
firms, differs in that it explicitly describes stages as linked to dominant
problems. The four-stage model, presented with additional supporting case
data is as follows.
Stage 1: Conception and development. Before their formal creation, as
signified by incorporation or by gaining a major source of financial backing
that goes beyond initial seed grants, virtually all ventures go through a period during which the primary focus of the entrepreneur and possibly of
several others is on the invention and development of a product or a
technology. In 1974, Riley, the founder of Alpha, developed the idea of an
electronic typewriter with memory while working with semiconductor
technology. Initial attempts to gain financial backing were rejected because
he lacked proprietary technology. Continued proposals to several potential
backers resulted in an initial seed grant. At Beta, Thomas traced his interest
and work on the product that ultimately launched the venture back to 1965.
He worked on the project on his own time until late 1971, when he developed a workable prototype design. After several attempts, he finally convinced a backer of the strength of his idea. It was not until July 1972 that Beta

<-----Page 7----->1988

was incorporated, with Thomas as the first employee. Such activities are
associated with the creation of the idea for a new business (Normann, 1977;
Sarason, 1972; Van de Ven et al., 1984).
Structure and formality are nonexistent during this stage, with almost all
activity focused on technical issues as defined and directed by the founding
entrepreneur(s). With Alpha's initial venture capital, Riley proceeded to
overcolne several key technical hurdles, build prototypes, and hire engineering support. During the early days of the firm, activities were implicitly and
informally organized around project management principles, with all employees working in one room.
Major problems of organizations at this point include construction of a
product prototype (Block & MacMillan, 1985) and selling the product and
business idea to financial backers (Timmons, Smollen, & Dingee, 1977).
Working prototypes were developed by early 1972 at Beta, leading to the
acquisition of additional, Inore significant funding and a movement toward
commercialization. The major milestones associated with the technical development were initial development, building a so-called proof-of-principle
machine, testing and debugging, constructing 2 prototypes, and constructing
10 to 20 prototypes for test and evaluation. Alpha made several unique
technological advances over a six-month period, using several engineers
who were hired on a short-term contract with a promise of a position if
feasibility could be established. It was not until February 1976 that Alpha
became an incorporated entity with full-time employees other than the
founder.
Stage 2: Commercialization. Given financial backing, new ventures go
through a period during which their major focus is on developing the product or technology for commercialization. At this point, the organization largely
resembles a new product-development team, with its problems and compet e n c e ~largely being technical. The focus is primarily on learning how to
make the product work well and on how to produce it beyond the model
shop prototype approach of the first stage (Galbraith, 1982). At Alpha, about
two years passed between incorporation with full-time employees to the
company's public announcement of its first product, in early 1978. In May
1976, the firm hired a director of manufacturing to plan manufacturing facilities and to begin to identify suppliers. At the time of product launch, all
employees still worked in one room with desks lined u p against each other
and eight telephone lines for all 175 people. Under such an arrangement
communication was face-to-face, and employees were either directly involved with or witnessed all decisions.
In this stage, building an organizational task system becomes a consideration. By this time, discrete organizational functions like manufacturing and engineering have been formally created, and others are embryonic.
At Alpha in early 1977, the primary focus was preparing to launch the
product. The start of the marketing function began early in the year with the
hiring of individuals to work on software specifications and design. By midyear the marketing field organization began to evolve with the hiring of field

<-----Page 8----->264

managers, salespeople, new trainers, and technical support people. The financial and administrative systems also emerged at this time with the appointment in April of a full-time director of finance to replace an outside
consultant who had set u p the systems used to that point. Shortly thereafter,
a full time bookkeeper was hired as well.
Some critical functions may be assigned to part-time employees or contracted out. During this time at Beta, one consultant conducted market
research, and another structured basic administrative systems. The two consultants later joined the firm as full-time employees.
In this period, a single owner or a small number of partners will dominate the venture. Toward the end of this stage, the venture's product is
publicly announced or made available for sale.
Stage 3: Growth. If a product is technically feasible and achieves market
acceptance, a period of high growth will typically result. The major problems of a new venture at this point are to produce, sell, and distribute its
product in volume and to avoid being shaken out of the market as ineffective
or inefficient (Abernathy & Utterback, 1982; Moore & Tushman, 1982). Under pressure to attain profitability, a venture must carefully balance profits
against future growth.
Many ventures experience a sequence of functionally localized problems as each function faces the difficulty of building an efficient and effective task system. At Alpha, from mid-1977 to late 1979 could be considered a
transition period characterized by a series of organizational problems with a
clear dominant focus. The first of those was an engineering crisis from
mid-1977 to early 1978. The difficulty was to get the product to work reliably
and to function as promised. The second crisis, following shortly thereafter
in the second half of 1978, was in manufacturing. The problem was to overcome "manufacturing constipation"-to get more machines off the end of the
line. A third crisis emerged in early 1979 within the marketing function. The
problem was an inadequate selling capacity that constrained the selling of
more machines. At the time of this research, several sources suggested the
emergence of problems in the areas of product reliability, service within
marketing, and financial controls. Most of the crises, and certainly those in
manufacturing and marketing, were overcome by expanding numbers and
types of employees and by creating and formalizing new positions and
systems. Many interviewees thought, however, that the financial crisis required an emphasis not on the size of the personnel, but on the nature and
quality of information and internal decision processes.
At Beta, a series of problems also characterized the transition from an
early start-up organization to a high-growth, high-volume company. The first
two came close together. By early 1977, it became apparent that Beta was not
meeting its sales goals. The marketing crisis resulted in the firm's hiring a
person with an extensive marketing background to serve as a general manager under Thomas, who continued as chairman of the firm. Also recognized
at about the same time was a financial and administrative crisis centering on
the gross inadequacy of the company's billing procedures and inventory

<-----Page 9----->1988

265

controls. The firm did not focus on those problems until 1979 because the
marketing problems were more pressing, but it devoted much of 1979 to
financial and accounting systems and controls, management information
systems, and planning and budgeting.
In stage 3, a new venture experiences an almost constant state of change.
The original general manager may remain central to all decision making, but
through this stage there is a growth of hierarchy, an advent of functional
specialization, and a move toward adding professionally trained, experienced people.
In January 1978 Alpha announced and offered its first product. With
commercialization and strong product demand, the number of employees
increased dramatically. Although some staff was in place for each function,
it was becoming necessary to flesh out the functional organizations as Alpha
built depth in engineering, brought additional plant capacity on line, positioned a national field sales force, and structured administrative systems and
support capabilities. With the increase in personnel, it was necessary to
establish more formalized structures and reporting mechanisms. Everyone
no longer knew everyone else by name, and not everyone could report directly to Riley, as had been the case. Therefore, the first formalization of
structure was instituted with a functional organization design.
As at Alpha, at Beta most organizational structure and internal system
developments were initiated at the functional level. Here again, each function changed from an informal, nonspecialized activity to a structured,
specialized, and formalized organization, typically as a result of the precipitating problems discussed in this section.
Stage 4: Stability. As the growth rate slows to a level consistent with
market growth, a venture enters a new stage. Its major problems at this point
are to maintain growth momentum and market position (Moore & Tushman,
1982). The typical focus becomes the development of a second-generation
product. A professional, experienced manager or team of managers may have
replaced or may be supporting the original owner (Gupta, 1984; Kerr, 1982).
In January 1978 the general manager became the president of Beta. Shortly
after assuming his new duties, he uncovered what might be described as
another crisis-an "engineering and product planning void." The main problem was that no one at Beta was concerned about new products or even
subsequent generations of existing products. His initial actions included a
comprehensive reorganization of the marketing and engineering areas.
By this time, a venture has evolved from an organic technology-product
development group into a stable, functional, operating company characterized by bureaucratic principles across the organization. It has and adheres
to a formal structure and has correspondingly standardized and formalized
rules and procedures. During 1978 at Beta, deepening and strengthening
functional marketing and R&D capability through an influx of new talent
were focal. In engineering, a new director who instituted formal projectplanning activity and project management systems was hired. Developing
second- and third-generation products had high priority, an emphasis initi-

<-----Page 10----->266

ated with the creation of an advanced product-planning group within R&D,
headed by a director, also newly hired from outside. By this time, Beta had
over 1,000 employees, many of whom were highly specialized,
By April 1979, the number of employees at Alpha exceeded 1,000. With
this growth came a need to modify the structure specifically to reduce Riley's
span of control. With even greater growth at an increasing rate projected for
the next year, it was no longer possible to have over ten individuals reporting directly to the chief executive. Therefore, Riley consolidated his organization under vice-presidents for marketing, operations, administration, and
international sales.
STUDY TWO: THE RELATION OF 

DOMINANT PROBLEMS TO STAGES OF GROWTH 

Review of the Literature

The literature on stages of growth typically implies that problems influence internal organization. However, the findings from the field study suggested that problems played a central role in the growth patterns of new
ventures and so deserved additional theoretical development. Several studies have discussed the role of dominant problems as contextual factors. The
literature on product life cycles (Midgley, 1981; Moore & Tushman, 1982;
Porter, 1980) has long proposed that there is a pattern of primary tasks or
concerns that firms face for each theorized stage. They may be either functional tasks or strategic positioning issues. This idea is relevant because
technology-based new ventures typically experience their initial growth
around a single new product.
The work of Miles and Snow (1978) also offers support. Although not
focused directly on small, emerging firms, they outlined a pattern of growth
for mature firms facing a change of domain. Their adaptive cycle outlines
"the three major problems which management must continually solve:
entrepreneurial, engineering, and administrative" (1978: 21). The entrepreneurial problem concerns redefinition of a firm's domain by the modification of products or market offerings. The engineering problem focuses on the
creation of a systems delivery capability for changes. Finally, the administrative problem requires rationalizing and stabilizing solutions instituted in
earlier stages.
More recently, Block and MacMillan (1985) discussed the role of problems with a specific reference to new ventures. They listed ten milestones
that a new venture must pass as it evolves from an idea to a viable business
entity. Milestones include such tasks as the completion of concept- and
product-testing, completion of the prototype, production start-up, and first
redesign and redirection. Galbraith (1982) offered a stage-of-growth model
similar to the present model and consistent with Block and MacMillan's
(1985) research, in which certain tasks (problems) are associated with each
stage of growth. Storey (1985),in the only empirical study of the problems of
new ventures found in the literature, investigated problems facing new firms

<-----Page 11----->1988

in the United Kingdom. He found that the problems differed by industry as
well as by the age of firms.
Propositions

If empirically supportable, the four stages of growth would constitute
distinct contexts for managerial focus and decision making. My empirical
research assessed the validity of the stage-of-growth model by investigating
the relation of dominant problems to stage. A strong association between the
problems a firm faces and its stage of growth would support the model
presented, providing a better understanding of how and why stages emerge.
Therefore, I expected four primary patterns of association and investigated
them with a large number of firms.
Proposition 1: Stage 1firms will rate problems associated
with resource acquisition and technology development
higher than will firms in other stages.
Proposition 2: Stage 2 firms will rate problems associated
with production start-up, vendor relations, facilities, and
field support of the product higher than will firms in other
stages.
Proposition 3: Stage 3 firms will rate problems associated
with sales growth, market share growth, and internal organizational mechanisms higher than will firms in other
stages.
Proposition 4: Stage 4 firms will rate problems associated
with profitability, internal controls, and future sources of
growth higher than will firms in other stages.
Methods

Four venture capitalists provided a portfolio of firms from which to
select and provided entree to firms that otherwise might not have responded.
Data were collected in late 1982 through a questionnaire. The venture capitalists provided names and addresses of the firms and a cover letter to the
potential respondents supporting the research project. To be included, a
venture had to have been created since 1970, be in a business considered
high technology, such as computers and related electronics products, and be
autonomous and free-standing. No intracorporate start-ups or joint ventures
were included. Of the 225 firms contacted, 105 (46%) responded. The chief
executive officer served as the respondent in each firm.'
Measurements. Each problem was measured by asking a venture's CEO to
rate problems on a 1 to 7 scale in terms of their current dominance to the
firm. The Appendix lists the dominant problems.

' For a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using self-categorization measures
with CEOs as respondents, see Hambrick (1980).

<-----Page 12----->Academy of Management JournoI

The measure of stage of growth was a self-categorization, CEOs were
asked to select the one of four unlabeled descriptions of a firm and its
situation that most closely described their own firm.' The descriptions corresponded to the stages of growth outlined in the present model. The Appendix gives the four descriptions. The stage measure preceded the problem
measure in the questionnaire.
The construct validity of the self-categorization measure was assessed
through investigating the relationship of stage with salient external variables. I
collected data on the age of firms (years), their size (total number of employees), and their rate of growth (a factor of actual sales for the previous
year). Table 1 presents the means for each variable within each stage. As
expected, the means for age and size increase with each subsequent stage, suggesting a movement of firms through stages. Also as expected, growth increased from stage 1 through 3 , with stage 3 showing the highest rate of
growth, and then decreased. These findings offer support for the validity of
the stage model. Like data from a cohort analysis, such cross-sectional data
are an imperfect substitute for longitudinal data but do suggest the order in
which firms move from stage to stage.
Analysis and Results

Initially, I performed a multivariate analysis of variance (MAKOVA)
grouping firms on the stage variable to see if significant differences existed
on the ratings of the 18 problems. The analysis resulted in an overall significant finding (F54,248 = 1.59, p < .01),suggesting that there are significant

differences in problem ratings across stages. I then performed a factor analysis to better reveal the factorial structure among the 18 problems ratedG3
Principal components analysis with varimax rotation was chosen because it requires no prior assumptions about the structure of data and is
widely accepted as an appropriate procedure for identifying meaningful
dimensions in a multivariate domain (Cooley & Lohnes, 1971). Six interpretable factors, presented in Table 2, resulted.
The factor loadings suggest a grouping of problems consistent with the
model. The first factor, which loads heavily with problems related to internal administrative systems and concerns-management information systems,
cost control, financial information systems, and the general level of red
tape-is an organizational-administrative construct. Factor 2, which includes
such concerns as meeting sales targets, attaining profit and market-share
goals, penetrating new geographic markets, and maintaining the quality of
product support and customer service, is related to critical requirements
for success in the marketplace and can be interpreted as a sales and marketing
factor. Only two variables, attracting capable employees and management
depth and talent, load on factor 3 , which can be termed a people construct.
Factor 4 , which also includes only two variables, the ability to produce in
volumes adequate to meet demand and the development of a network of
reliable vendors and suppliers, is a production construct. Factor 5 includes a
firm's position in a new product-market segment and the development of a
new product or technology application and is therefore a strategic positioning factor. Finally, the two problems that loaded on the last factor were
securing financial resources and backing and acquiring key outside advisers
or board members, which makes this an external relations factor.
After factor analysis, a n alpha coefficient was calculated for the items
defining each factor. Coefficients ranged from .51 to .79, reinforcing the
reliability of the constructs (Nunnally, 1970). I then calculated scale scores
using a unit weighting of the means of the associated problem ratings. To
investigate the relationship of the factors and stages, I then conducted a
one-way ANOVA with each of the factor variables against stage. Table 3
presents the results, which are significant for four of the six factors.
To facilitate examination and interpretation of the problem factors' means
across and within stages, the results shown in Table 3 have been plotted in
Figure 2. It is interesting that several of the problem factors-strategic
positioning, sales-marketing, and people-are more dominant than the other
factors in all stages.
Post hoc comparisons based on a Scheff6 test were conducted for the
four factors with significant mean differences (Table 3). I compared factor
ratings for firms i n specific stages with those of firnis in other stages to test
for the hypothesized differences. The organizational factor demonstrated

" Both Kim and Mueller (1985: 76) and Lawley and Maxwell (1971: 20) suggested that a n
adequate sample size exists for factor analysis if n-p-1 > 50, where n = the number of observations and p = the number of variables. In this case, n --p - 1 = 85, suggesting an adequate size.

significantly higher means for firms in stages 3 and 4 than for firms in stages
1 and 2. The sales-marketing factor showed significance with stage as well,
with stage 3 firms clearly rating these problems as more dominant than did
firms in other stages. The strategic positioning factor was rated higher by
stage 1 and stage 4 firms than by firms in stages 2 and 3. The final significant
result was for the external relationship factor, which was rated more dominant by stage 1 and stage 2 firms than by stage 3 and stage 4 firms.
Omega-squared values were also calculated (Tables 1and 3). The omegasquared coefficient, which is analagous to RZ,can be used as a goodness-of-fit
measure as it provides an estimate of a treatment's effects on the variation of
the response variable (Green, 1978).In the tables, these values are equivalent
to R values of .07-.48.
DISCUSSION AND INTEGRATION
It would seem that dominant problems, the increase or decrease of their
influence, and the relations among them might in themselves be valuable

<-----Page 18----->274

constructs deserving of additional study. The findings of this research serve
as a useful starting point in this regard.
The theoretical role of dominant problerns is important, not only in
defining and measuring discrete stages, but also in understanding the transition from stage to stage, which I viewed as an organizational learning process
(Normann, 1977; Rhenman, 1973).Miles noted that "organizational learning
occurs in response to immediate problems, imbalances or difficulties, in
what Downs (1967) has referred to as performance gaps . . . . The intraorganizational conflicts and tensions created by these immediate problems
serve a constructive function in stimulating search behaviors that lead to
organizational learning" (1982: 157-158).
The particular problems it faces at a given time define a venture's position in a particular stage of growth. The venture will then undergo some
search for knowledge and competence and, if successful, will resolve those
problems. The problem-search-resolution process will recur in subsequent
growth cycles, since the venture will again face the same problems (Miles &
Snow, 1978).
This process will constitute organizational learning if a new venture can
map solutions onto its organization in terms of specific functions, structures,
and positions, as well as information, decision, and planning processes.
Solutions to problems should not be tied to specific individuals because
they would then have to be reinvented in the absence of those people (Jelinek,
1979). In other words, if learning occurs, an organization institutionalizes
the solutions to these recurring problems so that it can replicate those solutions when they are needed.
Such an organizational learning cycle explains how a successful new
venture makes the transition from one stage of growth to the next and suggests why some fail. If Alpha had not gained initial funding or demonstrated
its product's technical feasibility, it would not have become a stage 2 firm
concerned with developing the capacity to launch the product. Mad Beta not
resolved its financial and administrative control problems, it might not have
continued to grow and might not have made the transition to stage 4 and the
concerns of new product development and long-term viability.
Thus, the transition from stage to stage is effected in two ways. First,
structures and processes that were not previously required are institutionalized. Second, elements of the organization may be radically altered; for
example, types of employees or reward systems may change.
The findings from studying 105 technology-based new ventures offer
some support for a link between dominant problems and stages of growth.
The predicted dominant problems for stage 1firms were product or technology development and resource acquisition, and firms in this stage rated the
development of new product or technology applications higher than other
problems. The problem is apparently a prime concern of both stage 1 firms
attempting to establish their initial product and stage 4 firms looking to
develop second-generation or completely new products to spur further growth.
Since firms move from initial development through subsequent growth or

<-----Page 19----->1988

adaptive cycles (Miles & Snow, 1978), such a U-shaped relationship should
be expected to emerge. The problem of securing financial resources and
backing demonstrated significantly higher mean ratings for stage 1 and 2
firms than for stage 3 and 4 firms.
Little support emerged for a link between the hypothesized dominant
problems and stage 2 . Production-related problems demonstrated no significant differences across stage. Interestingly, firms in this stage rated acquisition of resources highest. Additionally, sales and marketing problems were
rated noticeably higher in stage 2 than in stage 1.
Results for stage 3 firms strongly supported the model. Sales and marketing were significantly more important to firms in this stage than to firms in
other stages. Also, organization was significantly more important for stage 3
and 4 firms than for firms in stages 1 and 2.
Finally, only moderate support emerged for the relationships theorized
for stage 4. Strategic positioning was important for stage 1 and 4 firms, and
organization and administration were also a problem for stage 4 as well as
stage 3 firms, consistent with a need for increased control in a large
organization.
Examining the plots of dominant problem factors across stages (Figure 2)
yields further insights. The strategic positioning factor ranks first in three
stages and second in one stage. The people factor ranks second or third in all
four stages. It seems that technology is a continual focus for any technologybased firm. Also, since technology is embodied in the skill sets of individuals,
people are also of regular concern. Managerial depth is typically a concern
when firms are growing rapidly, as were most of the firms studied, regardless
of stage. Finally, the sales-marketing factor ranks first or second in three
stages and third in one, which may also be a function of the high rates of
growth attained and expected by these ventures.

CONCLUSIONS
Several conclusions concerning the model can be drawn. Support for the
hypothesized relationships emerged for firms in stages 1 and 3. However, an
overall examination of the relative dominance of problem factors within
stages suggests a need to modify the model. Even though problems increased
or decreased in importance over time, some were simply more dominant
than others all of the time. One implication of that finding is that there could
be a hierarchical ordering of the problem factors not envisioned in the model,
perhaps the result of the prominence of growth and technology in the firms
for which the model was developed. The second implication is that problems may influence stage characteristics not only by their absolute importance to a firm at one time, but also according to their relative importance
across stages. That is, a problem could be less dominant than others in all
stages and yet increase or decrease in importance from one stage to another.
It could thus still be enough of a focus to trigger an organizational learning
cycle.

Another conclusion is that this research supports the conceptual argument that stages are not tight, discrete packages of internal characteristics
that develop in response to dominant problems, but are instead somewhat
fluid, with problems overlapping in adjacent stages (Normann, 1977: 46). In
three of four cases where significant differences were found, problems were
of equal concern to firms in adjacent stages. The fourth case, the strategic
positioning factor, demonstrates the U-shaped relationship discussed above.
Reexamination of Table 1, where it can be seen that size and age are more
similar for firms in stage 1 and 2 and for firms in stage 3 and 4, supports this
conclusion. Interestingly, comparing rate of growth for firms in stages 3 and
4 suggests strong differences as well.
It is important to bound the conclusions regarding the model with an
understanding of the limitations of this research. A bias may exist in the data
base because the firms that responded were largely successes. They were
still in business, and continued existence is a critical measure of performance,
especially for early-stage firms. There were no firms that had failed to make a
transition from one stage to another. The fact that the firms studied were
venture-capitalist backed heightens this effect; experienced investors had
seen them as having a high potential for success. Such investors review not
only products and business plans, but management talent and organizational
issues as well.
The current analyses provide only a cross-sectional view of the firms in
their current stage. Their developmental movement and the ultimate success
of their framework can only be assessed through longitudinal analyses of
multiple waves of data. Even so, the analyses presented provide interesting
insights into the growth patterns of technology-based new ventures.
In summary, there is partial support for the contention that the development of such ventures proceeds through a predictable pattern that can be
related to the problems a firm finds pressing at sequential times. Results did
not, however, completely support the expected pattern. Some problems were
more important than others across all stages, and problems and stage characteristics appeared to overlap.

APPENDIX
Self-categorized Stage-of-Growth Measures
CEOs were asked to select the description that most closely matched their own firm. Descriptions were not labeled.
Stage 1. Within this company, the primary focus of our activities is on product development and design, securing adequate financial resources and developing a market. Most of our
employees have technical tasks but could be considered more as generalists than specialists as
we all perform multiple tasks. We more closely resemble a task group than an organization.
Formality and procedures are almost non-existent at this firm, but the presidentientrepreneur is
central to all functions and commui~ications.
Stage 2. The company has a product that performs well and meets a need in the marketplace.
We have the capability to produce and sell but we have yet to firmly establish the company in
the market. The presidentientrepreneur is central to all functions and communications. The
firm has some revenues and some backlog of orders.
Stage 3. The company is characterized by high growth rates in both sales and number of
employees. The major internal focus is around issues of how to produce, sell and distribute the
products in volume while attaining profitability. Internal structure and communication is becoming more formal and increasingly individuals are assuming specialist roles. The company
has a single product line.
Stage 4.Within this company, the major internal activities include: (a) development of
2nd, 3rd generation products andior totally new product lines; (b) securing growth funding; (c)
securing or growing market share; (d) penetrating new geographic territories. The firm has a
formality of organization structure, rules and procedures. A top management team composed of
some individuals with broad industry experience is in place or being built.

Dominant Problem Ratings
CEOs were asked the degree to which the following problems were currently the focus of
management attention and resources. Responses were captured on a 7-point scale, with 1 = a
minor issue of concern at this time, 4 = somewhat of an issue of concern at this time, and 7
extremely dominant issue at this time.
1. Developing a new product or technology application
2. Securing financial resources and backing
3 . Acquiring key outside advisors or board members
4. Product suppolt or customer service
5. Attracting capable personnel
6. Adequate facilities andior space
7. Developing a network of reliable vendors and suppliers
8. Produce in volumes adequate to meet demand
9. Meet sales targets
10. Management depth and talent
11. Cost control
12. Definition of organizational roles, responsibilities and policies
13. Management information systems
14. Attaining profitability or market share goals
15. Penetrating new geographic territories
16. Administrative burden and red tape
17. Development of financial systems and internal controls
18. Establishing a firm position in productimarket segments
