Abstract
Research on technological opportunity has typically focused on the impact of broad industry characteristics on R&D intensity of firms. This study complements such approaches by examining the impact of a multidimensional vector that measures
technological opportunity on independent inventors’ decisions to patent and commercialize inventions. Using data from 559
inventions and controlling for demand, appropriability, and competitive conditions, we found two of four tested dimensions
of technological opportunity – technical performance and technical uncertainty – to be significant and important determinants of the likelihood of commercialization. Technical feasibility appears important in affecting patenting but unimportant in
affecting commercialization. Technical significance carries a negative, although insignificant, sign conditioning commercialization.

1. Introduction
The commercialization of inventions is one important way in which income and wealth are created. And
independent inventors are one source of inventions that
cannot be ignored. In 2003 in the United States, independent inventors represented approximately 15% of
the creators of patented inventions, a significant proportion (USPTO, 2004). In Canada, evidence points

to an even more important role for independent inventors. For example, by the end of the 1970s, approximately 42% of patented inventions of Canadian origin
originated with individuals, a finding at least partially
explained by Canada’s reliance on firms in resourceintensive sectors that have low R&D activity (Amesse
et al., 1991). Inventors have been characterized as one
of the major sources of radical innovations both in
the beginning (Schumpeter, 1934) and middle of the
nineteenth century (Jewkes et al., 1959). Independent
inventors still appear as important sources of technological change in many industries (e.g. Dahlin et al.,
2004; von Hippel and Katz, 2002) and a net contributor

<-----Page 1----->T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

to economic development (Åstebro, 2003). However,
little is known about how entrepreneurs and inventors
find and exploit technological opportunities (Shane and
Venkataraman, 2000). This paper addresses that gap in
the literature.
With the intent of examining how technological
opportunity affects inventor commercialization efforts
we turned to received literature on the relationship
between technological opportunity and firm-level
R&D for guidance. Recent work (surveyed by Cohen,
1995) argues that greater technological opportunity
increases the incentive for firms to invest in R&D.
Most of this research employs industry-wide measures of technological opportunity. However, broad
industry-wide conditions fail to consider the nature
of the opportunity discovered, thus providing limited
explanatory power (Shane, 2001a). In this paper,
we show not only that technological opportunities
are measurable at the invention unit of analysis, but
that several dimensions of technological opportunity
should be considered. Recent research focusing on
invention-based measures of technological opportunity (e.g. Shane, 2001a) has measured these constructs
ex post, which leads to difficulties in inferring
causality. This present research is unfettered by
such measurement and interpretational difficulties as
we measure constructs prior to commercialization
efforts.
Focusing on independent inventors allows for a
cleaner test of the technological opportunity effect
on economic incentives than has traditionally been
possible in the analyses of new product development
by established firms. Established firms may use
complementary sales or learning curve advantages to
compensate for weak appropriability conditions or
low technological opportunity, making it hard to distinguish technological opportunity from firm-specific
abilities or firms’ beliefs about their abilities (Cohen
et al., 2000; Mitchell, 1991; Simon, 1945). We focus
our analysis on one segment of the entrepreneurial
process—the decision to exploit an opportunity, which
is subsequent to the discovery and prior to the choice
of the mode of exploitation (Shane and Venkataraman,
2000). With respect to this decision, it is not altogether
obvious that increased technological opportunity
necessarily leads to increased commercialization rates, at least not in the case of independent
inventors.

1405

In this paper we make three contributions to the
understanding of invention commercialization. Our
first contribution is to explicate how four dimensions
of technological opportunity affect inventors’ incentives to patent and commercialize inventions. It turns
out that the relationships are somewhat more complex than the simple “opportunity creates positive
incentives” stories of the past. Our second contribution is to provide empirical tests of the effects of
these measures on the independent inventor’s decision to patent and commercialize an invention while
controlling for expected demand, appropriability, and
competitive conditions, recording all measures at the
invention level of the inception stage. Third, we show
that the incentives to patent versus to commercialize
inventions are quite different for independent inventors. The independent inventor’s motivation to patent
seems driven primarily by the patentability of his/her
invention, without much concern for commercial conditions. On the other hand, the probability that the
invention is commercialized is very much a function
of the commercial opportunity and whether the invention was patented. These results together indicate that
increasing incentives to patent by changing the patent
system would likely increase the rate of patenting
but not necessarily increase the commercial quality
of inventions commercialized by independent inventors.

2. Technological opportunity
Schumpeter (1934, p. 66) acknowledged that
entrepreneurs both recognize and introduce new
competitive opportunities. He argued that whereas
declining opportunities in mature industries lead to
a reduction in innovation by established firms, they
create incentives for entrepreneurs. Schumpeter’s
theorizing regarding technological opportunity has
led to two related streams of research: one investigating the evolution of industries (e.g. Tushman and
Anderson, 1986; Klepper and Simons, 2000); the
other investigating cross-industry differences in R&D
as a function of technological opportunity (e.g. Cohen
et al., 1987). However, research on technological
opportunity suffers from a lack of precision in defining
the concept, as well as the lack of operational measures
(Klevorick et al., 1995).

<-----Page 2----->1406

Technological opportunity reflects the cost of
achieving some normalized unit of technical advance
(Cohen, 1995). Higher technological opportunity
means achieving more technical advance per invested
R&D dollar, while low opportunity means low advance
per dollar invested. More specifically, Klevorick et
al. (1995) state: “Technological opportunities, which
comprise the set of possibilities for technical advance,
may be measured in terms of the distribution of values
of improved production-function or product-attribute
parameters that may be attained through R&D, or, alternatively, as the distribution of returns to R&D, given
demand conditions, the current level of technology and
the appropriability regime” (p. 188). Opportunity has
been treated as a parameter in a production-function,
or an elasticity of unit manufacturing cost with respect
to R&D spending, or industry- or patent-class dummies representing broad sectoral differences (Cohen,
1995). Another approach has been to survey R&D
managers in established firms as to their perceptions
regarding technological opportunities, and to average
responses within the industries.1 Opportunities have
then been conceptualized as the relevance of basic
and applied science to technological progress, and
the contribution of upstream suppliers and university
research across broad sectors (for a review see Cohen,
1995).2
Previous researchers, having identified technological opportunity as having a positive effect on R&D
intensity (Cohen, 1995), concluded that greater opportunity leads to more commercialized inventions. We,
however, argue that one cannot immediately draw
the conclusion that more inventions will be commercialized simply because technological opportunity is greater. Creating inventions does not guarantee
successful commercialization. Inventions with greater
technical advance may actually represent ideas that are
more difficult to commercialize in the market, because
either they represent larger deviations from existing
1 Because such measures necessarily have to be broad to be applicable across industries and innovations they suffer from potential
measurement error. Neverthless, semantic scales of opportunity have
performed well in cross-industry regressions of R&D intensity (e.g.
Cohen et al., 1987; Cohen and Levinthal, 1989).
2 Despite this shortcoming, the simple classification of industries
into presumed technological differences has explained a substantial fraction of the variance in patenting and R&D intensity (Cohen,
1995) and in new firm formation (Shane, 2001b).

consumer practice or are more difficult to manufacture; they may also carry large uncertainties, which
will reduce economic incentives if inventors are risk
averse.
Furthermore, while technological opportunity is
often thought of as a scientiﬁc opportunity, Klevorick et
al. (1995) argue that the key dimension is the
improvement of product attributes (or productionfunction attributes) and not the scientific contribution. This suggests that technological opportunity
can be a multidimensional concept, encompassing
for example both the cost of achieving technical
advance and the improvement in various product attributes.
2.1. Dimensions of technological opportunity
Recent studies use several invention-specific
attributes of technological opportunity to analyze the
impact of attributes on invention commercialization
decisions and outcomes (Crepon et al., 1998; Gans and
Stern, 2003; Goldenberg et al., 2001; Shane, 2001a).
This paper explores four attributes: technological significance, performance, feasibility, and uncertainty.
Technological signiﬁcance indicates the degree of
significance of a contribution to technical development that the invention is expected to have. Performance indexes the degree to which an invention
is expected to work better than alternatives or fulfill a function not previously provided. Feasibility
approximates the likelihood that an invention is technically sound and complete. Finally, uncertainty indicates the likelihood that planned and future R&D will
resolve current outstanding technical issues. The first
dimension relates directly to the numerator of the
standard definition of technological opportunity—the
degree of technical advance per unit of R&D expenditures. The denominator – expected R&D expenditures – are also measured and controlled for in regressions.
2.2. Technological signiﬁcance
The expected significance of an invention relates
to the increased likelihood that the development will
be both completed and commercialized, inasmuch
as more significant inventions have higher economic
value (Trajtenberg, 1990) and thus will increase incen-

<-----Page 3----->T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

tives (Albert et al., 1991). But let us disentangle the
effects of an invention’s technological and economic
significance. In effect, technical and economic significances may have different effects on commercialization. While we agree that greater economic significance increases incentives and thus, for example,
should increase R&D efforts, it can also be argued
that a greater technological leap is likely to be less
favourably received by the market (Goldenberg et al.,
2001; Christensen, 1997). For example, Goldenberg et
al. argue that “the market does not generally respond
enthusiastically to large-scale changes [in technology]”
(Goldenberg et al., 2001, p. 73). One reason is the technical difficulty of completing a complex idea. A second
is the difficulty of establishing a production process
for an invention that has a lot of “height” (Mishra et
al., 1996). Still another is that the adoption of inventions representing a significant leap on the knowledge
frontier is less likely for products that appear complex
or different to the consumer (Ostlund, 1974; LaBay
and Kinnear, 1981). This line of reasoning receives
empirical support from Crepon et al. (1998), who show
that a greater technological opportunity increases R&D
expenditures, while decreasing the rate of patenting for
a given R&D expenditure level. All things considered,
the total effect of technological significance on the
likelihood of commercialization is ambiguous. However, if we were to control for the effect of incentives,
we could argue that a negative effect of technological significance on commercialization outcomes might
dominate. Note that the difficulties of commercializing
significant technological contributions do not necessarily come into play when patenting is under consideration. The probability of obtaining a patent may
instead increase for an invention with greater significance as more significant inventions may be more likely
to be novel, which is a key criterion for being granted
a patent. We therefore suggest a first hypothesispair:
Hypothesis 1a. The greater the ex ante significance
of an invention, the greater the probability that it will
be patented.
Hypothesis 1b. Controlling for R&D expenditures,
the greater the ex ante significance of an invention,
the lower the probability that it will be commercialized.

1407

2.3. Technological performance
Technological performance indicates how well a
technical idea solves a particular problem for the user
(Klevorick et al., 1995; Goldenberg et al., 2001). Inventions that offer users new or important advantages over
existing products are more likely to be successful in
the market (Goldenberg et al., 2001; Henard and Szymanski, 2001). However, how well a technical idea
solves a particular problem for the user is not necessarily related to the invention’s patent status. Nor is it a
consideration for the patent office. Moreover, an inventor may be motivated to patent an invention in the hopes
of obtaining licensing revenues, even though he/she
does not know exactly how the invention would be
used. These arguments lead to the second hypothesispair:
Hypothesis 2a. The ex ante performance of an
invention is not related to the probability of it being
patented.
Hypothesis 2b. The greater the ex ante performance
of an invention, the higher the probability that it will
be commercialized.
2.4. Technical feasibility
Technical feasibility indicates the likelihood that
an invention is technically sound and complete. An
invention that is not technically sound is unlikely
to be of commercial quality. Many proposed inventions may not be technically sound (at the time)
or may lack some fundamental scientific underpinning that makes them impossible to commercialize.3
While it may be argued that a rational inventor would
immediately discard such apparently impossible ideas,
thereby rendering the factor unimportant in predicting the likelihood of commercialization, such a deterministic view is at odds with our knowledge of the
3 For example, the helicopter drawn by Leonardo da Vinci was
an infeasible invention in that it lacked the application of some fundamental scientific knowledge that would make it possibly to fly.
Another example is the ballpoint pen patented in 1888 (#392,046)
by John J. Loud, which predated the development of precisionmachining that would make it possible to reduce the pen to commercial practice by several decades. The first commercially successful
ballpoint pen was eventually produced in 1945 by Laszlo and George
Biro.

invention process (e.g., Kline and Rosenberg, 1986)
and our limited knowledge about inventor behaviour
(Åstebro, 2003). The invention process incorporates
some significant uncertainties, allowing for the possibility that inventions which, at an early stage, were
assessed as “technically infeasible” may later, with
some probability, still be successfully commercialized.
While technical feasibility is not one of the three
main criteria used by patent offices to judge whether
or not an application will be granted (the three criteria
being usefulness, novelty, and non-obviousness), there
are nonetheless some additional rules that pertain to
feasibility. For example, it is impossible to obtain a
patent on a perpetuum mobile basis. A positive correlation between feasibility and patentability is therefore likely. We accordingly suggest hypothesis-pair
three:
Hypothesis 3a. The greater the ex ante feasibility of
an invention, the higher the probability that it will be
patented.
Hypothesis 3b. The greater the ex ante feasibility of
an invention, the higher the probability that it will be
commercialized.
2.5. Technological uncertainty
The importance of technological uncertainty in
technical development has long been recognized (cf.
Nelson, 1959). The greater the uncertainty that an
invention can be completed, the less the expected utility
(given risk-aversion), and thus the less the incentive for
commercialization. If economic incentives also drive
inventors’ patenting activities, we can expect increased
technological uncertainty to reduce the likelihood of
obtaining a patent as well. This leads us to suggest
hypothesis-pair four:
Hypothesis 4a. The greater the ex ante uncertainty
of an invention, the lower the probability that it will be
patented.
Hypothesis 4b. The greater the ex ante uncertainty
of an invention, the lower the probability that it will be
commercialized.

3. Methodology
3.1. Sample
The Inventor’s Assistance Program (IAP) at the
Canadian Innovation Centre (CIC), Waterloo, Canada,
provided us with data on inventions. The IAP helps
inventors evaluate an invention at a very early stage.
The purpose of this evaluation is to advise the potential
entrepreneur on whether, and how, to continue efforts.4
Hence, the data from the IAP are prior assessments of
the economic traits of the inventions, which avoid any
potential methods bias (Rosenthal and Rosnow, 1991),
hindsight bias (Fischhoff, 1975), or reversed causality
problems. While unlikely to be completely unbiased,
the CIC represents an organization independent of the
R&D projects it evaluates implying that its personnel is less likely to suffer from the type of judgment
biases (e.g. extreme optimism) typically associated
with direct project involvement. Research shows that
the procedure used by the IAP is highly reliable with
Cronbach alphas ranging from 0.84 to 0.96 (Baker and
Albaum, 1986). The procedure results in more accurate
judgments than R&D project managers’ judgments of
their own R&D projects and of VC’s judgments of early
stage ventures (Åstebro, 2002). All the inventions we
examined were generated by inventors outside of established organizations, thus also avoiding potential biases
associated with examining firm-level data.
The inventions we examined were at their stage of
inception, ranging in development from brief sketches
to working prototypes. Although some were in the
process of being patented at the time of review, very
few had received a patent. To illustrate their early stage
of development, note that the average accumulated
out-of-pocket R&D expenditures at the time of the
evaluation were Cdn. $6625 (1995 value); contrast
this with the R&D expenditures for those reaching the
market of Cdn. $87,553 (1995 value). At this stage,
the inventions were far from completed, which makes
an assessment of technological opportunity relevant.
Our study differs from other studies of independent
inventors in that we did not, as has been the norm,
collect samples conditional on the inventions successfully being patented (e.g. Amesse et al., 1991). Our

4

For further details see Åstebro and Gerchak (2001).

<-----Page 5----->T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

sample was constructed and the independent variables
were measured at a pre-patenting stage. We can thus
examine the patenting likelihood, as well as further
commercialization outcomes.
The sample spanned a range of typical independent
inventors and inventions. The majority of inventors
who responded were male (89%); and the majority (72%) came from Ontario, the most populous
Canadian province. As well, most inventions were
consumer-oriented (47%), whether geared to household and general consumer use (28%) or to sports and
leisure applications (15%). Independent inventors are
thus much more focused on inventing new consumer
goods than corporations, which Scherer (1982)
found invented mostly processes for use within the
originating industry and for which only approximately
7% represented inventions for consumer goods only.
Successful consumer-oriented inventions reviewed
by the IAP included a new milk container design,
an impact absorbent material sewn onto the back
of a T-shirt for hockey players, a meat tenderness
tester, and a toilet tissue holder. However, the IAP
had also reviewed a significant number of “high-tech”
(6%) and industrial equipment (6%) inventions (CIC,
1996). These included an industrial-strength crusher
of recycled cans, a new method for repairing worn
feed rolls in sawmills, a re-usable plug to insert in
wooden hydroelectric poles after testing for rot, and
a computerized and mechanically integrated tree
harvester. Tests were conducted to check that the
variation in sampling and response proportions across
the year of submission, province in Canada, gender,
and IAP rating was random. Indeed, no selection bias
was detected from the universe of inventor records the
IAP made available (Åstebro, 2004).5
3.2. Sampling strategy
The inventions’ key economic outcome, commercialization, was assessed in a follow-up telephone survey in 1996. We used a sample frame of all 4024
projects reviewed by the IAP between 1989 and 1993.
5 A survey of Canadian independent inventors (Amesse et al.,
1991) is broadly consistent with the relatively scarce data that we
have on inventor’s characteristics. The investigators found that Canadian independent inventors are more educated, older, and have higher
household income than the general population.

1409

Projects reviewed after 1993 were excluded to ensure
that outcomes were observable. Records were drawn
representatively in equal proportions for each year. The
survey yielded an adjusted response rate of 75% and
559 useful responses (499 inventions were not commercialized, 60 were commercialized).
One concern was that the sample would include a
insufficient number of successes and therefore produce
meaningless models, why we also included a nonrandomly selected subset of projects for which the IAP had
information indicating that the invention might have
reached the market. Fifty-one observations were preselected in this manner, 33 of these were reported by
the inventors to have eventually reached the market.
These 51 observations are included in the above tally
of 559. The sampling plan is controlled for by the algorithms described in Holt et al. (1980) and King and
Zeng (2001).
We collected patent data from the United States
and Canadian Patent Offices, which we searched using
inventor name and address and the keywords obtained
from a short description of the invention by the IAP.
With this method, we likely obtained undercoverage
of patents issued to these inventors; in some cases,
for instance, inventors have very common names or
address records do not match because people have
moved on. As well, keyword searches might not have
obtained a match, although the inventor may have
patented the invention.
Of the 559 inventions, we found 45 inventions with
one Canadian patent and 5 inventions with two Canadian patents. There were also 51 inventions with one
or more US patents, 31 of which were also patented in
Canada. Finally, there were seven US design patents.
One invention had four patents, 3 inventions had three
patents, and 39 had two patents. Overall, there were 71
inventions with at least one patent (11.8%).
3.3. Dependent variables
The first outcome variable is whether the invention was patented [=1] or not [=0]. The second outcome variable includes both technical success as well
as acceptance in the marketplace.6 Inventors were
asked in telephone interviews: “Did you ever start
6 Technical and commercial success is sometimes analyzed separately (e.g., Mansfield et al., 1977).

<-----Page 6----->1410

T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

to sell NAME or a later revised or improved version of this invention?” The response was coded
as [1] = commercialized, and [0] otherwise. We also
inquired whether the inventor had earned licensing
royalties, had sold the intellectual property (IP), or
had earned any other revenue from the invention and
coded an affirmative response as unity (commercialized) and otherwise as zero. Among the 60 commercialized inventions, 11 had not been directly commercialized by the inventor but were instead licensed or the
rights had been sold. The two outcomes of the innovation process, patenting and commercialization, are
positively correlated (r = 0.20, p < 0.0001). However,
the significance of the correlation is strongly driven
by the large number of inventions that were neither
patented nor commercialized (n = 447, 80%). Indeed,
only 19 of the 71 patented inventions (26.7%) were
commercialized, while 41 inventions without a patent
were commercialized.
3.4. Independent variables
Operationalizations are reported in Appendix A.
These are the exact definitions used by the IAP to assess
the inventions. The IAP used a three-point scale to
measure all variables used in this study: A (acceptable,
which means that the criterion appears to be favourable
or satisfactory), B (borderline, which means the criterion rated as B needs to be improved or strengthened.),
and C (critical weakness, meaning it may be necessary
to discontinue the effort to commercialize the invention). For the purposes of the statistical analysis, the
scores were converted into numerical data according
to the following: A = 1; B = 0; and C = −1.
3.5. Control variables
Operationalizations are reported in Appendix A.
The scales for technological and demand uncertainty,
R&D investment as well as for competition were
reversed so that higher uncertainty, greater expected
investment and greater competition would be expected
to carry negative signs. Reversing these scales was
made for easier interpretation of the regressions.
3.5.1. R&D investment
Technological opportunity is defined as the technical advance per unit of R&D expenditures. We there-

fore included an IAP judgment of the expected R&D
expenditures required to bring the invention to the market. This variable also helped to control for the effect
of unmeasured economic incentives.
3.5.2. Demand
Demand has been found to be a major explanation
of R&D intensity (Cohen, 1995). Three IAP judgments of expected demand are used: expected sales,
rate of growth, and uncertainty. The first two are
expected to have positive effects on the likelihood
of invention commercialization, whereas the latter is
expected to have a negative effect if inventors are riskaverse.7
3.5.3. Appropriability
Appropriability conditions describe the degree to
which the inventor can capture rents from an innovation (Cohen, 1995); they are typically measured as the
degree to which legal protection is available. Other
important ways inventors can protect the exclusivity of
an innovation include secrecy, an early-mover learning
curve advantage, and complementary skills and assets.
The IAP judgment that we use indicates protection
using “patents, trade secrets, or other means.”
3.5.4. Competition
Cohen (1995) reports that the notion of market
concentration contributes little to an understanding of
the variation in inventive efforts across industries. The
causality might instead run from innovation to market
structure. We included IAP judgments of both existing
competition and expected competition from imitators;
the latter was expected to have a negative effect on
commercialization likelihood, while the former was
thought to be of little importance.
3.6. Validity and reliability
We measured predictors prior to significant patenting and commercialization efforts. This approach eliminates problems associated with ex post measurement.
To alleviate concerns about inter-rater reliability, we
noted that the IAP employed the same chief evaluator between 1981 and 2000. Further, all evaluators
were trained by the procedure’s chief evaluator (the
7

The last scale has been reversed to reflect uncertainty.

<-----Page 7----->T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

initial training took about two days and close supervision was required for an additional 2 weeks). A
group meeting at the end of each review also mitigated
potential erroneous classifications. Note that Baker and
Albaum (1986) have tested the reliability of the original
instrument across 86 judges and six products and find
Cronbach alpha’s ranging from 0.84 to 0.96, indicating
highly reliable scales.
3.7. Analysis
The analysis took the form of two independent
logistic regressions. A more complex structural model
would have been preferable to the reduced-forms
estimated here. However, as we lacked useful control
variables to properly instrument the endogenous variables, we resorted to a simpler analysis. See Crepon et
al. (1998) for specification of models with greater structure and the associated estimation problems that arise.
We made adjustments for the sampling plan. Following the recommendation of Holt et al. (1980), we
multiplied the likelihood function by the inverse of the
combined sampling and response fraction, which varies
by the year of submission from 10% in 1989 to 17% in
1993. Second, when analyzing commercialization likelihood, the intercept was adjusted for oversampling on
the dependent variable (King and Zeng, 2001). Third,
as the outcome appears rarely in the data, coefficients
and standard errors were adjusted with the rare events
algorithm, also described by King and Zeng (2001).
3.8. Some descriptive data
The mean probability of commercialization lies
between 0.05 and 0.08 (Åstebro and Bernhardt, 1999).
In comparison, the probability of the commercial
success of conducting R&D in established firms is
approximately 0.37 (Mansfield et al., 1977, Table 2.1).
Moreover, the average development time in calendar
years is 1.5 years for successful inventions and 0.5 years
for unsuccessful inventions (Åstebro, 1998). As well,
the average development cost for successful inventions
is $87,553 (S.E. = $55,327) as compared to $5798
(S.E. = $3928) for unsuccessful inventions (Åstebro,
2003). A conservative estimate of the mean yearly
sales is Cdn. $257,500 (1995 values), with a standard
error of $114,500 and the median located between Cdn.
$5000 and $24,999 (Åstebro, 1998). The expected

1411

survival time for inventions that reach the market is
approximately 11 years (Gerchak and Åstebro, 2000).
Finally, the median realized pre-tax internal rate of
return of these inventions is negative (Åstebro, 2003).

4. Results
Spearman rank-order correlations are shown in
Table 1. The likelihood for commercializing an
invention is most strongly correlated with expected
sales (r = 0.24, p < 0.01), technological uncertainty
(r = 0.24, p < 0.01), and technological performance
(r = 0.23, p < 0.01). Patenting is positively related
with technological significance (r = 0.13, p < 0.01),
demand growth (r = 0.12, p < 0.01), and appropriability
(r = 0.24, p < 0.01). The highest correlation between
any two independent variables is r = 0.49 between
technological uncertainty and remaining R&D
investment, which indicates a reasonably low multicollinearity. Technological performance is positively
and significantly correlated with significance (r = 0.20)
and feasibility (r = 0.31) and negatively correlated
with uncertainty (r = −0.27), which indicates that, as
expected, there is some degree of overlap in how the
four dimensions measure technological opportunity.
The column labeled p(A) displays a measure’s probability of achieving the highest rating “A.” We found that
only 8% of the inventions are rated as having a large
contribution to technological change; few are expected
to have a large sales volume (5%); most are expected
not to obtain worthwhile commercial protection
through patents, trade secrets, or other means (93%);
and a fairly large fraction (37%) are assessed as facing
significant R&D expenditures. These assessments
seem appropriate given the relatively small fraction
that eventually reaches the market: between 5 and
8%. On the other hand, most inventions seem to be
technically feasible (72%), while 30% are assessed to
fulfill a function not previously provided for.
Table 2 reports the effect of technology attributes
on the likelihood of seeking and obtaining a patent.
We used maximum likelihood estimation, adjusting for
non-response and unequal sampling probabilities, and
temporarily ignoring adjustments for the rare events
bias. Results are reported in columns 1 and 2. We report

effect. Standard errors are displayed in brackets and
are adjusted to reflect sampling heterogeneity across
strata. A response-weighted “pseudo”-likelihood is
computed, one that differs from the sample’s distribution. It is therefore not displayed (Skinner et al.,
1989).
Control variables obtained expected signs and are
jointly significant (χ2 = 29.56, p < 0.001) [Model 1].
Adding the main variables of interest, the effects
on patenting likelihood are not jointly significant
(χ2 = 4.98, p > 0.10), although the full model is significant [Model 2]. Finally, after adjusting for the rare
events bias, we obtained slightly different coefficient
estimates [Model 3], although the qualitative results
remain the same. The key results are straightforward:
only appropriability conditions and technical feasibility impacts on whether an invention is patented or
not. Inventions that were forecast by the IAP as being
easier to legally protect are indeed more likely to be
legally protected, and those forecasted as being technically unsound and incomplete are not likely to be
granted a patent. The zero effects of the other variables tell us something about how economic incentives affect inventors’ patenting efforts. The inventors
seem not to have been driven much by any commercial considerations when they applied for patents.
If they had been, we would have expected effects
of technological performance, technological uncertainty, as well as market demand and competitive
conditions.
Table 3 reports the effect of technology attributes
on the likelihood of invention commercialization. We
perform estimation both without and with the inclusion of the patent indicator. Excluding the patent indicator provides total and unbiased effects. Including
the patent indicator provides effects conditional on
obtaining a patent, but where coefficients are biased
since the patent indicator is endogenous. Control variables obtained expected signs and are jointly significant
(χ2 = 45.71, p < 0.001) [Model 1]. Adding the main
variables of interest, the effects are jointly significant
(χ2 = 14.98, p < 0.01) [Model 2]. Adjusting for sampling on the dependent variable and the rare events
bias, we obtain slightly different coefficient estimates
[Model 3], although the qualitative results remain the
same. All estimators for technological opportunity
have the hypothesized signs and those for technological performance and uncertainty are significant. An

odds-ratio less than one for technological significance
indicates that the problems that very novel inventions
face outweigh the benefits of novelty. The odds-ratio
of uncertainty of 0.49 in Model 3 corroborates the
idea that greater technological uncertainty reduces the
incentive to commercialize the invention. In fact, a
lowered rating (from A to B or from B to C) in development uncertainty decreases commercialization odds by
a multiple by 1.95.8 The odds-ratio of R&D investment
of 0.76 indicates that, all else being equal, an inventor
prefers to commercialize inventions that are less expensive to develop. This means that a lowered rating (from
A to B or from B to C) decreases commercialization
odds by a multiple of 1.34 (which, however, is non significant). Focusing only on significant positive effects,
an improvement from a B rating to an A rating (or from
C to B) in performance, expected sales, and appropriability is estimated to increase the odds of com8 Although we investigated to see if any interaction effects existed

mercialization by a multiple of 1.93, 1.64, and 1.71,
respectively. Notice the difference in explained pseudoR2 between Tables 2 and 3. Our measures explain about
10 percent of the variance in patenting and 19 percent of the variance of commercialization. It appears
that our measures are less important for patenting than
for commercialization decisions. Finally, examining
the marginal effects the previously significant effect
of appropriability conditions is no longer significant
[Model 4]. The effect of appropriability conditions on
commercialization likelihood is completely mediated
by the patenting indicator. The size of the patent indicator is large, the odds of commercialization are 2.75
times higher with a patent (note however the potential bias in the estimate). Including the patent indicator
reduces the effect of appropriability condition to zero
but does not significantly alter other coefficients. This
result confirms results reported in Table 2 that obtaining
a patent is not related to higher commercial prospects
of the invention as measured by our various indicators.
As the patent coefficient is an OLS estimate it captures
all potential reasons for obtaining a patent. Apparently,

5. Discussion and conclusions
Little is currently known about how entrepreneurs
and inventors find and exploit technological opportunities (Shane and Venkataraman, 2000). This paper
addresses that gap in the literature. We found that
technological opportunity is a strong predictor of the
likelihood that inventors will commercialize inventions
that they have conceived while it is less of a predictor
for patenting likelihood.
This paper makes three contributions to our understanding of invention commercialization. The first
contribution is to explicate how four dimensions of
technological opportunity affect inventors’ incentives
to patent and commercialize inventions. In particular,
we argue that once having controlled for the impact
of technological significance on incentives, there
emerges a negative effect of technological significance

on the likelihood of commercialization because more
significant inventions are, for various reasons, more
difficult to commercialize.
Second, we provide empirical tests of the impact of
technological opportunity on patenting and commercialization decisions by independent inventors. Focusing on independent inventors allows for a cleaner test
of the effect of technological opportunity on economic incentives than that enabled when analyzing
new product development decisions by established
firms. A methodological contribution is that we measured invention-specific technological opportunities
long before the inventions were commercialized. Previous research has typically measured constructs at
the industry level, which may be only approximately
related to incentives, or measured attributes ex post
commercialization, which can lead to difficulties in
inferring causality. In contrast to Shane (2001a), but
in line with both Goldenberg et al. (2001) and Crepon
et al. (1998), we found a negative, although insignificant, marginal effect of technological significance on
commercialization likelihood.

<-----Page 11----->T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

Third, we highlighted the differential effects of technological opportunity on patenting and commercialization activities. Our analysis showed that inventors
patent inventions without much thought of commercialization conditions. This result is consistent with
Jaffee and Lerner’s (2004) claim that for the past 20
years there has been excess patenting. Several reasons
are highlighted by Jaffee and Lerner, such as the recent
willingness by the USPTO to grant patents without
thorough search of prior art. We can only speculate as
to why independent inventors patent inventions without much thought of commercial conditions. Maybe
the patenting fees for independent inventors are not
large enough to warrant sufficient effort in examining
the upside opportunity.9 Maybe they go through the
patenting process hoping that obtaining a patent will
open up licensing possibilities. If the latter is the case,
however, they are seriously mistaken. The likelihood
of obtaining license fees or royalties from a patent is
5 in 71 (7%). Indeed, it seems that the dominant mode
to commercial success is through commercialization
by the original inventor: 49 in 60 (82%). The latter
data are consistent with those reported by Amesse et
al. (1991). To learn more there is a need for research that
examines the decision-making process of independent
inventors.

measurement error than such conditions as expected
demand might result in an underestimation of the latter
effects. However, early assessment of these conditions
on the other hand avoids several other measurement
biases, most particularly hindsight bias.
Third, we estimated reduced-form models. Lacking
appropriate instruments the marginal effects in the second stage are biased towards OLS estimates. Moreover,
we did not analyze the degree to which an invention
provides financial returns. It may, for example, be the
case that technological significance increases returns,
while its effect on commercialization likelihood is negative. Further research is necessary to examine such
simultaneous and nested models.
5.2. Implications for research

Our analysis has three main limitations. First, and
similar to the Yale survey (Levin et al., 1987), we used
semantic scales to measure predictors. While previous
research has shown a high reliability of constructs
across a large sample of judges (Baker and Albaum,
1986), semantic scales introduce measurement
error.
Second, all measures are subjective assessments of
future expected states, and all forecasts were measured
with errors. The fact that reasonably contemporaneous
conditions such as technical features may have less

We extended previous research in several ways,
adding to recent work on technological opportunity
(Goldenberg et al., 2001; Shane, 2001a). First, it is clear
that technological opportunity is an important determinant for commercialization across a broad crosssection of inventions, not just high-tech. Despite the
low variance in technological opportunity across inventions in our sample – most are for consumer goods –
and despite the generally low assessed significance of
the inventions, technological opportunity proved to be
a very strong predictor of commercialization. Another
popular idea, one for which we found little support,
is that inventions by independent inventors have no
technological uncertainty. On the contrary, we found
technological uncertainty to have a significant impact
on invention commercialization.
One might well ask why independent inventors
focus on inventions in a domain where technological
opportunity appears to be rather limited and expected
profits are negative (Åstebro, 2003). Schmookler
(1962) would reply that in this domain independent
inventors are more exposed to problems that need a
solution.10 Another answer might be that independent

9 This suggestion was made by a referee. The referee also suggested that a partial explanation is ego gratification. Using a different
sample Dahlin et al. (2004) investigate whether independent inventors are heroes (inventors of significant technologies) or hobbyists
(patenting for ego gratification) and come to the conclusion that independent inventors are over-represented at both tails of the patenting
distribution compared to employed inventors.

10 Schmookler (1962) argues that chance encounters between
inventive talent and a problem needing a solution are more frequent
when there is a larger (and increasing) market. It is possible that such
reasoning explains why there is such a dominance of consumer goods
inventions in this sample. Consistent with this argument, there is a
recent stream of research documenting the increasing importance of
user-driven innovation (e.g., von Hippel and Katz, 2002).

5.1. Limitations

<-----Page 12----->1416

T.B. Åstebro, K.B. Dahlin / Research Policy 34 (2005) 1404–1418

inventors are supply-side constrained. They may lack
the technical expertise to invent in areas of greater
opportunity such as pharmaceuticals. Perhaps market
failures related to the financing of innovation for
independent inventors also constrain investors to
inventions with modest capital requirements and lower
opportunities. Another explanation, one based on the
results of this study, suggests that it is rational for
independent inventors to focus on inventions with less
technological opportunity since those are easier to commercialize. Further research on this topic is certainly
warranted.
At first glance, focusing on independent inventors
may seem to make the study less relevant, given the
modern day dominance of firm-level R&D. However,
independent inventors are a particularly important
source of patents in Canada (Amesse et al., 1991);
moreover, they are net contributors to economic
development (Åstebro, 2003). Furthermore, the
study’s design has several important benefits for producing a “clean” test of the impact of appropriability,
demand, opportunity, and competition on incentives.
It allows a better isolation of the positive incentives for
innovation afforded by legal protection and secrecy,
as it eliminates confounding effects of ex ante firm
size and R&D. The apparently ubiquitous reason
of patenting for strategic (blocking) reasons (Cohen
et al., 2000) is also likely of little concern in this
study.
5.3. Policy implications
A government’s intellectual property (IP) policy
is apparently important for conditioning independent
inventors’ efforts in one way but not in another. First,
since IP protection strongly affects patenting, greater
patent protection would likely increase the rate of
patenting and in turn increase commercialization odds.
Second, the rate of imitation seems to only marginally
shape the efforts of inventors. Stronger legal protection from IP infringements would therefore likely not
have much effect on inventors’ activities. Returning
to the first implication we, however, found independent inventors to patent for reasons not much related to
commercial conditions. Thus, further strengthening IP
protection may not be socially optimal in the sense that
more inventions would be brought to the market that
would not necessarily have much commercial value.

It appears to us more useful if a larger number of
poor ideas were discouraged from patenting while a
smaller number of good ideas were conversely encouraged to continue commercialization efforts. Raising
the cost of patenting would only accomplish the first
of the two objectives stated above. Another policy
that has been shown socially efficient and which
accomplish both previously stated objectives is to support agencies such as the CIC that pre-screens ideas
by independent inventors (Åstebro and Bernhardt,
1999).
5.4. Normative management implications
As R&D expenditures increase with development
efforts, it is clearly useful to screen out the likely
unsuccessful inventions as early as possible. Indeed,
an early-stage evaluation of the potential merits of an
R&D project has been shown to have considerable
value (Mansfield et al., 1977). Our results show promise
with regard to creating an early-stage screening
tool.
5.5. Future research
There are two results from this study that need to be
investigated further. First, what would cause commercialization rates to be inhibited by greater technological
significance once incentives have been controlled for?
Second, why do inventors seem oblivious to commercial conditions when patenting their inventions? We
need to better understand the mechanisms that cause
reduced commercialization opportunities for more significant technologies. We would also like to know the
decision process of inventors to better explain the latter
question.

Note: The explanation contains the exact statement of the indicator, as used by the IAP analysts between 1989 and 1993. A three-point scale
was used by the IAP to measure these: A (acceptable, which means that the criterion appears to be favorable or satisfactory), B (borderline—the
criterion rated as B needs to be improved or strengthened.), and C (critical weakness, meaning it may be necessary to discontinue the effort to
commercialize the project.) These were converted into numerical data according to the following: A = +1; B = 0; and C = −1.
