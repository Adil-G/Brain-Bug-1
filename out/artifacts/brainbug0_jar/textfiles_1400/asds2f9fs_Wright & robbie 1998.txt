VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY: A
REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS
Mike Wright and Ken Robbie*

The 1980s control activities, . . ., have demonstrated that the M&M [Modigliani
and Miller] theorems (while logically sound) are empirically incorrect. The
evidence from LBOs, leveraged restructurings, takeovers and venture capital firms
has demonstrated that leverage, payout policy and ownership structure (that is,
who owns the firm's securities) do in fact affect organizational efficiency, cash flow
and, therefore, value. (Jensen, 1993, p.868)

INTRODUCTION

In the last fifteen years, venture capital has emerged as an important area of
finance for academic researchers. This interest lags well behind the
development of the venture capital industry both in the US and elsewhere.
Venture capital is typically defined as the investment by professional investors
of long-term, unquoted, risk equity finance in new firms where the primary
reward is an eventual capital gain, supplemented by dividend yield. Earlier
reviews of the literature have covered the period up to 1981 (Tyebjee and
Bruno, 1981), from 1981 to 1988 (Fried and Hisrich, 1988) and more recent
research, although less exhaustively, by Barry (1994). The emphasis in these
earlier reviews has been on US studies which focus primarily on formal
venture capital as early stage finance, frequently with a high technology
aspect.
The purpose of this paper is to review and synthesise a wide body of research
relating to venture capital and thence to identify possible directions for future
research. In undertaking such a task it is important at the outset to identify
what is distinctive about venture capital and which justifies its separate

analysis within the field of corporate finance. These broad motivations can be
summarised as follows.
First, there are marked differences between venture capital and mainstream
corporate finance. Venture capital involves the financing of new or radically
changing firms which contrast in many important informational ways to
established companies quoted on a stock market, notably the problem of
asymmetric information. Venture capitalists are attracted to this kind of
investment because of the specific skills they perceive themselves to possess.
Second, venture capital has until recently been a relatively neglected area
in corporate finance. Even now, research is patchy and has not addressed the
full scope of possibilities offered by a broad interpretation of the term venture
capital. Although literature reviews are emerging which deal with a subset of
the new forms of organisations identified by Jensen in his presidential address
to the American Finance Association, and summarised in the quote at the start
of this paper (Jensen, 1993; Palepu, 1990; and Thompson and Wright, 1995),
these have tended to focus on buy-outs and recapitalisations not venture
capital.
Third, and leading on from the second, venture capital as noted already has
tended to be viewed narrowly as referring to new firms. However, venture can
be and is in practice increasingly used in firms undergoing radical
restructuring. Early stage and start-up funds account for only about six per
cent of the annual value of European venture capital investments (EVCA,
1995), with management buy-outs and buy-ins accounting for 46 per cent of
funds invested. Hence, the potential contribution of venture capital and
venture capitalists goes far beyond this limited perspective with the term
`private equity' increasingly being used. This opens up scope for the
development of both theory and empirical studies which provide comparative
analyses of the differing types of venture capital investment.
Fourth, there is an absence in the previous literature of a full examination of
the operation of the venture capital market as a whole. Fried and Hisrich
(1988) identify a model which focuses on the processes undertaken by venture
capital firms and the relationships between venture capital firms and their
funds' providers, however their review of the literature focuses on six topics
ö portfolio of venture capital firms, investment decisions, operations,
strategy, impact on the entrepreneur and public policy ö which are not linked
to their model. The review by Barry (1994) identifies on an ad hoc basis a
number of important issues relating to venture capital, that is, discussion of
what venture capitalists do, evidence on the success of venture capital, venture
capital and the going-public process, contracting technology between venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs and between venture capitalists and their
investors, and evidence on the positive role of venture capital.
In neither of these reviews is consideration given to the interplay of
competitive forces in the venture capital market and their implications for
venture capital firms. Where market imperfections remain problematical

and increasing competition reduces returns from super-normal towards
normal levels, firms are forced to seek new investment opportunities in less
problematical areas and/or to develop enhanced distinctive competencies at
identifying and monitoring investments. As will be seen in more detail below,
this helps to explain the frequently observed extension of maturing venture
capital markets into a wider range of investment activities which include
development capital, management buy-outs and buy-ins as well as early stage
investments.
On this basis, this paper for the first time analyses the issues involved in
venture capital at two interrelated levels, that is from the industry/market
level and the venture capital firm level (Figure 1). As will be seen, there is little
work on the demand side of the market, that is relating to the decision-making
process by which firms seek venture capital. Hence the principal focus of this
review concerns the operation of the supply side of the market, that is the
behaviour of venture capital firms.
Bruno (1986) shows that Porter's (1980) competitive forces model provides
a framework for reviewing industry level issues as it directly analyses the
ability of an industry to sustain long-term profitability by reference to the
degree of inter-firm rivalry, the power and roles of customers and suppliers,
new entrants and providers of substitute products and services. However,
within this framework, the degree to which individual firms contribute to
inter-firm rivalry will be influenced by the incentives and governance
mechanisms in place and its degree of success in undertaking the process of
investment in venture capital. Models of the venture capital investment
process (e.g. Fried and Hisrich, 1994) provide a means of structuring a review
of issues at the firm level which range from the initial generation of
transactions through to post-realisation.
Accordingly, the paper is structured as follows. The next section
summarises the links and distinctions between traditional mainstream
corporate finance theory and venture capital. The third section reviews the
literature at the industry and market level. This involves issues concerning
the structure and interaction of venture capital competitors, the power of
suppliers of funds to the industry, the power of customers in demanding and
searching for venture capital, the importance of substitute products
(especially informal venture capital, LBO Associations and banks), and the
role of new entrants. The fourth section reviews existing literature at the firm
level. This section focuses on the governance of venture capital firms by their
funds' providers and the process of venture capital investment in investee
companies. The latter raises issues concerning deal generation, initial and
second screening (pre-contracting problems), deal valuation and due
diligence, deal approval and structuring, post-contractual (general and
restructuring and failure), investment realization and entrepreneur's exit
and assessment by venture capitalists and post-exit monitoring and
recontracting. In the light of the industry/market level and firm level analyses,

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

the fifth section examines the evidence concerning the performance of the
venture capital industry. The final section presents conclusions and suggestions for further research. As already indicated, this review encompasses the
range of investment stage activities undertaken by venture capitalists, which
includes development and replacement capital, management buy-outs and
management buy-ins as well as early stage investments. Because of space
limitations the principal scope is restricted to the formal venture capital
industry,1 though reference is made to informal venture capital and other
competing sources of funds as appropriate.

VENTURE CAPITAL AND CORPORATE FINANCE

Mainstream corporate finance theory can be divided into two main
categories: the financing of investments and the undertaking of investments
(e.g. Brealey and Myers, 1996). The financing of investments primarily
involves analysis of the contracts whereby investors provide funds to the firm
in return for claims on the future values it produces. The undertaking of
investments concerns the use to which funds are put and in particular the
issues involved in making decisions about the investment of funds in capital
equipment, other companies, etc.
The existence of conflicts of interest, and associated informational
asymmetries, between shareholders and managers introduces an agency cost
problem which may affect a corporation's investment and financing decisions.
The optimal capital structure which deals with these issues involves both
considerations of the division of ownership between managers and outsiders
as well as the relative positions of debt and equity-holders (Jensen and
Meckling, 1976). The structuring of such arrangements has important
implications for the nature of corporate governance. In respect of the second
category, a major aspect of making investment decisions has been the
elaboration of a consistent and rational approach to the valuation of assets,
within which concepts such as the time value of money and risk return
relationships are fundamental. While these two dimensions of mainstream
corporate finance theory also relate to venture capital, the latter is distinct
from other forms of corporate finance in several ways as summarised in Table
1 and elaborated as follows.
Perhaps the key distinction between venture capital and mainstream
corporate finance relates to the problem of asymmetric information. Venture
capital investments are made in companies not quoted on stock markets,
where the investor trades-off the short term illiquidity in the shares held for
the prospects of a greater future return. As Fama (1991) has shown, the
available evidence suggests that private information in quoted companies is
rare; hence the development of passive investment strategies by investment
managers. In contrast, new and radically changing firms are characterised

in such monitoring may be able to achieve super-normal returns.2
Venture capitalists typically take a more active and interventionist role in
firm decision-making. In mainstream corporate finance theory, a number of
corporate governance mechanisms are directed at dealing with the agency
problem, notably shareholder voting rights to elect the board of directors,
directors' fiduciary duties, mechanisms for setting executive remuneration,
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 5----->526

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

independent (non-executive) directors, and the market for corporate control.
In venture capital investments, block ownership of equity can be considered as
an alternative governance mechanism to takeovers as a means of disciplining
managers. Venture capitalists are typically more actively involved than nonmanagement shareholders in quoted corporations, including institutional
shareholders. Venture capitalists' portfolios are likely to be relatively
undiversified compared to those of institutional investors, while executives
are more likely to have remuneration contracts more closely aligned to the
performance of their portfolio. The illiquidity of venture capitalists' equity
holdings also means that governance via exit in the short term is
problematical. The position of venture capitalists on the board should enable
more timely identification of when management should be changed than
would be possible by an outsider searching for a takeover target (Romano,
1996).
Venture capitalists can essentially be viewed as seeking a return on their
specific and distinctive skills in identifying, investing in and monitoring new
and/or radically changing firms (such as management buy-outs and buy-ins
undergoing restructuring). The need for the specific skills of venture
capitalists arises because of the problems of access to information in such firms
noted already and their capabilities in assessing risk and the type of financial
structure which can accommodate it. As such, access to capital differs from the
notion of an `anonymous' competitive capital market. Rather, the problem for
entrepreneurs is to identify those venture capitalists with the specific skills to
invest in their projects. The role of the specific skills of the venture capitalist
can be seen as taking an enterprise to a stage where other forms of financial
intermediation and corporate ownership and control are appropriate. It is
from this stage onwards that traditional corporate finance theory is focused.
Venture capitalists at this stage are likely to exit either immediately or over a
period of time and apply their skills in other ventures.
Venture capital is particularly appropriate in a specific subset of firms
which have non-redeployable or highly specialised assets. This together with
the greater uncertainty of cash flows in early stage new technology businesses
in particular suggests that equity finance as provided by a venture capitalist is
preferable to debt. Moreover, the concentrated ownership and direct board
position provided by venture capital is preferable to the diffuse ownership of
mainstream corporate finance theory because of the need for more timely
access to information and intervention to control management (Romano,
1996).
While in principle many of the valuation techniques developed in
mainstream corporate finance theory are applicable to venture capital
investments, and some such as real options approaches to valuation may be
particularly important as will be seen below, access to information may pose
particular problems. Early stage investments require valuation approaches
which can handle uncertain and/or rapidly growing future cash flows in
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 6----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

527

markets which may scarcely be established. Methods relying on constant
dividend payments, or even the payment of dividends at all, as well as those
which rely on historic information, are particularly problematical.
Venture capital typically involves for early stage projects the provision of
several rounds of finance rather than a one-off injection of funds. This brings
complications to the investment decision but may allow the investor to
exercise more control over management through the structuring of multistage contracts. Although, as we have noted already, there are important
differences between venture capital investments and projects in mainstream
corporate finance theory with regard to access to information, a further
difficulty for venture capitalists is that even closeness to the entrepreneur
may not lead to the revelation of full information. This raises major issues
about the nature of the monitoring relationship which we consider in detail
below.
The distinctiveness of venture capitalists from other sources of finance can
be identified in respect of the types of situations where each may, in general, be
appropriate. Banks can be typified as seeking to obtain a return from their
skills in screening and investing in well-established, relatively stable activities
which are not expected to undergo radical restructuring and which require a
relatively modest degree of monitoring. For these enterprises, information
availability is expected to be relatively reliable and robust, with the bank able
to identify with a high degree of certainty the existence of sufficient value in the
enterprise's assets to provide security for the debt finance which is to be
provided, thus behaving in a generally risk averse way. Also in contrast to
venture capitalists, strategic alliances between a relatively new enterprise
and an existing corporation enable the former to gain access to finance and
may in general be appropriate where the skills involved in the technology are
such that firms already in the industry are more knowledgable and skilled in
their development than would be possible for the venture capitalist to obtain.
This brief outline suggests that there is a distinct class of activities where
venture capital and venture capitalist involvement may be particularly
appropriate.3
In the sections which follow, especially that relating to the operation of the
venture capital process, notions of addressing the problems of asymmetric
information are extensively examined.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET LEVEL

From major initial developments in the US, there has been a diffusion of
venture capital market growth first to the UK and then throughout Europe
and beyond.4 Tyebjee and Vickery (1988) note the variation in maturity of
different venture capital markets in Europe, while Roure et al. (1990), Ooghe,
et al. (1991) and Murray (1995) argue that market development is likely to be
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 7----->528

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

associated with greater competition, reduced rates of return and a shift to later
stage investments. The following sub-sections review industry level issues
using Porter's competitive forces framework outlined in the Introduction.
Rivalry Between Firms
In analysing competition between formal venture capitalists it is important to
consider the investment stages they target since this provides an important
segmentation of the industry. In terms of investment stages, it has been
suggested that late-stage investors, especially investing in smaller buy-outs,
should not be considered venture capitalists (e.g. Bygrave and Timmons,
1992), though given that many such venture backed transactions can involve
considerable product and organisational innovation this argument seems
debatable (Wright, Robbie and Ennew, 1995). There is growing recognition
of the need to consider the portfolio mix of investment stages adopted by
venture capitalists (see e.g. Elango et al., 1995), a point to which we return
below. Moreover, industry statistics encompass in the term venture capital
all stages of investment. While some venture capitalists do invest across the
range of investment stages, others only invest in late stage projects. In 1995
later stage financings represented 96% of the total value of investments and
84% of the total number of financings made in that year by members of the
British Venture Capital Association (BVCA, 1996a).5 As much of the activity
of venture capitalists is focused on later stage investments, the term private
equity capitalists may increasingly be a more appropriate descriptor.
Power of Suppliers
Sourcing of funds used by venture capitalists can be divided into two principal
areas. `Captive' venture capitalists, which are part of banks or insurance
companies, do not have to raise capital from third parties (Abbott and Hay,
1995). In the UK they are often viewed as investing primarily in later stage
projects such as development capital and management buy-outs and buy-ins.
`Independent' firms tend to be seen as the more traditional type of venture
capitalist though in the UK at least many of these may only engage in later
stage transactions. They are typically funded through limited-life closed-end
funds, with funding coming from pension funds, foreign investors, etc., and are
more committed than captives to generating a return for investors through
realising a capital gain within a more clearly specified period of time; the latter
are more likely to place a higher emphasis on the income stream from their
investments. In 1995 independent venture capitalists accounted for 47 per
cent of new funds invested (BVCA, 1996). Murray (1995) notes the increasing
power of funds providers in a maturing market as evidence becomes available
on the nature of the performance of venture capitalists in investing previous
funds (we return to the evidence on performance below). Recent funding
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 8----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

529

developments, however, have meant that traditional captive institutions have
become more hybrid (or semi-captive) as they source funds from outside to
add to those provided by their parent bank or insurance company.
McNally (1994) provides an analysis of the role of corporations both as
direct (i.e. through corporate venturing) and indirect (i.e. through funds)
investors in venture capital and suggests that problems relating to mismatches in expectations between corporations and other parties in relation to
investment time scale and control mechanisms in particular have resulted in
major difficulties in the development of this source of finance.
Power of Customers
There has been relatively little attention to demand side issues although Bruno
and Tyebjee (1985) refer to the cost to the entrepreneur of the equity
relinquished, the effects of the long time that may be taken to raise venture
capital finance and the chances of raising venture capital from another
supplier when rejected by an initial venture capital firm. An important area
is the potential role of intermediaries. Hustedde and Pulver (1992) examined
the role of different types of intermediaries in securing venture funds for their
entrepreneurial clients. Their results showed that entrepreneurs who failed to
seek advice were more likely to be less successful in acquiring equity finance,
but that those using bankers or public agencies were likely to increase their
chances of failure. While providing interesting insights, the study focused
primarily on entrepreneurs seeking finance for early stage projects.
Evidence from Murray, et al. (1995), relating to management buy-outs
shows that management generally take the dominant role in the venture
capital identification process and, particularly, the final choice decision.
Given the considerable uncertainty of the process and the acknowledged
inexperience of most managers in respect of obtaining venture finance, it is
surprising that most managers in smaller deals (but not in larger ones) only
involve their key advisers late in the process, if at all.
These findings provide interesting insights into the relative power of
customers and have clear implications for both industry and, as will be seen
below, firm levels since they suggest an asymmetry in bargaining to the
advantage of the venture capitalist in respect of smaller transactions.6 There
has, however, been little attempt to address systematically the relative power
of entrepreneurial customers where their contribution to the venture is very
specific and difficult to replace. A further issue is raised in the particular
context of venture capital backed management buy-outs of divisions of larger
firms where the divestor is seeking to obtain the maximum price for the
disposal through an auction process.7 In such circumstances, incumbent
managers may or may not be able to exercise power over the venture
capitalist, depending on their specific contribution to the firm and the skills
the venture capitalist possesses in being able to replace them if necessary.
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 9----->530

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

These issues link to the firm level problems concerning deal generation and
screening to be considered below.
Threat of New Entrants
Manigart (1994) finds support for a population ecology approach to the entry
of firms into venture capital markets, with the major influences on the overall
founding rate being the density of the industry. Interestingly, institutional
changes were not found to be influential. Wright (et al., 1992) in examining
the management buy-out sector of the overall venture capital market suggest
that institutional changes are important at least in the initial stages of market
development, but that subsequently new entrants are encouraged by evidence
that attractive returns are being earned. Roure et al. (1990) also show that
greater market maturity is associated with entry by a greater variety of funds'
providers, especially by pension funds and insurance companies. Ooghe et al.
(1991) support this view and in addition find that public sector funds' providers
are more likely to exit. Relatively little attention has been directly addressed to
the influences on new entrants to markets from other countries. However,
Wright et al. (1992) and Murray (1995) find evidence from UK venture
capitalists that they are attracted to enter new markets in other countries
because of declining opportunities in their original market, their accumulated
expertise and perceived comparative advantage over domestic competitors in
new markets in seeking out and taking advantage of emerging opportunities.
These authors also consider the appropriateness of differing entry strategies
and suggest that a major problem is insufficient attention to developing an
understanding of the workings of new markets with in particular little regard
to the need to recruit local executives with the necessary market expertise.
There is, however, little systematic evidence as yet as to whether entrants'
behaviour is dynamic in the sense that they adapt their entry strategies
according to previous experience and differing market conditions.
Threat of Substitutes
In addition to the comparisons between mutual funds and venture capitalists
seen in the previous section, three other competing funders are of particular
interest, informal venture capitalists (or business angels), LBO Associations,
and banks.
Informal Venture Capitalists
Informal venture capitalists, or `business angels' are individuals who seek to
invest a part of their personal wealth in, typically, a minority equity stake in
an entrepreneurial venture.8 Evidence by Landstrom (1993) shows that there
are marked international differences between the involvement of informal
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 10----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

531

investors in their investee companies. In terms of transaction screening,
investors in the UK devote little attention whereas in the US it is moderately
high and in Sweden high. Post-transaction in the UK, such investors are
generally passive, in Sweden they are generally active, whilst in the US they
are active and highly involved in day-to-day activities. US informal investors
take the highest risk in their portfolio of investments. Contrary to views that
informal investors are less constrained by the need to earn returns in a
specified period, Landstrom finds their exit horizons were usually less than five
years. There is also some evidence that informal venture capital markets are
inefficient in terms of the communications channels between investors and
entrepreneurs (Mason and Harrison, 1992; and Freear and Wetzel, 1990).9
An important issue concerns the extent to which agency theory applies as
well to informal as it does to formal venture capitalists. Landstrom (1992),
finds little evidence that the involvement of business angels in monitoring their
investments will vary according to the level of agency risk and suggests that
the agency framework is inappropriate. He argues that the assumptions
applicable in agency theory which concern rational economic maximising
behaviour, asymmetric information and conflicting objectives are not valid
in the case of informal investors since they are more motivated by noneconomic factors, have a desire to make a value-added contribution and are
able to mitigate asymmetric information problems through prior
relationships and close involvement in the business.
However, it is necessary to understand the differing approaches of the two
types of venture capitalists towards two types of risk. Fiet (1995b) finds that
formal venture capitalists attach more importance to market risk than agency
risk and vice versa and argues that formal venture capitalists are less
concerned about agency risk because they protect themselves from it through
stringent contracting which enables them to replace underperforming
entrepreneurs. Informal venture capitalists who screen very few deals per year
have access to comparatively limited information and place more emphasis on
agency risk, that is finding the `right' entrepreneur who will be able to address
market risk. Fiet (1995a) also shows that formal venture capitalists make
greater use of formal informant networks and that they prefer their own due
diligence to reliance on informal networks.10
There is also evidence (Ehrlich et al., 1994) of significant differences
between formal and informal venture capitalists in respect of investee
monitoring, with the former providing more difficult targets, and greater
feedback and involvement in monitoring especially when the firm is
experiencing problems. These differences may arise because private investors
neither have the time, expertise nor flexibility to engage in close monitoring,
so that formal venture capitalists may be more appropriate for entrepreneurs
with high technical but low managerial skills and vice versa for private
investors. These arguments suggest that agency theory is also of importance
for informal investors, but that greater emphasis is placed on ex ante rather
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 11----->532

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

than ex post issues. To trust an investee entrepreneur to manage market risk,
the informal investor will have had to develop skills for dealing with adverse
selection problems. In the absence of these skills business angels may react by
not investing (`virgin angels') despite screening large numbers of potential
investments.
LBO Associations
There is some considerable degree of overlap between specialist providers of
funds to buy-outs (LBO Associations, Jensen, 1989) and venture capitalists
(Sahlman, 1990). Both invest funds on behalf of other institutions and
although there is a degree of heterogeneity in the forms they take, both are
often, especially in the US, organized as limited partnerships. Both cases
involve relationship investment with management, managerial compensation
is oriented towards equity and there are likely to be severe penalties for
underperformance. The principal differences concern the nature of the
relationship between investor and investee and that in investments by LBO
Associations most of the funding required to finance an acquisition is through
debt. Sahlman (1990) in comparing LBO Associations with venture
capitalists notes that executives in the former may typically assume control of
the board of directors but are generally less likely than venture capitalists to
assume operational control. Investments by venture capitalists, which may
also involve buy-outs as well as start-ups and development capital, make
greater use of equity and quasi-equity.11 These differing relationships and
financing instruments may be used to perform similar functions in different
types of enterprise, so widening the applicability of the active investor concept
within the Anglo-American system of corporate governance (Wright et al.,
1994).
Banks
While the overall need of small and growing firms to have bank finance has
been widely researched, Chan et al. (1990) raise the issue of the need to explore
the conditions which lead to the simultaneous existence of banks and venture
capitalists.12 They suggest that venture capitalists may have advantages over
banks in providing finance in settings where entrepreneurial skills are highly
uncertain at the outset and the role of close monitoring is potentially
significant. As banks begin to develop close long term relationships involving
detailed information flows with their corporate customers (Binks and Ennew,
1995; and Holland, 1994), there would appear to be increasing convergence
with the approach adopted by venture capitalists. Moreover, the problems
faced by venture capitalists in respect of adverse selection and their response
in terms of increased price versus refusal to fund is analogous to issues
concerning the so-called finance gap (De Meza and Webb, 1987). There is
also evidence relating to the role and operation of debt covenants in
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 12----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

533

management buy-out investments, that in the UK at least these are operated
in a more flexible manner than might have been supposed (Citron, Robbie
and Wright, 1997). These developments suggest a need to compare the
investment selection and monitoring behaviour of banks and venture
capitalists as the overlap in their activities increases.

FIRM LEVEL

In examining firm level issues it is useful to view venture capitalists as facing a
two-level principal-agent relationship between themselves and their providers
of capital and between themselves and the managers of the companies in
which they invest (Sahlman, 1990). Firstly, in respect of the relations between
venture capital firms and their funds' providers, the previous section has
shown that venture capital firms obtain their funding from a range of sources
each with their own objectives. However, the availability of alternative outlets
for funds and evidence from performance with previous tranches of funds
provides a measure of power in the dynamic context where venture capital
firms need to raise second and subsequent rounds of funds to invest in further
projects. Not only does this raise issues as to whether or not funds' providers
will extend funds, it also raises issues concerning their governance of venture
capital firms in order to help ensure that their objectives are met. Hence as
agents, venture capital firms may be faced with the risk that if they do not
perform satisfactorily they will fail to attract further funding. Secondly,
venture capital firms as principals face problems in screening potential
investments due to both uncertainty and adverse selection problem and moral
hazard problems in the post-investment monitoring of their investee
companies. Reid et al. (1995) show that venture capitalists attempt to manage
the risks involved in their activities, firstly through fine filters on proposals,
high hurdle rates of return and being strongly resistant to downside risk
exposure to address adverse selection and secondly, through tight monitoring
and an unwillingness to bear all the risk in order to address moral hazard
issues. Each of these two firm level aspects is considered in turn.
Governance of Venture Capital Firms
A pioneering study by Sahlman (1990) examines the nature of the principalagent relationship between funds providers and venture capitalist and
identifies the mechanisms used to help minimise these problems, which
include incentives for mutual gain, the specific prohibition of certain acts on
the part of the venture capitalist which would cause conflicts of interest,
limited life agreements, mechanisms to ensure gains are distributed to
investors, expenditure of resources on monitoring the venture capitalist and
the regular provision of specific information to the funds providers by the

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

venture capitalist. The terms of the contract both communicate the expectations of funds providers and filter out those venture capitalists who are unable
to meet these requirements. Venture capitalists' remuneration is typically
based on an annual management fee plus some percentage of the realised
profits from the fund. Sahlman points out that good venture capitalists by
accepting a finite funding life and performance dependent compensation are
signalling their quality in relation to weak ones, but that the funds' provider
has to invest in intensive screening in order to guard against false signalling.
A significant agency problem may also arise in the valuation of investments
for the purposes of reporting to providers of funds. It is venture capitalists as
agents who are responsible for such valuations and on which their performance will be judged (Fried and Hisrich, 1994). However, since it may take
many years for a venture capital investment to come to fruition, considerable
subjectivity surrounds the valuation of investments in any particular year
before the investment is realised. In the absence of clear and `complete' rules,
management may have the scope and incentive to report biased interim
investment values. The adoption of different valuation practices also makes it
difficult to compare the performance of individual venture capital firms. In
the UK, the BVCA in an attempt to produce a more consistent approach to
valuation, has introduced guidelines which recommended four appropriate
valuation methods for its members (BVCA, 1993). However, venture
capitalists have the discretion to decide themselves which one they will adopt.
The Venture Capital Process
The stages in the venture capital funding, assessment and monitoring process
have been analyzed in a number of studies (e.g. Bygrave and Timmons, 1992;
Fried and Hisrich, 1994; MacMillan, et al., 1985; Tyebjee and Bruno, 1994;
and Sweeting, 1991b). These stages have been identified from direct analysis
of the operation of venture capitalist's operations and have been based on
approaches which have sought to develop an understanding of what it is that
venture capitalists do (Figure 1). Identification of these stages helps to
highlight the inter-linkages between them. As becomes clear in what follows,
however, the greater body of research has tended to focus on issues raised by
individual stages.
A clear gap in the literature to date has been the failure to recognise the
dynamic nature of the process. That is, there is a need to consider the
possibility that venture capitalists may seek to reinvest in entrepreneurs who
have exited from their existing portfolios. Recognising this dynamic nature of
venture capital investment extends previous approaches by explicitly
incorporating reinvestment into the model. As will be seen below this
dimension may raise new issues for the venture capital investment process.
The following sub-sections review evidence relating to the venture capitalistinvestee stages in turn.

Deal Generation
At the beginning of the venture capital process it is crucial to obtain access to
viable projects which can be funded at entry prices which will generate target
rates of return. The difficulties faced by venture capitalists because of
entrepreneurs' search and decision processes, and increases in competition
between venture capitalists noted earlier, serve to highlight the importance
of a deal generation strategy. While there has been attention to these issues
by practitioners, there has been relatively little academic research.
Deal generation is closely linked at the strategic level to venture capitalists'
preferences with respect to investment stages and deal size, as well as to the
availability of information and the recruitment of venture capitalist
executives with the specific skills to seek out transactions (Murray, 1995; and
Bygrave and Timmons, 1992). There is some evidence from both the US and
the UK which draws attention to the implications for deal generation of
differences between the regional locations of venture capitalists and those of
potential investees (Murray et al., 1995). As seen earlier, problems here link
back to an understanding of the dynamics of the power of customers in
differing segments of the market. Operationally, issues are raised which
concern the comparative net benefits of proactive versus reactive approaches.
In an environment of increasing competition for deals there appears to be a
move towards more proactive approaches, even though this involves increased
costs and may require greater technical as well as financial skills, which may
only be possessed by certain segments of the market.
Initial and Second Screening ö Pre-contracting Problems
At the time that a venture capital investment is being considered, institutions
are faced with a potential adverse selection problem in that they are unable to
gauge the manager's performance in the enterprise prior to deal completion
(Amit et al., 1990). Adverse selection issues also raise crucial problems in the
potential effectiveness of post-transaction monitoring by institutional
investors (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981). To the extent that these problems lead
investors to misjudge the situation, a deal and accompanying financial
structure may be agreed which is inappropriate and possibly unviable. As a
result, the control mechanism introduced by the commitment to meet the cost
of servicing external finance may lead to sub-optimal decisions.
Amit et al. (1990) develop a model which examines the nature of the
adverse selection problem for venture capitalists. The general assumption is
made that the entrepreneur knows his own ability level, whereas the venture
capitalist does not. In an initial case it is assumed that the entrepreneur is risk
neutral and no new investment is needed. In such conditions, only
entrepreneurs with below average ability will choose to involve a venture
capitalist who, because of the absence of information, makes a bid to fund a
project on the basis of the average ability level. This will result in a negative
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 16----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

537

net present value investment and because of the severity of the adverse
selection problem the market breaks down. Relaxing this assumption to allow
for risk averse entrepreneurs may still mean that only low-ability entrepreneurs accept the venture capitalists' bid while the high ability ones develop
ventures on their own.13 Venture capitalists may enter a low bid because they
fear the consequences of over-bidding for projects which subsequently are
revealed as poor performers. In so doing, they may attract less skilful
entrepreneurs but they may also attract some higher ability entrepreneurs
who are seeking risk-sharing. However, the dynamics of a competitive market
may mean that the price of a bid is driven up and higher bids are needed to
entice more high-powered entrepreneurs. Hence, the venture capitalist may
be forced back to offering premia for the projects of low-ability entrepreneurs.
This model provides interesting and potentially important insights into the
operation of a venture capital market and may go some way to explaining the
phenomenon that subsequently successful ventures may initially have been
refused venture capital finance, together with the relatively low amounts of
venture capital funding of early stage investments where information asymmetry problems are most serious. However, the model does not incorporate a
number of essential features which may help our theoretical understanding of
this stage of the venture capital process. The paper assumes that entrepreneurs
can invest in effort to perfectly reveal their skills in order to eliminate
information asymmetries. Important extensions would be to consider the case,
firstly, of imperfectly revealed information which would reduce but not
eliminate information asymmetries. Secondly, the issue could be considered
from the perspective of venture capitalists who may not simply accept a state
of (near) ignorance about the entrepreneur but may expend effort and costs in
seeking to reduce information asymmetries and provide a more efficient means
of matching entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. Sweeting (1991b), for
example, points out that venture capitalists have been particularly proactive
in deal generation in an attempt to reduce adverse selection problems by
becoming more involved with entrepreneurs at an earlier stage. Other sections
below consider the evidence relating to post-transaction information
generation by venture capitalists. Consideration of both the entrepreneur's
and the venture capitalist's perspectives suggests scope for the development of
a game theoretic approach to information revelation. The authors also assume
that once the decision is made to go with a venture capitalist, the author turns
over to them the right to determine the sharing agreement. An interesting
extension would be to develop a model of bargaining in the negotiation of the
venture capital contract in such circumstances.
There may also be scope for theoretical development of the venture
capitalist's approach to bidding (pricing), for example to consider the nature
of performance contingent contracts rather than one-off agreements.
Moreover, the extent to which venture capitalists raise the price of their
involvement or simply refuse to invest is debatable. The use of performance

<-----Page 17----->538

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

contingent contracts is one reflection of how venture capitalists may raise the
price but this is typically used where the venture capitalist is satisfied about the
quality of management but there is disagreement about the level and timing of
meeting forecast performance.
The nature of the adverse selection problem may not be constant with all
entrepreneurial ventures, but may vary with the stage and sector of an
investment. In a buy-out, investing institutions may be guided by incumbent
management's experience in post and their knowledge of the business, though
management may have an incentive not to reveal full information in an
attempt to obtain the most favourable terms. In a buy-in as the entrepreneur
comes from outside there may be problems of asymmetric information, both in
relation to their true skills and an inability to observe the manager in post ex
ante (Robbie and Wright, 1996). In development capital situations it may be
difficult to judge whether the entrepreneur's previous performance will
continue in the future where his/her equity stake is diluted by the introduction
of venture capital. The informational asymmetry problems may also be more
intractable in the case of complex high-tech/bio-tech ventures than for more
straightforward ventures using existing technology, which raise issues concerning the specialist skills of both the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist.
Further theoretical developments might usefully attempt to model these
different situations. Empirical studies may also help to identify the extent
and nature of potential adverse selection problems.
Empirical studies examining venture capitalist investment criteria have
evolved from descriptive studies of the variables taken into account to those
which attempt to identify the relative importance of various criteria using a
variety of rating and ranking scales and principally focused on start-ups (e.g.
Bruno and Tyebjee, 1985; MacMillan et al., 1985 and 1987; Hall and Hofer,
1993; and Rah et al., 1994). However, whilst these approaches implicitly
consider adverse selection issues, there has been a tendency for them to be
atheoretical.
MacMillan et al. (1987) show that the most important criteria used by
venture capitalists in screening investment proposals were entrepreneurial
personality and experience, with lesser dependence being placed on market,
product and strategy. In a replication study, Fried et al. (1993), show that six
years on, venture capitalists were more concerned with market acceptance and
less demanding of high potential rates of return and quick exit, which these
authors see as a more realistic view of venture potential. However, while
providing useful insights, these studies are open to a number of criticisms: they
focus primarily on early stage investments rather than later stage; they primarily
use rating scales where individual respondents may attach differing importance
to a particular score; they generally use mail questionnaires which may fail to
obtain the full essence of the screening process; and they fail to identify the
trade-offs venture capitalists need to make between different criteria.
In a critique of the questionnaire-based methodology and early stage focus
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 18----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

539

of many previous studies, Fried and Hisrich (1994) use detailed analysis of the
process adopted by venture capitalists in specific cases covering the full range
of investment stages. They suggest that venture capitalists use three generic
criteria for screening investments ö the viability and novelty of the project;
the integrity, track record and leadership skills of management; and the
possibility for high returns and an exit ö before proceeding to detailed
evaluation. Muzyka et al. (1995) emphasise that venture capitalists have to
make trade-offs between various criteria in their screening of investments,
and that previous approaches fail to take this into account. Using conjoint
analysis, Muzyka et al. conclude that venture capitalists would prefer to select
an opportunity which offers a good management team and reasonable
financial and product market characteristics, even if the opportunity does
not meet the overall fund and deal requirements.
These last results are consistent with Wright and Robbie (1996) who show
that venture capitalists place considerable emphasis on the specific attributes
of a potential investee company both in relation to assessment of its value and
the rate of return to be expected from it. While accounting information is an
important element in deal screening and in arriving at a valuation and a
target rate of return, venture capitalists place most emphasis on very detailed
scrutiny of all aspects of a business, typically including sensitivity analysis of
financial information, discussions with personnel and accessing considerably
more information of an unpublished and subjective kind. This use of
information is quite different from that found in studies of investment analysts
dealing with quoted companies (e.g. Arnold and Moizer, 1984).
There is some debate in the US literature about the extent to which the use
of non-accounting information varies between stage of investment (Elango et
al., 1995; and Fried and Hisrich, 1994). There appears to be greater consensus
that later stage investors will be more interested in market acceptance of a
product. Early stage investors emphasise a range of product strength and
market growth characteristics, particularly as early stage transactions are
technology based with little available data on market acceptance.
Valuation and Due Diligence
Standard corporate finance theory states that the return an investor seeks on
an investment is a function of the non-diversifiable risk of the investment
(Brealey and Myers, 1996). According to CAPM, the required return should
be positively related to the long term, risk free interest rate and to the
difference between the expected return of the stock market and the long term,
risk free interest rate. DCF and discounted dividend yield methods whilst
theoretically correct pose particular problems in a venture capital investment
context. With the DCF approach it is difficult to forecast future cash flows in
the typically highly uncertain environment of a start-up, so that the expected
error of the forecast will increase. It may be difficult to apply the dividend
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 19----->540

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

yield method to early stage investments which rarely pay significant
dividends. The expected increase in the value of the venture is thus unlikely
to be reflected in the dividend stream at least in the short term, though a
significantly higher value may have been generated at the time of the exit of
the venture capitalist. Options theory offers a potential interesting theoretical
development in respect of the valuation of venture capital investments since
much of the value is derived from options being created on the future growth
of the investment as a result of new opportunities. Venture capital investments
give rise to two types of options. The multi-stage nature of venture capital
investments, see below, presents an opportunity to invest now with the option
of investing further at a later date. The investor has no obligation to make
subsequent investments but can wait until new information reveals the true
nature of potential benefits. Since further investment is a right not an
obligation, the investor possesses a valuable option on the value of the
investee. A second type of option arises from the nature of venture capital
projects since investments in company-specific knowledge may result in future
cash flows that either far exceed initial outlays or total loss, either of which
may be difficult to predict. Dixit and Pindyck (1995) show that options theory
has clear implications for the raising of venture capital since financial market
participants will place greater value on the investments which create options
and be more hesitant to finance those which exercise options. Thus as new
technology projects proceed from exploration to production, hurdle rates will
rise and venture capital becomes more difficult to raise.
Evidence suggests that venture capital projects are typically valued by
applying one or more valuation techniques to the financial and accounting
information relating to the potential investee typically contained in the
business plan submitted by management to the venture capitalist (Wright
and Robbie, 1996). Forward looking information in the Business Plan may
be subject to sensitivity analysis both by management and their advisers and
by the venture capitalist according to the expected influence on future
performance of other information. Most importance appears to be attached
to price earnings multiples based valuation methods (Wright and Robbie,
1996), particularly among later stage investors, but with greater emphasis on
DCF based methods than is the case for assessment of quoted companies by
investment analysts (Arnold and Moizer, 1984). The process is likely to
involve several iterations based on assumptions about the future trend in
performance to test the robustness of the point at which the proposed venture
meets an acceptable IRR, the most common measure of performance used in
the industry (Murray, 1991). Dixon (1991) using data relating to the buoyant
economic conditions of the late 1980s suggests that little scrutiny of
information to assess risk and adjust target IRRs takes place. However,
Wright and Robbie (1996) indicate that by the early-mid 1990s venture
capitalists were undertaking widespread assessment of risk. Moreover,
Murray and Lott (1995) show that venture capitalists perceive technology

<-----Page 20----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

541

based projects to be more risky than alternative later stage projects and use a
higher target rate of return in assessing them, but also that the stage of
financing is significantly more important in determining project risk than the
state of technology involved.
A variety of issues broadly categorised as time restrictions, cost constraints
and situational factors, may directly impact the level of due diligence during
an acquisition process (Harvey and Lusch, 1995). Evidence from buy-ins
(Robbie and Wright, 1996) identifies a major problem related to the ability
to obtain adequate up to date information concerning the target company.
While due diligence is expected to be undertaken in a thorough manner, its
cost in relation to transaction value in smaller buy-ins and time constraints in
negotiations, meant that this ideal was difficult to achieve. There are
indications that venture capitalists have adapted to such asymmetric
problems through recent developments involving hybrid inside and outside
management and investor buy-outs, where there is direct negotiation between
vendors and venture capitalists.
Deal Approval and Structuring
Appropriate structuring of venture capital investments has important
implications for the ability of venture capitalists to earn their target rates of
return. Sahlman (1990) shows that venture capitalists use various mechanisms to encourage entrepreneurs both to perform and to reveal accurate
information.14 These mechanisms include staging of the commitment of
investment funds, convertible financial instruments (`equity ratchets') which
may give financiers control under certain conditions, basing compensation on
value created, preserving mechanisms to force agents to distribute capital and
profits, and powers written into Articles of Association which require
approval for certain actions to be sought from the investor(s).
Theoretical work by Chan et al. (1990) provides a two-period agency model
to explain the nature of these venture capitalist contracts. Venture capitalists
are assumed to be competitive and risk neutral while entrepreneurs are
considered risk averse. Both parties are assumed to have the skill to control
production, but the entrepreneur's skill is unknown at the time of the contract
negotiation and capital investment. In the first `developmental' phase of the
project a cash flow is generated and reinvested in the project and it is this
which reveals the entrepreneur's skill to the venture capitalist. Based on this
information, the venture capitalist determines whether to allow the entrepreneur to control the project for the second period or to transfer control to
the venture capitalist. The cash flow produced at the end of the second period
is shared between the two parties in accordance with initially agreed
contracts.
Although the authors point out that their results are likely to change little if
assumptions about the certainty of external factors are relaxed, their
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 21----->542

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

assumption that the venture capitalist can run the project if the entrepreneur
fails to perform raises important issues. Since one of the key issues in such
investments concerns the specific skills of the entrepreneur, the notion of
venture capitalists being able to control production requires some
explanation. There are doubts about whether venture capitalists have the
skills to control production at the detailed operational level where the
entrepreneur's skills may arguably be most central (Gorman and Sahlman,
1989). Evidence (see below) suggests that they intervene primarily at the
strategic level and that this is very limited because of resource constraints.
Venture capitalists may take control of the project from the entrepreneur but
need to find a further entrepreneur with the requisite skills to control the
project; this in itself raises further problems.
An important feature of many venture capital investments, especially early
stage ones, is the staggering of financing into several rounds. Staging of
investments, however, can lead to myopia and over-investment where initially
entrepreneurs and subsequently first round venture capitalists as insiders
present misleading information to outsiders in an attempt to persuade them to
invest. An important theoretical issue arises which concerns how contracts are
to be structured under these conditions of multi-stage investment decisions.
Cooper and Carleton (1979) develop a model of optimal continuation
decisions in a multistage venture capital project in which the venture
capitalist is the sole provider of funds throughout the life of the project. Both
the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur make decisions at each stage about
whether to continue to the next stage. However, Cooper and Carleton do not
consider the possibility of asymmetric information nor the potential role of the
venture capitalist as an intermediary between the entrepreneur and outside
investors.
Admati and Pfleiderer (1994) in attempting to address the issue of agency
problems in the continuation decision provide one of the few rigorous
theoretical studies in the existing venture capital literature. Their model
assumes three investment stages: initial access by the entrepreneur to a project
requiring immediate investment, which requires additional investment in the
second period; successful financing in the first period leads to a second period
in which additional funding must be made if the project is to continue; and if
the decision to continue is made in the light of information becoming
available, the total payoff is realized in the third period.
The authors initially assume risk neutrality, which is later relaxed, no
discounting, limited liability, a competitive capital market and asymmetric
information. Two possibilities are considered for the entrepreneur to obtain
financing. First in an entrepreneur-led financing, the entrepreneur approaches outside investors in each of the two investment stages. Alternatively,
the entrepreneur can involve a venture capitalist who provides all of the
finance in the first stage and some of the capital needed in the second stage. If
financing is entrepreneur-led, the state of the world is observed only by the
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 22----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

543

entrepreneur. If financing is provided by a venture capitalist, both the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist are assumed to observe the state of the
world. Other providers of finance in the second stage do not observe the state.
Admati and Pfleiderer's analysis shows that with venture capitalist
financing a contract in which venture capitalists continue to maintain the
same fraction of equity in the various rounds of financing a project can
neutralize a venture capitalist's incentive to mislead. With entrepreneur-led
financing this situation does not hold as there does not exist a fully revealing
signalling equilibrium which would resolve asymmetric information problems. Relaxing the assumption of risk neutrality in the case of venture capital
financing requires the contract to be designed to address risk-sharing issues.
With a fixed-fraction contract, it is possible to vary the division of pay-offs
between entrepreneurs and outside investors who put up capital in the second
stage as opposed to the initial venture capitalists. The entrepreneur's risk can be
reduced by giving outside investors warrants which can be exercised in the
event of high pay-off realisations to give outside investors a large share of the
equity and vice versa in poor performance situations. Syndication in the first
stage of the project can also be a means of sharing risk; the lead venture capitalist
as inside investor being given a fixed-fraction contract and making the
continuation decisions, while syndicate members are given securities which
reduce the risk of the entrepreneur. Admati and Pfleiderer argue that this
analysis is consistent with the notion that venture capitalists often form
syndicates with different types of contracts and different responsibilities with
respect to monitoring for different capital providers. Bygrave (1988) finds that
an important reason for syndication is to share information to reduce
uncertainty and that this may be as important, if not more important, than the
spreading of financial risk. Lerner (1994a) also finds support for this view and
for the argument that typical later-round syndication involves less experienced
venture capitalists investing in a deal begun by established organisations.
Given issues relating to effecting post-contractual monitoring, to which we
return below, the extent and nature of syndication may be dynamic. Venture
capitalists may in effect search over time for a network of syndicate partners
with whom they are able both to complete transactions and undertake effective
monitoring. This aspect of syndication has received little research attention.
Admati and Pfleiderer focus on the benefits of venture capital financing but
omit consideration of the costs of monitoring venture capital projects. They
also ignore the costs of information gathering by the venture capitalist, which
may be significant notwithstanding signalling behaviour by the entrepreneur.
A commitment to fixed-ratio contract over subsequent rounds may be
problematical where initial venture capitalists seek to exit early (e.g. because
of the demands of their limited-life funds providers). It may also be argued
that even at the second stage of funding the original venture capitalist may
experience a significant asymmetric information problem. Though something
of an insider from the earlier round(s), this is likely to be imperfect given the
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 23----->544

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

constraints on venture capital executives' time and the involvement of venture
capitalists at a more strategic rather than operational level. This problem
suggests that the asymmetric information problems which arise at the time of
the initial intervention of the venture capitalist are unlikely to be fully
resolved. Indeed, although the authors assume no asymmetric information
between the entrepreneur and capital providers at the first stage it is often
precisely at this stage that asymmetric information exists.
Since monitoring is costly and cannot be performed continuously the
venture capitalist will periodically check the project's status and preserve the
option to abandon at each stage. Sweeting (1991a) and Mitchell et al. (1995)
show that part of the contractual measures adopted by venture capitalists are
accounting information demands which are designed to deal with moral
hazard and information asymmetry problems and provide safeguards through
bonding arrangements. Accounting information flows were typically required
on a more regular and more detailed basis than are statutory requirements for
quoted companies.
Gompers (1995) and Gompers and Lerner (1994) examine agency and
monitoring costs in the staging of venture capital investments. They find
evidence to support the view that the monitoring process provides valuable
information which enables the venture capitalist to cut off new financing in
the light of negative information about future returns and provide more
financing and a greater number of rounds of financing in the more successful
transactions. However, they also note that though venture capitalists
periodically check-up on entrepreneurs between capital infusions, entrepreneurs still have private information about the projects they manage.
Hence, the nature and effectiveness of the monitoring process, which we
examine below, is of considerable importance.
Little theoretical attention has been devoted to the range of financial
instruments used by venture capitalists. Norton and Tenenbaum (1992) find
that venture capitalists favoured the use of preference shares regardless of the
presence or absence of deal specific influences, and that the use of debt was
consequent on expectations that the investment would shortly generate
taxable income, would have collateralizable assets, would have products
resistant to the economic cycle and that the investment was more likely to be
later stage. A follow-up study (Norton and Tennenbaum, 1993) examines the
link between financing structures, financing stages and venture capitalists'
characteristics. They find that smaller less diversified venture capitalists make
greater use of ordinary equity instruments, but the use of preference shares did
not increase in higher risk (early) stage investments nor did investors who were
subject to greater amounts of unsystematic risk make greater use of preferred
instruments.
A particular theoretical and practical problem concerns the consequences
of the venture capitalist and the entrepreneur failing to agree on the degree to
which the venture will be profitable, with consequent implications for the split
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 24----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

545

between the equity stake attributable to each. Such differences may arise
because of differing views of an uncertain situation and because of the agency
cost problem when entrepreneurs own less than all the equity (Jensen and
Meckling, 1976). Chua and Woodward (1993) suggest that this problem can
be addressed through the use of stock options in the financing structure which
provides entrepreneurs with an incentive to perform since they increase the
cost to the entrepreneur of excessive consumption of perks. Similar devices
have been used extensively in practice, termed `equity ratchets' in the UK.
Available evidence suggests that they may pose major problems in terms of
specifying (relatively) complete contracts concerning the definition of
financial performance to be used, manipulation of information by managers,
and the timing of their crystallisation15 (Thompson and Wright, 1991). These
problems may lead to major relationship difficulties between the venture
capitalist and the entrepreneur.
Post-Contractual Monitoring
General
As noted above, post-contractual asymmetric information problems have
major implications for the nature and effectiveness of venture capitalists'
monitoring of investments. The agency theory perspective adopted above
focused on the contractual structures involved in monitoring. However, an
important aspect of monitoring concerns the relative roles of contractual
mechanisms and processes.
Barney et al. (1989) examine the influences on the degree to which
elaborate governance mechanisms are used by venture capitalists and found
that high agency risks and business risks were associated with more elaborate
governance structures. In a complementary paper, Sapienza and Gupta
(1994) focus on the processes of monitoring by venture capitalists. In an
important and innovative study which, unusually in this area, used matched
pairs of lead venture capitalists and CEOs of investee companies, they find
using US data that the frequency of interaction between the two parties
depends on the extent of the CEOs' new venture experience, the venture's
stage of development, the degree of technological innovation being pursued
and the extent of goal congruence between the CEO and the venture
capitalist. Contrary to expectations they find that the degree of management
ownership had no impact on the frequency of interaction. This study's findings
are of interest since they show that even with goal congruence, in an uncertain
new business environment, signals regarding the appropriate course of action
may be weak, leading to expectations of disagreements between investors and
investees and a need for greater exchange of information to identify the
appropriate course of action. Moreover, the finding concerning the effect of
management ownership suggests that where a high level of managerial
ownership is present, there is little reason to expect incentive-related shirking

à

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 25----->546

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

so that further adjustments to incentive mechanisms may be ineffective. The
need for interaction is emphasised as the idiosyncratic knowledge possessed by
the venture's founders may be virtually irreplaceable (we return to this issue in
the next sub-section). A subsequent four country study which included the US
data plus data from the UK, France and the Netherlands suggests that some of
these results may be country specific (Sapienza et al., 1996), thus emphasising
the need to understand the inter-linkages between the nature of the venture
capital environment and appropriate monitoring mechanisms and processes.
A number of other studies have examined the links between the process of
monitoring and the choice of the venture capitalist, the demands of a
particular investment situation, the skills level of venture capitalists and the
stage of the investment.
MacMillan, Kulow and Khoylian (1989) show that differing levels of
involvement in venture capital investments was not related to the nature of
the operating business but to the choice exercised by the venture capital firm
itself as to the general style it wished to adopt. There were, however, no
significant differences in the performance of businesses subject to differing
levels of involvement. Sapienza et al. (1992) provide evidence that there is less
involvement by venture capitalists in monitoring activities which are more
developed and presumably less risky. Elango et al. (1995) identify three levels
of assistance by venture capitalists in their investees, but surprisingly, they find
that this involvement is not primarily related to the stage of investment.
However, there were major variations in the amount of time spent and
severity of actions taken by different venture capitalists on problem investees.
Barry (1994) cites evidence that venture capitalists intensify their monitoring
activities as the need dictates. Venture capitalist representation on the board
is found to increase around the time of chief executive turnover, while the
number of other outsiders remains constant, according to evidence from the
bio-technology industry, i.e. an early stage sector (Lerner, 1995).
Rosenstein et al. (1993) find that the value added by venture capitalists on
the investee's board was not rated significantly higher by CEOs than that of
other board members and that entrepreneurs valued venture capitalists with
operating experience more than those with purely financial expertise.
However, Murray (1994) shows that finance was the only area where venture
capitalists skills were judged by entrepreneurs to be greater than those of other
parties. Indications are that the general type of skills possessed by venture
capital executives varies between types of venture capitalist, with those
employed by captive funds tending to be more financial skills oriented whilst
those employed by independents tend to have greater industrial skills
(Beecroft, 1994).
Sweeting (1991a) and Hatherly et al. (1994) for the UK and Fried and
Hisrich (1995) for the US provide evidence of the importance of flexibility
through personal relationships in the governance of venture capital and buyout investments and that formal power needs to be used sparingly and almost

only when things go wrong to be effective. However, this may be because of
inertia rather than a deliberate policy. While venture capitalists may take
control when things go seriously wrong, such action has to be exercised with
care since to act precipitously may destroy carefully nurtured relationships
and commit the venture capitalists to unknown amounts of time to put matters
right. We return to the issues in dealing with problem investments below.
Similarities but also differences emerge in the operation of active investor
governance in buy-outs and buy-ins. UK evidence from both buy-outs and
buy-ins shows that board representation is the most popular method of
monitoring investee companies with venture capitalists also requiring regular
provision of accounts (Robbie, Wright and Thompson, 1992), but that there is
a greater degree of control exercised by institutions over management buy-ins
than for buy-outs especially in the form of greater requirement for regular
financial reports and greater use of equity ratchets. Evidence from smaller
buy-ins suggests that even where they have non-executive directors,
institutions may not be as active in responding to signals about adverse
performance as might have been expected (Robbie and Wright, 1996) and
that relationships between entrepreneurs and investors had not developed to
the extent that potential crises could be identified and understood by the
venture capitalist. These problems reflect the high cost of monitoring and
control in relation to the value of investments. In larger buy-ins there is
evidence of extensive and repeated active monitoring (see Wright et al.,
1994). This difference illustrates the comparative cost-effort-reward trade-offs
involved in the active monitoring of large and small investments.
There is, however, a major issue as to the extent to which agency theory is
the most appropriate theoretical tool for understanding the monitoring
relationships between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, or whether it
requires some adaptation given the particular conditions of venture capital
investments. In general, legal forms are able to facilitate exchange
relationships. Thus contract law specifies a general set of arrangements under
which goods and services are exchanged for money. The universal recognition
of these norms, backed up by sanctions, economises on the costs of writing
complex contracts. A potential complementary development to principalagent theory associated with contracting problems is offered by procedural
justice theory (Korsgaard et al., 1995). Procedural justice constitutes a
behavioural standard for those in stewardship positions with respect to assets
and is concerned with exchange relationships in which one party does not have
control over decisions. The essential argument is that regardless of the
outcome of decisions, individuals react more favourably when they feel the
procedure used to make them was fair. The theory has clear parallels to the
situation faced by the indirect involvement by venture capitalists in the
operations of investee firms. Though venture capitalists may make considerable contributions to investee firms through the presence of non-executive directors and other monitoring devices, it is the entrepreneurs who
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 27----->548

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

control the way in which funds are used, who develop the strategies to achieve
the returns that venture capitalists are seeking and who possess intimate inside
information on the operation of the business. The venture capitalist seen as a
principal may not therefore be in a position to control the nature and level of
governance over the entrepreneur as agent.
Procedural justice can also be viewed as an important influence on the
development of trust and commitment in relations between venture capitalists
and entrepreneurs. This perspective links to agency theory in that the
development of relationships may reduce uncertainty and ameliorate the need
for costly monitoring as it reduces the need for formal mechanisms in the
management of exchange relationships and may also reduce the perceived
need to scrutinise data offered openly. This relationship may be considered in
the context of the timeliness of information flows from an entrepreneur to the
venture capital monitor. An absence or a persistent delay in the provision of
information may be perceived by the venture capitalist as an unfair violation
of an investment agreement and to undermine the investor's trust in the
entrepreneur. Sapienza and Korsgaard (1996) use a procedural justice
perspective to examine the impact of entrepreneurs' management of information flows on entrepreneur-investor relations. Using both an experiment with
master's level students and a field survey of venture capitalists they identify the
importance of timely feedback of information in promoting positive relations
between investor and entrepreneur when the investors' influence on decisions is
low. In other words, the more entrepreneurs share information, the more likely
are investors to eschew monitoring, to trust that the entrepreneurs will be
honest, to support the entrepreneurs' decisions and be more willing to reinvest.
The use of an experimental approach in part of this study raises concerns about
its generalisability and suggest that more large-scale studies directly involving
entrepreneurs and venture capitalists are required. In addition, other
procedural factors may be important other than feedback and influence, such
as the entrepreneur's openness to the input from venture capitalist.
A procedural justice approach goes some way to overcoming some of the
over-simplified assumptions of formal theoretical models which address
agency problems, such as perfectly revealed information or no information.
However, procedural justice theory focuses on the process of monitoring not
the outcome.16 There may be considerable trust, but performance may be
sub-optimal. In addition, evidence from agency theory perspectives
concerning the link between perceptions about entrepreneurs' skills and the
nature of monitoring have so far been omitted from procedural justice
approaches. Further theoretical modelling and subsequent testing of
investor-investee relationships appears to require a synthesis of the insights
from these two approaches to create a more robust analysis. Potentially
fruitful directions may involve consideration of the implications for the
relative importance of monitoring mechanisms which tend towards trust as
one end of a spectrum and formal contracts at the other of assumptions
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 28----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

549

relating to, for example, the complexity of projects, the degree of private
information, the skills of the entrepreneur (both absolutely and relative to
the venture capitalist), costs of monitoring and penalties for cheating.
Restructuring and Failure
Particular importance has been attached to the governance role of active
investors in cases where venture capital investments require restructuring.
Ruhnka et al., (1992) find that `living dead' investments, i.e. investments
which are viable but fail to achieve adequate growth and returns, arise usually
because of problems with management and markets. Ruhnka et al. find that
successful turnround, which occurs in only 56 per cent of cases is influenced by
the nature of the problem and the ability of venture capitalists to control them.
Subsequent research (Wright et al., 1993) has distinguished between
`Living Dead' and `Good Rump' investments, where the former essentially
involve enterprises where the business collapses with little prospect of
turnaround and the latter are capable of being turned round, but the effects
of restructuring have yet to be seen. A problem of enforcing restructuring is
that it may be difficult to obtain consensus with other parties, both
entrepreneurs and co-investors, what form it should take. In smaller
investments, since management are usually important majority shareholders
great care is needed in taking action. If institutions are a controlling
shareholder, as is usually the case in larger buy-outs and buy-ins, making
changes is theoretically straightforward. However, in cases with large
syndicates of financiers, restructuring may be delayed or take a particular
direction because of differences in the attitudes of syndicate members.17
In the limit, problems in the screening and control of venture capital
investments may be expected to be closely associated with business failure.
The influences on likelihood of failure in buy-outs in the UK was examined
by Wright et al. (1995) who found that while positive managerial motives for
buy-outs and greater levels of restructuring undertaken expeditiously at buyout are associated with survival, direct investor monitoring per se was found
not to be significant.

à

Investment Realization
Issues surrounding the exit or realisation of venture capital investments
concern the timing and nature of such actions. Realization may be through
IPO, full or partial sale to a third party, secondary buy-out/buy-in or
receivership, with there being considerable variance around the mean period
of investment in a venture capital project.18
An important point to emerge is that the timing and form of realization of
venture capital investments requires the objectives of all parties to be satisfied
(Relander et al., 1994; and Wright et al., 1994). Barry et al. (1990) indicate
that venture capitalists have several mechanisms to ensure firms go public at
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 29----->550

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

times perceived to be optimal, including board seats and informal advice.
Wright et al. (1994) writing in the context of venture backed management
buy-outs suggest that institutions' desire for realization in order to achieve
their returns, may influence the nature of corporate governance to achieve a
timely exit. In order to achieve timely exit, institutions are more likely to
engage in closer monitoring of their buy-out investments and to use exitrelated equity-ratchets on management's equity stakes (Wright, Thompson,
Robbie and Wong, 1995). Both quantitative and case study evidence suggests
that the greater the conflicts in the objectives of the parties which had to be
suppressed at the time of the transaction, the more the governance structure
has to be able to respond and be flexible. Even so, exit arrangements will
largely be influenced by the relative bargaining power between venture
capitalists and entrepreneurs.
In the context of venture capital investments generally, most attention has
focused on exit through IPO. Barry et al. (1990) show that successful timing of
a venture-backed IPO provides significant benefits to venture capitalists in that
taking companies public when equity values are high minimises the dilution of
the venture investor's ownership stake. Barry (1994) cites evidence that venture
capitalists' governance may be biased where they have incentives to offer bad
advice to their investees in the matter of premature IPO timing. Such a potential
reverse principal-agent conflict may arise where venture capitalists seek a
premature IPO in order to gain profile and report prior performance in the
raising of new funds.19 Lerner (1994) shows that seasoned venture capitalists
appear to be particularly good at taking companies public near market peaks,
though of course this does not necessarily mean that such timing is appropriate
from the point of view of the company itself (Wright et al., 1994).20
While there is evidence that unseasoned IPOs generally result in significant
underpricing (see e.g. Ibbotson et al., 1988, for a review), Megginson and
Weiss (1991), however, do show that there is less underpricing in venture
backed IPOs, a finding consistent with a recognized role for venture capitalists
as monitors.21 Moreover, Jain and Kini (1995) whilst supporting this
evidence, go further and show that venture capitalist-backed IPO firms have
superior post-issue operating performance compared to non-venture capital
backed IPO firms over a three year post-issue period. Importantly, they also
show that the extent of superior performance is positively associated with the
quality of venture capitalists' monitoring.
The valuation of venture capital investments at the time of exit may be
particularly problematic since as Lam (1991) has shown, a venture capitalist
may not be able fully to realise the value of an investment in a low information
environment because of the existence of estimation risk, that is the incremental
variation in the predictive return distribution that is attributable to investors'
ignorance of the parameters of its true return distribution.22 Estimation risk
may be expected to decline as more information becomes known about the
firm's performance. Thus, if part of the estimation risk is transitory and can
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 30----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

551

be dissipated in the aftermarket following IPO then it is worthwhile for the
venture capitalist to adopt a graduated policy towards the realisation of cash
gains.
Despite this emphasis on realisation through IPO, venture capitalists
maintain a flexible approach to the timing and form of exit (Wright et al.,
1993; and Relander et al., 1994). Sale to a third party is often the most
commonly preferred and actual form of exit. Relander et al. (1994) using
European evidence show that although in principle IPOs may be the preferred
realization route, in practice sale to a third party is the most common form
used, principally because a threshold for an IPO is not reached or because an
attractive but unforeseen acquisition proposal is received. Wright et al. (1993)
show that venture capitalists' attitudes to exit are not homogeneous between
European countries.23 Petty et al. (1993) examine trade sales as an exit route
for US venture capitalists and find that although it provides more immediate
full liquidity of an investment than is possible in an IPO, the objectives of the
entrepreneur may not be satisfied. Murray (1994) in a study of exit
possibilities from early stage investments shows that venture capitalists rank
trade sale as their preferred route with IPO third. Exit by sale to a next stage
venture capitalist was ranked only fourth, despite early stage investors'
expressed preference for such a form of finance. Murray expresses concern that
young, growing firms may be faced by a second equity gap. Such companies
may represent rather small acquisitions for trading groups seeking to obtain
economies of scale and/or scope, though they may be attractive where
purchasers are seeking to gain access to new technology or product
innovations.
Entrepreneur's Exit and Assessment By Venture Capitalists, Post Exit
Monitoring ö Serial Contracting and Post-Exit Careers
The existence of entrepreneurs who are exiting from venture capitalists' own
portfolios adds a feedback loop to the source of deal generation in Figure 1,
and also raises interesting theoretical and empirical issues concerning
recontracting. While we have earlier touched upon recontracting at different
stages of the same project, this section focuses on the issue of the attractiveness
of recontracting with exiting entrepreneurs especially given the importance
accorded to entrepreneurs' track records in investment screening, as seen
earlier. To date, the available literature has not addressed this dynamic aspect
of venture capital investment. Although the screening literature in section (ii)
above refers to previous entrepreneurial experience, it has not directly
examined the problems faced by venture capitalists in assessing entrepreneurs
who have exited from their own (and indeed others portfolios). As venture
capital markets mature and increasing realization of investments is likely to
be followed by exits by entrepreneurs, this would appear to be an area of
growing importance.
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 31----->552

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

Studies which have specifically examined cases of habitual entrepreneurship e.g. Birley and Westhead (1994) and Kolvereid and Bullvag (1993)
generally find little difference in characteristics and performance between
novice and experienced entrepreneurs. Starr and Bygrave (1991) suggest that
although there is a danger that experienced entrepreneurs may become
fixated on repeating past behaviour, the positive experience of previous
entrepreneurial ventures should make it easier to raise start-up financing per
se and in larger amounts. At the initial investment stage, venture capitalists
may be able to negotiate relatively advantageous terms compared to entrepreneurs who are inexperienced in dealing with such situations, using their
screening expertise as discussed earlier.24
Theoretical models reviewed earlier have examined the contracting
problems in the presence of asymmetric information at either the initial stage
of investment by the venture capitalist (Amit et al., 1990) or in relation to
multi-period investment decisions (Admati and Pfleiderer, 1994). These
models do not consider the issues of recontracting with the same entrepreneur
in a different situation. This would seem to suggest that the nature of
informational asymmetries differ from the initial contracting decision. In
recontracting with entrepreneurs who have exited from their own portfolio,
venture capitalists are potentially faced with a situation in which the
entrepreneur is more aware of the effectiveness of the venture capitalist's
monitoring and of how (dis)advantageous was the initial contract. Though
the skills of the entrepreneur have been revealed to the venture capitalist, at
least more so than in the first venture, assumptions about the nature of the
entrepreneurs objective function (e.g. risk neutral/risk averse) may need to
be amended since the outcome of the first project may affect the entrepreneur's
motivations about subsequent ones. There is essentially a multi-period game
whereby serial entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will seek to change either
the invest/not invest decision and/or the nature of the contract in the light of
information which has been revealed in the first project. As a result, venture
capitalists, may be cautious about reinvesting in entrepreneurs from their own
portfolios. Empirical evidence on recontracting with exited entrepreneurs
shows that venture capitalists do indeed identify major differences between
novice and serial entrepreneurs in the negotiation process as a result of their
experience with the venture capital process (Wright et al., 1997).
With respect to entrepreneurs who have exited from other venture
capitalists' portfolios, the contracting problem is more complicated as the
entrepreneur now has knowledge about the venture capital negotiating
process in general, though not of the venture capitalist to whom an approach
is being made for the first time. While venture capitalists may know the
entrepreneurs who have exited from their own portfolios, they are still faced
by potential adverse selection problems in respect of entrepreneurs exiting
from others' portfolios. Hence, venture capitalists may be more cautious
about investing in such entrepreneurs because of both contracting problems
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 32----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

553

relating to asymmetric information and the entrepreneur's knowledge of the
negotiation process. In general, there would appear to be scope for further
theoretical modelling of the recontracting process where venture capitalists
are considering reinvestment in serial entrepreneurs.
An understanding of why entrepreneurs may cease to be entrepreneurs also
has important implications for venture capitalists strategies to monitor entrepreneurs post-exit. Ronstadt (1986 and 1988) specifically examines the
reasons why entrepreneurs exit early from their careers and provides evidence
which suggests that at least some may have the potential for undertaking
further ventures. Whilst this provides general evidence of the reasons for
entrepreneurial exit, there is a need to examine more directly the implications
for venture capitalists.

PERFORMANCE OF VENTURE CAPITAL FIRMS

The interrelated industry/market and firm level strands in the available
literature on venture capital suggest that on the one hand, the returns earned
by venture capital firms will depend on their ability to use their specific skills to
overcome the information asymmetries inherent in privately held firms, but
on the other that competitive forces shaping industry profitability will offset
these returns.
Evidence of the target rates of return sought by venture capitalists ex ante
(e.g. Dixon, 1991; Murray and Lott, 1995; and Wright and Robbie, 1996)
shows that in the UK, the overall average internal rate of return sought on
venture capital investments is around 29 per cent and that these target returns
vary according to the stage of the investment, and the size and the degree of
technology risk involved in the project.
There is relatively little rigorous analysis of the performance of venture
capital firms. Outside of the US this is partly because of the relative newness
of most markets where venture capital portfolios have not generally reached
maturity. A major problem also arises in respect of access to adequate data.
A review of the main US literature to 1987 by Bygrave (1994) concludes
that
contrary to the folklore figure of 30^50 per cent, actual venture capital returns have
most often been in the teens, with occasional periods in the 20^30 per cent range and
rare spikes above 30 per cent.

Bygrave's own study of the performance of funds formed in the period 1969^
1985 shows that the median IRR peaked in 1982 at 27 per cent and that early
stage funds had higher returns than later stage ones.
Kleiman and Shulman (1992) examine the comparative performance of
publicly traded venture capital firms and government sponsored small
business investment companies and find that for 1980^1986 the latter
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 33----->554

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

demonstrate significantly greater total and unsystematic risk and greater
returns on a risk adjusted basis, but significantly less systematic risk, than the
former. However, this difference disappears for later years. An analysis of 33
quoted European venture capital firms during the period 1977^91 (Manigart
et al., 1993) showed only eight of the sample with a return higher than the
market return although the systematic risk was lower than the market risk.
Venture capital companies which specialised in a specific investment stage
had a higher return.
In Europe, the sensitivity of returns information has led to analyses being
conducted by national venture capital associations. Though these studies
provide some data there is a lack of transparency in the process of analysis.
Dutch venture capitalists earned an average annual return on investment of
13 per cent for the period 1986^1990. However, these figures are based on
realisations only and ignore the value of portfolio companies which have not
been realised and which may be expected to lower these returns. The Dutch
analysis, in contrast to US evidence, showed that early stage finance was on
average loss-making (ÿ3 per cent annual return) compared with the much less
riskier management buy-outs which earned a high positive return of 25 per
cent per year. Analysis of returns in the UK for a sample of funds launched
between 1980 and 1990 show an overall annual return to the end of December
1994 of 12.1 per cent, with the upper quartile earning 14.6 per cent, and large
MBO funds producing the highest returns at 23.1 per cent and early stage 4
per cent (BVCA, 1995b). Funds raised in 1986 and 1987 were the worst
performers while the best ones were raised in 1985 and 1990, reflecting the
effects of differing market conditions notably the entry price/earnings ratios
paid for investees. Unlike the Dutch study, but in line with US approaches,
the UK analysis was based on all investments not just exited ones and relates
to the performance of funds not companies.
It is clear from these studies that returns depend to a great extent on the
stage of investment and the timing of the raising of the fund and have generally
fallen internationally since the market began to develop significantly from the
early 1980s. Moreover, it is also the case that the bulk of returns are earned on
the top decile or quartile. Huntsman and Hoban (1980) show that eliminating
the top decile meant that the average return fell from 18.9 per cent to ÿ0.28
per cent. In Bygrave's study, the top quartile funds peaked at 44 per cent. It is
also notable, if not perverse, that funds involving the lowest risk categories
earned the highest returns.

CONCLUSIONS

The main thrusts of this review have been to emphasise the richer array of
research issues which arise from focusing on the wider range of investment
activities actually undertaken by venture capitalists and to identify the interß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 34----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

555

linkages and gaps in the current literature. Not only does this approach key in
more closely to the nature of the venture capital and private equity market
and what venture capital firms do, but it also permits greater application of
important finance and accounting concepts and issues. Increasingly, at least
in the UK and European context, it would seem important to view the issues
as relating to the provision of private equity, within which pure venture
capital is a sub-set.
This review has presented for the first time an integrated examination of
both industry/market and firm levels issues in order to provide a fuller
understanding of the venture capital market. The review indicated that
although there is considerable work on various aspects of the venture capital
process, there is relatively little work at the industry/market level. There has
also been relatively little attention to explicit examination of the interlinkages between the industry/market and the firm level issues.
Perhaps most importantly, this review has indicated that the developmental formal theoretical models have been at best partial and that much of
the empirical work in this area has been somewhat atheoretical. Formal
approaches have attempted to model the problem of asymmetric information
and have provided insights into the nature of venture capital contracts,
contracting in multi-stage investment decisions, and the problems associated
with the venture capitalist's ability to identify, attract and invest in high
ability entrepreneurs. However, there are a number of areas where simplifying assumptions may have meant that the full essence of a particular aspect of
the venture capital process has not been captured. Particular gaps where
further work would appear warranted, concern for example, the modelling of
perfect versus imperfect revelation of information at the screening and postcontractual monitoring stages, the costs of information search by the venture
capitalist, the use of performance contingent contracts as a means of dealing
with asymmetric information, the consequences of venture capitalists not
being able to control production if the entrepreneurs are replaced and the
development of bargaining models of contract negotiation.
Consideration of these issues appears to be an important aspect of the future
research agenda given the dynamic nature of venture capital markets and its
implications for the behaviour of venture capital firms. Following the structure of the preceding review, the following suggestions emerge for areas for
further research.
Industry and Market Level
Rivalry Between Firms
The determinants of rationalisation and mergers within the industry may be
expected to involve some differences in comparison with traditional
manufacturing sectors. For example, when a closed end fund is fully invested
the venture capital firm can continue to operate for several years without

à

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 35----->556

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

making further investments. Issues are also raised concerning the incentives
for other venture capital firms and others to acquire such companies.
Given the importance of individuals' skills in venture capitalist firms, more
mature markets begin to raise the issue of the impact of CEO succession and
executive turnover on future fund performance. This issue is widely addressed
in the general literature on succession in privately held firms (see e.g. Kets de
Vries, 1977) as well as in the corporate control literature (see e.g. Walsh,
1988) but has yet to be examined in the context of venture capitalists.
Power of Suppliers of Funds
The effects on the strategies of funds' suppliers of evidence on the performance
of previous funds is of particular relevance in a market where venture
capitalists are seeking to raise subsequent funds. This has major implications
for the developing structure of the industry as weak performers may not be
able to raise further funds. Institutional developments affecting funds
providers may in turn affect their stance towards investing in venture capital.
For example, solvency ratio requirements for pension funds and their ability to
recognise venture capital as an asset class may affect their willingness to hold
venture capital investments, especially in more difficult market conditions. In
this context, access to transparent performance information is likely to have
important implications for the extent and direction of their investment in
venture capital firms, including the linking of fund performance to the
compensation incentive structures of the venture capital limited partnership
or firm.
à

Power of Customers
As seen earlier, some attention has been paid towards the demand and search
process of entrepreneurs seeking venture capital. However, issues concerning
the influences on venture capital search such as the size and investment stage
of the transaction and the background experience of the entrepreneur lack
systematic analysis. Research which analyses and compares the differing
perspectives of entrepreneurs, intermediaries and venture capitalists could
provide important insights into both the deal search process and for deal
generation by venture capitalists (see below).
à

à Threat of New Entrants
The mirror image of exits concerns the incentives for and barriers to entry by
new competitors. Differing stages of market maturity introduce possibilities
for comparative analysis of these factors. More specifically, the scope and
prospects for new entry by internationally based venture capitalists, spin-outs
from existing firms, tax driven incentive schemes (e.g. Venture Capital Trusts
in the UK) and for direct and indirect investment by high net worth
individuals, offer potentially important research possibilities.

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 36----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

557

Threat of Substitutes
Further research areas concern examination of the extent to which venture
capitalists and venture capital backed firms are different from other
institutions and firms. Moreover, as much of the existing work has either been
confined to US conditions with an emphasis only on start-up investments or
has related to much earlier time periods, there is scope for further research
beyond these areas. There is also relatively little existing analysis of how firms
select between competing sources of finance from banks, and formal and
informal venture capitalists, nor is there evidence concerning the
complementarity between these sources of finance.

à

Firm Level
Funds Providers-Venture Capital Firm Relationships
Growing evidence on the mechanisms and processes by which venture
capitalists monitor their investee companies has shed important light on
principal-agent issues.25 However, there has been relatively little research on
the other crucial principal-agent relationship, that between venture
capitalists and their funds providers. There is little research on the comparative approaches of limited partnership venture capital funds and captive
funds to monitoring relationships, investment stage and time horizon
emphasis and overall objectives. In addition there is an absence of analysis of
the operation and effectiveness of venture capital contracts from the
perspectives of venture capitalists and their funds' providers. There would
thus appear to be scope for more detailed finance-based clinical studies of the
processes involved in the operation of venture capital contracts.
There is also a major issue concerning the appropriate conceptual
underpinning to empirical examination of relationships. As seen above, a
potential complementary development of principal-agent theory is offered
by procedural justice theory. The theory has clear parallels to the situation
faced by the indirect involvement by funds providers in the operations of
venture capital firms as well as to relations between venture capital firms and
their investees as discussed above. Though funds providers may have made
considerable contributions to venture capital funds, it is the venture capital
executives who control the way in which funds are disbursed and strategies
adopted to achieve the returns that funds providers are seeking.
à

Deal Generation
Little systematic research has been devoted to deal generation yet it raises
issues concerning both the allocative efficiency of the venture capital market
and the performance of firms. For example, differences between regional
concentrations of venture capital funds and entrepreneurial opportunities
may mean that certain ventures may receive funding in one region whereas
ventures with the same characteristics in another region may not. Hence,

à

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 37----->558

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

research which examines the implications of regional concentrations of
venture capitalists, the effectiveness of their regional networks (including both
regional offices and the role of intermediaries) and the response of venture
capitalists to opportunities which arise because of such market imperfections,
may be of interest.
A further issue concerns the appropriateness and net benefits of reactive
versus proactive approaches to deal generation. Changing competition in the
industry has implications for the generation of deals, one manifestation of
which has been the development of new types of transaction such as investorled buy-outs where the venture capitalists' role is enhanced. Evidence and
experience in earlier market development suggests that there is a need to
examine carefully the implications of new methods of deal generation and the
new types of deal which may be involved for the skills required to venture
capitalists, adverse selection and moral hazard problems and ultimately for
the performance of venture capital firms.
Links between differing sources of funds may also have important
implications for deal generation and require examination. For example,
informal venture capitalists may have an important role to play in funding
early stage projects prior to formal venture capitalists entering at a later stage.
The development of new secondary and tertiary tier quoted markets (such as
NASDAQ in the US, AIM in the UK and EASDAQ in Europe) may provide
an alternative source of funds for growing firms and offer competition for
venture capitalists.
Initial and Second Screening
There is now extensive empirical evidence on the screening process,
particularly in respect of new ventures but less so for later stage investments.
Much of the recent research in this area has focused on refining techniques
addressed to established research questions. There would appear to be a need
for further work which examines differences between types of transaction stage
and screening characteristics as well as direct examination of the links between
screening characteristics and subsequent performance, and of whether or not
deals rejected by one venture capitalist are funded by another or by an
alternative funder or not funded at all. Further theoretical work would appear
warranted on the problems of imperfectly revealed information and the costs
incurred by the venture capitalist in obtaining information. Theoretical work
might also address screening issues for differing stages of venture capital
investments (e.g. early versus late/buy-out stage).

à Valuation and Due Diligence
Little work is available on valuation in venture capital investments,
particularly relating to international comparisons in markets at differing
stages of development. Given the indications from the research which is
available that there are differences between venture capital investments and

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 38----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

559

other forms of investment, and the link between valuation at this stage and
post-investment valuation (see below), this would appear to be an important
issue.
There is also a paucity of evidence concerning the due diligence process.
Recent work referred to above is based primarily on the situation concerning
acquisitions with there being little evidence relating to venture capital
situations. Moreover, the ability to carry out due diligence may differ between
different stages of venture capital investment (e.g. for start-ups there may be
little hard evidence, for later stage hard information may be available), and
whether investees are insiders or outsiders and face competition in the bidding
process (e.g. management buy-ins and investor-led buy-outs26 versus
management buy-outs and development capital transactions). A comparative
analysis of these situations may identify important further dimensions of
asymmetric information problems and issues which interlink with other stages
in the venture capital process such as the implications for the structuring and
viability of transactions.
Deal Approval and Structuring
Although, as has been seen there are theoretical models which examine the
structure of the venture capital contract, little work has been conducted on
the bargaining process between entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. In
some models, for example, it has been assumed that the entrepreneur has
handed over to the venture capitalist the determination of the sharing
agreement. Its determination through a bargaining process may be one useful
extension of analysis in this area.
Although there is extensive evidence concerning screening criteria little
empirical attention has been devoted to the deal approval process at the
organisation level. This is potentially an important issue since individual
venture capitalist executive decision-making takes place within an
organisational structure which typically requires recommendations to be
approved by an investment committee. Analyses of conditions where
recommendations are accepted or rejected and of differences in the process
according to type of venture capitalist and stage of investment would
especially appear to be appropriate.
There is surprisingly little research on deal structuring in terms of the
determinants of the combinations of the types of financial instruments which
are used. Evidence from available studies that financial structures vary more
according to the characteristics of venture capitalists and competition for the
deal rather than of the investee itself is somewhat puzzling and would appear
to warrant further research in respect of cross-country and cross-investment
stage comparisons.
In the light of the review of industry level and firm level issues, further
analysis is required of the trade-offs between greater risk spreading but
weakened control actions in syndication in the context of increasing

à

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 39----->560

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

competition between providers, increased ability to fund larger transactions
as good performers are able to raise larger funds, and differing economic
environmental conditions.
Post Contractual Monitoring
There is now quite extensive research on post-deal monitoring. The
potentially interesting avenue for further research offered by the procedural
justice perspective has already been referred to in respect of funds' providersventure capitalists' relationships. The approach has similar applications in
respect of venture capitalist-investee relationships. However, little of this
research has related to the monitoring actions which are taken when investees
are either performing well or facing major problems. In particular, there
would appear to be a need for further research on the extent and effectiveness
of monitoring actions in identifying problem cases, and the processes used to
restructure such investments with comparative analysis between those that go
into bankruptcy, and those that partially and fully recover. However, such
research could well benefit from further theoretical modelling of the
monitoring process. Although some tentative moves have been made in this
direction with the introduction of procedural justice theory, significant gaps
appear to remain in the formal modelling of the interplay between contractual
mechanisms and monitoring processes.
à

Investment Realisation
In respect of the realisation of venture capital investments, there is a need for
greater attention than hitherto to venture capitalists' preferred form of exit,
especially trade sales. In particular such issues as the pricing of such sales, the
determination of an acceptable price (especially for under-performing
investee companies) and the processes of the management of closed end fund
portfolios and divestment from them would seem to warrant further analysis.
Further analysis of post-IPO performance issues also appears warranted,
particularly in respect of the influence of information asymmetry on the
timing of IPOs and the question as to whether post-IPO venture capitalist
involvement, either directly through director representation or through a
shareholding presence, is positively associated with performance.
à

Entrepreneurs' Exit and Assessment by Venture Capitalists and Post Exit
Monitoring
These two stages are considered together as they both raise issues about
recontracting between venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. There has also
been little attempt to address the theoretical and empirical issues involved in
the reinvestment in exiting entrepreneurs either by the original venture
capitalist or an alternative one. This area would appear to introduce important issues concerning the problems of recontracting with entrepreneurs who
have learnt about the venture capital process and which may change the
à

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 40----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

561

relative bargaining position of the two parties. A similar issue also arises in
staged investments where an investee company is growing successfully, giving
the entrepreneur greater bargaining power. However, there is an important
distinction in the two cases since the former involves a new project whilst the
latter concerns the existing one. Formal modelling of this dynamic aspect of
the venture capitalist-entrepreneur relationship remains a gap in the existing
literature.
There is also a paucity of rigorous academic studies on the performance of
venture capital investments and of the venture capitalists themselves. A subset
of important issues also concerns the methods used in the valuation of initial
venture capital proposals, the continuous revaluation of venture capital
portfolios by both captive and independent funds and the implications of
valuation policies for the ultimate realisation of investments and, as noted
above, measurement of industry level performance.
Inter-Linkages Between Stages in the Process
There has hitherto been relatively little work which has examined the nature
and effects of the inter-linkages between the industry and firm levels of the
venture capital market and in respect of the stages in the venture capital
process. Some areas of inter-linkage have been identified in the preceding
paragraphs and the following areas in particular may offer further potentially
interesting research possibilities.
As noted in this review, some empirical work is now appearing which
compares formal and informal venture capitalists in terms of their
approaches to screening and monitoring, but there has been little which
focuses on the decision processes by which entrepreneurs choose between
these two sources.
There has also been little attention to the complementarity of informal and
formal venture capitals. For example, there are issues which concern whether
informal venture capital performs a greater role for smaller earlier stage
projects with formal venture capitalists entering at a later stage when larger
amounts of funds are required. In addition, there may be instances where the
combined inputs of both formal and informal venture capitalists may be
appropriate, for example where informal venture capitalists also bring
technical skills.
Evidence is now available on the performance of different stages of venture
capital investment. However, there has been little attempt to analyze systematically the determinants of the performance of venture capital firms, whether
they are quoted or privately held, nor of schemes to encourage private equity
investment which offer taxation incentives. The implications of emphases and
different elements of the screening process, of monitoring mechanisms and of
financing structures for performance is little understood. This may be especially important given the general absence of strong evidence concerning the
efficacy of different approaches to post-investment monitoring. In respect of

à

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 41----->562

WRIGHT AND ROBBIE

tax incentive schemes, issues are raised concerning the effects on investment
decision making.
The general corporate governance debate has raised issues about the link
between executive remuneration and performance (Jensen, 1993; and Keasey
and Wright, 1993) and the venture capital industry would appear to provide a
novel sector in which to address some of these issues. For example,
comparisons of the performance of management rewarded through salaryplus bonus against those rewarded through salary-plus carried interest,27
controlling for investment stage differences, etc. would be of interest. Access
to information, however, poses particular problems for large sample studies.
Performance of Venture Capital Firms
Though, as reviewed above, there is some evidence relating to the broad
performance of venture capital firms and to differences between the performance of investment stages, this is rather limited. Overall declining rates of
return and evidence of the disparity in returns on differing risk categories
raises important questions about market efficiency and the determinants of
performance of relevance to researchers, practitioners and policy makers.
These issues relate partly to the efficacy of the contracting technology which
has been developed to enable value to be added to the venture capital process,
but this is too narrow a basis to obtain an understanding of the operation of the
venture capital market. Evidence on the comparative returns from different
stages of investment may also be related to the skills of venture capitalists and
continuing difficulties of accessing private information. These differences are
especially marked between early stage and management buy-out type
investments and prompt important research questions about the operation of
the market. As indicated by the two level framework of analysis adopted in this
paper, it is necessary to consider the effects of competitive forces in the venture
capital market since, for example, competition between venture capital firms
may increase the equity stakes obtained by entrepreneurs and drive down the
returns available for venture capitalists. The evidence reviewed in this paper
indicates that little attention has been devoted to analysing these interlinkages and that further research in this area appears warranted.
Data availability poses severe problems for comprehensive analysis and
existing studies may be difficult to compare because of inconsistencies in
valuation methods especially in relation to unrealised portfolios. A relatively
neglected data source concerns the possibility in some environments to
analyze differences in performance between enterprises which have been
supported by venture capitalists and those which have not.
The development of a venture capital price index could provide indicators
of benchmark performance against which to judge individual company
performance. It would also enable comparisons to be made with other stock
market indices. Indices relating to venture-backed investments are now
ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998

<-----Page 42----->VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY

563

beginning to appear, such as the CMBOR Index covering management buyouts. These raise questions about the continuing influence of venture
capitalists when their interest has been diluted after flotation. A second
category of indices concerns non-quoted venture backed firms, with increasing competition to obtain funds placing pressure on venture capitalists for
greater transparency of performance information. Preliminary efforts in this
area have been made by Keeley and Turki (1995) for example, but there
would as yet appear to be significant problems stemming from data
availability which need to be addressed.
Concluding Comments
So far, finance and accounting researchers have only addressed parts of the
above research agenda. Partly this is because some of the areas relate to
strategy issues, though as may be evident from this review the interface
between strategy, finance and accounting offers interesting research avenues.
The relative lack of attention is also partly because the nature of information
in the area means that traditional finance and accounting research
approaches are difficult to apply. The private nature of investments means a
general absence of publicly available information. This may mean that
qualitative in-depth research methods may be appropriate for addressing
many of the areas identified above. The relatively small number of venture
capital firms in most countries has implications for the extent to which these
firms can be surveyed or otherwise contacted without leading to saturation
and consequent small and potentially biased sample sizes. This suggests that
other data sources may be appropriate, such as analyses of enterprises which
have or have not been financed by venture capital. In sum we would argue
that venture capital provides a potentially rich research agenda for
researchers in the accounting and finance area.

NOTES
1 Detailed treatment of the newer literature on corporate venturing is seen as beyond the scope
of this paper. For analysis see e.g. Block and MacMillan (1993). Informal venture capital is
discussed as a competing source of private equity.
2 For such firms, an IPO may provide access to equity funds but little if any monitoring.
Moreover, because of the problems of access to information and the skills possessed by
institutional investors there may be a reluctance for them to purchase shares in these kinds of
firms. It may also be noted that evidence relating to potential gaps in corporate finance
research (Herbert and Wallace, 1996), suggests there is a need to give greater attention to the
effects of the information asymmetries which exist between insiders and outsiders on decision
processes in corporate finance. Following on from the second motivation, these asymmetries
are likely to be greater for smaller firms, for whom Herbert and Wallace (1996) show there is
a significantly greater need than for larger companies to provide research on appropriate
sources of finance and the debt/equity financing choice.

4 Prior to this more recent substantial market growth it needs to be borne in mind that the
world's largest venture capital institution, 3i, based in the UK has however, been investing
since the mid-1940s (Coopey and Clarke, 1995) whilst Charterhouse and other banks provided
venture capital at least a decade earlier.
5 Later stage financings represented 94% of the total value of investments and 83% of the total
number of financings made by members of the European Venture Capital Association
(EVCA, 1995).
6 This can lead for example to an overemphasis on equity stake by entrepreneurs with the
venture capitalist making counter-balancing adjustments in other aspects of the contract that
an inexperienced entrepreneur may not fully appreciate and to insufficient search on the part
of the entrepreneur for an appropriate venture capitalist. This is consistent with notions that
entrepreneurs finding themselves in unfamiliar situations under-search for information as they
fail to appreciate fully the issues involved or their complexity.
7 This is particularly an issue in the recent development of Investor-led Buy-outs (IBOs) where
venture capitalists are proactive in seeking and completing deals. While this may to some
extent reduce the power of incumbent entrepreneurs/managers in obtaining large equity
stakes from the venture capitalist, venture capitalists are faced with potential problems arising
from paying higher prices to invest and asymmetric information problems where they may
have full unbiased information on the investee (see Wright and Robbie, 1996, for discussion).
8 Different types of business angels can be identified according to their behaviour and
characteristics (see e.g. Mason and Harrison, 1992).
9 It is not clear, however, how representative these studies are. For example, `more informed'
informal investors may utilise their links with banks to identify investment opportunities
rather than using `marriage bureaux' and such entrepreneurs may therefore not be fully
represented in these studies.
10 Wright and Robbie (1996) who examined only formal venture capitalists also find a high
degree of importance is attached to own due diligence.
11 Though the LBO industry in the US is typically seen to be distinct from the venture capital
industry, venture capitalists are extensively involved in funding buy-outs especially smaller
ones (see e.g. Malone, 1989). In the UK, there is probably much greater overlap between
venture capitalists and what may be seen as LBO Associations (Wright, Thompson and
Robbie, 1996). Moreover, although there has been some reference to the rehabilitation of the
US LBO, post the problems of the late 1980s, this has been a much stronger and persistent
feature of the UK buy-out market where venture capitalists play a significant role. Venture
capital widens the emerging literature on corporate restructuring which has hitherto tended
to focus on debt forms of finance (Jensen, 1993), in particular in relation to the balance
between the reduction of agency costs and the stimulation of growth and entrepreneurial
actions. Although the corporate restructuring debate has tended to emphasise the former,
there is evidence that a large number of management buy-outs in both the US and the UK
make extensive use of venture capital and engage in significant R&D and investment
expenditure (see e.g. Zahra, 1995; and Wright et al., 1992).
12 For example, in the UK management buy-out market, venture capitalists are involved in the
funding of around a half of smaller transactions, with banks fully funding the rest (Wright and
Robbie, 1995).
13 Hustedde and Pulver (1992) examine the important roles of different types of intermediaries in
securing venture capital funds for their clients and find that entrepreneurs who failed to seek
advice had a significantly lower chance of success.
14 In this respect, venture capital has an important contribution to make to the corporate
governance debate as the involvement of venture capitalists in investee companies has
implications for both performance and accountability simultaneously (Lorenz, 1989). Sykes
(1994) also draws attention to the contribution that active investors in MBOs may have to
the corporate governance debate.
15 Performance may be in terms of profits over a given period, market value on flotation, etc.
Flotation at a date prior to that expected in the ratchet contract may provoke disputes about
the extra amount of equity to which management are entitled where a sliding scale operates.
16 This parallels other behavioural research relating to the link between job satisfaction and
performance.
17 See Lerner (1994) for a discussion of syndication of venture capital investments.

18 For the case of venture backed management buy-outs see Wright, Thompson, Robbie and
Wong (1995).
19 This issue also raises further governance problems in relation to conflicts between venture
capitalists and their investors.
20 Evidence from IPOs of buy-outs in the UK also indicates a marked increase in activity at times
of market buoyancy (see Wright and Robbie, 1995).
21 Parallel evidence from reverse LBOs (DeGeorge and Zeckhauser, 1993) shows they
outperform comparable firms in terms of operating profitability pre-flotation but not post; a
finding consistent with the view that managers and their institutional supporters wait for a
good year before coming to market. However, evidence that despite this change in relative
performance reverse LBOs do not underperform the share price of non-LBOs suggests that
the market anticipates such a change.
22 Estimation risk has transitory and permanent components. The former may be eliminated as
more information becomes available while the latter is due to the random nature of asset return
parameters.
23 However, it is worth emphasising that 40 per cent of IPOs in the UK in the period 7/92 to 12/95
were venture capital financed companies according to the British Venture Capital
Association.
24 Although some entrepreneurs mitigate this problem with the use of intermediaries, there is
evidence to suggest that intermediaries become involved at a late stage, especially in smaller
transactions (Murray et al., 1995).
25 There may also be wider corporate governance applications of the flexible active investor
approach adopted by venture capitalists (Jensen, 1993; and Thompson and Wright, 1995).
26 See Wright and Robbie (1996).
27 Carried interest relates to the participation of individual venture capital executives in the
gains achieved by the externally provided funds they are investing in entrepreneurial ventures.
