RESEARCH NOTE
INCUMBENT’S ADVANTAGE THROUGH
EXPLOITING COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS VIA
INTERFIRM COOPERATION

Lansing, Michigan, U.S.A.

I examine interfirm cooperation between incumbents and new entrants as a mechanism for
incumbents to adapt to radical technological change through exploitation of complementary
assets. The research setting is the biopharmaceutical industry, where I analyze 889 strategic
alliances between 32 large pharmaceutical firms and providers of the new biotechnology. I
find that incumbents that focus their network strategy on exploiting complementary assets
outperform incumbents that focus on exploring the new technology. However, there are limits
to this strategy due to diminishing marginal returns to alliance intensity. I am also able to
show that an incumbent’s new product development is positively associated with its performance.

Incumbent firms often face severe difficulties in
adapting to radical technological change (Foster,
1986). The advent of the personal computer (PC),
for example, destroyed the demand for a wide
array of products ranging from typewriters to
fully dedicated word-processing systems, while at
the same time it created huge opportunities for
new PC manufacturers, their suppliers, and the
producers of complementary products like
software and printers. Thus, radical innovations
often initiate a Schumpeterian process of creative
destruction, leading to the replacement of incumbents by new entrants. Schumpeter asserted that
this perennial gale of creative destruction is the
driving force behind the market system:
The process of Creative Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism … it is not [price]

competition which counts but the competition
from … new technology … competition which
strikes not at the margins of profits … of existing
firms but at their foundations and their very lives.
(Schumpeter, 1942: 83–84; italics added)

However, not every radical technological
breakthrough will produce a process of creative
destruction in which new entrants rise to dominance as incumbents fail. Incumbent firms may
be able to adapt to radical technological change if
they have the necessary financial and managerial
resources to master such an adaptation
(Christensen and Bower, 1996). For example, the
emergence of the Internet is considered to be a
radical innovation for firms in the computing
industry; however, the dominant software
enterprise in the pre-Internet era, Microsoft, has
embraced this technological shift and incorporated
it throughout its business. Likewise, IBM is
emerging as a leading e-business infrastructure
provider. What these incumbents have in common
is that they did not develop the new technology,
but they gained access to it through licensing
agreements, strategic alliances, joint ventures,
and acquisitions.

Therefore, the phenomenon of extensive
cooperation between incumbents and new entrants
following radical technological change warrants
more attention. Understanding how incumbent
firms may take advantage of technological discontinuities is becoming more and more important
as the new competitive landscape is characterized
by an increasing speed and magnitude of technological change (Bettis and Hitt, 1995). Incumbent
survival in the face of radical technological
change has been explained by the persistence of
market capabilities (Abernathy and Clark, 1985),
prior collaborative relationships (Mitchell and
Singh, 1996), and complementary assets (Tripsas,
1997). In addition, it has been shown that incumbents are able to thrive on technological change
as long as it is competence enhancing (Tushman
and Anderson, 1986) or sustaining in nature
(Christensen and Bower, 1996). More research,
however, is needed to understand the phenomenon
of interfirm cooperation between incumbents and
new entrants following a technological discontinuity, and its subsequent impact on incumbent
performance.
The contribution of this paper lies in creating
links between interfirm cooperation, new product
development, and incumbent firm performance
in the post-innovation time period. I focus on
incumbent firms exposed to radical technological
change and analyze how they have used interfirm
cooperation with new entrants as a strategy not
only to adapt but also to innovate successfully.
In particular, I attempt to show how corporate
entrepreneurship (Zahra, 1993; Covin and Miles,
1999) pursued by large pharmaceutical firms has
led to the successful adaptation to a radical innovation—in this case, the emergence of biotechnology as the new framework of drug discovery
and development.
It has long been proposed that corporate
entrepreneurship leads to superior firm performance (Guth and Ginsberg, 1990). Few studies
have empirically tested this proposition (cf. Zahra
and Covin, 1995). This study of 889 strategic
alliances between large pharmaceutical companies
and new biotechnology firms provides one of
the few attempts to empirically test the impact
of
corporate
entrepreneurship
on
firm
performance. What is unique about this study is
the attempt to integrate the literatures on technology innovation, strategic alliances, and corporate entrepreneurship.

RADICAL TECHNOLOGICAL
CHANGE AND INCUMBENT
PERFORMANCE
Teece (1986) argued that the ownership of
complementary assets, particularly when they are
specialized to the commercialization of an innovation, determines who will benefit from that innovation. Incumbents with competencies in manufacturing or marketing are often well positioned to
benefit from technological change, even if it is
radical in nature. Tripsas (1997), for example, was
able to show that complementary assets buffered
incumbents in the typesetter industry from the
consequences of radical technological change.
Thus, Teece (1986) posited that the fully integrated
incumbent is the firm best positioned to benefit
from innovation through exploitation of existing
complementary assets. The commercialization of
the CAT scan highlights this view. GE did not
invent the CAT scan; however, it soon became
the market leader, since it possessed the complementary assets necessary to succeed in this new
market. On the other hand, the innovator, EMI,
was unable to acquire or develop the needed complementary assets to successfully commercialize
the CAT scan and eventually exited the market.
Others argue, however, that dynamic networks
allow firms to focus on their core competencies
through partnering with other firms along the
industry value chain (Miles and Snow, 1986).
Interfirm networks can improve an incumbent’s
access to emerging technologies, increase opportunities for organizational learning, and enable
rapid adaptation to market and technology shifts
(Gulati, 1998). In addition, interfirm cooperation
may allow firms to generate relational rents which
they would not be able to generate in isolation
(Dyer and Singh, 1998). Mohr and Spekman
(1994) in their study of strategic alliances in the
computer industry found that a network strategy
can lead to a competitive advantage.
Hypotheses development
Strategic alliances and new product
development
A firm exposed to radical technological change
must assemble the necessary technological and
nontechnological value chain activities to commercialize the new technology successfully
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

<-----Page 2----->Research Note
(Pavitt, 1998). Radical new technologies are generally pioneered by new entrants (Tushman and
Anderson, 1986). New entrants, however, may
find it necessary to cooperate with incumbent
firms in order to commercialize the new technology, i.e., to gain access to the market and to
capital, in particular when forward integration is
difficult and capital is scarce (Pisano, 1991). In
addition, new entrants may be further motivated
to cooperate with incumbents as alliances with
established firms can bestow legitimacy, and thus
positive reputational effects (Stuart, Hoang, and
Hybels, 1999). Incumbents, on the other hand,
often prefer cooperative arrangements over the
acquisition of new entrants in order to internalize
the new technology and thus maximize the value
of their real options, particularly in environments
of high uncertainty (Folta, 1998).
Williamson (1985) has pointed out that extensive cooperation between incumbent and new
entrant firms may ensue in the context described
above. Generally, the new entrants discover and
develop new products based on the radical new
technology, while the incumbents commercialize
the new products. These partnerships allow new
entrants and incumbents to focus on their respective specialized skills and capabilities. As a result,
incumbent firms that possess downstream value
chain activities specific to commercializing a new
technology may be able to adapt to radical technological change through strategic alliances with
new entrants. At the same time, new entrants are
able to extend their downstream value chains and
increase the likelihood that their innovative output
will be commercialized successfully, by accessing
the market-oriented competencies of incumbent
firms. Thus, complementary assets form the basis
for a specialization-based division of labor in
commercializing a radical new technology (Teece,
1992). Interfirm cooperation driven by access to
complementary assets should be positively
associated with the new product development for
incumbent firms since it allows incumbents to
commercialize the innovative output developed
by new entrants.
Interfirm cooperation, however, is motivated
not only by access to mutually complementary
assets, but also by learning (Powell, Koput, and
Smith-Doerr, 1996). Firms may enter into strategic alliances to learn the new technology from
their partners and, in turn, enhance their own
competencies in new product development. Based

on the notion that strategic alliances are driven
by complementarities and organizational learning,
I argue that the number of strategic alliances an
incumbent firm has formed with providers of the
new technology should have a positive effect
on the incumbent’s new product development.
Strategic alliances may create unique resource
combinations that, if valuable, rare, and difficult
to imitate, can form the basis for a competitive
advantage (Barney, 1991).
However, the more alliances an incumbent firm
participates in simultaneously, the higher the
probability that management will be less effective
in managing those alliances due to bounded
rationality (Simon, 1960). An increasing number
of alliances creates increasing managerial information-processing demands, which may contribute to an overall negative net effect at high levels
of alliance intensity (Hitt, Hoskisson, and Kim,
1997). Further, with an increasing number of
alliances, an incumbent firm’s transaction costs
may rise up to and possibly beyond a point where
gains from additional alliances are outweighed by
their costs (Jones and Hill, 1988). Since in every
firm there is a limit to managerial and financial
resources, the relationship between an incumbent’s strategic alliances and its new product
development will exhibit diminishing marginal
returns and, past some point, diminishing total
returns. In other words, the relationship has an
inverted-U shape.
Hypothesis 1: The relationship between an
incumbent’s strategic alliances with providers
of the new technology and the incumbent’s
new product development is curvilinear, i.e.,
the relationship exhibits diminishing marginal
returns and, past some point, diminishing
total returns.
Exploration vs. exploitation alliances
Exploration is understood as ‘the pursuit of
knowledge, of things that might come to be
known,’ and exploitation as ‘the use and development of things already known’ (Levinthal and
March, 1993: 105). Applying March’s (1991)
dichotomy of exploration and exploitation to a
firm’s strategic alliances, an incumbent firm can
theoretically enter two types of alliances with
new entrants: exploration and exploitation
alliances (Koza and Lewin, 1998). I argue that
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

<-----Page 3----->690

F. T. Rothaermel

organizational learning motivates exploration
alliances, while access to complementarities motivates exploitation alliances. Nonetheless, both
types of alliances should improve the product
development of incumbent firms because incumbents may build new competencies through exploration alliances or leverage existing competencies
through exploitation alliances.
On the one hand, an incumbent firm can enter
into strategic alliances to learn the new technology (exploration alliances), allowing it to build
new upstream value chain activities (Hagedoorn
and Schakenraad, 1994). This type of alliance
allows partners to get close enough to share
tacit knowledge such as basic R&D (Lane and
Lubatkin, 1998). An example of an exploration
alliance is the alliance between the ‘incumbent’
IBM and the ‘new entrant’ Microsoft with the
goal of developing a new standard of operating
system (OS/2) for personal computers in the mid
1980s. Mowery, Oxley, and Silverman (1996)
found support for the notion that exploration
alliances allow the acquisition of new capabilities,
in particular, when the alliances are structured as
joint ventures.
On the other hand, an incumbent firm can enter
into alliances to leverage existing complementary
assets (exploitation alliances) that allow the
incumbent firm to benefit directly from the technological expertise of the new entrant. Exploitation alliances focus on complementarities among
the allied partners as they exchange explicit
knowledge (Teece, 1992). The new entrant provides the new technology, while the incumbent
commercializes it. The collaboration in the telecommunications industry between Cincinnati Bell,
an ‘old’ Regional Bell Operating Company, and
several new cellular service providers exemplifies
the nature of exploitation alliances. Cincinnati
Bell was able to build a profitable business by
performing all of the customer care functions,
including billing and service inquiries, for these
new entrants.
I argue that both exploration and exploitation
alliances are antecedents of an incumbent’s new
product development. Exploration alliances are
predictors of new product development since
exploration alliances are explicitly entered with
the goal of discovering or developing a new
service or product. The issue of causality is less
clear with respect to exploitation alliances.
Exploitation alliances usually start with an R&D
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

project that has been brought to technological
completion but has not yet been commercialized.
Exploitation alliances still contain some residual
uncertainty because the incumbent generally
needs to bring the new product through the commercialization stages of the value chain, for
example, obtaining government approval, if
necessary, and involving marketing and sales.
Even though exploration alliances generally
carry more uncertainty than exploitation alliances,
exploitation alliances are not without risk. In
particular, many new products need regulatory
approval before they can be introduced into the
market. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has
created its Ethicon division to focus on exploitation alliances with providers of a new technology. The goal is to license-in promising
technologies from new ventures and research
institutions like universities to commercialize
them (Cohan, 1997). In this scenario, Johnson &
Johnson still bears the residual uncertainty of
commercialization, including that of obtaining
FDA approval. Following Schumpeter’s (1934)
definition of innovation as commercialized invention, only when the approval is granted and the
product has been commercialized can one count
this product as a firm-level innovation and new
product development.
Empirical research indicates that the success
rate of major product launches is somewhere
between 14 and 20 percent (Stevens and Burley,
1997; Griffin, 1997). The high failure rate of
innovation in the post-technological completion
stage is a result of market uncertainty, poor commercialization, poor positioning strategy, technological myopia, market timing, and regulatory
uncertainties (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995).
While these numbers do not differentiate with
respect to the organizational arrangement of the
innovation, I argue that they provide some evidence that exploitation alliances do bear residual
uncertainty and can be reasonably viewed as antecedents of new product development.
I further argue that an incumbent’s exploitation
alliances have a greater impact than its exploration alliances on the incumbent’s new product
development because of the different degrees of
uncertainty they carry. If an incumbent’s technological value-chain activities are depreciated by
the new technology and its complementary assets
remain intact, it is beneficial for the incumbent
to focus its network strategy on exploitation
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

<-----Page 4----->Research Note
alliances. In this case, the incumbent commercializes the products developed by new entrants.
The goal of exploration alliances, on the other
hand, is to develop new, unknown products. Both
the new entrant and incumbent pursue new
knowledge with a highly uncertain outcome.
Since the level of uncertainty is generally lower
in exploitation alliances than in exploration
alliances, I expect exploitation alliances to have
a stronger impact on the incumbent’s new product
development in the post-innovation time period.
Hypothesis 2: Following radical technological
change, an incumbent’s exploitation alliances
have a greater impact than its exploration
alliances on the incumbent’s new product
development, when the incumbent firm possesses complementary assets necessary to the
commercialization of the new technology.
New product development and firm performance
Radical technological change in combination with
intensified global competition characterizes the
competitive environment in many industries
(Bettis and Hitt, 1995). Such an environment
places a premium on a firm’s capability to innovate and to introduce new products or services
into the marketplace (Franko, 1989). I argue that
an incumbent’s strategic alliances with new
entrants are a way for the incumbent to adapt to
radical technological change and subsequently to
improve its performance through the successful
commercialization of new products.
Covin
and
Miles
defined
corporate
entrepreneurship as ‘the presence of innovation
plus the objective of … purposefully redefining
organizations, markets, or industries in order to
create or sustain competitive superiority’ (Covin
and Miles, 1999: 50). Thus, new product development and commercialization by incumbents helping to adapt to a new technological paradigm are
considered to be a manifestation of corporate
entrepreneurship. Zahra and Covin (1995) found
corporate entrepreneurship, operationalized as
innovation and new product development, was
associated with superior firm performance. Likewise, Wiklund (1999) found a positive and sustainable relationship between firms’ entrepreneurial orientation and their performance.
New product introductions may allow the innovator to establish first mover advantages and a

temporary monopoly (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988). This is particularly true in industries
where standards or effective patent protection
create winner-take-all scenarios (Hill, 1997). Even
in other types of industries, successful new product introductions still allow the first mover to
benefit from early market preemption, reputation
effects, and experience curve effects (Lieberman
and Montgomery, 1988).
Hypothesis 3: An incumbent’s new product
development is positively associated with its
performance.

METHODS
Sample and research setting
The sample for this study consists of 32 large
pharmaceutical companies that have entered into
889 strategic alliances with providers of the new
biotechnology. The research setting is the
biopharmaceutical industry. This term describes
the industry composed of traditional pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck or Eli Lilly,
that utilize biotechnology for drug discovery and
development, as well as fully dedicated biotechnology firms, such as Amgen or Genentech, and
nonprofit research institutions and universities
engaged in biotechnology research. The unit of
analysis is the incumbent pharmaceutical firm as
it attempts to adapt to the new biotechnology
via interfirm cooperation with providers of the
new biotechnology.
The emergence of biotechnology can be interpreted as a radical process innovation that broke
the barriers to entry into the pharmaceutical
industry (Stuart et al., 1999). Consequently, many
new biotechnology firms emerged to commercialize this technological breakthrough. Between
the mid 1970s and 1997, over 1100 new entrants
entered the industry to commercialize biotechnology, the majority with a focus on human therapeutics (BioScan, 1997).
The upstream value chain activities in research,
drug discovery, and drug development based on
chemical synthesis deployed by traditional
pharmaceutical companies have been rendered
largely obsolete within the new biotechnology
paradigm. The skill loss for a scientist making
the transition from the traditional chemical-based
framework to the new biotechnology framework
Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

<-----Page 5----->692

is estimated to be 80–100 percent based on the
semi-structured interviews conducted for this
study. Nevertheless, the downstream value chain
activities of incumbent pharmaceutical firms, such
as FDA regulatory management, and marketing
and sales, retained their value in this new
environment. The challenge for incumbents has
been to fit the new technologies based on recombinant DNA into their existing value chains; this
has largely been attempted via interfirm
cooperation with new entrants (Rothaermel,
2000). Consequently, the biopharmaceutical
industry exhibits the highest alliance activity
among all the industries studied in prior research
(Hagedoorn, 1993).
Data
I constructed a data base containing 889 strategic
alliances between incumbents and new entrants
dating from the emergence of biotechnology in
the mid 1970s to 1997 based on the following
sources: BioScan industry directory, Scrip’s Yearbooks on the global pharmaceutical industry, and
the annual biotechnology industry reports published by Ernst & Young and Burrill & Company.
These sources were complemented by data
obtained from Standard & Poor’s monthly industry reports and the Compustat as well as Bloomberg’s data base. I augmented the secondary data
with 15 semi-structured interviews conducted with
executives (including CEOs), board members,
managers, and scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry.
I identified the chemical-based, traditional
pharmaceutical firms active in biotechnology
listed under Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) code 2834 ‘Pharmaceutical Preparations.’ I
then cross-referenced and complemented the SIC2834 industry sample with Scrip’s Yearbooks on
the global pharmaceutical industry and with BioScan. The final sample comprises 32 large
pharmaceutical firms, which participated in 889
strategic alliances focused on biotechnology for
drug discovery, development, and commercialization.
Measures
An incumbent pharmaceutical firm’s new product
development based on biotechnology is the dependent variable to test Hypotheses 1 and 2. I operCopyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

ationalized this variable by the number of new
biotechnology products the firm had introduced
into the market up until December 1997 (which
marks the publication date of the BioScan industry directory used for this study). New biotechnology products include new biotechnology-based
drugs, such as Hoffman-La Roche’s Roferon-A
for chronic myelogenous leukemia or BristolMyers Squibb’s Zerit for HIV, and in vivo diagnostics. These therapeutics are placed inside the
human body (in vivo) as opposed to in vitro
drugs or diagnostics that are used outside the
human body. I chose to limit the sample to in
vivo therapeutics as the firms engaged in this
segment of biotechnology are exposed to extensive regulatory requirements which demand
detailed reporting about each specific drug or
diagnostic.
An incumbent’s firm performance is the dependent variable to test Hypothesis 3. To measure
firm performance, I constructed a financial performance index for each firm based on its average
firm ROE for 1998 and 1999. I further controlled
for a potential specification bias arising from
unobserved heterogeneity through the inclusion
of 1997 firm ROE as independent variable
(lagged firm performance) when testing Hypothesis 3 (Jacobson, 1990).
The number of strategic alliances is a count
variable of the strategic alliances a traditional
pharmaceutical firm has entered into with providers of biotechnology. I further split the total
number of alliances into exploration and exploitation alliances. BioScan has a qualitative section
for each firm describing its alliances in detail.
Each alliance is classified along the value chain
of a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company.
I coded technology-oriented alliances that focus
on drug discovery and development, as well as
clinical and commercial manufacturing, as exploration alliances. Market-oriented alliances that
focus on clinical trials, FDA regulatory management, and marketing and sales, were coded as
exploitation alliances.
I calculated the average age of the alliances
and their subcategories (exploration and exploitation alliances) to control for age dependency. I
controlled for equity alliances (strong ties) vs.
nonequity alliances (weak ties) through the
inclusion of the ratio of equity alliances over
nonequity alliances. I controlled for incumbent
firm size using the logarithm of 1997 firm revStrat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

<-----Page 6----->Research Note
enues. I further controlled for potential economies
of scope based on technological diversity of
incumbent pharmaceutical firms through a count
variable that represents the number of biotechnology subfields in which the pharmaceutical firm
participates (Shan, Walker, and Kogut, 1994).
Finally, I controlled for institutional differences
by including an indicator variable country distinguishing between U.S. and non-U.S. pharmaceutical companies (Hennart, Roehl, and Zietlow, 1999).
The hypotheses were tested using multivariate
regression models. Since the dependent variable
(new product development) for testing Hypotheses
1 and 2 is an integer count variable, OLS estimates of the regression coefficients would have
been asymptotically biased and inconsistent
(Greene, 1997). To test these hypotheses, I chose
a negative binomial regression model with a
maximum likelihood estimation procedure over a
Poisson model since equality of mean and variance is not present in the sample (Kogut, Shan,
and Walker, 1992). For Hypothesis 2, I additionally applied a t-test for the difference between
partial regression coefficients (Cohen and Cohen,
1983). Hypothesis 3 was tested using OLS.

RESULTS
The 889 strategic alliances split into 317 exploration and 589 exploitation alliances. Only 17
alliances were targeted towards both. This small
number of alliances (1.9%) that span the entire
industry value chain lends support to March’s
(1991) view of exploration and exploitation as
relatively distinct and separate firm activities. All
589 exploitation alliances were nonequity
alliances, while the 317 exploration alliances split
into 234 nonequity and 83 equity alliances.
Descriptive statistics and the bivariate correlation
matrix can be found in Table 1. Tables 2 and 3
depict the regression results.
Model 1 represents the base model, which
includes the control variables only. Hypothesis 1
states that the relationship between the number
of an incumbent’s strategic alliances with providers of the new technology and the incumbent’s
new product development is curvilinear. I find
support for Hypothesis 1. In Model 2, which
shows a significant improvement over the base
model (p < 0.01), the coefficient total number of

strategic alliances is positive, as expected, and
statistically significant (p < 0.001), while the coefficient total number of strategic alliances squared
is negative, as expected, and statistically significant (p < 0.05).
Hypothesis 2 indicates that an incumbent firm’s
exploitation alliances have a greater impact on
the incumbent’s new product development than
its exploration alliances. Model 3 (linear alliance
variables only) and Model 4 (full model, including squared alliance variables) pitch exploration
and exploitation alliances directly against one
another and show that exploitation alliances have
a stronger positive impact on an incumbent’s
new product development than its exploration
alliances. Applying a t-test for the difference
between partial regression coefficients shows that
the respective difference between the coefficients
for exploration and exploitation alliances is statistically significant (p < 0.001) in both models.
Models 5 and 6 indicate a significant improvement over the base model (p < 0.05 and p <
0.001 respectively). In sum, I find strong support
for Hypothesis 2.
Hypothesis 3 states that an incumbent’s new
product development is positively associated with
its performance. Model 5 represents the base
model, which includes the control variables only.
Model 6, which represents a significant improvement over the base model (p < 0.05), shows that
the coefficient new product development is positive and statistically significant (p < 0.05) in
explaining firm performance. Thus, I find a positive association between an incumbent firm’s new
product development and its performance.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The emergence of biotechnology can be understood as a radical process innovation in the way
drugs are discovered, developed, and manufactured for firms within the traditional, chemicalbased pharmaceutical framework (Stuart et al.,
1999). However, the emergence of biotechnology
has not led to the destruction of existing pharmaceutical companies. Rather, we are witnessing a
transformation of the traditional, chemical-based
pharmaceutical industry into the newly emerging
biopharmaceutical industry. This new industry is
a combination of traditional pharmaceutical firms,
like Merck or Pfizer, and new biotechnology

firms, such as Biogen or Immunex. This transformation through combination is the result of corporate entrepreneurship efforts by incumbent
pharmaceutical firms. It has mainly been
accomplished through strategic alliances with new
biotechnology entrants (Greis, Dibner, and Bean,
1995). In turn, the biotechnology start-ups have
utilized extensive cooperation with incumbents to
commercialize biotechnology (Shan et al., 1994).
The cooperation of Genentech and Eli Lilly is a
case in point, as Genentech has preferred to
license its human insulin based on recombinant
DNA (Humulin) to Eli Lilly instead of commercializing it on its own (Lee and Burrill, 1994).
Incumbents may survive radical technological

change through strategic alliances established
prior to a discontinuity (Mitchell and Singh,
1996) or by utilizing complementary assets
(Tripsas, 1997). This research links interfirm
cooperation, as a mechanism for incumbents to
exploit complementary assets, and new product
development to firm performance in the postdiscontinuity time period. I show that an incumbent firm’s corporate entrepreneurship strategies,
in this case pursuing strategic alliances with new
entrants as a response to radical technological
change, led to improved new product development and superior performance.

tegic alliances and its new product development
(Deeds and Hill, 1996). This study, however,
demonstrated a curvilinear relationship between
an incumbent’s strategic alliances with new
entrants and the incumbent’s new product development. The focus on the incumbent, rather than
the start-up, is novel. Therefore, this research
contributes to the limited body of knowledge
regarding the success of incumbents facing radical, technological change (cf. Christensen and
Bower, 1996) and is one of the first studies to
examine strategic alliances as a mechanism for
incumbents to access and commercialize a radically new technology.
I am also able to show that incumbents that
focus on exploitation rather than on exploration
alliances will experience a competitive advantage,
at least in the short term. This indicates that
alliances in the biopharmaceutical industry seem
to be driven by a search for mutually complementary assets. This finding is consistent with Shan
and Hamilton (1991), who find that complementary assets are determinants of the formation of
cross-border alliances in biotechnology. On the
other hand, less radical technological change
would probably limit the effectiveness of exploitation alliances and increase the effectiveness of
exploration alliances. In such a situation, I would
Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

expect an incumbent firm to focus more on exploration alliances, assuming the incumbent firm is
not in a position to develop the technology alone.
Should the incumbent be in a position to commercialize the new technology alone, there would be
no need for cooperation between new entrants
and incumbents (Williamson, 1985).
I also find that an incumbent’s new product
development is positively associated with its performance in the post-discontinuity time period. It
has been pointed out that new product development is critical for the success of entrepreneurial
start-ups (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman,
1990; Deeds, DeCarolis, and Coombs, 2000). It
seems that incumbents that are able to speed
innovative products to the market will be
rewarded with superior performance.
A limitation of this study is its focus on surviving alliances. In particular, exploration alliances
are likely to have a higher mortality rate than
exploitation alliances. However, alliances in the
biopharmaceutical industry are characterized by
longevity because the product development process often requires 15 years or more (Burrill,
1999). Shan et al. (1994) found that only 15
percent of the alliances entered since the early
1970s has expired by 1989. Thus, our results are
unlikely to be materially affected by a potential
survivorship bias.
I present evidence indicating that corporate
entrepreneurship by incumbent firms may lead to
wealth creation. By the late 1990s, the incumbent
pharmaceutical firms marketed seven out of the
top-10 selling biotech drugs, even though none
of the drugs was developed by them. Those seven
drugs accounted for two thirds of the revenues
of the top-10 selling biotechnology drugs
(Morrison and Giovannetti, 1998). Overall revenues of new biotechnology drugs were $22
billion in 1999, about 15 percent of total revenues
in pharmaceuticals (Burrill, 1999).
I was also able to obtain data for firm-specific
cooperative arrangements stipulating the revenue
partition among the developer of the product, the
new biotechnology firm, and the marketer of the
product, the incumbent pharmaceutical firm. In
1998, for example, the biotechnology company
Immunex introduced Enbrel, a radical new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis based on a genetically engineered human protein. The annual sales
of Enbrel are forecast to be $5 billion by 2005.
American Home Products, whose sales force coStrat. Mgmt. J., 22: 687–699 (2001)

<-----Page 10----->Research Note
promotes Enbrel, receives about 45 percent of the
gross profits. Another example is the cooperation
between Eli Lilly and the biotechnology firm Icos
to commercialize a drug for the treatment of male
and female sexual dysfunction, which is expected
to be a direct competitor for Pfizer’s Viagra. The
revenue partition will be 50/50 between Lilly
and Icos. Such favorable revenue partition for
incumbents is explained by the fact that incumbent pharmaceutical companies enjoy a tremendous advantage in FDA regulatory management
and drug distribution. Large pharmaceutical companies have sales forces that approach or exceed
10,000 people. A standard time horizon of more
than 10 years and a cost of up to $500 million
for drug development in combination with the
incumbent’s advantage in drug approval and distribution explains why fully integrated new
biotechnology firms like Amgen are the exception, rather than the rule.
In addition, prior research has shown that strategic alliances with existing pharmaceutical companies bestowed legitimacy on new biotechnology
firms, which in turn had positive effects on their
stock valuations (Stuart et al., 1999). Thus, one
could speculate that incumbents have not only
created wealth for themselves, but also enhanced
the rents available to start-ups. On the other hand,
one could argue that incumbents co-opted the
new entrants via interfirm cooperation (Hoang,
1997), and that this contributed to the suspension
of the process of creative destruction. This debate
provides an avenue for future research.
The results of this paper also have implications
for strategic management. In the context of radical technological change, a firm’s competitive
advantage may lie in its network-level strategy
(Mitchell and Singh, 1996). For example, managers of incumbent firms in industries experiencing a technological discontinuity should gain an
initial competitive advantage by searching out
those strategic alliance partners that allow the
incumbent firm to exploit its assets that have
retained their value in the new environment
(Niederkofler, 1991). This strategy should also
enable incumbent firms to buy time in order to
build the new technological competencies
required for competition in the new environment.
Future research should attempt to test the
theory advanced in this paper in different industry
settings to enhance its external validity. In
addition, more work remains to be done to underCopyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

stand the impact of different types of alliances
on firm performance. Finally, interfirm networks
are dynamic, and so we need to better understand
how the effectiveness of different types of
alliances changes over time.
