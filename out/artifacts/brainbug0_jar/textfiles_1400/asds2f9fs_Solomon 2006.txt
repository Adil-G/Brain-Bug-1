Groupthink versus The Wisdom of Crowds:
The Social Epistemology of Deliberation
and Dissent
Miriam Solomon
Temple University
Abstract
Trust in the practice of rational deliberation is widespread and largely
unquestioned. This paper uses recent work from business contexts to
challenge t h e view t h a t rational deliberation i n a group improves
decisions. Pressure to reach consensus can, in fact, lead to phenomena
such a s groupthink and to suppression of relevant data. Aggregation of
individual decisions, r a t h e r t h a n deliberation to a consensus, s u r prisingly, c a n produce b e t t e r decisions t h a n those of e i t h e r group
deliberation or individual expert judgment. I a r g u e t h a t dissent i s
epistemically valuable, not because of t h e discussion i t can provoke
(Mill’s a n d Longino’s view about t h e benefit of dissent), but because
d i s s e n t i n g positions often a r e associated w i t h p a r t i c u l a r d a t a or
i n s i g h t s t h a t would be l o s t i n consensus formation. Social epistemologists can usefully pay attention to various methods of aggregation of individual opinion for t h e i r effectiveness a t realizing
epistemic goals.

1. Introduction
Philosophers from Plato to Mill to Popper to Rawls and Longino
have made critical discussion and deliberation central to their
social epistemologies. The claim is t h a t rational dialogue
between two or more individuals improves reasoning over what
can be accomplished by individuals working alone. Longino
(1990, 2002) even goes so far as to claim that objectivity is
constituted by such critical discourse, provided t h a t t h e
discourse satisfies constraints such as tempered equality of
intellectual authority, public forums for criticism, responsiveness to criticism, and some shared standards of evaluation.
Faith in the practice of rational deliberation is widespread
and largely unquestioned. Moral and political philosophers
depend on it as much a s epistemologists and philosophers of
science, often writing of “deliberative democracy” or “discursive
democracy.” Characteristically, the Kantian focus on individual
reason has been replaced by various ideals of group reason. For
example, in Rawls’s “original position’’ a community of individ-

28

<-----Page 1----->Groupthink versus The Wisdom of Crowds

uals rationally deliberates along impartial guidelines (the “veil
of ignorance”) in order to select shared principles of justice. In
Habermas’s “discourse ethics,” participants rationally deliberate
with one another from their actual social positions, attempting
to reach consensus.
Faith in the practice of rational deliberation extends to
applied ethics as well as ethical theory. The following statement,
from the University of Michigan Pediatric Ethics Committee, is
typical of contemporary approaches: “What experimentation is
to medicine, rational deliberation is to ethics.”’
While rational deliberation involves a community, rather than
an individual working in isolation, the criticisms and responses
to criticism are thought of a s transparent to each reflective
individual. Deliberation corrects errors, uncovers presuppositions, and sometimes transmits additional evidence. Each individual in the community is thought of as capable of recognizing
their own errors and presuppositions when they are pointed out
by others, and of accepting evidence discovered by others.
This is a very ”internalist” view of deliberation, in a sense
of the word “internalist” that is widely used among epistemologists. (It is also somewhat individualist, despite the dependence on community, b u t t h a t is not my topic here.) For
example, Roderick Chisholm characterizes internalism this
way: “If a person S is internally justified in believing a certain
thing, t h e n t h i s may be something h e can know j u s t by
reflecting upon his own state of mind” (Chisholm 1989, 7). The
core of the position is that justifications for belief are internal
to each individual knower and, typically, not only internal but
also available to reflection. The contrast is with “externalism,”
according t o which one can be justified, or have knowledge,
without being able t o say why one is justified or h a s knowledge. Thus externalists claim that the reasons for justification
or knowledge are not (or not readily) available to individual
cognizers, either because the reasons do not enter conscious
awareness or because the reasons (or causes) are external to
individual minds.
It might be thought t h a t social epistemology is all externalist, since by definition social epistemology concerns itself
with epistemic phenomena t h a t go beyond t h e individual.
Nevertheless I maintain t h a t this a r e a of work (namely, on
deliberation and criticism) in social epistemology is internalist
in character, because the epistemic phenomena discussed are
available to reflection and because when an epistemic phenomenon involves more than one individual (e.g., when one person
points out problems in another’s work) the epistemic assessment is based on reflection by each and all of the individuals
concerned. Again, the contrast is with externalism, in which
epistemic assessments a r e not based on reflection or introspection at all.
29

<-----Page 2----->Miriam Solomon

This kind of internalism in social epistemology should not be
confused with “conservative” social epistemology (as described
by Hilary Kornblith [1994] and endorsed by him as well as
Philip Kitcher [ 19931). “Conservative” social epistemology has
more to do with individualism and with rejection of constructivism than it has to do with internalism.
Generally speaking, work in social epistemology by philosophers has not been “internalist” in the way described above.
Certainly Hilary Kornblith and Alvin Goldman a r e clear in
their common position that social practices are t o be evaluated
instrumentally for their conduciveness to truth, rather t h a n
intrinsically for their rational cogency. For example, Goldman
(2002) claims that infants get their first beliefs through a
process he calls “BABA”:the bonding approach to belief acceptability. Goldman suggests t h a t beliefs a r e contagious when
there is a prior bond of affection between individuals. It turns
out that BABA is reliable, and the reliability of BABA is understood through evolutionary psychology: those with affective
bonds will have less incentive to deceive one another than those
without affective bonds. The epistemics of BABA are not transparent to reflection.
I am basically in agreement with Goldman and Kornblith’s
“externalist” approach (although I would describe myself as less
conservative, in that I think that terms such as “justified” and
“knows” a r e usefully applied to communities, in addition to
individuals). In this paper, I am using the externalist (or instrumentalist) perspective to look at group deliberation, discussion,
and criticism. I do not assume truth in particular as the goal
(as do Goldman and Kornblith), although all t h a t I say is consistent with t r u t h as a goal. I am also taking a thoroughly
naturalistic approach, drawing on previous empirical work on
epistemology of groups.
It will turn out that the traditional “internalist” philosophical picture of rational deliberation is a myth and not an epistemologically useful myth (i.e., i t is not a n ideal toward which
individuals or groups can or should strive). This is surprising
because the practices of group rational deliberation seem so
obvious: Helen Longino even says t h a t her explication of
objectivity in terms of the four criteria of knowledge comes from
“an intuitive distinction between knowledge and opinion that I
take to be shared .... Those who reject the conditions have a different concept of knowledge, or perhaps, a concept of something
else” (2002, 174).
Surprises can be useful in epistemology. Epistemology is
most helpful when it leads to normative recommendations that
are surprising in t h a t they a r e counterintuitive or in contradiction with established practice. Furthermore, against t h e
background of a few significant surprises, commonsense recommendations become more interesting because they cannot be
30

<-----Page 3----->Groupthink versus The Wisdom of Crowds

taken for granted. So i t would make the enterprise of social
epistemology more valuable to have some surprises, such as a
counterintuitive recommendation or a n unexpected negative
consequence of commonsense normative practice.

2. Some Surprising
Empirical Results
A good deal of work in social epistemology is done in business
schools, out of t h e philosophical limelight. This is perhaps
because of the business school emphasis on outcomes, typically
financial outcomes, in organizational research. This makes the
work relevant to naturalistic epistemologists, especially those
who evaluate epistemic practices instrumentally. Here are some
surprising results:

1. Group deliberation often produces worse decisions than can
be obtained without deliberation. (Often enough for epistemic
concern.)
2. A group of nonexperts often produces better decisions on a
topic than does an expert about that topic. (Thus challenging
the traditional deference to the expert.)
3. If group deliberation does take place, outcomes are better
when members of the group are strangers, rather than
colleagues or friends.
4.

Groups and organizations sometimes don’t know what they
know.2

Let me say a little about each of the results, to give you the
flavor of the research and the significance of the results.
The “groupthink phenomenon was first described by Irving
Janis in 1972.3I t occurs when a group of individuals aims to
reach consensus on a controversial topic. Peer pressure, as well
as pressure from those in authority (if present in the group),
leads dissenting individuals t o change their minds and, perhaps
as important, not to share their knowledge of contrary evidence.
The dynamics of groupthink frequently lead the group to a
polarized position, not to a n average or a neutral aggregate of
individual opinions. Often cited examples of groupthink include
Kennedy’s “Bay of Pigs” fiasco and NASA’s decision to launch
the Challenger spacecraft.
To take the first example, the “Bay of Pigs” fiasco (in which
the Kennedy administration attempted to overthrow the Castro
government by secretly returning a small brigade of Cuban
exiles to Cuba), Janis rejects the official explanation in terms of
right-wing political pressure, difficulties of a new presidency,

31

<-----Page 4----->Miriam Solomon

secretiveness about the planning and individual fears about
reputations. Or at least, he claims that the official explanation
is not enough to explain what actually happened: a process in
which knowledgeable and intelli ent advisors succumbed to the
dual illusions of unanimity a n invulnerability, suppressing
both their own doubts and the doubts of others and acting with
docility under Kennedy’s leadership.
While there is some controversy about whether the groupthink phenomenon occurs in j u s t the way t h a t Irving J a n i s
describes, there is little doubt t h a t factors such as peer pressure, pressure from authorities, pressure t o reach consensus,
and the salience of particularly vocal group members who may
anchor decisions lead groups into making poor decisions. It
doesn’t help much if individuals “try harder” to be unbiased or
independent; we are unaware of, and largely unable to resist,
the social factors causing groupthink and related phenomena.
Solomon Asch’s and Stanley Milgram’s classic experiments in
the 1950s and 1960s show the strength of pressures to conform
and Tversky and Kahneman’s classic work in the 1970s shows
the power of cognitive biases such as salience and anchoring. As
James Surowiecki (2004,xix) puts it, “too much communication,
paradoxically, can actually make the group as a whole less
intelligent .”
Does this mean t h a t group deliberation is worthless? I t
means that the results are doubtful, unless the group follows a
structured procedure designed to avoid groupthink (and other
biasing phenomena) and produce better decisions. There are a
number of suggestions about what such a structured procedure
should be. J a n i s himself recommends nondirective group
leaders, encouragement of ( r a t h e r t h a n mere toleration of)
dissent, and several independent groups or subgroups charged
with the same problem (in order to see whether o r not they
come up with the same result). Surowiecki (2004)recommends
diversity of group membership, claiming that it brings different
perspectives to a group. Cass Sunstein (2003)recommends both
diversity and active encouragement of dissent. Sunstein also
goes further and explores the kind of diversity that is relevant
to particular problem domains. Epistemically useful diversity is
not the same as political diversity, although it may be coextensive with political diversity for some problem domains. I n
general, epistemically useful diversity results when different
individuals use their differences in their investigation of the
problem domain.
These suggestions are all reasonable, but they have not been
formally tested a n d evaluated. Even J a n i s expresses t h e
concern that the suggestions will have “undesirable side effects”
(1982,252). Some leaders, for example, might be unable to
tolerate dissent without subtle or overt disapproval, which will
then squash dissent. Or some leaders, for example, might be

%

32

<-----Page 5----->Groupthink versus The Wisdom of Crowds

incapable of neutrality, especially when a group is coming t o a
consensus on a view t h a t the leader disagrees with. Or, for
example, criticism a n d dissent might produce anger and
demoralization that distracts the group from its epistemic goals.
So it is not enough to make plausible-sounding suggestions for
improvement: it is important to show that the suggestions can
be implemented and that they lead to the desired results. The
experimental work is not there yet.
The Tipping Point (ZOOO),a current best-seller by Malcolm
Gladwell, describes a phenomenon similar to groupthink, but
more extended in time, society, a n d place: how inventions,
fashions, or behavior become widely accepted in a society. He
tries to explain “the tipping point,” which is the point at which
the behavior in question “cascades,” spreading quickly through
a population. The explanation is not t h a t there is a rational
public discussion of benefits a n d risks of change. Rather,
Gladwell explains “social epidemics” in terms of three causes:
“the Law of the Few, the Stickiness Factor, and the Power of
Context.” The general idea is t h a t the new behavior is first
adopted by some individuals who a r e regarded by others as
being “in the know” (Gladwell calls them Mavens). Then the
behavior is infectious, so that others who see it also adopt i t
(Gladwell thinks that some specially talented people help with
this-he calls them Salesmen). Finally, in the right context of
favorable connections between individuals (Gladwell describes
individuals with many a n d diverse social connections as
Connectors), adoption of the new behavior reaches “the tipping
point.” An example that Gladwell gives is the spread of Hush
Puppies as a fashion in t h e mid-1990s. Hush Puppies were
down to sales of about 30,000 per year when a few trendy young
people in the East Village and Soho in New York (the Mavens)
bought them from resale stores. They were noticed by influential fashion designers (the Connectors), and the aesthetic was
catchy enough t h a t these designers used the shoes in their
shows. Through the fashion designers and their multifarious
connections, wearing Hush Puppies spread through the nation,
reaching annual sales of over 2 million.
Hush Puppies do not “deserve” their success any more than
a whole range of funky shoes adopted by trendy people at different times. Hush Puppies became successful because the influential fashion designers (the Connectors) saw the Mavens (the
trendy young people in Soho) wearing them. It could easily be
t h a t a group of trendy young people on South Street, Philadelphia, started wearing Classic Loafers (Sperry Top Siders) in
1994. But t h e influential fashion designers never got to
Philadelphia and never saw them. Thus, Classic Loafers never
reached the “tipping point.”
Another example described by Gladwell is the comparison of
Paul Revere’s ride from Boston northward with William Dawes’s
33

<-----Page 6----->Miriam Solomon

ride westward. Both men carried the news that the British were
coming. But Revere’s news tipped, and Dawes’s didn’t; Revere
got the troops out and Dawes did not: that’s why most of u s
have not heard of Dawes. The difference was that Revere was a
Connector, knowing many people in many different walks of life,
and Dawes was not. Revere knew just whose doors to knock on
to spread the message that the British were coming (that is, he
knew who the Salesmen were). Revere was also a Maven, which
is why the stable boy who overheard the British plans made
sure to tell Revere. Finally, Revere was charismatic and trustable, ensuring t h a t his message was “sticky” ( t h a t is, he was
himself a Salesman). (Typically, the three characteristics of
Maven, Connector, and Salesman do not all coincide i n one
person! In that way, this example is unusual.)
Surowiecki’s recent book, The Wisdom of Crowds (2004),
presents a surprising result: large groups of untrained people
are often better at decision making than an elite (expert) few.
He shows this result in a wide variety of domains. The original
example is from Francis Galton (Darwin’s half-cousin) who
discovered in 1906 t h a t the “vox populi”-a group of approximately 800 people visiting a fair in Plymouth-made a n
excellent estimation of the weight of a fat ox. In fact, the mean
of the estimates was 1,197 pounds and the actual weight was
1,198 pounds. Individuals who were expert in the weight of
oxen (farmer, butchers) did not individually do as well. Galton
himself was surprised by the accuracy of the result: he had a
cynical view of the outcome of democratic choice when ordinary
people vote.
A more recent example described by Surowiecki is t h e
excellent results of the Iowa Electronic Market, which generally outperforms major national
as well as individual
political pundits, in predicting the outcome of presidential and
other US. and foreign elections. The Iowa Electronic Market is
open to anyone b u t is not very large (approximately 800
traders), not especially demographically diverse (mostly men,
mostly from Iowa) a n d not composed of political experts. It
works like gambling odds: people can buy a n d sell futures
contracts based on how well they think a candidate will do in
a n upcoming election. The Iowa Electronic Market works so
well t h a t others a r e imitating it: for example, Eli Lilly is
experimenting with using i n t e r n a l stock m a r k e t s a n d
hypothetical drug candidates to predict whether new drugs
will gain FDA approval (Surowiecki 2004, 221). Note t h e
difference between this and the more commonsense practice of
consulting with an expert.
A final, startling example that Surowiecki reports is the case
of the missing submarine. In 1968 the US. submarine Scorpion
disappeared. The Navy had only the vaguest of information
about where it might be: somewhere in a circle twenty miles in
34

<-----Page 7----->Groupthink versus The Wisdom of Crowds

diameter and thousands of feet deep. Craven, a naval officer,
assembled a diverse group of experts and asked each to
individually calculate their best prediction of the submarine’s
path and final location. There was no discussion or consultation
of these experts with each other. John Craven combined the
calculations using Bayes Theorem and came up with an aggregate prediction. It turned out to be just 220 yards from t h e
discovered location of the Scorpion. (See Surowiecki 2004, xxxxi.)
These three examples are not isolated cases; it is not possible
t o dismiss them on the ground t h a t they are due t o chance or
good epistemic luck. Surowiecki’s book gives so many examples
that it is inescapable to conclude that he is onto an epistemic
phenomenon. It is important not t o conclude, however, that the
crowd is always wise. As the examples of “groupthink” and
“tipping point” show, the crowd may be unwise or indifferent to
good epistemic results.
Observe t h a t in Surowiecki’s examples the groups do not
deliberate, do not attempt to come t o a consensus, and do not
attempt t o compromise. The “group decision” is a calculated
average opinion i n t h e case of t h e Galton example and a
resultant market value i n t h e case of t h e Iowa Electronic
Market and a calculated vector sum in the case of the missing
submarine. In the case of the Galton example, the group doesn’t
know what it knows or that it knows. In the case of the Iowa
Electronic Market, each individual does know the price of the
contracts, but they do not necessarily know what they know:
they do not know t h a t t h i s is a good prediction of election
results (unless, of course, they know from past results how well
the Iowa Electronic Market does in general). So, again, they do
not know what they know or that they know. In the case of the
missing submarine, it is stretching things even to say that the
group knows; certainly they do not know that they know. These
are clear examples of externalism in social epistemology.
Another result that Sunstein mentions is that investment
groups and corporate boards composed of strangers do better
t h a n investment groups and corporate boards composed of
friends (2003, 27-8). Apparently, groupthink phenomena, which
often produce polarized and inaccurate decisions, are more
likely when members of a group have social connections to one
another.

3. Analysis of the
Empirical Results
According to Surowiecki (who, it seems, inductively arrives at
his conclusions5) there a r e three important conditions for a
crowd to make a good aggregate judgment: independence, diversity, and decentralization. Independence means t h a t each

35

<-----Page 8----->Miriam Solomon

individual makes a judgment on his or her own. There is no
discussion, or even knowledge of other’s opinions. Diversity
means t h a t t h e individuals a r e sufficiently different with
respect to t h e knowledge a n d perspectives t h a t they have.
“Sufficiently different” needs specifying for each case (I’ll say
more about t h a t below). Decentralization means t h a t t h e
process of aggregation treats each person’s decision similarly:
every vote counts for the same and there a r e no “experts” or
“authorities” whose votes a r e weighted more heavily t h a n
others.
These conditions help u s understand why the aggregated
decisions of a crowd can be epistemically superior. There is a bit
of mystery about “the wisdom of crowds.” Surowiecki says that
when averaging t h e opinions of a large group of diverse,
independent, decentralized people “the errors each of them
makes in coming up with an answer will cancel each other out”
(2004,10). He h a s i n mind t h a t t h e diversity is such t h a t
individual biases cancel each other out (227).Independence
means that phenomena such as groupthink cannot take place.
And decentralization prevents any individual from having
undue influence in the aggregated decision, making sure t h a t
no bias gets magnified.
While Surowiecki explains why the aggregated decisions of a
crowd are not epistemically faulty in these three respects, he
does not explain why the aggregated decisions often do so well.
I’ll try t o do this. When decisions a r e aggregated, individual
opinions a r e all used in calculating the aggregate decision.
Individual opinions are often based on particular pieces of information that may not be generally known. When an individual is
overruled in discussion, or changes her mind because of peer
pressure, that information is lost to the group. So aggregation
without deliberation preserves information.
Interestingly, Sunstein says something similar i n his
discussion of the epistemic benefits of dissent. In Why Societies
Need Dissent (2003)he argues that dissent is valuable because
it keeps the most information available to a community. Thus
he implicitly claims t h a t different judgments are different at
least i n part because they are based on different information.
Dissent is even worthwhile when the dissenting opinions are,
overall, judged implausible. I t is not, however, worthwhile
when dissenting opinions are “speaking nonsense” (Sunstein
2003, 7).
The difference between Surowiecki and Sunstein on t h i s
matter is that Surowiecki is interested in the overall, aggregate
judgment without deliberation and Sunstein allows-indeed
encourages-both deliberation and a more informal process of
coming to an overall decision. While their emphasis is different,
they are not really disagreeing with one another. They agree on
the central claim: dissent (i.e., different assessments by differ-

36

<-----Page 9----->Groupthink versus The Wisdom of Crowds

ent individuals) is valuable because it preserves and makes use
of all the information available to the community.
I have also said something very similar in Social Empiricism
(2001) where I argued t h a t , i n scientific inquiry, dissent is
valuable because it keeps all the empirical successes available
t o the community and t h a t consensus, when it takes place,
should not result i n the loss of any of these successes. I use
“empirical success”‘jrather than “information” because my book
deals specifically with scientific knowledge. Here are the details
from Social Empiricism.
Three conditions for a normatively appropriate dissent:
1. Theories on which there is dissent should each have associated
empirical success.
2.

Empirical decision vectors7 should be equitably distributed
(in proportion to empirical successes).

3.

Nonempirical decision vectors should be equally distributed
(the same number for each theory).

Note that consensus is the special case in which the amount of
dissent goes t o zero.
Three conditions for a normatively appropriate consensus:
1’. One theory comes to have all the empirical successes available
in a domain of inquiry.

2’. This same theory comes to have all of the empirical decision
vectors, since all scientists working productively (with
empirical success) are working within the one theory.
3’. Any distribution of nonempirical decision vectors is OK, but

typically more will develop,over time, on the consensus theory,
as the old theories fade away. During dissent, and thus in
the early stages of consensus formation, dissent’s requirement of equal distribution of nonempirical decision vectors
holds.
Social Empiricism also sets out similar conditions for the dissolution of consensus, since consensus is not viewed as an “end
point” of inquiry.
Three conditions for a normatively appropriate dissolution of
consensus:

1”. A new theory has empirical success that is not produced by
the consensus theory. (So, the new theory deserves attention.)
37

<-----Page 10----->Miriam Solomon

2”. Empirical decision vectors come to be equitably distributed.

3”. Nonempirical vectors come to be equally distributed.
The justification for these conditions is not given here, but i t
rests on the superior outcomes (better scientific results) when
the conditions are satisfied. That is, the justification is instrumental. Case studies in the recent history of science are used to
show this.
In general, according to Social Empiricism, consensus is
usually epistemically undesirable. I t is not enough for one
theory to have the most evidence; it must have all the empirical
successes for consensus to be appropriate. Most of the time,
dissent is epistemically better for science. (I stress the epistemic
desirability, rather than overall desirability, since there can
sometimes be political reasons for coming to consensus. Medical
practice and environmental science a r e two areas i n which
consensus has political advantages. These political advantages
may or may not outweigh t h e epistemic disadvantages of
coming to a consensus.)
Note that this discussion of the epistemic benefits of dissent
differs from the more widely known arguments by Mill, Popper,
Longino, and others who claim that dissent is valuable because
the criticism from dissenting perspectives leads everyone to
correct and improve their position. On the latter view, dissent is
valuable because it improves everyone’s views through criticism
a n d response to criticism. On t h e former view, dissent is
valuable even when no discussion occurs. Of course, dissent
could be valuable for both reasons: t h a t i t keeps information
available and that it encourages criticism. As discussed above,
however, t h e r e is room for skepticism about t h e results of
criticism, since sometimes deliberation makes things worse
rather than better.
If t h e main epistemic benefit of dissent is t h a t i t keeps
information available, then not just any dissent is worthwhile.
(Contrariwise, if dissent is epistemically worthwhile because it
encourages criticism, then any dissent is worthwhile, so long as
it stimulates the dissenter to produce good criticism.) Dissent is
worthwhile only when t h e dissenting positions a r e each
associated with relevant information. The dissenting positions
don’t need to have overall plausibility, but they do need to bring
information to t h e table. This is close to what I said about
science in Social Empiricism, where I argued that theories on
which there is dissent should each have associated empirical
successes.
A final point. Let’s go back to the case of the fat ox. In order
to calculate the aggregate judgment of the weight of the ox,
Galton took an arithmetic mean of individual judgments. Why
calculate an arithmetic mean? Why not calculate the median?
38

<-----Page 11----->Groupthink versus The Wisdom o f Crowds

Or perhaps some other function of individual judgments? For
example, one could weight more heavily t h e judgments of
farmers a n d butchers t h a n t h e judgments of other people.
Farmers and butchers have more expertise than laypersons, so
perhaps t h e i r judgments should count for more. Or, for
example, one could leave off the top and the bottom estimates
on the grounds that these are probably outliers. These questions about how to aggregate individual judgments take u s
into the domain of social choice theory, in which there have
been a number of interesting r e s u l t s recently. (See, for
example, List and Pettit 2002.) I t is sufficient to note here
that all the methods of aggregation are, in an epistemic sense,
external: neither t h e crowd nor any of t h e individuals
composing the crowd a r e i n fact calculating t h e aggregate
judgment. In t h e case of t h e f a t ox, Galton is making t h a t
calculation. I n the case of betting markets such as the stock
market or the Iowa Electronic Market, the market is making
the calculation. In the case of the missing submarine, the nonsubmarine-expert applied mathematician makes the calculation. S o i n all these cases, the groups do not know what the
information they have amounts to. We might say informally,
“the group does not know what i t knows.” More precisely, for
t h e stock m a r k e t a n d t h e Iowa Electronic Market, t h e
knowledge is represented, s o t h e group knows, although i t
does not know that i t knows. For the fat ox and the missing
submarine, the knowledge is not represented (unless Galton or
the applied mathematician calculates it), so the group does not
know (in one sense), and it does not know what it knows (in
another sense). In t h i s a t t e m p t at linguistic precision, we
begin to stretch the limits of our language of “know.” The more
d a t a processing or even d a t a mining t h a t goes into t h e
calculation of the aggregate result, the less plausible i t is to
say t h a t the group “knows” the result. All t h a t can be said is
t h a t t h e group h a s all the information required in order t o
know b u t does not know which information (of all t h a t i t
knows) is the relevant information.
“Data mining,” sometimes called “knowledge discovery in
databases (KDD)” is defined as “The nontrivial extraction of
implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from d a t a ” (Frawley, Piatetsky-Shapiro, a n d Matheus
1992). I t uses powerful computational tools such as neural
networks and decision trees to analyze given data. It identifies
patterns in the data and uses those patterns t o make predictions that aid decision making. It is valued precisely because no
individual notices these patterns when perusing the typically
huge databases on which d a t a mining techniques a r e used.
Data mining shows the importance of having the data in a form
in which the computational techniques can be applied, that is,
stored in a single database to which algorithms can be applied.
39

<-----Page 12----->Miriam Solomon

When data are physically distributed (e.g., possessed by different institutions) or stored in a variety of forms (e.g., some in
human memory, some on paper, some in one database, some in
another), then we are even further from knowing anything that
is “in the data” because the data are not in a form that is amenable to the computations of data mining.
There are an infinite number of ways to calculate an aggregate decision from a group of individuals’ decisions. Arrow’s
possibility theorem and its descendants (including List and
Pettit’s “discursive dilemma” or “impossibility theorem”) suggests
t h a t compromises need to be made when applying the usual
constraints on such calculation.8 Such compromises reinforce
the sense that aggregate decisions are not ”in the data” of the
individual decisions, but are various different interpretations of
data, each satisfying different constraints. I n these circumstances, it is a stretch to say that the group “knows.” After all,
which of the many different interpretations of d a t a does i t
know?

4. Conclusion
Discussion and criticism are widely thought to be essential for
both scientific research and political deliberation. Dissent is
traditionally valued because it leads to criticisms a n d
responses to criticism. This paper gives reason to be skeptical
about the outcomes of discussion and criticism. In particular, it
gives reason to be skeptical about the widespread epistemic
ideal of encouraging a group t o deliberate with one another
until they reach consensus. Instead, this paper gives another
reason t o value dissent, namely, that normatively appropriate
dissent preserves information in a way t h a t can be useful to
the group. Finally, the paper suggests that epistemically useful
results can be obtained by various ways of aggregating group
information.

For this way of describing t h e epistemic situation, I draw on
Goldman (20041, who quotes Sandy Berger, national security advisor
under President Clinton, who was speaking of the FBI on 9/11.
This was in his Victims of Groupthink (1972). The second edition
of the book was titled simply Groupthink (1982) and it is this edition
that I am using.
Surowiecki does not explore t h e reasons for this, although h e
does mention t h a t t h e results of polls fluctuate more than the results

of the Iowa Electronic Market.
I qualify this because Surowiecki does not say explicitly how he
arrives a t his recommendations for aggregate decision making. The
recommendations follow the discussion of particular examples.
Exactly how to characterize “empirical success” need not be
discussed here; t h e r e is a full discussion i n c h a p t e r 2 of Social
Empiricism (2001).
Empirical decision vectors a r e causes of preference for theories
with empirical success, either a kind of empirical success in general
or one empirical success in particular (e.g., a preference for theories
with novel empirical success or a p a r t i c u l a r s a l i e n t empirical
success). Nonempirical decision vectors a r e other reasons or causes
for success (e.g., preference for theories with hierarchical ideology,
preference for simpler theories, holding onto a theory because of
pride). Decision vectors include anything that influences t h e outcome
of a decision, including t h o s e influences typically considered as
“biasing factors.” These concepts a r e discussed at length i n my book
Social Empiricism.
* Philip Pettit and Christian List’s recent result, which they call
“the impossibility theorem” (List and Pettit 20021, argues t h a t there
is no aggregation procedure yielding consistent collective judgments
t h a t satisfies their four reasonable constraints (universal domain,
completeness, anonymity, systematicity).
