Ever since the appearance of Professor David McClellantl's studies on achievement motivation,
a subfield of entrepreneurship research has becn the search for the prototype entrepreneurial
personality or the ideal personality attributes of the cntl.cprcneur. The purpose of this article is
twofold: ( I ) to examine how the search for a prototype entrcprcneur has been wrong-headed and
(2) to argue that the focus of entrepreneurship education and training prograrrimrs should bc
skill development, not behaviour modification. This is not to suggest that the personality and
behaviour of the entrepreneur are unimportant to our ficlcl. The entrepreneur is a focal point of
our field and there is a need to continue to scck understantling of the diversity of ent~.eprcneurial
behaviour and how that behaviour shapes the firm, and how it is shaped by the larger cultural
environment.

Introduction

In order to inderstand why some individuals become entrepreneurs a n d some
entrepreneurs a r e relatively more successful than others, there a r e three key elements
that must be addressed: the entrepreneur's personality o r attributes, the entrepreneur's
background a n d experience, a n d the entrepreneur's skills including how they learn. T h e
interrelationship of these three variables is expressed in Figure 1.

Critique of entrepreneurial attributes

McClelland's stucly reflected the 1950s. A rl~qjorthcr~lci l l the economic dcvelopnient
literature of that period was that undcrdcvclopcd couritrics, 3 5 they \\'ere the11 callccl,
were shapecl not only by extreme poverty and a scarc:ity in the k~ctorsol'p~.c~duction,
but
also by a prevailing sense of fatalism. Since fatalislrl \vils pcrceivetl as a rncjor cause of
oriented ancl the
undcrdevclopmcnt, clevelopcd societies were c)b\:ionsly i~chieve~r-~cnt
antidote to fatalism was thc cult.ivation ol' a need to achie\,e.
Is there really any evidence to suggest t l ~ a teither scrccnirrg c;~rlditlntcs Ijascd 0 1 1
personality attributes o r emphasizing bchaviorrr modification is I-cli~tedto Illore or t~cttcr

communities and countries rely o n personality ;~ttributcsi l l scr-et:ning eentrcprcncurs iincl
the morc that cntreprencurial training is basetl on bchaviour ~~~oclification:
the less

that a rcliance o n personality attributes and betlaviour n~oclificationhas bccn p~.irrrarily
employed in the poorest areas of the worlcl, the question rcrnains: ivhy thcrc and not in
the rich countries and cornmunities? W h y are such rncthocls unncct:ssilry in the centres ol'
high prosperity o r in technological ccntrcs likc Silicon \J;llley ancl Koutc 128 in t l ~ cUSA?
O v e r the years, Narziger has probably been thc rnost articulate critic ol' the
achievement motivation literature (1975, 1977, 1978, 1984, 1986. 1988). Nafzigcr fi~lds

that the individual bears responsibility for uncrnplo).rrlcnt o r lor their lack of

Outside the ficld of entrepreneurship, other bodies ol'litcratur.e such as lcadcrship and
managernent studies have been prone to focus on the developrncnt of 'ideal types' basecl
on personality attributes in the early phase of their development. T h e ficld of'
entrepreneurship has been no ciiffcrcnt. Kcliccting thc ri~piddevelopment of the field, the
literature o n the personality attributes of entrepreneurs has ;dso bc:cn severely criticizecl
in a wide variety of sources (Chell 1985, Chell ;~nrl l%urro\vs 1991, C;;~rtncr 1989,
Ginsberg ancl Buchholtz 1989, Sexton 1987, Wortman 1386).
l'hc criticisms of the personillity attribute approach have rcnclccl to focus o n thrcc
issues: (1) the lack of clcfinition and w:ak conccpt Sol-rnation processes; (2) a reliance on a
univariate as opposed to a multivariate approach; ancl (3) the very concept of'a 'trait' and

entrepreneur - has contributecl to contr;~dictor);empirical finclings ( C H I . S ~~fL (11.

developing computer software might have some shared bchavioural traits t h a ~distinguish
them from, let us say, shop-owners.
Another deficiency is that most researchers havc locused on a singlc trait as bcing
definitive while giving insufficient attention to sets of attributes (Chell and Haworth
1992). Ray (1986), in a study of risk taking, discovered that self-esteem was closely
associated with and might have driven risk-taking propcnsity. Those with very low selfesteem either take no risks or very high risks; each action reinforces their initial premise
that they are unworthy individuals. Those with a hcalthy level of self-cstcen~are able to
take risks appropriate to various situations that arise.
The attributes or traits approach to entrcpreneurship makcs a number of assumptions
which are open to challenge. By relying on a single list of attributes, i t assulncs that the
attributes which lead to the decision to launch a new venture are also synonymous with
the attributes that cause new ventures to be successful. The opposite may, in fact, be the
case. A high internal locus of control, for example, may lead individuals to be clissatistied
as employees, subject to the authority of others, but thc same pcrsonality attribute may
actually reduce the likelihood that the new venture will succecd. A h ~ g hinternal locus of
control may prevent the entrepreneur from building an effectivc team or de1,egating any
real authority to the team. Virtually every personality trait an individual pos:;csscs can be
both positive or negative in relation to somc aspect of entreprcncurship and incw venturc
development.
There is also an assumption that the opposite of a specified attribute commonly
associated with the decision to launch a new venture - risk taking - will prcvcnt or inhibit
an individual from becoming an entrepreneur although there is no empirical evidence to
support this assumption. T h e decision to becomc an entrepreneur is complex and the
absence of one or more variables, such as risk taking, may or may not be sufficient to
deter one from becoming an entrepreneur. I n rcality, the decision to become an
entrcpreneur is probably a complex interaction between attributcs and the situation faced
by the individual.
Further, the conceptual and empirical foundations of some of the mosl: conimonly
identified pcrsonality traits are subject to severe criticism. Ray (1986) studied the role of
risk in distinguishing between practising entrepreneurs and managers, cnyinccrs ancl
marketing personnel working for multinational enterprise in Singallore. While
interesting differences were empirically identified, subsequent research revealed that every
conceptual and empirical aspect of the research was based on f;~ultytools and dubious
empirical findings by earlier researchcrs. For examplc, the widely used choice clilcmrnas
cluestionnairc was validated only arnong upper middle-class college students attending
two private colleges in the North-east of the USA. O n e researcher found thiit ovcr 30%
of a sample did not even understand the questions in the choice dilemmas instrurncnt.
The most cited study in the field on risk taking using this instrument was based on a
sample of only 40 applicants for business licences in St Louis, Missouri (IJSA) in the
autumn of 1978. That study generalizes from a marginal, non-entrepreneurial sample in
universal terms and has been interpreted as if it wcre spcaking about a universal
entrepreneurial phenomenon. In short; there is no en~piricalor conceptual base to say
much, if anything, about entrepreneurs and risk taking.
Ncvcrtheless, one can find in numerous textbooks and entrcprcncu~.ial training
manuals reference to entrepreneurs as 'moderate risk takers'. Aside from thc flimsy
cmpirical and conceptual foundation for such an observation, what ~>rccisclydocs bcing a
'moderate risk taker' mean? Are we to interprct such a statement as saying that for the
average entrepreneur all decisions taken havc an aueraEe propcnsity to involve mocleratc
risks? O r does i t mean that the average entrepreneur only takes mocleratc ri:jks implying

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 13:31 30 April 2010

D. M . RAY

that, in low-risk situations, the entrepreneur will opt ]'or thc riskier option ancl, in highrisk situations, will opt for the less risky option? Such statements reflect the confi~sionof
scholars who equate measures of central tendency with the actual dynamics of
entrepreneurial behaviour. T h e phrase 'moderate risk' may be largely a creation of
academic invention unrelated to how entrepreneurs actually think about risk o r cope with
risk in their management decisions. T h e problem may originate in assuming that the role
of risk in entrepreneurship is largely a matter of personality instcad of function of
situations, information, strategy a n d decisions.
Assuming that personality is subject to manipulation in a short training course, a
dubious assumption at best, what happens if the training programme is o\~crlyellicient
and stimulates too much risk taking? Will the graduates fail because a n over-zealous
trainer pushed them over the edge of 'moderate' risk taking anti into the 'high' risktaking category? O r will they take a fateful 'r-nodcrate' risk when they shoulcl have
assumed no risk? O r will they fail evcx to become a n entrepreneur because thcy are
unable to take the risk of leaving a secure, well-paying, high-prestige job despite scoring
as a 'moderate risk taker' o n some psychological test? Risk in entrepreneurship is better
understood as a contextual a n d strategy variable, not a personality variable.
Low et al. (1988, p . 148) conclude in a major rcvie\v of the litcrature o n
entrepreneurship by observing that:
Definitional and niethodological problems associated with thcse past psy~:IioIo~ical
stuclics,
such as noncomparable samples, bias to\v;ird successi'ul cntrcprenrurs, and rhc possibility
that observed entrepreneurial traits are the producl of entrepreneuriid experience, rrialic i t
ditficult to interpret the results. Furthermore, at ;I rrlore hnclarncnt;ll Icvcl, i t can be a r ~ u c d
that the wide variations among entrepreneurs made any ;tttclrlpt to develop a stancl;ird
psychological profile futile. One is struck by the appropri;itcness of' C;artncrls (1985)
observation that there is as llluch diKerence arrlong entrepreneurs as bctwccn cnrreprencurs
and non-entrepreneurs.
T h e attribute literature has focused o n a ft:w personality attributes but has ignored some
of the more obvious a n d possibly tlecisivc attributes in explaining cntrepreneurial success
such as physical appearance a n d likeability. Any reaclcr of the populilr business literature
o n entrepreneurship should bc curious about tht: high pcrccntage of successful
entrepreneurs who, when profiled, are accompanied b). pictures of highly photogenic a n d
attractive individuals. Physically attractive people probably find i t easier to meet pcople
(networking), raise money (resources) and sell their product o r service (customers). By
the same token, individuals who are very personable and likeable probably find the road
to entrepreneurial success to be easier. If you were a supplier, \voulcl you extend credit to
someone without a track record o r proper financial credit who you would Just as soon
never see again? T h e same applies for investors, lenders ancl early customers. Physical
appearance a n d likeability have probably not been clealt with in the litcratul-e because
there they d o not lend then~selvesto mailed surveys and they arc 11ot sufficiently erudite.
Whole bodies of reputable scholarship have bccn ignored by students of
entrepreneurial personality. Basctj o n the metaphorical c.listinction that managers might
be likened to those o n a n organized bus tour while cntrcprencurs might bc likcncd to
travellers with a backpack, the author encouragccl one of his honclurs undergraduates
(van Hollen 1991) to examine the psyc:hological literaturc o n toul-ism. H c founcl some
interesting models that may have relevance to cntrcprcncurship. For c s a n ~ p l e activation

destinations, unstructured rather than packaged tours, and rnorc involvement with local
cultures. Psychocentrics. . . prefer familiar destinations, packagccl tours, ar~cl'touristy'
areas. . . . The energy dimension. . . describes the desired level of activity prel'crrcci by the
tourist; high-energy travellers prefer high lcvcls of activity while low-cncrxy travellers
prefer fewer activities. (Nickerson and Ellis 1991, p. 26)
Activation theory states that individuals differ with regard to their seel..ing out or
avoiding activity. Both high- and low-level activation people can be furthcr c:lassified by
their needs for meaningfulness, variety and internality (Nickerson and Ellis 1991). It is
plausible that entrepreneurs are distinguished from non-entrepreneurs by their high
activation needs and that growth-oriented entrepreneurs arc distin~guishcdfrom small
business founders by even higher needs for activity and higher needs for merirningfulness
and variety. Innovative entrepreneurs may, lndecd, be the 'travellcrs' of the business
world while managers, small business owners and franchisees prefer the 'organized tour'
of business.
T h e purpose here is not to champion activation theory per se or the application of
psychographic research in entrepreneurship but simply to suggest that the field of
entrepreneurship has been stuck for too long on a limited nurnber of psychological traits
that have not necessarily increased our understanding of entrepreneurs or inlproved the
quality of entrepreneurship courses and training programmes.
Sports psychology is another field for fruitful investigation that has bccn ignored by
those committed to understanding the psychology of entreprcncurs. An exarnple of how
sports psychology might contribute to the field can be Sound in the resea.rch by two
Canadian scholars, Orlick and Partington (1988), who studied 235 Canad1.m Olympic
athletes who participated in the 1984 Olympic games in Sarajcvo and Los Angeles. Thcy
sought to understand what mental frames of refcrencc were associated with 'best
performances' and with 'below best performances'. This fascinating study probably has
more to offer the field of entrepreneurship education and training than all c~fthe n Ach
studies piled together.

Towards an understanding of entrepreneurial personality

It is widely assumed that there is a universal set of finite and linear personality attributes
that determine whether one can be an entrepreneur. This list of attribu~:estypically
includes moderate risk taking, internal locus of control, need for achicvcment and
information seeking.
Every prospective entrepreneur has a unique set of attributcs (Ai-n). Thesc attributes
may either facilitate or encourage a decision to launch a new vcnture or they may inhibit
that decision. Once the venturc is launched, these personality attributes may either
increase or reduce the probability of success.
T h e various unique attributes of each individual can be classified into four categories:
(1) attributcs that encourage or facilitate thc decision to become an entrepreneur (Ei-n);
(2) attributes that inhibit the decision to launch a new venture (Ti-n); (3) at,tributes that
increase the likelihood of success and the growth of a new venture (Si-n); and (4)
attributes that reduce the likelihood of success (Fi-n).
T h e probability of any one individual launching a new vcnture is not tlased on the
existence of a fixed set of attributes nor is the success of the new venture. Rathcr there is a
near infinite variety of combinations in which an individual's positive attributes must
outweigh the negative attributes. But it is rnorc complicated than that. Not cvery positivc
or negative attribute is equally important and certainly not equally irllportant in every

culture, every industry o r every situation. T h e importance of a n y single attribute is
always c ~ ~ l t u r a lal y

Some unspecified critical mass of encouraging factors (FG-n) which exceed the total
inhibiting factors must exist with regard to the decision to hecome an entrepreneur. T h i s
might be expressed by the equation:

that a ricar inlinite n u m b e r of combinations of' ;tttrib~rtesm;iy lead to thc dec:ision to

Policy implicatiolis

Accepting the premise that entrepreneurs have unique personalities does not ciemand that
we accept as a corollary the premise that pcrsonality is uni~nportanr to the
entrepreneurial process. Separate studies completed by Knight (1991), R a y and TLII-pin
(1991) a n d R a y (1991) demonstrate that venture capitalists throughout Asia, Europe a n d
North America consider the entrepreneur to bc the most important factor in their
investment decision criteria. Venture capitalists invcst substantial sums of money Srom
their funds o n whether a n individual is o r will become a good entrepreneur. T h c r c is no
evidcnce of a n y venture capitalist anywhere in the worlcl sul~jcctinga prospective
portfolio client to a need for achievement o r some othcr pcrsonality test.
Most venture capitalists interact intcnsivcly with a n entrepreneur for a pcriocl of time
in the process of evaluating a potential portfblio clicnt and in negotiating a complex
investment contract with the client. N o training programme can make sucll careful ancl
prolonged observations of thcir applicants. Rut rcscarch fronl North America suggests
that venture capitalists typically select two to three 'losers' for every big \vinncr a n d 70%
of the firms they decline to invcst in survive (Bruno and Tycl?jcc 1986, 11. 44:),implying at
least nominal success. T h e process of identifying 'winners' and 'loset-s' is extremely
complex. Venture capitalists have access to much bctter information ancl dat.3 than d o the
'gatckeepers' of training programmes.
What is remarkable is that entrepreneurship d c \ ~ l o p m e n tprogrammes assume that
they can effectively screen candidates. It is even morc remarkable that the 'gatckccpers'
rely heavily o n personality attributes as a screening device and that thc spec:ific concepts
used, such as achievement motivatic~n,a n d their measurement instruments c:mploved
arc
.
.
largely imported from abroad. It might be argucd that the dclnand Ibr cntrc:preneurship
' training so ovcrwhelrningly
exceeds the supply of trainers, facilities and financial
resources that some screening a n d selection tool nccds to bc utilizecl. T h e point is well
taken. Rut why not let the candidatcs self-select themselves? If there is a n cxcessi\:c
demand for entrepreneurship, off'er the training at inconvenient times o r make the
training sufficiently rigorous and demanding that only the most serious candidates will
seek to d o it. D O not thesc conditions better simulatc what it takes to becorn,: a successful
entrepreneur far morc than whether one possesses o r can fake a handful of personality
attributes?
Oncc individuals have entered entrepreneurial training programmes, \what kind of
training should they receive? Again, the focus o n a simple, universally based linear
theory of entrepreneurial attributcs has done substantial damage to the process of
entrepreneurship de&lopment. It is highly problematic as to whethe:r short-term
'treatments' can change the behaviour o r pcrsonality attributcs of individuals. T h c r c is a
high degree of pretence even in the assumption that this can be accomplishc:d. Ccrtainly
thcre are areas where radical behaviour modification does occur such as wit11 charismatic
religious cults and religious conversion. It cvcn occurs a m o n g self-help groups such as

Implicit in the personality approach to entrepreneurship training is the mcssage that
poverty is not the result of fundamental structural problems in a society but the result of
some failure o r deficiency o n the part of individuals. If people were only clifl'erent, things
would be bctter. If thc poor people of Asia only had personalities like the rich

Entrcprcncurial skills

I n 1988, R a y a n d Turpin surveyed over 55 entrcprt:lleurs i l l cacli of foul. countrics:
C a n a d a , France, J a p a n ancl the U S A . T h e y sought to unclcrstancl ho\v entrepreneurs
perceived succcss. O n e of the open-ended cluestions askccl the respondents 'what in your
education and training has c o n t r i l ~ ~ ~ tthe
e r l 111ost to \vhatcvel succcss you have achievecl
as a n entrcprcncur?'. T h e results from the US sarnplc:, unreportetl in thcir publication
(1989), were particularly intriguing. T h e US sarnplc was (:omposed exclusively of
~ t ;I riicclical dcg~.eco r a
biotechnology entrepreneurs. Virtuall). every r c s p o ~ i d e ~had

'scientific method'.
solving arc critical skills for
'Reality testing' a n d a systematic approach to prc~l~lcrli
entrepreneurial success. W h a t makes these findings so intriguing is that they are countcrintuitive. Western business school scholars or cntrcprcncurship prograrlinle designers
would probably expect that business skills are the [nost irliportant skills to develop in
training programmes. T h e author is currently involved in ;I multi-facetecl research
project to discover what skills entrepreneurs t l i e ~ ~ ~ s e l consider
vcs
to be most important. I t
is highly probable that the skills whic;h arc most rc:lcvnnt to cmphasizc in training
programmes may be highly specific to specific industries and socio-economic settings.
Consequently, this is a n empirical rescarch eltort that neec.1~to bc replicated in many
different locations. Readers who cvould like to join in thc t-cscarch team arc invitccl to
write to the author.
Based o n m y understanding o f the new venture clevelopnient process, a partial list of
the skills which seems to be critical includes the follo~ving:
1 l'hc ability to identify new product a n d service opportunities. T h i s involves the
ability to see what others d o not see, to \;isualize what docs not exist, and the
ability to identify what is missing. T h e opportunity iclcntification process depends
heavily o n creativity a n d the ability to think innovativcly.
2 T h e ability to assess opportunities and the ability to think critically. Critical
evaluation is essential in distinguishing bet~veen good opportunities a n d the

illusion of an opportunity. Innovative entrepreneurship may be rare because
creativity and critical evaluation are not widely nurtured in educational systems at
any level.
Persuasive communication skills. Entrepreneurs typically start with little more
than an idea in their heads. To transform that idea into a reality, they must
persuade people to join them in the new venture, persuade friends, t.elatives and
even strangers to invest in the venture or loan i t money; persuade suppliers to
extend credit; and finally persuade customers to part with their hard-earned
money for a new product or service from an unproven company. Pcr:;uasive skills
embrace both oral and written communication, face-to-face and telephone
communication.
Negotiation skills. Negotiation skills are critical for the same reasons a.s persuasive
skills. Once someone has been persuaded to support a new venture, the details still
must be worked out. These details can either be simple or ccnnplex, but
negotiation skills are inevitably involved.
Interpersonal communication. Entrepreneurship is a people-intensive activity.
Without good 'people skills' it will be very difficult for an entrepreneur to succeccl.
Listening and information acquisition skills. Implicit in persuasive c:ommunication, negotiation and interpersonal communication is the ability to listcn and the
ability to discover the interests and neecls of others.
Problem-solving skills. There are certain patterns in the new venture development
process but each new venture creates a unique set of problems, challenges and
crises. Aside from franchising, there are no formulas in entrepreneurship. It is
impossible to teach entrepreneurs how to respond to every problen~they will face
in launching and growing a new venture. What can be done and what is critical
for effective programming is to cultivate problem-solving skills.

This list of skills is not intended to be definitive. Whether there is etnpirica:l support for
the development of these skills or a diferent set of skills is something that needs to be
investigated.
A comparison of the author's longer list of' skills with the skills emphasi;~cclby other
scholars in the field can be found in Appendix A . Creating this appendix was surprisingly
difficult, which may say something about the need to clarify the meaning of skills. While
one could identify a reasonably clear lists of' attributes that are cornmonly asr,ociatecl with
entrepreneurship, it is harder to identify the skills. Even when skills are emphasized in
the literature, there is a lack of clarity as to their meaning and importance:. Thcre are
several reasons for this. First, the level of specificity is often very high. For example, what
specific 'start-up action skills' mentioned by Ronstadt (1985) are most important?
Second, the conceptual line between personality attributes and skills is often not clearly
drawn. For example, is Chell and Haworth's (1992) 'striving to be the best' a skill or a
personality attribute? T h e same difficulty in distinguishing between skills t~cvclopment
and behaviour modification is obvious in the materials published by the CEFE
programme developed by G T Z , the Gerrnan development agency. T h e same problem is
found in the publications of Management Systems International (MSI) artd McBer &
Co., two of the leading international for-profit entrepreneurship training consultants in
the world.
MSI (1990) has a list of 15 'PECs' or personal entrepreneurial characteristics, which is
largely based on the studies completed by McBer & Co. and listed in Appendix A under
Spencer (1986). T h e concept of a 'PEC' blurs the important distincti~on between
attributes and skills. O n both the Spencer and MSI list is 'opportunity seeking', which

<-----Page 10----->Downloaded By: [University of Toronto] At: 13:31 30 April 2010

implies something slightly different, more t,chaviou~.;llly oricntccl, than cc)pl~ort~lnity
identification, a skill that can bc taught. Chinese entl-cprencurs in Singapore, lor
example, are r~aturallyopportunity seeking but they arc not \.cry skillctl at syste~natic;~lly
seeking out opportunities o r clevcloping new pl-oclitcts. "l'l~ius:they Ilorlrish in t r a c l i n ~a n d
commerce but have been less s~~cccssf~ul
in innovalive 01- technology-t~ascd
cntreprcnc~~rship.
In fact the MSI list of 15 'PECs' pl;lces dccidctlly morc: cmphasis on
behavioural attributes than Spencer's (1986) list. -1-he M S I list includes such things as
initiativc, persistence, asscrtivenc:ss, self-confidence, moclcratc risk taking and goal
setting ( M S I 1990, p. 77).
Whilc there may inevitably be somc ovcrl;~pbct\vccn bclla\,ioul rnodific;~tionanrl skill
development activity, the blurred bouncti~rics bctwccn the two categories ~ ~ r o b a l ~ l y
reflects the lack of attention given to entrepreneurial skills in research, entr.eprc~tcur~ship
education and training programme design. Most textbooks in the held discuss sornc of

Conclusion

T h e basic prcmisc of this paper is that the cntreprcncurii~lpcrson;~lityis important in
shaping a venture but that there is no ideal-type pcrsonality o r marginal set o f ; ~ t t r i b ~ ~ t c s
that guarantees success for a new venture. Training programlnes that locus o n

entrepreneur. T h e entrepreneur's personality will shape the company's culture, the
values a n d the social behaviour of the firm. M u c h more needs to be understood about
entrepreneurial behaviour a n d the relationship between the entrcprcncur's personality
a n d the new venture creation process.
A science of entrepreneurship development 111ust rest on a solicl foundation of
elnpirical investigation. A n essential aspect of a n y science is failurc. Scicntists 'fail' in
their laboratory experiments far morc oftcn than thcy succeed. Unlcss we begin to
measure the results of o u r interventions, o u r training programrncs, wc will bt: stuck with
the programmes organized around outdated and wrong-hcadcd thcorics. Only when we
begin to measure the results of o u r programrncs, the clfcctiveness of alternative
'treatments' a n d share those results, a n d o u r successcs and failurcs, widcly in thc ficld,
will we dcvelop a true scicncc of cntrcprcncurship dcvclopmcnt. Failure rnust be an
essential component of a science of entrepreneurship.
It might be questioned why programme administrators should proviclt: empirical
evidence of failure to those who oppose entrepreneurship development. Why should wrc
not maintain a public relations facade of success a n d achievement? Certainly
achievement is what.economic development is all about. If thc fielcl of entrcp~rcncurship
rests o n public rclations, it will be littlc more than a passing fad. E n t r e ~ ~ r e n e u r s h i p
training a n d development has been around for several decadcs but it has bec:n swept to
prominence based o n the privatization and frcc market movemcnt of the 1980s. It has
received another boost with the collapsc of the centrally planncd cconomics of the formcr
communist bloc countries. T h e r e is perhaps anothcr 10-year 'window of opportunity' Ior
entrepreneurship a n d entrepreneurship development programmes to demonstrate that
there is another path to cconomic prosperity and dcvclopmcnt. In some couni:rics a n d in
some settings, the 'window of opportunity' may be longer and in othcr settings i t may be
shorter. T h e public relations approach to entrepreneurship development cannot be
sustained in light of thc povcrty a n d complcx cconomic problcms conliontirlg virtually
every country in the world.
If we in the field ofentrepreneurship want to d o anything more than profit I'rom a fad,
we must approach entrepreneurship development and our activities as if wc were
developing a new science. T h a t means we must be willing to share honestly th.e results of
o u r programme successes and failurcs; we must strivc to construct morc complex thcorics
and more closely approximate the diversity of entrepreneurial experience; and wc must
continually strive to better understand entrepreneurial reality through a variety of
empirical research methods.
