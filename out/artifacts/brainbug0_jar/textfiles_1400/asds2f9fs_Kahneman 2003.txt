By DANIEL KAHNEMAN*
The work cited by the Nobel committee was
done jointly with Amos Tversky (1937-1996)
duringa long and unusuallyclose collaboration.
Together, we explored the psychology of intuitive beliefs and choices and examined their
bounded rationality. Herbert A. Simon (1955,
1979) had proposed much earlier that decision
makersshould be viewed as boundedlyrational,
and had offered a model in which utility maximization was replaced by satisficing. Our research attemptedto obtain a map of bounded
rationality, by exploring the systematic biases
that separatethe beliefs thatpeople have and the
choices they make from the optimal beliefs and
choices assumed in rational-agentmodels. The
rational-agentmodel was our startingpoint and
the main source of our null hypotheses, but
Tversky and I viewed our researchprimarilyas
a contributionto psychology, with a possible
contributionto economics as a secondarybenefit. We were drawn into the interdisciplinary
conversation by economists who hoped that
psychology could be a useful source of assumptions for economic theorizing, and indirectly a
source of hypotheses for economic research
(Richard H. Thaler, 1980, 1991, 1992). These

This essay revisits problems that Amos Tversky and I
studiedtogethermany years ago, and continuedto discuss in
a conversationthat spannedseveral decades. It builds on an
analysis of judgment heuristics that was developed in collaborationwith Shane Frederick(Kahnemanand Frederick,
2002). A different version was published in American Psychologist in September2003. For detailedcomments on this

hopes have been realized to some extent, giving
rise to an active programof researchby behavioral economists (Thaler, 2000; Colin Camerer
et al., forthcoming; for other examples, see
Kahnemanand Tversky, 2000).
My work with Tversky comprisedthree separate programs of research, some aspects of
which were carriedout with othercollaborators.
The first explored the heuristicsthat people use
and the biases to which they are prone in various tasks of judgmentunderuncertainty,including predictions and evaluations of evidence
(Kahneman and Tversky, 1973; Tversky and
Kahneman,1974; Kahnemanet al., 1982). The
second was concerned with prospect theory, a
model of choice under risk (Kahneman and
Tversky, 1979; Tversky and Kahneman, 1992)
and with loss aversion in riskless choice (Kahneman et al., 1990, 1991; Tversky and Kahneman, 1991). The thirdline of researchdealt with
framing effects and with their implications for
rational-agentmodels (Tversky and Kahneman,
1981, 1986). The present essay revisits these
three lines of research in light of recent advances in the psychology of intuitivejudgment
and choice. Many of the ideas presented here
were anticipated informally decades ago, but
the attempt to integrate them into a coherent
approachto judgment and choice is recent.
Economists often criticize psychological research for its propensity to generate lists of
errors and biases, and for its failure to offer a
coherentalternativeto the rational-agentmodel.
This complaint is only partlyjustified: psychological theories of intuitive thinking cannot
matchthe elegance and precision of formalnormative models of belief and choice, but this is
just anotherway of saying that rationalmodels
are psychologically unrealistic. Furthermore,
the alternativeto simple and precise models is
not chaos. Psychology offers integrative concepts and mid-level generalizations,which gain
credibility from their ability to explain ostensibly differentphenomenain diverse domains. In
this spirit, the present essay offers a unified

treatment of intuitive judgment and choice,
which builds on an earlierstudy of the relationship between preferencesand attitudes(Kahneman et al., 1999) and extends a model of
judgment heuristics recently proposed by Kahneman and Shane Frederick(2002). The guiding ideas are (i) that most judgments and most
choices are made intuitively; (ii) that the rules
that govern intuitionare generally similarto the
rules of perception.Accordingly, the discussion
of the rules of intuitivejudgments and choices
will rely extensively on visual analogies.
Section I introduces a distinction between
two generic modes of cognitive function, corresponding roughly to intuition and reasoning.
Section II describes the factors that determine
the relative accessibility of differentjudgments
and responses. Section III relates prospect theory to the general propositionthat changes and
differences are more accessible than absolute
values. Section IV explains framing effects in
terms of differential salience and accessibility.
Section V reviews an attribute substitution
model of heuristic judgment. Section VI describes a particularfamily of heuristics, called
prototype heuristics. Section VII discusses the
interactions between intuitive and deliberate
thought. Section VIII concludes.
I. The Architectureof Cognition:Two Systems
The present treatment distinguishes two
modes of thinking and deciding, which correspond roughly to the everyday concepts of reasoning and intuition. Reasoning is what we do
when we computethe productof 17 by 258, fill
an income tax form, or consult a map. Intuition
is at work when we read the sentence "Bill
Clinton is a shy man" as mildly amusing, or
when we find ourselves reluctantto eat a piece
of what we know to be chocolate that has been
formed in the shape of a cockroach(Paul Rozin
and Carol Nemeroff, 2002). Reasoning is done
deliberatelyand effortfully,but intuitivethoughts
seem to come spontaneouslyto mind, without
conscious search or computation, and without
effort. Casual observation and systematic research indicate that most thoughts and actions
are normally intuitive in this sense (Daniel T.
Gilbert, 1989, 2002; Timothy D. Wilson, 2002;
Seymour Epstein, 2003).
Although effortless thought is the norm,
some monitoringof the quality of mental oper-

DECEMBER2003

ations and overt behavior also goes on. We do
not express every passing thought or act on
every impulse. But the monitoring is normally
lax, and allows many intuitivejudgments to be
expressed, including some that are erroneous
(Kahneman and Frederick, 2002). Ellen J.
Langer et al. (1978) provided a well-known
example of what she called "mindless behavior." In her experiment, a confederate tried to
cut in line at a copying machine, using various
preset "excuses."The conclusion was thatstatements that had the form of an unqualifiedrequest were rejected(e.g., "Excuseme, may I use
the Xerox machine?"),but almost any statement
that had the general form of an explanationwas
accepted, including "Excuse me, may I use the
Xerox machine because I want to make copies?" The superficialityis striking.
Frederick (2003, personal communication)
has used simple puzzles to study cognitive selfmonitoring,as in the following example: "A bat
and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1
more than the ball. How much does the ball
cost?" Almost everyone reports an initial tendency to answer "10 cents" because the sum
$1.10 separatesnaturallyinto $1 and 10 cents,
and 10 cents is aboutthe right magnitude.Frederick found thatmany intelligentpeople yield to
this immediateimpulse: 50 percent(47/93) of a
group of Princeton students and 56 percent
(164/293) of studentsat the Universityof Michigan gave the wrong answer. Clearly, these respondents offered their response without first
checking it. The surprisinglyhigh rate of errors
in this easy problem illustrateshow lightly the
outputof effortless associative thinkingis monitored: people are not accustomed to thinking
hard, and are often content to trust a plausible
judgment that quickly comes to mind. Remarkably, Frederick has found that errors in
this puzzle and in others of the same type
were significant predictors of high discount
rates.
In the examples discussed so far, intuition
was associated with poor performance,but intuitive thinkingcan also be powerful and accurate. High skill is acquired by prolonged
practice, and the performanceof skills is rapid
and effortless. The proverbial master chess
player who walks past a game and declares
"white mates in three" without slowing is performing intuitively (Simon and William G.
Chase, 1973), as is the experienced nurse who

detects subtle signs of impending heart failure
(Gary Klein, 1998; Atul Gawande, 2002).
The distinctionbetween intuitionand reasoning has recently been a topic of considerable
interest to psychologists (see, e.g., Shelly
Chaiken and Yaacov Trope, 1999; Gilbert,
2002; Steven A. Sloman, 2002; Keith E.
Stanovich and RichardF. West, 2002). There is
substantialagreementon the characteristicsthat
distinguishthe two types of cognitive processes,
for which Stanovich and West (2000) proposed
the neutral labels of System 1 and System 2.
The scheme shown in Figure 1 summarizes
these characteristics.The operationsof System
1 are fast, automatic,effortless, associative, and
often emotionally charged; they are also governed by habit, and are therefore difficult to
control or modify. The operationsof System 2
are slower, serial, effortful, and deliberately
controlled;they are also relatively flexible and
potentially rule-governed.
The difference in effort provides the most
useful indications of whether a given mental
process should be assigned to System 1 or System 2. Because the overall capacity for mental
effort is limited, effortful processes tend to disrupt each other, whereas effortless processes

neithercause nor suffer much interferencewhen
combinedwith othertasks. For example, a driver's ability to conduct a conversationis a sensitive indicator of the amount of attention
currently demanded by the driving task. Dual
tasks have been used in hundredsof psychological experimentsto measure the attentionaldemands of different mental activities (for a
review, see Harold E. Pashler, 1998). Studies
using the dual-taskmethod suggest thatthe selfmonitoring function belongs with the effortful
operations of System 2. People who are occupied by a demanding mental activity (e.g., attempting to hold in mind several digits) are
much more likely to respondto anothertask by
blurting out whatever comes to mind (Gilbert,
1989). The phrase that "System 2 monitors the
activities of System 1" will be used here as
shorthandfor a hypothesis about what would
happen if the operationsof System 2 were disrupted.For example, it is safe to predictthat the
percentageof errorsin the bat-and-ballquestion
will increase, if the respondentsare asked this
question while attempting to keep a list of
words in their active memory.
In the language that will be used here, the
perceptual system and the intuitive operations

<-----Page 4----->1452

THE AMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

of System 1 generate impressions of the attributes of objects of perception and thought.
These impressions are not voluntary and need
not be verbally explicit. In contrast,judgments
are always explicit and intentional, whether or
not they are overtly expressed. Thus, System 2
is involved in all judgments, whetherthey originate in impressions or in deliberatereasoning.
The label "intuitive" is applied to judgments
that directly reflect impressions.
Figure 1 illustrates an idea that guided the
researchthat Tversky and I conducted from its
early days: that intuitive judgments occupy a
position-perhaps correspondingto evolutionary history-between the automaticoperations
of perception and the deliberate operations of
reasoning. All the characteristicsthat students
of intuitionhave attributedto System 1 are also
propertiesof perceptualoperations.Unlike perception, however, the operations of System 1
are not restricted to the processing of current
stimulation. Like System 2, the operations of
System 1 deal with stored concepts as well as
with percepts, and can be evoked by language.
This view of intuition suggests that the vast
store of scientific knowledge available about
perceptualphenomenacan be a source of useful
hypotheses aboutthe workingsof intuition.The
strategy of drawing on analogies from perception is applied in the following section.
II. The AccessibilityDimension
A defining property of intuitive thoughts is
that they come to mind spontaneously,like percepts. The technical term for the ease with
which mental contents come to mind is accessibility (E. Tory Higgins, 1996). To understand
intuition, we must understand why some
thoughts are accessible and others are not. The
remainderof this section introducesthe concept
of accessibility by examples drawnfrom visual
perception.
Consider Figures 2a and 2b. As we look at
the object in Figure 2a, we have immediate
impressionsof the height of the tower, the area
of the top block, and perhapsthe volume of the
tower. Translatingthese impressions into units
of height or volume requiresa deliberateoperation, but the impressionsthemselves are highly
accessible. For other attributes,no perceptual
impression exists. For example, the total area
that the blocks would cover if the tower were

Figure 2c

FIGURE 2. EXAMPLES OF DIFFERENTIAL ACCESSIBILITY

dismantled is not perceptually accessible,
though it can be estimated by a deliberateprocedure, such as multiplyingthe area of a block
by the numberof blocks. Of course, the situation is reversedwith Figure 2b. Now the blocks
are laid out and an impression of total area is
immediately accessible, but the height of the
tower that could be constructed with these
blocks is not.
Some relational properties are accessible.
Thus, it is obvious at a glance that Figures 2a
and 2c are different,but also that they are more
similar to each other than either is to Figure
2b. And some statisticalpropertiesof ensembles
are accessible, while others are not. For an
example, consider the question "What is the
average length of the lines in Figure 3?" This
question is easy. When a set of objects of the
same generalkind is presentedto an observerwhethersimultaneouslyor successively-a representationof the set is computedautomatically,
which includes quite precise informationabout
the average (Dan Ariely, 2001; Sang-Chul
Chong and Anne Treisman, 2003). The representation of the prototype is highly accessible,
and it has the characterof a percept:we form an
impression of the typical line without choosing
to do so. The only role for System 2 in this task
is to map the impression of typical length onto
the appropriatescale. In contrast,the answer to
the question "What is the total length of the
lines in the display?" does not come to mind
without considerableeffort.
As the example of averages and sums illustrates, some attributesare more accessible than
others, both in perceptionand in judgment. Attributes that are routinely and automatically
producedby the perceptualsystem or by System

1, without intention or effort, have been called
natural assessments (Tversky and Kahneman,
1983). Kahneman and Frederick (2002) compiled a partiallist of these naturalassessments.
In addition to physical propertiessuch as size,
distance, and loudness, the list includes more
abstract properties such as similarity, causal
propensity, surprisingness, affective valence,
and mood.
The evaluation of stimuli as good or bad is a
particularlyimportantnatural assessment. The
evidence, both behavioral (John A. Bargh,
1997; Robert B. Zajonc, 1998) and neurophysiological (e.g., Joseph E. LeDoux, 2000), is
consistent with the idea that the assessment of
whether objects are good (and should be approached)or bad (should be avoided) is carried
out quickly and efficiently by specialized neural
circuitry.A remarkableexperimentreportedby
Bargh (1997) illustratesthe speed of the evaluation process, and its directlink to approachand
avoidance. Participantswere shown a series of
stimuli on a screen, and instructedto respondto
each stimulusas soon as it appeared,by moving
a lever thatblankedthe screen. The stimuli were
affectively charged words, some positive (e.g.,
LOVE) and some aversive (e.g., VOMIT), but
this feature was irrelevant to the participant's
task. Half the participantsrespondedby pulling
the lever towardthemselves, half respondedby
pushing the lever away. Although the response

1453

was initiatedwithin a fractionof a second, well
before the meaning of the stimulus was consciously registered,the emotionalvalence of the
word had a substantialeffect. Participantswere
relatively faster in pulling a lever towardthemselves (approach)for positive words, and relatively faster pushing the lever away when the
word was aversive. The tendencies to approach
or avoid were evoked by an automaticprocess
that was not underconscious voluntarycontrol.
Several psychologists have commented on the
influence of this primordialevaluative system
(here includedin System 1) on the attitudesand
preferences that people adopt consciously and
deliberately (Zajonc, 1998; Kahneman et al.,
1999; Paul Slovic et al., 2002; Epstein, 2003).
The preceding discussion establishes a dimension of accessibility. At one end of this
dimension we find operations that have the
characteristicsof perceptionand of the intuitive
System 1: they are rapid,automatic,and effortless. At the other end are slow, serial, and
effortful operations that people need a special
reason to undertake.Accessibility is a continuum, not a dichotomy, and some effortful operations demand more effort than others. Some
of the determinantsof accessibility are probably
genetic; othersdevelop throughexperience.The
acquisition of skill gradually increases the accessibility of useful responses and of productive
ways to organize information,until skilled performancebecomes almost effortless. This effect
of practice is not limited to motor skills. A
masterchess playerdoes not see the same board
as the novice, and visualizing the tower in an
array of blocks would also become virtually
effortless with prolonged practice.
The impressions that become accessible in
any particularsituation are mainly determined,
of course, by the actual propertiesof the object
of judgment:it is easier to see a tower in Figure
2a than in Figure 2b, because the tower in the
latter is only virtual. Physical salience also determinesaccessibility:if a large green letterand
a small blue letter are shown at the same time,
"green"will come to mind first. However, salience can be overcome by deliberateattention:
an instructionto look for the small object will
enhance the accessibility of all its features.
Analogous effects of salience and of spontaneous and voluntaryattentionoccur with more
abstract stimuli. For example, the statements
"Team A beat team B" and "Team B lost to

<-----Page 6----->1454

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

FIGURE 4. AN EFFECT OF CONTEXT ON ACCESSIBILITY

team A" convey the same information,but because each sentence drawsattentionto its grammatical subject, they make different thoughts
accessible. Accessibility also reflects temporary
states of associativeactivation.For example,the
mentionof a familiarsocial categorytemporarily
increasesthe accessibilityof the traitsassociated
with the category stereotype,as indicatedby a
lowered thresholdfor recognizing behaviors as
indicationsof these traits(SusanT. Fiske, 1998).
As designers of billboardsknow well, motivationally relevant and emotionally arousing
stimuli spontaneously attract attention. Billboards are useful to advertisersbecause paying
attention to an object makes all its features
accessible-including those that are not linked
to its primarymotivationalor emotional significance. The "hot"states of high emotional and
motivationalarousalgreatly increase the accessibility of thoughts that relate to the immediate
emotion and to the currentneeds, and reducethe
accessibility of other thoughts (George Loewenstein, 1996, 2000; Jon Elster, 1998). An
effect of emotional significanceon accessibility
was demonstratedin an importantstudy by Yuval Rottenstreich and Christopher K. Hsee
(2001), which showed that people are less sensitive to variationsof probabilitywhen valuing
chances to receive emotionally loaded outcomes (kisses and electric shocks) than when
the outcomes are monetary.
Figure4 (adaptedfrom JeromeS. Brunerand
A. Leigh Minturn, 1955) includes a standard
demonstrationof the effect of context on accessibility. An ambiguous stimulus that is perceived as a letter within a context of letters is

DECEMBER2003

instead seen as a numberwhen placed within a
context of numbers. More generally, expectations (conscious or not) are a powerful determinant of accessibility.
Another importantpoint that Figure 4 illustrates is the complete suppressionof ambiguity
in conscious perception.This aspect of the demonstrationis spoiled for the readerwho sees the
two versions in close proximity, but when the
two lines are shown separately, observers will
not spontaneouslybecome aware of the alternative interpretation.They "see"the interpretation
of the object that is the most likely in its context, but have no subjective indication that it
could be seen differently.Ambiguityand uncertainty are suppressed in intuitive judgment as
well as in perception.Doubt is a phenomenonof
System 2, an awarenessof one's ability to think
incompatible thoughts about the same thing.
The central finding in studies of intuitive decisions, as described by Klein (1998), is that
experienced decision makers working under
pressure (e.g., firefighting company captains)
rarelyneed to choose between options because,
in mostcases, only a single optioncomes to mind.
The compound cognitive system that has
been sketched here is an impressive computational device. It is well-adaptedto its environment and has two ways of adjustingto changes:
a short-termprocess that is flexible and effortful, and a long-termprocess of skill acquisition
that eventually produces highly effective responses at low cost. The system tends to see
what it expects to see-a form of Bayesian
adaptation-and it is also capableof responding
effectively to surprises.However, this marvelous creation differs in importantrespects from
anotherparagon,the rationalagent assumed in
economic theory. Some of these differences are
exploredin the following sections,which review
severalfamiliarresultsas effects of accessibility.
Possible implicationsfor theorizingin behavioral
economicsare exploredalong the way.
III. Changesor States:ProspectTheory
A general propertyof perceptualsystems is
that they are designed to enhance the accessibility of changes and differences. Perceptionis
reference-dependent:the perceived attributes
of a focal stimulus reflect the contrastbetween
that stimulus and a context of prior and concurrent stimuli. This section will show that

<-----Page 7----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

1455

FIGURE 5. REFERENCE-DEPENDENCE IN THE PERCEPTION OF BRIGHTNESS

intuitive evaluations of outcomes are also
reference-dependent.
The role of priorstimulationis familiarin the
domain of temperature.Immersingthe hand in
water at 20?C will feel pleasantly warm after
prolongedimmersionin much colder water, and
pleasantly cool after immersion in much
warmer water. Figure 5 illustrates referencedependencein vision. The two enclosed squares
have the same luminance, but they do not appear equally bright.The point of the demonstration is that the brightness of an area is not a
single-parameterfunction of the light energy
that reaches the eye from that area,just as the
experienceof temperatureis not a single-parameter function of the temperatureto which one is
currently exposed. An account of perceived
brightnessor temperaturealso requiresa parameter for a reference value (often called adaptation level), which is influencedby the context of
currentand prior stimulation.
From the vantage point of a student of perception, it is quite surprising that in standard
economic analyses the utility of decision outcomes is assumed to be determinedentirely by
the final state of endowment, and is therefore
reference-independent.In the context of risky
choice, this assumption can be traced to the
brilliantessay that first defined a theory of expected utility (Daniel Bernoulli, 1738). Bernoulli assumed that states of wealth have a
specified utility, and proposedthat the decision
rule for choice under risk is to maximize the

expected utility of wealth (the moral expectation). The language of Bernoulli's essay is prescriptive-it speaks of what is sensible or
reasonable to do-but the theory was also intended as a descriptionof the choices of reasonable men (Gerd Gigerenzeret al., 1989). As in
most modem treatments of decision-making,
Bernoulli's essay does not acknowledge any
tension between prescription and description.
The proposition that decision makers evaluate
outcomes by the utility of final asset positions
has been retained in economic analyses for almost 300 years. This is ratherremarkable,because the idea is easily shown to be wrong; I
call it Bernoulli's error.
Tversky and I constructednumerousthought
experimentswhen we began the study of risky
choice that led to the formulation of prospect
theory (Kahnemanand Tversky, 1979). Examples such as Problems 1 and 2 below convinced
us of the inadequacyof the utility function for
wealth as an explanationof choice.

Problem 1
Would you accept this gamble?
50% chance to win $150
50% chance to lose $100
Would your choice change if your
overall wealth were lower by $100?

<-----Page 8----->1456

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

There will be few takersof the gamble in Problem 1. The experimentalevidence shows that
most people will reject a gamble with even
chances to win and lose, unless the possible win
is at least twice the size of the possible loss
(e.g., Tversky and Kahneman, 1992). The answer to the second question is, of course, negative. Next consider Problem 2:

Problem 2
Which would you choose?
lose $100 with certainty
or
50% chance to win $50
50% chance to lose $200
Would your choice change if your
overall wealth were higher by $100?

In Problem2, the gamble appearsmuch more
attractivethan the sure loss. Experimentalresults indicate that risk-seeking preferences are
held by a large majorityof respondentsin problems of this kind (Kahneman and Tversky,
1979). Here again, the idea that a change of
$100 in total wealth would affect preferences
cannot be taken seriously.
We examined many choice pairs of this
type in our early explorations, and concluded
that the very abruptswitch from risk aversion
to risk seeking could not plausibly be explained by a utility function for wealth. Preferences appeared to be determined by
attitudes to gains and losses, defined relative
to a reference point, but Bernoulli's theory
and its successors did not incorporate a reference point. We therefore proposed an alternative theory of risk, in which the carriers of
of
utility are gains and losses-changes
wealth rather than states of wealth. One novelty of prospect theory was that it was explicitly presented as a formal descriptive theory
of the choices that people actually make, not
as a normative model. This was a departure
from a long history of choice models that
served double duty as normative logics and as
idealized descriptive models.
The distinctive predictions of prospect theory follow from the shape of the value function, which is shown in Figure 6. The value
function is defined on gains and losses and is

VALUEFUNCTIONFORCHANGES

characterized by three features: (1) it is concave in the domain of gains, favoring risk
aversion; (2) it is convex in the domain of
losses, favoring risk seeking; (3) most important, the function is sharply kinked at the
reference point, and loss-averse-steeper for
losses than for gains by a factor of about
2-2.5 (Kahneman et al., 1991; Tversky and
Kahneman, 1992).
If Bernoulli's formulation is transparently
incorrect as a descriptive model of risky
choices, as has been argued here, why
has this model been retained for so long?
The answer appears to be that the assignment of utility to wealth is an aspect of rationality, and therefore compatible with the
general assumption of rationality in economic
theorizing (Kahneman, 2003a). Consider
Problem 3:

Problem 3
Two persons get their monthly report
from a broker:
A is told that her wealth went from
4M to 3M
B is told that her wealth went from
1M to .IM
Who of the two individuals has more
reason to be satisfied with her financial
situation?
Who is happiertoday?

<-----Page 9----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

Problem3 highlightsthe contrastinginterpretationsof utility in theoriesthatdefine outcomes
as states or as changes. In Bernoulli's analysis
only the first of the two questions of Problem 3
is relevant, and only long-term consequences
matter. Prospect theory, in contrast, is concerned with short-termoutcomes, and the value
function presumablyreflects an anticipationof
the valence and intensity of the emotions that
will be experienced at moments of transition
from one state to another(Kahneman,2000a, b;
BarbaraMellers, 2000). Which of these concepts of utility is more useful? The cultural
norm of reasonabledecision-makingfavors the
long-termview over a concernwithtransientemotions. Indeed,the adoptionof a broadperspective
and a long-termview is an aspectof the meaning
of rationalityin everyday language. The finalstates interpretationof the utility of outcomes is
thereforea good fit for a rational-agentmodel.
These considerations support the normative
and prescriptivestatus of the Bemoullian definition of outcomes. On the other hand, an exclusive concern with the long term may be
prescriptively sterile, because the long term is
not where life is lived. Utility cannot be divorced from emotion, and emotions are triggered by changes. A theory of choice that
completely ignores feelings such as the pain of
losses and the regret of mistakes is not only
descriptively unrealistic, it also leads to prescriptions that do not maximize the utility of
outcomes as they are actually experiencedthat is, utility as Benthamconceived it (Kahneman, 1994, 2000a; Kahnemanet al., 1997).
Bernoulli's error-the idea that the carriers
of utility are final states-is not restricted to
decision-making under risk. Indeed, the incorrect assumptionthat initial endowments do not
matteris the basis of Coase's theoremand of its
multiple applications (Kahnemanet al., 1990).
The error of reference-independenceis built
into the standardrepresentationof indifference
maps. It is puzzling to a psychologist that these
maps do not include a representationof the
decision maker's current holdings of various
goods-the counterpartof the referencepoint in
prospect theory. The parameteris not included,
of course, because consumer theory assumes
that it does not matter.
The core idea of prospect theory-that the
value function is kinked at the reference point
and loss averse-became useful to economics

1457

when Thaler (1980) used it to explain riskless
choices. In particular,loss aversionexplained a
violationof consumertheorythatThaleridentified
and labeled the "endowmenteffect":the selling
price for consumptiongoods is much higherthan
the buying price, often by a factorof 2 or more.
The valueof a good to an individualappearsto be
higherwhen the good is viewed as somethingthat
couldbe lost or given up thanwhenthe samegood
is evaluatedas a potentialgain (Kahnemanet al.,
1990, 1991; Tverskyand Kahneman,1991).
When half the participantsin an experimental
market were randomly chosen to be endowed
with a good (a mug) and tradewas allowed, the
volume of tradewas about half the amountthat
would be predictedby assuming that value was
independent of initial endowment (Kahneman
et al., 1990). Transactioncosts did not explain
this counterexampleto the Coase theorem, because the same institutionproducedno indication of reluctanceto trade when the objects of
trade were money tokens. The results suggest
thatthe participantsin these experimentsdid not
value the mug as an object they could have and
consume, but as something they could get, or
give up. Interestingly,John A. List (2003a, b)
found that the magnitude of the endowment
effect was substantiallyreducedfor participants
with intense experience in the tradingof sportscards. Experienced traders (who are also consumers) showed less reluctance to trade one
good for another-not only sportscards,but also
mugs and othergoods-as if they had learnedto
base theirchoice on long-termvalue, ratherthan
on the immediateemotions associated with getting or giving up objects.
Reference-dependenceand loss aversionhelp
account for several phenomena of choice. The
familiar observation that out-of-pocket losses
are valued much more than opportunitycosts is
readily explained, if these outcomes are evaluated on different limbs of the value function.
The distinction between "actual" losses and
losses of opportunitiesis recognized in many
ways in the law (David Cohen and Jack L.
Knetsch, 1992) and in lay intuitionsabout rules
of fairness in the market (Kahneman et al.,
1986). Loss aversion also contributes to the
well-documented status-quo bias (William
Samuelson and RichardZeckhauser,1988). Because the reference point is usually the status
quo, the properties of alternative options are
evaluated as advantages or disadvantages

<-----Page 10----->1458

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

relative to the currentsituation, and the disadvantages of the alternatives loom larger than
their advantages.Otherapplicationsof the concept of loss aversion are documentedin several
chaptersin Kahnemanand Tversky (2000).

DECEMBER2003

In this version of the problem, a substantial
majorityof respondentsfavor ProgramA, indicating risk aversion. Other respondents, selected at random, receive a question in which
the same cover story is followed by a different
descriptionof the options:

IV. FramingEffects
In the display of blocks in Figure 2, the same
property(the total height of a set of blocks) was
highly accessible in one display and not in another, although both displays contained the
same information.This observation is entirely
unremarkable-it does not seem shocking that
some attributesof a stimulus are automatically
perceived while others must be computed, or
that the same attributeis perceived in one display of an object but must be computed in
another. In the context of decision-making,
however, similarobservationsraise a significant
challenge to the rational-agentmodel.
The assumption that preferences are not affected by inconsequential variations in the
descriptionof outcomes has been called extensionality (Kenneth J. Arrow, 1982) and invariance (Tversky and Kahneman, 1986), and is
considered an essential aspect of rationality.
Invarianceis violated in framing effects, where
extensionally equivalent descriptions lead to
differentchoices by alteringthe relative salience
of differentaspects of the problem.Tverskyand
Kahneman(1981) introducedtheir discussionof
framingeffects with the following problem:

The Asian disease
Imagine that the United States is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual
Asian disease, which is expected to kill
600 people. Two alternativeprograms to
combat the disease have been proposed.
Assume that the exact scientific estimates
of the consequences of the programs are
as follows:
If Program A is adopted, 200 people
will be saved
If Program B is adopted, there is a
one-thirdprobabilitythat 600 people will
be saved and a two-thirdsprobabilitythat
no people will be saved

If ProgramA' is adopted,400 people will
die
If Program B' is adopted, there is a onethirdprobabilitythat nobody will die and
a two-thirdsprobability that 600 people
will die

A substantial majority of respondents now
favor ProgramB', the risk-seeking option. Although there is no substantive difference between the versions, they evoke different
associations and evaluations. This is easiest to
see in the certainoption, because outcomes that
are certain are overweighted relative to outcomes of high or intermediateprobability(Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Thus, the certainty
of saving people is disproportionatelyattractive,
while accepting the certain death of people is
disproportionatelyaversive. These immediate
affective responses respectively favor A over B
and B' over A'. As in Figures 2a and 2b, the
different representationsof the outcomes highlight some features of the situation and mask
others.
In an essay about the ethics of policy,
Thomas C. Schelling (1984) presented a compellingly realistic example of the dilemmas
raised by framing. Schelling reportsasking his
students to evaluate a tax policy that would
allow a larger child exemption to the rich than
to the poor. Not surprisingly,his studentsfound
this proposaloutrageous.Schelling then pointed
out thatthe defaultcase in the standardtax table
is a childless family, with special adjustments
for families with children, and led his class to
agree that the existing tax schedule could be
rewrittenwith a family with two childrenas the
default case. In this formulation,childless families would pay a surcharge. Should this surcharge be as large for the poor as for the rich?
Of course not. The two versions of the question
about how to treat the rich and the poor both
triggeran intuitivepreferencefor protectingthe

<-----Page 11----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:
MAPSOF BOUNDEDRATIONALITY

poor, but these preferences are incoherent.
Schelling's problem highlights an important
point. Framing effects are not a laboratorycuriosity, but a ubiquitous reality. The tax table
must be framed one way or another, and each
frame will increase the accessibility of some
responses and make other responses less likely.
There has been considerable interest among
behavioral economists in a particulartype of
framing effect, where a choice between two
options A and B is affected by designating
either A or B as a default option. The option
designated as the default has a large advantage
in such choices, even for decisions that have
considerablesignificance. Eric J. Johnson et al.
(1993) described a compelling example. The
states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey both
offer drivers a choice between an insurance
policy that allows an unconstrainedright to sue,
and a less expensive policy that restricts the
right to sue. The unconstrainedright to sue is
the default in Pennsylvania,the opposite is the
default in New Jersey, and the takeup of full
coverage is 79 percentand 30 percentin the two
states, respectively. Johnson and Daniel G.
Goldstein (2003) estimate that Pennsylvania
drivers spend 450 million dollars annually on
full coverage that they would not purchase if
their choice were framedas it is for New Jersey
drivers.
Johnsonand Goldstein (2003) also compared
the proportions of the population enrolled in
organ donation programs in seven European
countries in which enrollment was the default
and four in which nonenrollmentwas the default. Averaging over countries, enrollment in
donor programs was 97.4 percent when this
was the default option, 18 percent otherwise.
The passive acceptance of the formulation
given has significant consequences in this
case, as it does in other recent studies where
the selection of the default on the form that
workers completed to set their 401(k) contributions dominated their ultimate choice
(Brigitte Madrian and Dennis Shea, 2001;
James J. Choi et al., 2002).
The basic principle of framingis the passive
acceptanceof the formulationgiven. Because of
this passivity, people fail to constructa canonical representationfor all extensionally equivalent descriptions of a state of affairs. They do
not spontaneously compute the height of a
tower that could be built from an array of

1459

blocks, and they do not spontaneously transform the representationof puzzles or decision
problems. Obviously, no one is able to recognize "137 x 24" and "3,288" as "the same"
number without going through some elaborate
computations.Invariancecannotbe achieved by
a finite mind.
The impossibility of invarianceraises significant doubts about the descriptive realism of
rational-choice models (Tversky and Kahneman, 1986). Absent a system that reliably generates appropriate canonical representations,
intuitive decisions will be shapedby the factors
that determinethe accessibility of differentfeatures of the situation.Highly accessible features
will influence decisions, while features of low
accessibility will be largely ignored-and the
correlationbetween accessibility and reflective
judgments of relevance in a state of complete
informationis not necessarily high.
A particularlyunrealistic assumption of the
rational-agentmodel is that agents make their
choices in a comprehensivelyinclusive context,
which incorporatesall the relevantdetails of the
present situation,as well as expectations about
all future opportunities and risks. Much evidence supportsthe contrastingclaim that people's views of decisions and outcomes are
normally characterized by "narrow framing"
(Kahnemanand Daniel Lovallo, 1993), and by
the related notions of "mental accounting"
(Thaler, 1985, 1999) and "decision bracketing"
(Daniel Read et al., 1999).
The following are some examples of the
prevalence of narrowframing. The decision of
whether or not to accept a gamble is normally
consideredas a responseto a single opportunity,
not as an occasion to apply a general policy
(Gideon Kerenand Willem A. Wagenaar,1987;
Tverskyand Donald A. Redelmeier, 1992; Kahneman and Lovallo, 1993; Shlomo Benartziand
Thaler, 1999). Investors'decisions aboutparticular investments appear to be considered in
isolation from the remainderof the investor's
portfolio (Nicholas Barberis et al., 2003). The
time horizon that investors adopt for evaluating
their investments appears to be unreasonably
short-an observation that helps explain the
equity-premiumpuzzle (Benartzi and Thaler,
1995). Finally, the prevalence of the gain/loss
framing of outcomes over the wealth frame,
which was discussed in the previous section, can now be seen as an instance of narrow

<-----Page 12----->1460

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

framing.A sharedfeatureof all these examples
is that decisions made in narrowframes depart
far more from risk neutralitythan decisions that
are made in a more inclusive context.
The prevalenceof narrowframes is an effect
of accessibility, which can be understood by
referring to the displays of blocks in Figure
2. The same set of blocks is framed as a tower
in Figure 2a, and as a flat arrayin Figure 2b. Although it is possible to "see" a tower in Figure
2b, it is much easier to do so in Figure 2a. Narrow frames generally reflect the structureof the
environmentin which decisions are made. The
choices that people face arise one at a time, and
the principleof passive acceptancesuggests that
they will be consideredas they arise. The problem at hand and the immediateconsequences of
the choice will be far more accessible than all
other considerations, and as a result decision
problemswill be framedfar more narrowlythan
the rationalmodel assumes.

V. AttributeSubstitution:A Modelof Judgment
Heuristics
The firstresearchprogramthatTversky and I
undertooktogetherconsisted of a series of studies of varioustypes of judgmentaboutuncertain
events, including numericalpredictionsand assessments of the probabilities of hypotheses.
Ourconclusion in a review of this work was that
"people rely on a limited number of heuristic
principles which reduce the complex tasks of
assessing probabilitiesand predictingvalues to
simplerjudgmentaloperations.In general,these
heuristics are quite useful, but sometimes they
lead to severe and systematic errors"(Tversky
and Kahneman, 1974, p. 1124). The article introduced three heuristics-representativeness,
availability, and anchoring-that were used to
explain a dozen systematic biases in judgment
underuncertainty,including nonregressiveprediction, neglect of base-rate information,overconfidence, and overestimatesof the frequency
of events that are easy to recall. Some of the
biases were identified by systematic errors in
estimates of known quantities and statistical
facts. Other biases were defined by discrepancies between the regularities of intuitive
judgments and the principles of probability
theory, Bayesian inference, and regression
analysis.

Kahnemanand Frederick(2002) recently revisited the early studies of judgment heuristics,
and proposeda formulationin which the reduction of complex tasks to simpler operations is
achieved by an operation of attributesubstitution. "Judgmentis said to be mediated by a
heuristic when the individual assesses a specified target attribute of a judgment object by
substitutinganotherpropertyof thatobject-the
heuristic attribute-which comes more readily
to mind" (p. 53). Unlike the early work, Kahneman and Frederick'sconception of heuristics
is not restricted to the domain of judgment
under uncertainty.
For a perceptualexample of attributesubstitution, consider the question: "What are the
sizes of the two horses in Figure 7, as they are
drawn on the page?" The images are in fact
identical in size, but the figure producesa compelling illusion. The targetattributethatobservers intend to evaluate is objective twodimensional size, but they are unable to do this
veridically.Theirjudgmentsmap an impression
of three-dimensional size (the heuristic attribute)onto units of length that are appropriate
to the target attribute, and scaled to the size
of the page. This illusion is caused by the
differentialaccessibilityof competinginterpretations of the image. An impression of three-

<-----Page 13----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

dimensional size is the only impression of size
that comes to mind for naive observers-painters and experienced photographersare able to
do better-and it produces an illusion in the
perceptionof picture size.
A study by Fritz Strack et al. (1988) illustrates the role of attributesubstitutionin a different context. College students respondedto a
survey which included the two following questions in immediate succession: "How happy are
you with your life in general?"and "How many
dates did you have last month?"The correlation
between the two questions was 0.12 when they
appeared in the order shown. Among respondents who received the same questions in reverse order, the correlation was 0.66. The
psychological interpretationof the high correlation' is inferential,but straightforward.The dating question undoubtedly evoked in many
respondentsan emotionally charged evaluation
of their romantic life. This evaluation was
highly accessible when the question about
happiness was encountered next, and it was
mapped onto the scale of general happiness.
In the interpretationoffered here, the respondents answered the happiness question by reporting what came to their mind, and failed to
notice that they were answering a question
that had not been asked-a cognitive illusion
that is analogous to the visual illusion of
Figure 7.
The most direct evidence for attributesubstitution was reportedby Kahnemanand Tversky
(1973), in a task of categoricalprediction.There
were three experimentalgroups in their experiment. Participantsin a base-rate group evaluated the relative frequencies of graduate
students in nine categories of specialization.2
Mean estimates rangedfrom 20 percentfor Humanities and Educationto 3 percentfor Library
Science.
Two other groups of participantswere shown
the same list of areas of graduatespecialization,
and the following description of a fictitious
graduatestudent.

Tom W. is of high intelligence, although
lacking in true creativity. He has a need
for order and clarity, and for neat and
tidy systems in which every detail finds
its appropriate place. His writing is
rather dull and mechanical, occasionally enlivened by somewhat corny puns
and by flashes of imagination of the
sci-fi type. He has a strong drive for
competence. He seems to have little feel
and little sympathyfor other people and
does not enjoy interacting with others.
Self-centered, he nonetheless has a deep
moral sense.

I
Participantsin a similarity group ranked the
nine fields by the degree to which Tom W.
"resemblesa typical graduatestudent"(in that
field). The descriptionof Tom W. was deliberately constructedto make him more representative of the less populated fields, and this
manipulationwas successful: the correlationbetween the averages of representativenessrankings and of estimated base rates was -0.62.
Participantsin theprobability group rankedthe
nine fields accordingto the likelihood that Tom
W. would have specialized in each. The respondents in the lattergroup were graduatestudents
in psychology at major universities. They were
told that the personalitysketch had been written
by a psychologist when Tom W. was in high
school, on the basis of personalitytests of dubious validity. This informationwas intendedto
discredit the description as a source of valid
information.
The statisticallogic is straightforward.A description based on unreliableinformationmust
be given little weight, and predictionsmade in
the absence of valid evidence must revert to
base rates. This reasoning implies that judgments of probabilityshould be highly correlated
with the correspondingbase rates in the Tom
W. problem.
The psychology of the task is also straightforward. The similarity of Tom W. to various
stereotypesis a highly accessible naturalassessment, whereasjudgments of probabilityare difficult. The respondentsare thereforeexpected to
substitutea judgment of similarity (representativeness) for the requiredjudgment of probability. The two instructions-to rate similarity or

probability-should therefore elicit similar
judgments.
The scatterplotof the meanjudgments of the
two groups is presented in Figure 8a. As the
figure shows, the correlation between judgments of probability and similarity is nearly
perfect (0.98). The correlation between judgments of probability and base rates is -0.63.
The results are in perfect accord with the hypothesis of attributesubstitution.They also confirm a bias of base-rate neglect in this
predictiontask. The results are especially compelling because the responses were rankings.
The large variabilityof the average rankingsof
both attributesindicates highly consensual responses, and nearly total overlap in the systematic variance.
Figure 8b shows the results of anotherstudy
in the same design, in which respondentswere
shown the description of a woman named
Linda, and a list of eight possible outcomes
describing her present employment and activities. The two critical items in the list were #6
("Linda is a bank teller") and the conjunction
item #8 ("Linda is a bank teller and active in
the feminist movement"). The other six possibilities were unrelated and miscellaneous
(e.g., elementary school teacher, psychiatric
social worker). As in the Tom W. problem,
some respondents ranked the eight outcomes

by the similarity of Linda to the category
prototypes; others ranked the same outcomes
by probability.

Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken
and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student she was deeply concerned with issues of discriminationand
social justice and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.

As might be expected, 85 percent of respondents in the similarity group ranked the conjunction item (#8) higher than its constituent,
indicating that Linda resembles the image of a
feminist bank teller more than she resembles a
stereotypical bank teller. This ordering of the
two items is quite reasonablefor judgments of
similarity. However, it is much more problematic that 89 percent of respondentsin the probability groupalso rankedthe conjunctionhigher
than its constituent.This patternof probability
judgments violates monotonicity, and has been
called the "conjunctionfallacy" (Tversky and
Kahneman,1983).
The observationthat biases of judgment are
systematic was quickly recognized as relevant
to the debateaboutthe assumptionof rationality

<-----Page 15----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

in economics (see, e.g., Peter A. Diamond,
1977; David M. Grether, 1978; Howard Kunreuther, 1979; Arrow, 1982). There has also
been some discussion of the role of specific
judgmentbiases in economic phenomena,especially in finance (e.g., WernerF. M. De Bondt
and Thaler, 1985; Robert J. Shiller, 2000; Andrei Shleifer, 2000; MatthewRabin, 2002). Recent extensions of the notion of heuristicsto the
domain of affect may be of particularrelevance
to the conversation between psychology and
economics, because they bear on the core concept of a preference. As was noted earlier, affective valence is a naturalassessment,which is
automaticallycomputed and always accessible.
This basic evaluative attribute(good/bad, like/
dislike, approach/avoid)is thereforea candidate
for substitutionin any task that calls for a favorable or unfavorableresponse. Slovic and his
colleagues (see, e.g., Slovic et al., 2002) introduced the concept of an affect heuristic. They
showed that affect (liking or disliking) is the
heuristic attribute for numerous target attributes, including the evaluation of the costs
and benefits of various technologies, the safe
concentrationof chemicals, and even the predicted economic performanceof various industries. In an article aptly titled "Risk as
Feelings," Loewenstein et al. (2001) documentedthe relatedpropositionthatbeliefs about
risk are often expressions of emotion.
If different target attributesare strongly influenced by the same affective reaction, the
dimensionality of decisions and judgments
about valued objects may be expected to be
unreasonablylow. Indeed, Melissa L. Finucane
et al. (2000) found that people's judgments of
the costs and benefits of various technologies
are negatively correlated, especially when the
judgments are made under time pressure. A
technology that is liked is judged to have low
costs and large benefits. These judgments are
surely biased, because the correlationbetween
costs and benefits is generally positive in the
world of real choices. In the same vein, Kahneman et al. (1997) presented evidence that different responses to public goods (e.g.,
willingness to pay, ratingsof moral satisfaction
for contributing) yielded essentially interchangeable rankings of a set of policy issues.
Here again, a basic affective response appeared
to be the common factor.
Kahnemanet al. (1997) suggested that peo-

1463

ple's decisions often express affective evaluations (attitudes), which do not conform to the
logic of economic preferences. To understand
preferences, then, we may need to understand
the psychology of emotions. And we cannot
take it for grantedthat preferencesthat are controlled by the emotion of the moment will be
internally coherent, or even reasonable by the
cooler criteria of reflective reasoning. In other
words, the preferences of System 1 are not
necessarily consistent with the preferences of
System 2. The next section will show that some
choices are not appropriatelysensitive to variations of quantityand cost-and are better described as expressions of an affective response
than as economic preferences.
VI. PrototypeHeuristics
The results summarizedin Figure 8 showed
that the judgmentsthat subjectsmade about the
Tom W. and Linda problems substituted the
more accessible attributeof similarity (representativeness)for the requiredtargetattributeof
probability.The goal of the presentsection is to
embed the representativeness heuristic in a
broader class of prototype heuristics, which
share a common psychological mechanismthe representationof categories by their prototypes-and a remarkablyconsistent patternof
biases.
In the display of lines in Figure 3, the average
(typical) length of the lines was highly accessible, but the sum of their lengths was not. Both
observationsare quite general. Classic psychological experiments have established the following proposition: whenever we look at or
think about a set (ensemble, category) which is
sufficiently homogeneous to have a prototype,
information about the prototype is automatically accessible (Michael I. Posner and Stephen
W. Keele, 1968; EleanorRosch and CarolynB.
Mervis, 1975). The prototype of a set is characterized by the average values of the salient
propertiesof its members. The high accessibility of prototypeinformationserves an important
adaptive function. It allows new stimuli to be
categorized efficiently, by comparingtheir features to those of category prototypes.3 For

3 Stored information about individual exemplars also
contributesto categorization.

<-----Page 16----->1464

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

example, the stored prototype of a set of lines
allows a quick decision abouta new line-does
it belong with the set? There is no equally
obvious function for the automaticcomputation
of sums.
The low accessibility of sums and the high
accessibility of prototypeshave significantconsequences in tasks that involve judgments of
sets, as in the following examples:
(i) category prediction (e.g., the probability
that the category of bank tellers contains
Linda as a member);
(ii) pricing a quantity of public or private
goods (e.g., the personal dollar value of
saving a certain numberof migratorybirds
from drowning in oil ponds);
(iii) global evaluationof a past experience that
extended over time (e.g., the overall aversiveness of a painful medical procedure);
(iv) assessment of the supportthat a sample of
observations provides for a hypothesis
(e.g., the probability that a sample of colored balls has been drawnfrom one specified urn rather than another).
The objects of judgment in these tasks are
sets or categories, and the target attributeshave
a common logical structure. Extensional attributes are governed by a general principle of
conditionaladding, which dictates that each element within the set adds to the overall value an
amount that depends on the elements already
included. In simple cases, the value is additive:
the total length of the set of lines in Figure 3 is
just the sum of their separatelengths. In other
cases, each positive element of the set increases
the aggregatevalue, but the combinationrule is
nonadditive (typically subadditive).4 The attributesof the category prototypeare not extensional-they are averages, whereas extensional
attributesare akin to sums.
The precedingargumentleads to the hypothesis that tasks that require the assessment of
4 If the
judgmentis monotonicallyrelatedto an additive
scale (such as the underlyingcount of the numberof birds),
the formal structureis known in the measurementliterature
as an "extensive structure"(R. Duncan Luce et al., 1990,
Ch. 3). There also may be attributesthat lack an underlying
additive scale, in which case the structureis known in the
literatureas a "positive concatenation structure"(Luce et
al., 1990, Ch. 19, volume 3, p. 38).

DECEMBER2003

extensional variableswill be relatively difficult,
and that intuitive responses may be generated
by substitutingan attributeof the prototypefor
the extensional target attribute.Prototype heuristics involve a target attributethat is extensional, and a heuristic attribute which is a
characteristicof the category prototype.Prototype heuristics are associated with two major
biases, which generalize the biases of representativeness that were introducedin the preceding
section:
(i) Violations of monotonicity. Adding elements to a set may lower the average and
cause the judgmentof the targetvariableto
decrease, contrary to the logic of extensional variables. The prevalent judgment
that Linda is less likely to be a bank teller
than to be a feminist bank teller illustrates
this bias.
(ii) Extension neglect. Other things equal, an
increase in the extension of a category will
increase the value of its extensional attributes,but leave unchangedthe values of
its prototype attributes.The apparentneglect of the base rates of areas of specialization in judgments about Tom W. is an
example.
Studies that have examined the two biases in
different contexts are described next.
A. Pricing Goods
The price of a set of goods is an extensional
variable. If price is evaluatedby the attractiveness of a prototypicalelement of the set, violations of monotonicityand extension neglect are
predicted.
Scope Neglect.-Complete or almost complete neglect of extension has often been observed in studies of the willingness to pay for
public goods, where the effect is called "neglect
of scope." The best known example is a study
by William H. Desvousges et al. (1993) in
which respondentsindicatedtheirwillingness to
contribute money to prevent the drowning of
migratorybirds.The numberof birdsthatwould
be saved was varied for different subsamples.
The estimated amounts that households were
willing to pay were $80, $78, and $88, to save
2,000, 20,000, or 200,000 birds, respectively.

<-----Page 17----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

The targetattributein this case is willingness to
pay (WTP), and the heuristic attributeappears
to be the emotion associated with the image of
a bird drowning in oil, or perhaps with the
image of a bird being saved from drowning
(Kahnemanet al., 1999).
Frederick and Baruch Fischhoff (1998) reviewed numerousdemonstrationsof such scope
neglect in studies of willingness to pay for public goods. For example, Kahnemanand Knetsch
found that survey respondentsin Toronto were
willing to pay almost as much to clean up the
lakes in a small region of Ontarioor to clean up
all the lakes in that province (reportedby Kahneman, 1986). The issue of scope neglect is
central to the applicationof the contingent valuation method (CVM) in the assessment of the
economic value of public goods, and it has been
hotly debated (see, e.g., Richard T. Carson,
1997). The proponentsof CVM have reported
experimentsin which there was some sensitivity to scope, but even these effects are minute,
far too small to satisfy the economic logic of
pricing (Diamond, 1996; Kahneman et al.,
1999).
Violations of Monotonicity.-List (2002) reported an experiment that confirmed, in a real
market setting, violations of dominance that
Hsee (1998) had previously reportedin a hypothetical pricing task. In List's experiment,traders of sportscardsassigned significantly higher
value to a set of ten sportscardslabeled "Mint/
near mint condition"than to a set that included
the same ten cards and three additional cards
described as "poor condition." In a series of
follow-up experiments,JonathanE. Alevy et al.
(2003) also confirmed an importantdifference
(originally suggested by Hsee) between the
prices that people will pay when they see only
one of the goods (separateevaluation),or when
they price both goods at the same time (joint
evaluation). The goods were similar to those
used in List's experiment.The predictedviolation of dominance was observed in separate
evaluation, especially for relatively inexperienced market participants. These individuals
bid an average of $4.05 for the small set of
cards, and only $1.82 for the larger set. The
violations of dominance were completely
eliminated in the joint evaluation condition,
where the bids for the small and large sets
averaged $2.89 and $3.32, respectively.

1465

Alevy et al. (2003) noted that System 1 appears to dominate responses in separate evaluation, whereas System 2 conforms to the
dominance rule when given a chance to do so.
There was a definite effect of market experience, both in this study and in List (2002): the
bids of highly experienced traders also
showed violations of monotonicity in separate
evaluation, but the effect was much smaller.
B. Evaluations of ExtendedEpisodes
The global utility of an experience that extends over time is an extensionalattribute(Kahneman, 1994, 2000a, b; Kahnemanet al., 1997),
and the durationof the experience is a measure
of its extension. The correspondingprototype
attribute is the experienced utility associated
with a representativemomentof the episode. As
predictedby attributesubstitution,global evaluations of the episode exhibit both duration
neglect and violations of monotonicity.
Duration Neglect.-In a study described by
Redelmeierand Kahneman(1996), patientsundergoing colonoscopy reportedthe intensity of
pain every 60 seconds duringthe procedure(see
Figure 9), and subsequentlyprovided a global
evaluation of the pain they had suffered. The
correlationof global evaluations with the duration of the procedure(which ranged from 4 to
66 minutesin that study) was 0.03. On the other
hand global evaluations were correlated (r =
0.67) with an average of the pain reported at
two points of time: when pain was at its peak,
andjust before the procedureended. For example, patient A in Figure 9 reporteda more negative evaluationof the procedurethanpatientB.
The same patternof durationneglect and Peak/
End evaluations has been observed in other
studies (BarbaraL. Fredricksonand Kahneman,
1993; see Kahneman,2000a, for a discussion).
These results are consistent with the hypothesis
that the extendedepisode (which can be considered an orderedset of moments) is represented
in memory by a typical moment of the
experience.
Violations of Dominance.-A randomized
clinical experiment was conducted following
the colonoscopy study describedabove. For half
the patients, the instrument was not immediately removed when the clinical examination

ended. Instead,the physician waited for about a
minute, leaving the instrumentstationary.The
experience duringthe extra period was uncomfortable, but the procedureguaranteedthat the
colonoscopy never ended in severe pain. Patients reported significantly more favorable
global evaluations in this experimentalcondition thanin the controlcondition (Redelmeieret
al., 2003).
Violations of dominance have also been
confirmed in choices. Kahnemanet al. (1993)
exposed participants to two cold-pressor experiences, one with each hand: a "short" episode (immersion of one hand in 14?C water
for 60 seconds), and a "long" episode (the
short episode, plus an additional 30 seconds
during which the water was gradually warmed
to 15?C). When they were later asked which
of the two experiences they preferred to repeat, a substantial majority chose the long
trial. This patternof choices is predicted from
the Peak/End rule of evaluation that was described earlier. Similar violations of dominance were observed with unpleasant sounds
of variable loudness and duration (Charles A.
Schreiber and Kahneman, 2000). These violations of dominance suggest that choices between familiar experiences are made in an
intuitive process of "choosing by liking." Extended episodes are representedin memory by
a typical moment-and the desirability or
aversiveness of the episode is dominated by
the remembered utility of that moment (Kah-

neman, 1994). When a choice is to be made,
the option that is associated with the higher
remembered utility (more liked) is chosen.
This mode of choice is likely to yield choices
that do not maximize the utility that will
actually be experienced (Kahneman et al.,
1997).
C. Other Prototype Heuristics
The pattern of results observed in diverse
studies of prototypeheuristicssuggests the need
for a unified interpretation,and raises a significant challenge to treatmentsthat deal only with
one domain. A numberof authorshave offered
competing interpretationsof base-rate neglect
(Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, 1996;
Jonathan Jay Koehler, 1996), insensitivity to
scope in WTP (Raymond Kopp, 1992), and
duration neglect (Ariely and Loewenstein,
2000). In generalhowever, these interpretations
are specific to a particulartask, and would not
carry over to demonstrations of extension neglect in the other tasks that have been discussed. In contrast, the account offered here
(and developed in greater detail by Kahneman
and Frederick, 2002) is equally applicable to
diverse tasks that require an assessment of an
extensional target attribute.
The cases that have been discussed are only
illustrations,not a comprehensivelist of prototype heuristics. For example, the same form of
nonextensional thinking explains why the me-

<-----Page 19----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

dian estimate of the annual numberof murders
in Detroit is twice as high as the estimate of the
number of murders in Michigan (Kahneman
and Frederick, 2002). It also explains why
professional forecasters assigned a higher
probability to "an earthquake in California
causing a flood in which more than 1,000
people will drown" than to "a flood somewhere in the United States in which more than
1,000 people will drown" (Tversky and Kahneman, 1983).
As these examples illustrate,thereis no guaranteed defense againstviolations of monotonicity. How could a forecaster who assigns a
probability to a lethal flood ensure (in finite
time) that there is no subset of that event which
would have appeared even more probable?
More generally, the results reviewed in this
section suggest a profound incompatibilitybetween the capabilities and operationalrules of
intuitive judgment and choice and the normative standardsfor beliefs and preferences. The
logic of belief and choice requires accurate
evaluation of extensional variables.In contrast,
intuitive thinking operates with exemplars or
prototypesthat have the dimensionalityof individual instances and lack the dimension of
extension.
VII. The Boundariesof IntuitiveThinking
The judgments that people express, the actions they take, and the mistakes they commit
depend on the monitoring and corrective functions of System 2, as well as on the impressions
and tendencies generated by System 1. This
section reviews a selection of findingsand ideas
about the functioning of System 2. A more
detailed treatment is given in Kahneman and
Frederick(2002) and Kahneman(2003b).
Judgments and choices are normally intuitive, skilled, unproblematic, and reasonably
successful (Klein, 1998). The prevalence of
framing effects, and other indications of superficial processing such as the bat-and-ballproblem, suggest that people mostly do not think
very hard and that System 2 monitors judgments quite lightly. On some occasions, however, the monitoring of System 2 will detect a
potential error, and an effort will be made to
correct it. The question for this section can be
formulated in terms of accessibility: when do
doubts about one's intuitivejudgments come to

1467

mind? The answer, as usual in psychology, is a
list of relevant factors.
Research has established that the ability to
avoid errors of intuitive judgment is impaired
by time pressure (Finucane et al., 2000), by
concurrentinvolvement in a different cognitive
task (Gilbert, 1989, 1991, 2002), by performing
the task in the evening for "morningpeople"
and in the morningfor "eveningpeople" (Galen
V. Bodenhausen, 1990), and, surprisingly, by
being in a good mood (Alice M. Isen et al.,
1988; HerbertBless et al., 1996). Conversely,
the facility of System 2 is positively correlated
with intelligence (Stanovich and West, 2002),
with the trait that psychologists have labeled
"need for cognition"(which is roughly whether
people find thinking fun) (Eldar Shafir and
Robyn A. LeBoeuf, 2002), and with exposureto
statistical thinking (Richard E. Nisbett et al.,
1983; Franca Agnoli and David H. Krantz,
1989; Agnoli, 1991).
The question of the precise conditions under
which errors of intuition are most likely to be
preventedis of methodological interest to psychologists, because some controversies in the
literature on cognitive illusions are resolved
when this factor is considered (see Kahneman
and Frederick,2002; Kahneman,2003b). One
of these methodological issues is also of considerablesubstantiveinterest:this is the distinction between separate evaluation and joint
evaluation (Hsee, 1996).
In the separateevaluationcondition of List's
study of dominance violations, for example,
different groups of tradersbid on two sets of
baseball cards; in joint evaluation each trader
evaluatedboth sets at the same time. The results
were drasticallydifferent. Violations of monotonicity, which were very pronounced in the
between-groupscomparison,were eliminatedin
the joint evaluation condition. The participants
in the latterconditionevidentlyrealizedthatone
of the sets of goods included the other, and was
therefore worth more. Once they had detected
the dominance relation, the participants constrained their bids to follow the rule. These
decisions are mediatedby System 2. Thus, there
appear to be two distinct modes of choice:
"choosing by liking" selects the most attractive
option; "choosing by rule" conforms to an explicit constraint.
Prospect theory introducedthe same distinction between modes of choice (Kahnemanand

<-----Page 20----->1468

THEAMERICANECONOMICREVIEW

Tversky, 1979). The normal process corresponds to choice by liking: the decision maker
evaluates each gamble in the choice set, then
selects the gamble of highest value. In prospect
theory, this mode of choice can lead to the
selection of a dominatedoption.5However, the
theory also introducedthe possibility of choice
by rule: if one option transparentlydominates
the other, the decision maker will select the
dominantoption without furtherevaluation.To
test this model, Tversky and Kahneman(1986)
constructeda pairof gambles that satisfiedthree
criteria:(i) gamble A dominatedgamble B; (ii)
the prospect-theoryvalue of B was higher than
the value of A; (iii) the gambles were complex,
and the dominancerelationonly became apparent after groupingoutcomes. As expected from
other framing results, most participantsin the
experimentevaluatedthe gambles as originally
formulated,failed to detect the relationbetween
them, chose the option they liked most, and
exhibited the predictedviolation of dominance.
The cold-pressor experiment that was described earlier (Kahneman et al., 1993) is
closely analogousto the study of nontransparent
dominancethat Tversky and Kahneman(1986)
reported.A substantialmajorityof participants
violated dominance in a direct and seemingly
transparentchoice between cold-pressorexperiences. However, postexperimentaldebriefings
indicated that the dominance was not in fact
transparent.The participantsin the experiment
did not realize thatthe long episode includedthe
short one, although they did notice that the
episodes differed in duration. Because they
failed to detect that one option dominated the
other,the majorityof participantschose as people commonly do when they select an experience to be repeated: they "chose by liking,"
selected the option that had the higher remembered utility, and thereby agreed to expose
themselves to a period of unnecessary pain
(Kahneman,1994; Kahnemanet al., 1997).
The complex patternof results in the studies
of dominance in the joint-evaluation design
suggests three general conclusions: (i) choices
that are governed by rationalrules do exist, but
(ii) these choices are restrictedto unusual circumstances, and (iii) the activationof the rules
5
Cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and Kahneman,
1992) does not have this feature.

depends on the factors of attentionand accessibility. The fact that System 2 "knows"the dominance rule and "wants" to obey it only
guarantees that the rule will be followed if a
potential violation is explicitly detected.
System 2 has the capability of correcting
othererrors,besides violations of dominance.In
particular,the substitutionof one attributefor
another in judgment inevitably leads to errors
in the weights assigned to different sources
of information, and these could-at least in
principle-be detected and corrected. For example, a participantin the Tom W. study (see
Figure 8a) could have reasoned as follows:
"TomW. looks very much like a libraryscience
student,but thereare very few of those. I should
therefore adjust my impression of probability
downward." Although this level of reasoning
should not have been beyond the reach of the
graduate students who answered the Tom W.
question,the evidence shown in Figure 8 shows
that few, if any, of these respondentshad the
idea of adjustingtheir predictions to allow for
the different base rates of the alternativeoutcomes. The explanationof this resultin termsof
accessibility is straightforward:the experiment
provided no explicit cues to the relevance of
base rates.
Base-rateinformationwas not completely ignored in experiments that provided stronger
cues, though the effects of this variable were
consistently too small relative to the effect of
the case-specific information(JonathanSt. B. T.
Evans et al., 2002). The evidence of numerous
studies supports the following conclusions: (i)
the likelihood that the subject will detect a misweighting of some aspect of the information
dependson the salience of cues to the relevance
of that factor; (ii) if the misweighting is detected, there will be an effort to correct it; (iii)
the correctionis likely to be insufficient,and the
final judgments are therefore likely to remain
anchored on the initial intuitive impression
(GretchenB. Chapmanand Johnson, 2002).
Economists may be struck by the emphasis
on salient cues and by the absence of financial
incentives from the list of major factors that
influence the quality of decisions and judgments. However, the claim that high stakes
eliminate departuresfrom rationalityis not supported by a careful review of the experimental
evidence (Camerer and Robin M. Hogarth,
1999). A growing literatureof field researchand

<-----Page 21----->VOL.93 NO. 5

KAHNEMAN:MAPS OF BOUNDED RATIONALITY

field experimentsdocuments large and systematic mistakes in some of the most consequential
financial decisions that people make, including
choices of investments (Brad M. Barber and
Terrance Odean, 2000; Benartzi and Thaler,
2001), and actions in the real estate market
(David Genesove and Christopher J. Mayer,
2001). The daily paper provides further evidence of poor decisions with large outcomes.
The present analysis helps explain why the
effects of incentives are neitherlarge nor robust.
High stakes surely increase the amount of attention and effort that people invest in their
decisions. But attention and effort by themselves do not purchaserationalityor guarantee
good decisions. In particular,cognitive effort
expended in bolstering a decision alreadymade
will not improve its quality, and the evidence
suggests that the share of time and effort devoted to such bolsteringmay increase when the
stakes are high (JenniferS. Lemer and Philip E.
Tetlock, 1999). Effort and concentration are
likely to bring to mind a more complete set of
considerations,but the expansion may yield an
inferior decision unless the weighting of the
secondary considerationsis appropriatelylow.
In some instances-including tasks that require
predictions of one's future tastes-too much
cognitive effort actually lowers the quality of
performance (Wilson and Jonathan W.
Schooler, 1991). Klein (2003, Ch. 4) has argued
that there are other situations in which skilled
decision makers do better when they trust their
intuitions than when they engage in detailed
analysis.
VIII. ConcludingRemarks
The rationalagent of economic theory would
be described, in the language of the present
treatment,as endowed with a single cognitive
system that has the logical ability of a flawless
System 2 and the low computing costs of System 1. Theories in behavioral economics have
generally retained the basic architectureof the
rational model, adding assumptionsabout cognitive limitations designed to account for specific anomalies. For example, the agent may be
rational except for discounting hyperbolically,
evaluating outcomes as changes, or a tendency
to jump to conclusions.
The model of the agent that has been presented here has a different architecture,which

1469

may be more difficult to translateinto the theoretical language of economics. The core ideas
of the present treatment are the two-system
structure,the large role of System 1 and the
extreme context-dependencethat is implied by
the concept of accessibility. The centralcharacteristic of agents is not that they reason poorly
but that they often act intuitively. And the behavior of these agents is not guided by what
they are able to compute, but by what they
happen to see at a given moment.
These propositions suggest heuristic questions that may guide attemptsto predict or explain behaviorin a given setting: "Whatwould
an impulsive agent be tempted to do?" "What
course of action seems most natural in this
situation?"The answers to these questions will
often identify the judgment or course of action
to which most people will be attracted. For
example, it is more naturalto join a group of
strangersrunningin a particulardirection than
to adopt a contrariandestination.However, the
two-system view also suggests that other questions should be raised:"Is the intuitively attractive judgment or course of action in conflict
with a rule thatthe agent would endorse?"If the
answer to that question is positive, then "How
likely is it in the situation at hand that the
relevantrule will come to mind in time to override intuition?"Of course, this mode of analysis
also allows for differencesbetween individuals,
and between groups. What is naturaland intuitive in a given situation is not the same for
everyone: different cultural experiences favor
different intuitions about the meaning of situations, and new behaviors become intuitive as
skills are acquired.Even when these complexities are taken into account, the approachto the
understandingand prediction of behavior that
has been sketched here is simple and easy to
apply, and likely to yield hypotheses that are
generally plausible and often surprising. The
origins of this approach are in an important
intellectual traditionin psychology, which has
emphasized "the power of the situation" (Lee
Ross and Nisbett, 1991).
The present treatmenthas developed several
themes: that intuitionand reasoningare alternative ways to solve problems, that intuition resembles perception, that people sometimes
answer a difficult question by answering an
easier one instead, that the processing of information is often superficial, that categories are

<-----Page 22----->1470

representedby prototypes.All these featuresof
the cognitive system were in our minds in some
form when Amos Tversky and I began ourjoint
work in 1969, and most of them were in Herbert
Simon's mind much earlier. However, the role
of emotion in judgment and decision making
received less attentionin that work than it had
received before the beginning of the cognitive
revolution in psychology in the 1950's. More
recentdevelopmentshave restoreda centralrole
to emotion, which is incorporatedin the view of
intuition that was presented here. Findings
about the role of optimism in risk taking, the
effects of emotion on decision weights, the role
of fear in predictions of harm, and the role of
liking and disliking in factual predictions-all
indicate that the traditionalseparationbetween
belief and preference in analyses of decision
making is psychologically unrealistic.
Incorporatinga common sense psychology of
the intuitive agent into economic models will
present difficult challenges, especially for formal theorists. It is encouraging to note, however, thatthe challenge of incorporatingthe first
wave of psychological findings into economics
appearedeven more daunting20 years ago, and
that challenge has been met with considerable
success.
