A dynamic view of the resource based theory (RBT) examines how a ﬁrm builds its resources
over time, considering variations in resources' growth rates while the ﬁrm attempts to grow.
Accordingly, we consider the elasticity of accumulated resources to assess conditions where
these resources might serve as substitutes for rather than complements to COGS during periods
of growth. We specify a production function that links aggregate resource allocation among
SG&A, R&D and COGS expenses to a ﬁrm's revenue. This function yields a set of hypotheses on
the elasticity of SG&A and R&D, and the productivity of COGS, while controlling for the revenue
growth rate. We test these hypotheses on a dataset of 64 randomly selected ﬁrms that recently
underwent an IPO, and a comparable set of 64 established public ﬁrms from four hightechnology sectors. Results show that the accumulated stocks of resources can serve as
substitutes for rather than complements to COGS, and the manner in which recent-IPO ﬁrms
allocate and use resources differs from their established counterparts. We discuss the
implications of associated elasticity and productivity results.

1. Executive summary
Can funds generated by ﬁrms that have recently undergone an initial public offering (IPO) be used for goals other than
enhancing short-term ﬁnancial performance, which is customary, and instead be used for growth purposes? If so, and if ﬁrms
make signiﬁcant marketing, administration and research and development (R&D) pronouncements prior to an IPO, as the press
has suggested, could both spending for general and administrative (SG&A) (a proxy for marketing and administration expenses)
and R&D be signiﬁcant drivers of revenue generation? This article explores this puzzle by investigating whether recent-IPO ﬁrms
can foster growth by adjusting their investment rates in these key production factors by comparing them with established ﬁrms.
Recent extensions of the resource based theory (RBT) have called for an examination of the manner in which resources are
allocated in a dynamic setting. We consider heterogeneous resources within a model of ﬁrm growth by creating a production
function that links SG&A and R&D expenses, and how they interact with production costs (i.e., costs of goods sold or COGS), to
generate ﬁrm revenue. This production function incorporates adjustments over time based on growth rates in SG&A and R&D
spending, which are inﬂuenced by the portion of revenues a ﬁrm allocates to each activity. This function yields an econometric
relation between COGS productivity, or more speciﬁcally, the ﬁrm's revenue per unit of COGS and its investments in SG&A and
R&D.
The derived relationships between COGS productivity and SG&A and R&D investments prompt us to propose a set of
hypotheses. First, we posit that a ﬁrm's investment in SG&A and R&D stocks interact ― as a complement or a substitute ― with
COGS to generate revenue. Second, we hypothesize that growth-rate adjustments in these stocks are positively associated with

COGS productivity. Our third and fourth hypotheses assert that signiﬁcant differences exist between recent-IPO ﬁrms and
established ﬁrms in COGS productivity and the elasticity of SG&A and R&D investments (with respect to COGS) in generating
revenue. We construct a panel dataset of 64 randomly selected recent-IPO ﬁrms from four high-tech industries and 64 comparable
established ﬁrms (with the same SIC code and data year) to test our hypotheses.
Our analysis of the combined sample of recent-IPO and established ﬁrms shows that SG&A investments act as a substitute for
COGS, and R&D investment as a complement to COGS, in generating revenue. In other words, for a given level of revenue,
increasing SG&A spending reduces COGS, but increasing R&D spending augments COGS. When we examine the recent-IPO and
established ﬁrms separately, we ﬁnd that SG&A spending continues to act as a substitute for COGS for both the established and
recent-IPO ﬁrms. However, R&D spending complements COGS in generating revenue for recent-IPO ﬁrms.
We also ﬁnd that a ﬁrm's growth-rate adjustments in SG&A and R&D impact only the combined and recent-IPO samples; an
analysis of our sample of established ﬁrms shows that these ﬁrms do not closely coordinate their SG&A or R&D decisions with their
COGS decisions. For the growth-rate adjustment in SG&A, we observe a negative relationship between SG&A adjustments and
COGS productivity. For the growth-rate adjustment in R&D, however, we observe the hypothesized positive relationship for the
combined and recent-IPO samples. That is, increasing a ﬁrm's growth-rate adjustment while making R&D investments is expected
to improve that ﬁrm's COGS productivity. We further ﬁnd that the productivity of established ﬁrms in converting COGS into
revenue exceeds that of the recent-IPO ﬁrms, contrary to our hypothesis. Nevertheless, when we compare recent-IPO ﬁrms with
their established counterparts, we ﬁnd, as hypothesized, that both SG&A and R&D investments by recent-IPO ﬁrms exhibit greater
elasticity in generating revenue with respect to COGS productivity.
From a theory perspective, we contribute to the dynamic view of the RBT by proposing and testing an aggregate revenuegeneration function that links two accumulated and co-specialized factors of production, SG&A and R&D, with COGS, while
controlling for revenue growth rates. The resulting econometric model allows us to examine resource-bundling effects, either as
complements to or substitutes for COGS. From a management perspective, our ﬁndings suggest that early in the post-IPO growth
period, ﬁrms may beneﬁt from tracking and accounting for growth-rate adjustments while making aggregate SG&A and/or R&D
allocation decisions and continually tweak them based on revenue growth rates, recognizing that SG&A spending reductions can
be short-sighted when SG&A acts as a substitute for COGS. As for our ﬁndings' policy implications, since SG&A spending can reduce
COGS for both established and recent-IPO ﬁrms, the deployment of complementary tax incentives for SG&A investments (e.g., via
marketing programs) can foster growth.

2. Introduction

86

A dynamic view of the RBT of the ﬁrm requires an assessment of how resources are assembled while ﬁrms attempt to grow
(McKelvie, and Wiklund, 2010). The goal for investment in innovation and/or R&D is often aimed to spur growth and proﬁtability
(e.g., Minniti and Lévesque, in press). Spending on sales, and general and administrative costs (SG&A) are expected to build the
brand and create demand while covering allied overhead costs. Thus, SG&A and R&D are resources that act in unison to drive
growth (Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Krishnan and Ulrich, 2001). Managers in such decision scenarios strive to understand the
balance between SG&A and R&D investments, which are required to grow revenue.
Prior to an IPO, many CEOs assert that they will use the proceeds towards investments in R&D, marketing, and administration
efforts to foster growth. For instance, Rosetta Genomics' IPO prospectus states that “about $17 million from the proceeds of the
offering will be used to fund research and development activities. Roughly $2.5 million from the IPO will fund intellectual property
licensing and protection efforts, while about $6.6 million will go to business development activities such as personnel costs, legal
and administrative fees, and general corporate purposes” (Genomeweb, 2003). However, investments in growth are often the ﬁrst
allocations to be scaled back under competitive pressure or ﬁnancial distress. For instance, Pﬁzer, the world's largest drug maker,
cut its R&D budget signiﬁcantly in 2007 due to sharp competitive pressure (Rockoff, 2009).
Such examples raise questions about how a ﬁrm allocates resources towards SG&A and R&D while trying to stimulate proﬁtable
revenue growth. In this decision the ﬁrm must weigh the requirement for expenditures on current production costs in terms of the
costs of goods sold (COGS). The expense allocations are related decisions because the total allocations for SG&A, R&D and COGS
must equal the available working capital for each accounting period. Aggregating allocations is also a common practice in most
innovation-driven ﬁrms through their annual budgeting process (Anderson and Joglekar, 2005, Chao et al., 2009).
However, these decisions face intrinsic tensions. Increasing either SG&A or R&D investments encourages future revenue
generation and growth, but it does so through different mechanisms. They both generate expenses in the current accounting
period and thus reduce proﬁtability in the short term. The RBT suggests the examination of the elasticity of accumulated resources
to assess conditions where these resources (i.e., R&D and SG&A) might in fact be substitutes for rather than complements to COGS.
This assessment is especially important when the ﬁrm is attempting to grow (Townsend and Busenitz, 2008). In other words, for a
given level of revenue, increasing an expense that substitutes COGS will reduce those costs, but increasing an expense that
complements COGS will augment those costs. Hence, the overall effect of SG&A or R&D investments could either reduce or
enhance proﬁtability. Such allocations are particularly important following IPOs, when ﬁrms are infused with cash and are making
decisions aimed to foster growth (Jain et al., 2008).
The intended contribution of this research is to connect ﬁrm growth theory to RBT by examining the dynamic effects of
resource bundling during growth. In particular, we seek to understand three sets of issues: (i) Are there conditions where SG&A and
R&D investments act as substitutes for or complements to COGS within ﬁrms attempting to grow? (ii) Do ﬁrms adjust either their SG&A

or R&D allocations to be above (or below) their actual growth rate in revenue? (iii) Does the ﬁrm's point in its life cycle (i.e., a recent-IPO
or a well-established publicly traded company) affect the SG&A and R&D allocation balance?
To address these questions, we develop a production function that links a ﬁrm's SG&A expenses, R&D expenses and COGS with
its revenue. The speciﬁcation of this function considers four decisions that a publicly traded ﬁrm must make and report in any
given accounting period: the level of marketing and administrative intensity measured as the ratio of SG&A expenses to revenue,
the level of R&D intensity measured as the ratio of R&D expenses to revenue, the growth rate in revenue, and the amount of COGS.
Implicitly, these decisions also yield the actual operating margin measured as revenue minus SG&A, R&D expenses and COGS.
SG&A and R&D accumulate into two separate stocks, subject to rates of obsolescence.
We build upon ideas from the classic theory of ﬁrm growth (Baumol et al., 1970) to investigate the consequences of endowing a
manager with the ability to adjust (i.e., scale up or down) the SG&A and R&D stocks in order to manage a targeted revenue growth
rate. Wiklund et al. (2009) offer an integrative model of small ﬁrm growth that attempts to ﬁne tune how key constructs that have
been shown to affect growth actually act, while providing a “big picture” of the growth phenomenon. They ﬁnd an indirect effect of
adding resources, and suggest that future research should explore how resources are in fact used to foster growth. Our analysis
takes a step in this direction by looking at the endogenous allocation between SG&A, R&D and production costs while a ﬁrm
attempts to grow proﬁtably. In doing so, we draw upon the dynamic view of RBT postulated by Sirmon et al. (2007) and argue that
R&D and SG&A are the two relevant factors of production that affect growth. When combined, these investments can build into cospecialized assets that can impact the ﬁrm's productivity and competitive position (Townsend and Busenitz, 2008). We examine
the empirical link between the variation in COGS productivity and the fraction of revenue that the ﬁrm allocates to SG&A and R&D.
COGS productivity is deﬁned as the amount of revenue generated by each dollar spent on COGS. Since revenue is the sum of gross
margin and COGS, another way to interpret variation in COGS productivity is as a proxy for the inverse of the gross margin ratio.
The speciﬁed production function, along with equations that govern the accumulation of SG&A and R&D stocks, yields an
econometric relationship. We test this relationship for a panel dataset of 128 ﬁrms spread over 1993 to 2007, each tracked for ﬁve
contiguous years of growth, starting at their IPO date. Half of these ﬁrms are randomly selected, recent-IPO ﬁrms from four
industry sectors: electronics, energy, medical devices and software. The other half consists of a comparable sample of established
ﬁrms. Data on these established ﬁrms, also randomly drawn from the four industry sectors, is taken for the same years as the
comparable recent-IPO ﬁrms. As Filatotchev and Piesse (2009) observe, “[n]ewly listed ﬁrms provide a unique laboratory for
further theory building since they represent a bridge between mature, publicly listed companies and entrepreneurial ﬁrms” (p.
1261).
Rather than using the typical factors of production — capital and labor, we consider various types of expenditures (i.e., SG&A,
R&D, and COGS) that foster growth. This enables us to make a threefold contribution to the dynamic view of RBT. First, we specify
and test an aggregate production function, while controlling for relevant industry growth rates, and illustrate how the underlying
elasticity of SG&A and R&D investments with respect to COGS can be derived from a regression analysis. Second, we use these
elasticity parameters to demonstrate how SG&A investment is a substitute for COGS during revenue generation, whereas R&D
investment a complement. Third, we illustrate an asymmetry between observed productivities and observed SG&A and R&D
allocation decisions made by the recent-IPO ﬁrms compared to established ﬁrms in terms of enhancing COGS productivity.
Speciﬁcally, R&D investments and COGS are complements only for recent-IPO ﬁrms, while SG&A are substitutes for COGS for both
recent-IPO and established ﬁrms. Also, for the recent-IPO ﬁrms, both SG&A and R&D investments along with their related growthrate adjustments drive the revenue per unit of COGS, but only SG&A investments appear to be signiﬁcant for the established
sample.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the bodies of literature that have inﬂuenced our ideas and approaches
for this research. Next, we specify and analyze a growth-driven production function at the ﬁrm level. This exercise and the
resulting formal model allow us to propose a set of empirically testable hypotheses. Following this, we present the empirical
aspect of our study by describing the design of the sample, statistics on the aggregate data, key measures by industry sectors, and
speciﬁcation checks. We next address regression results and sensitivity analysis to test our hypotheses. We then discuss deviations
from the hypotheses, the inﬂuence of industry effects, and theoretical implications for dynamic RBT. We conclude by listing
managerial and policy implications, and by identifying the limitations of our work and options for follow-up research.

3. Firm growth literature

163

A large literature on ﬁrm growth originates with Penrose (1994). Baumol et al. (1970) were among the ﬁrst to empirically
examine a ﬁrm's willingness to retain earnings in order to drive growth. Several economic models explore allocation of capital and
labor strategies under growth (Aghion and Howitt, 1992), and economic growth through creative destruction (Schumpeter,
1950). However, at the ﬁrm level, the key aggregate decision is not how to allocate resources between labor and capital, but rather
how much resources to utilize and how to allocate them between tasks such as marketing and overhead (controlled through the
SG&A), R&D, and production (Grifﬁn and Hauser, 1996, Krishnan and Ulrich, 2001).
In an attempt to explore the balance between these three decisions in the context of established ﬁrms, Kamien and Schwartz
(1978) looked at R&D self-ﬁnancing, where both internal (Hauser, 1998) and external (e.g., R&D tax credits) (Hall and Van Reenen,
2000) incentives are relevant for growth. For startups, Joglekar and Lévesque (2009) argue that the productivities of marketing
and R&D activities are critical determinants of the portion of ﬁnancial resources to be allocated to each of these activities. Chao
et al. (2009) offer policies that determine the level of R&D investments in an endogenous manner as a function of revenue growth.

Entrepreneurship scholars have also been actively involved in the study of ﬁrm growth. Delmar et al. (2003) use a sample of
high-growth Swedish ﬁrms, where growth is assessed by various employment and sales measures, to demonstrate that high
growth is multidimensional and can occur in multiple patterns. Also examining Swedish ﬁrms, Chandler et al. (2009) study the
relationship between sales growth and employment growth, whereas Davidsson et al. (2009) focus on the growth-proﬁtability
relationship. Davidsson et al. argue that constraining growth initially may beneﬁt a ﬁrm because early proﬁtability allows for
delayed, yet sustainable growth without having to trade off proﬁtability. Their analysis supports this hypothesis and warns of the
danger in using sales growth as a measure of success (return on assets).
This growth-proﬁtability debate has also attracted the attention of scholars interested in the IPO based on expectations of
growth versus proﬁtability, especially during the Internet boom. For instance, Jain et al. (2008) looked at pre-IPO factors to analyze
the post-IPO path-to-proﬁtability. Another stream of research focuses on growth through the internationalization of newly
publicly listed ﬁrms. Filatotchev and Piesse (2009) looked at France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom to ﬁnd a positive
relationship between R&D intensity and sales growth. They demonstrate that “the growth of IPO ﬁrms is at its highest level just
after the ﬂoat” (p. 1273). In other words, sales growth diminishes over time after the IPO.
Recently, scholars have called for an examination of the modality of resource usage or how resources are built over time, while
considering the variations in these resources' growth rates as a ﬁrm attempts to grow (McKelvie and Wiklund, 2010). We bring
these ideas into context as we build our model and hypotheses by deploying the RBT in the growth (i.e., dynamic) setting as a
focusing device (Sirmon et al., 2007). Lippman and Rumelt (2003), Townsend and Busenitz (2008), and Sirmon et al. (2007)
advocate for a more dynamic examination of the black box of resources — how they are assembled. Wiklund and Shepherd (2003)
also argue for this dynamic examination in the entrepreneurial setting. Most of these studies maintain that investments must turn
into capabilities/stocks in order to affect the outcome (e.g., revenues). Then again, conventional growth models (e.g., Romer
(1990) at the economy level; Baumol et al. (1970) at the ﬁrm level) keep their stocks in terms of capital and labor and do not worry
about capabilities. We move away from stocks of labor and capital and instead consider the dynamics associated with stocks of
capabilities (e.g., R&D, SG&A) and integrate growth models and the RBT to test the conditions for when these stocks act as
substitutes for or complements to COGS, while continually balancing the capabilities' growth rates.
To our knowledge, no prior research explores the endogenous balance between SG&A expenses, R&D expenses and production
allocations in aggregate while a ﬁrm attempts to grow proﬁtably. In terms of these three categories of expenditures, a comparative
analysis of ﬁrms' choices made immediately following IPO and the choices of their established counterparts enables an empirical
test of balanced growth at the ﬁrm level (Filatotchev and Piesse, 2009). Drawing from this, in the next section we offer a model
that speciﬁes SG&A, R&D and COGS as the three relevant factors of production while controlling for industry growth rates.

4. A revenue model with controls for growth

204

4.1. Production function

205

Consider a ﬁrm that allocates its working capital for a given period to SG&A, R&D and COGS. Investments in SG&A and R&D in any
one period have a cumulative effect, such that they create stocks. The stock of SG&A creates and sustains brand awareness (and
supports allied coordination effort) that has been associated with revenue generation (Srinivasan et al., 2009). The R&D stock yields
innovative products and services, which in turn refresh the portfolio and enhance revenue generation (Krishnan and Ulrich, 2001).
The ﬁrm allocates at time period t a portion sM,t of its revenue, denoted by Yt, for SG&A in order to create a market presence.
Speciﬁcally, over time the ﬁrm's growth in SG&A stock Mt is directly proportional to sM, tYt (e.g., based on Nerlove and Arrow
(1962) advertisement capital model). Also, due to competitive forces, the ﬁrm's SG&A stock decreases exponentially over time at
rate d. In other words, SG&A stock accumulates goodwill and branding, but with some losses due to competition. Formally, growth
in SG&A stock satisﬁes (without a loss of generality, time is continuous in this formulation)

Certain ﬁrms may not invest in R&D in a given time period (Cohen et al., 1987, Cuervo-Cazurra and Un, in press), in which case
that stock will remain at its initially endowed value. Parameters d and e enable the model to account for lags between the impact of
R&D (or SG&A) to generate revenue.
A ﬁrm's output (i.e., revenue) depends on the laws of motion for the two production factors, SG&A stock and R&D stock shown
in Eqs. (1) and (2), and on its COGS. The production function is, assuming constant returns to scale and a Cobb–Douglas functional
form,
Yt = ½θCt 

That ﬁrm also consumes at time period t a proportion sR,t of its revenue to innovate, that is, to build its R&D stock. Speciﬁcally,
over time the ﬁrm's growth in R&D stock Rt is directly proportional to sR, tYt (Kamien and Schwartz, 1982). Owing to trials
associated with novelty, a ﬁrm's R&D stock decreases exponentially over time at a rate e. In other words, and symmetric to the law
of motion for SG&A stock, innovation accumulates expertise and know-how, but with some losses due to obsolescence of
technologies (e.g., Bruderl and Schussler, 1990, Choi and Shepherd, 2005). Formally, growth in R&D stock satisﬁes

where Ct is COGS at time period t, 1 − α − β∈(0,1) is that cost's elasticity, and θ (N0) is the productivity of production
expenditures. Clearly, α represents the elasticity of SG&A stock and β the elasticity of R&D stock. The production function in Eq. (3)
reﬂects the roles of three factors of revenue generation reported by real ﬁrms: SG&A, R&D and COGS expenses. As shown in
Eqs. (1) and (2), the effects of SG&A and R&D accumulate in a manner that is analogous to marketing and human capital in the
marketing and economics literature, respectively (e.g., Kamien and Schwartz, 1978). Based on accounting rules, COGS covers a
period of production costs (including variable material and labor costs) that do not accumulate. We also deﬁne

to study the effect of growth rates of SG&A and R&D stocks on a ﬁrm's revenue. We note that neither at, bt nor gt must be positive.
Parameter at represents the controls that allow adjustments to be made on the rate of growth in SG&A stock to equate the ﬁrm's
actual rate of growth gt in revenue. Since industry analysts compare ﬁrm performance, we argue that ﬁrms aspire to enable gt to
reach or exceed their particular industry's average growth rate in revenue. Such ﬁrms can then decide whether to match their
SG&A investments' growth rate with the corresponding average growth rate. When “at” equals 1, the ﬁrm elects to invest in SG&A
in the same proportion as its actual revenue growth rate. A value less (or more) than unity indicates that the ﬁrm is investing more
(or less) in SG&A growth than it invests in revenue. A similar interpretation also applies to “bt,” a.k.a., R&D investment adjustment.

Methodologically, the development of Eq. (5) parallels the analyses offered in the macroeconomic literature on growth (e.g.,
Romer, 1990, Mankiw et al., 1992). However, unlike the cases in this literature (where a country wants to grow its GDP), in our
model the ﬁrm has a proﬁtability motive while growing, and so we make all three factors of production – SG&A, R&D and COGS
expenses – endogenous, as opposed to keeping one (or more) exogenous.

251
252

4.3. Hypotheses

255

The preceding formal analysis, along with the RBT on purposeful assembly of factors of production, enables us to present a set
of empirically testable hypotheses. Lippman and Rumelt (2003) argue that revenue is split between a portion that is allocated for
payment for commodities in an elastic supply, and that the rest is allocated to pay for a bundle of scarce resources. Townsend and
Busenitz (2008) build on this payment perspective in that entrepreneurs can generate ﬁrm wealth through the unique bundling of
co-specialized resources. Adegbesan (2009) also shows that a ﬁrm can proﬁt when it exhibits superior complementarities to
targeted resources. If we interpret these resources to be stocks of R&D and SG&A, and view R&D stock as proxy for technology, and
SG&A stock for marketing, then their effects can be complementary (Song et al., 2005). We build upon this payment perspective on
the RBT to offer hypotheses on the observed elasticity for individual factors and to present hypotheses on the adjustments that
must be made to these factors in dynamic settings by accounting for their growth rates. We also postulate different types of
outcomes for recent-IPO and established ﬁrms.
Townsend and Busenitz (2008) contend that “the accumulation of substitute strategic factors reduces the factor payments
required to obtain the services of key individual resources within technology-based ventures” (p. 347). They also suggest that “the
development of strategic factor complementarities increases the marginal product of bundled strategic factors without a
corresponding increase in factor payments within technology-based ventures” (p. 349). Hence, our initial set of hypotheses focus
on the elasticity parameters α and β in Eq. (3) (speciﬁcally their signs). Empirical studies have examined the stand-alone impact of
marketing and R&D efforts (separately) on productivity (e.g., Hall et al., 2005), where the presence of either marketing activities or
R&D is seen to enhance revenue generation, ceteris paribus. Marketing effort is aimed at generating and closing on sales leads,
building brand and facilitating administrative effort that will enhance demand (Ailawadi et al., 2003) while decreasing the
associated variable (i.e., production) costs. While scholars have argued that R&D expenses ultimately enhance revenue, it is
unclear whether R&D decreases COGS. The theoretical rationale suggests that the R&D type dictates its linkage to the cost structure
(Utterback, 1996): product R&D may increase the costs, whereas process R&D will reduce the unit costs. Recent-IPO ﬁrms tend to
focus on product R&D rather than process R&D (Jain and Kini, 1995). Hence, we argue that while an increase in R&D stock will
increase demand, it may also require larger COGS. Formally,

The COGS elasticity (i.e., substitute versus complement) hypotheses affect ﬁrms' margins because the relationships between
R&D, SG&A and COGS determine the margin for a ﬁxed level of revenue. However, focusing on the COGS elasticity measure alone
may not be sufﬁcient to explain aggregate ﬁrm-level decisions on growth because managers are concerned about raising both
revenue and margins (Baumol et al., 1970). Hence, we offer a second set of hypotheses centered on the adjustments at and bt that
managers make. Financial accounting research incorporates both SG&A and R&D as levers for adjustments in growth and earnings
(Bange and De Bondt, 1998). Marketing and R&D productivities have been shown to be relevant factors in growth-related resource
allocation decisions (Joglekar and Lévesque, 2009). Hence, we argue that a ﬁrm's investment adjustments in both SG&A and R&D
increase COGS productivity (i.e., revenue per unit of COGS). Formally,

H2A. A ﬁrm's growth-rate adjustment while making SG&A investments is positively associated with its COGS productivity.

289

H2B. A ﬁrm's growth-rate adjustment while making R&D investments is positively associated with its COGS productivity.

290

Lippman and Rumelt's (2003) speciﬁcation of the revenue-generation function depends crucially upon resource productivity.
The next two hypotheses concern the productivity parameter θ in the production function (i.e., Eq. (3)) and the magnitudes (as
opposed to the signs) of the elasticity parameters, α and β. As per Eq. (5), the focus here is on comparing the magnitude of these
parameters (and hence their impact on COGS productivity) for recent-IPO ﬁrms to their magnitude for established ﬁrms. Based on
Davidsson et al.'s (2009) evidence, high proﬁtability and low growth are preferable in the early stages of ﬁrm development to
sustain both later growth and later proﬁtability. Since recent-IPO ﬁrms are in the early growth stage, they would thus be expected
to grow at a slower rate than their established counterparts, yet be more proﬁtable. But because recent-IPO ﬁrms likely have lower
revenues, they need to be more efﬁcient in transferring each unit of marketing, innovation and production efforts into revenue in
order to be proﬁtable. Consequently, not only is a unit of COGS expected to yield more revenue for recent-IPO ﬁrms than for
established ﬁrms, but the elasticity of SG&A investment and the elasticity of R&D investment are both expected to be higher for
recent-IPO ﬁrms.
These comparative observations are also supported by Wiklund and Shepherd (2003) who argue that “the willingness to be
innovative, proactive, and take risks [i.e., possess an entrepreneurial orientation (EO)] enhances the positive impact that a ﬁrm's
bundle of knowledge-based resources [i.e., those pertinent to opportunity discovery and exploitation] has on [its] performance”
(p. 1312). In considering proﬁt margin and growth in employee numbers, revenue and sales, their model uses resources as
antecedents to EO. Although EO is associated with small ﬁrm growth, in our study we do not observe EO but posit that recent-IPO
ﬁrms are likely to possess a higher EO because they are just moving beyond a restructuring phase to start their growth phase. This
higher EO, based on Wiklund and Shepherd's hypothesis, enhances the relationship between the ﬁrm's performance and resources
(mostly knowledge-based and plentiful in high-tech industries in either marketing, R&D or production investments). Formally,

5. Empirical analysis

317

5.1. Operationalization

318

Relevant concerns in our analysis of ﬁrm growth are the inﬂuence of ﬁrm age and industry sector. The literature on the theory
of the ﬁrm routinely argues for managers to pay attention to industry effects (Rumelt, 1991). In addition, adjusting for industry
effects and period lags is a recognized practice in the ﬁnancial economics and accounting literature (Kothari et al., 2002, Petersen,
2009). McGahan and Porter (2002) also examine variance in accounting proﬁtability and indicate that “industry and corporateparent effects are important and related to one another. As expected, business-speciﬁc effects, which arise from competitive
positioning and other factors, have a large inﬂuence on performance” (p. 834). Hence, we consider the inﬂuence of industry effects
(including industry growth rate) and the ﬁrm's choice to pursue proﬁtable growth in our analysis, and operationalize this in
Eq. (5) as

is a dummy variable for ﬁrm type (recent-IPO versus established ﬁrm), and HHI is the Herﬁndahl–Hirschman index, a measure of
industry concentration (Miller, 1982). Rather than controlling for age, we use EST_Firm to represent the position of the ﬁrm in its
life cycle. The left-hand side of Eq. (6) tracks the revenue per unit of COGS, labeled COGS productivity, which represents the gross
proﬁt added to COGS divided by COGS, providing a proxy for revenue acquisition.

coefﬁcients can be used for a relative assessment of the impact of growth rates. Accordingly, we use γ3 and γ4 to test H2A and H2B,
the association between growth-rate adjustments and COGS productivity. The estimated parameter γ0 reﬂects aggregate data
productivity and is thus used to test H3.

337

5.2. Sample selection and descriptive statistics

341

We focus on four high-technology sectors – electronics, energy, medical devices and software – to obtain a reasonable variation
in industry growth rate, a key control variable in our speciﬁcation. The industry sectors were chosen based on SIC codes. We chose
high-technology sectors because R&D is typically more important in these sectors (Amir et al., 2007); indeed all ﬁrms within our
sample reported positive R&D (and SG&A) expenditures.
We randomly selected 16 ﬁrms within each sector, yielding a total of 64 ﬁrms that underwent an IPO in the United States
between 1994 and 2002. For each ﬁrm, we collected annual data from the COMPUSTAT database for one year prior and ﬁve years
post IPO providing 7 contiguous years of information (these ﬁrms were new ventures or formerly private companies that ﬁled a S1 prospectus, which provides data for the year prior to IPO). We labeled these data recent-IPO sample. We also collected a
comparable sample of 64 established ﬁrms, called the EST sample, by randomly drawing ﬁrms from the same industry sectors and
same years as the recent-IPO sample. We also chose established ﬁrms that had undergone through an IPO at least 8 years prior to
the initial year in which their annual data was collected. Thus, the dataset reports 5 years of growth for each recent-IPO and EST
ﬁrm, because the sixth contiguous year of data is required to establish annual growth rates. Data for the seventh year was used to
compute lagged corrections, both for the IPO and EST samples. By combining the recent-IPO and EST samples, we created a panel
dataset with a sample size of 768 ﬁrm-years.
We used primary data for the following variables for each ﬁrm and accounting year (note that the time index t has been
removed on these variables for exposition simplicity):

We use COMPUSTAT data on R&D and SG&A in line with numerous studies (e.g., Berger et al., 1997; Bayus et al., 2003).
Measures such as SG&A, R&D and COGS are reported based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We note that if a
ﬁrm is actively engaged in R&D services, overlaps may occur based on the manner in which these measures are reported, because
R&D expenses could appear as COGS (e.g., costs of services delivered). The reverse is also possible, where overhead and
coordination costs can be part of R&D if accountants justify these costs as associated with R&D. Nevertheless, a common practice in

the accounting domain is to view these variations as special cases and proceed to use R&D and SG&A as proxies for the purpose for
which the reporting categories were created, as did Berger et al. (1997) and Bayus et al. (2003).
Tables 1–3 provide statistics on the aggregate data, key measures by industry and the correlations, respectively. The aggregate
statistics in Table 1 indicate that, on average, the revenue and gross proﬁt of the established ﬁrms are more than 5 times the
averages for the recent-IPO ﬁrms. On the other hand, the minimum and maximum values of SG&A, R&D, COGS expenses and age,
particularly for the established ﬁrms, were widely dispersed. Table 2 provides the comparison of these data based on industry
sectors. The average annual growth rate (ghati) in the energy and software sectors is higher than for the electronics and medical
devices sectors. High values for a and b imply that ﬁrms in that sector tend to move their allocation for SG&A and R&D at a
relatively lower rate than their actual revenue growth rate. In all four sectors, the recent-IPO ﬁrms tended to invest in both SG&A

and R&D at a higher rate, on average, than they invested in their revenue (a b 1 and all but one b b 1), and the established ﬁrms
invested at a much lower rate in R&D. Correlation coefﬁcients are shown in Table 3 for transformed variables based on Eq. (6).
Items IV and V (the adjusted growth rates) were computed by setting the values of d and e at 0.15. We set these obsolescence rates
for R&D and SG&A stock in the base case at 15% as the literature has determined to be realistic rates for ﬁrms (Cockburn and
Griliches, 1988, Berndt et al., 1995). We explore the sensitivity of the results in Section 6 to the magnitude of d and e. We also
adjusted the growth rate corrections by a constant shift parameter (k), set at 10, to overcome the non-negativity constraint
associated with a logarithmic function.

6.1. Speciﬁcation checks

442

Several econometric issues must be considered when testing Eq. (6). Firm characteristics (ﬁxed effects) such as strategy may be
correlated with the independent variables, autocorrelation may exist in the panel data set, and because causality may run in both
directions – from revenue to expenditure and vice versa – the independent variables may be correlated with the error term. As
neither the ﬁxed-effects regression nor the autoregressive lag model addressed the endogeneity issue, we used a two-stage least
squares regression with liquidity, leverage and lag of the natural log of COGS productivity (i.e., ln(y)) as instrumental variables.
Based on a post-estimation analysis, these three instruments proved to be strong and exogenous. The ﬁrst-stage test statistics for
the suspected endogenous variables in the base model, ln(sM) and ln(sR), were 30.55 and 37.64, and were of similar scale for
subsequent models — all comfortably passing the Stock and Yogo (2004) test for weak instruments. Following Blundell and Bond
(1998), we used the Sargan test (p-value = 0.759 in the base model), which supported the exogeneity of liquidity, leverage and lag
of ln(y) and checked that the error term was not serially correlated.
The dummy variables for sectors (Industryi) were dropped from the base and subsequent models because of collinearity with
the average revenue growth rate by industry sector (ghati). The Pagan and Hall (1983) test showed that heteroskedasticity was not
present. Further, we ran models, including the interaction between the ﬁrm-type dummy (EST_Firm) and each of the independent
variables, to test the validity of separately comparing the recent-IPO and established ﬁrms. All the interactions were signiﬁcant,
conﬁrming the difference in the coefﬁcients for recent-IPO and established ﬁrms. The results, presented in Tables 4 and 5, stem
from the two-stage least squares regression with autocorrelation consistent statistics.

6.2. Regression analysis

459

The regression results for the base case are presented in Table 4. The dependent variable is the natural log of COGS productivity,
a proxy for the inverse of the gross margin, which measures the revenue per unit of COGS. The results for the base case, with
obsolescence rates d = e = 0.15, are presented as a set of three models: combined data, established ﬁrms only, and recent-IPO
ﬁrms only, which are identiﬁed as Models 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in Tables 4 and 5. The results for H1A, H1B, H2A and H2B are
presented ﬁrst under the heading combined data analysis, followed by the results for H3, H4A and H4B, where the recent-IPO ﬁrms
are compared to the established ﬁrms. Model 1 combines the data for recent-IPO ﬁrms (labeled recent-IPO) and established ﬁrms

IPO vs. EST) results differ.

6.2.1. Combined data analysis
Model 1 combines the data and includes a ﬁrm-type dummy (EST_Firm). We draw four key inferences. First, we note that the
regression coefﬁcients γ1 and γ2 are signiﬁcant, suggesting that both SG&A and R&D investments are associated with COGS
productivity. As articulated earlier, we compute the values of α and β. Elasticity α is shown to be positive (1.251), thus supporting
H1A and allowing us to infer that an increase in SG&A investment can diminish COGS while generating revenue; in other words,
SG&A and COGS are substitutes in the growth-driven environment. On the other hand, β is negative (−0.535), also supporting
H1B and suggesting that an increase in R&D investments can augment COGS while generating revenue; in other words, R&D and
COGS are complements.
Second, we observe that γ3 is signiﬁcant and negative, but γ4 is signiﬁcant and positive. That is, H2A is unsupported but H2B is
supported. This suggests that the aggregate population does not adjust its growth rate by increasing SG&A investment to improve
COGS productivity, but it does adjust (positively) its growth rate while making R&D investment. We further observe in Model 1

6.2.2. Comparing recent-IPO to established ﬁrms
We estimate the production function separately in Model 2 and Model 3, based on the EST and recent-IPO samples,
respectively. In order to test H1A and H1B, we impute the values of α and β for Model 2 and Model 3 from their respective
regression coefﬁcients γ1 and γ2. In Model 2, we note that γ1 is signiﬁcant but γ2 is not signiﬁcant. In Model 3, however, both γ1
and γ2 are signiﬁcant. In Model 2 it follows that the imputed value for α is positive (0.641) and β equals zero, thus supporting H1A
but not H1B. In Model 3, α is positive (1.540) and β is negative (− 0.970), thus supporting both H1A and H1B. In other words, R&D
investments and COGS are complements only for recent-IPO ﬁrms, while SG&A substitutes for COGS for both recent-IPO and
established ﬁrms.
We also observe that, in Model 2, γ3 and γ4 are not signiﬁcant. Hence, H2A and H2B are not supported. In Model 3, on the other
hand, γ3 and γ4 are signiﬁcant, but the former is negative and the latter is positive. Hence, H2A is unsupported but H2B is
supported. The signiﬁcance of γ1 through γ4 for the recent-IPO ﬁrms suggests that both SG&A and R&D investments, along with
their related growth-rate adjustments (a and b), drive their COGS productivity.
These ﬁndings establish some asymmetry between the choices of the recent-IPO and established ﬁrms. This asymmetry exists
with respect to their R&D investment, and both SG&A and R&D growth-rate adjustments, in their association with COGS
productivity, to generate revenue. We test H3 by examining the interaction between the intercept and the ﬁrm-type dummy
(EST_Firm) and ﬁnd that the overall productivity parameter (γ0) is signiﬁcantly greater for established ﬁrms than for recent-IPO
ﬁrms (details omitted for space consideration). Hence, H3 is unsupported.
Finally, we use the imputed values of elasticity to test H4A and H4B. Since the imputed values of α for Model 2 and Model 3 are
0.641 and 1.540, respectively, H4A is supported. Similarly, the imputed values of β for Model 2 and Model 3 are 0 and − 0.970,
respectively, and thus H4B is also supported. Therefore, SG&A and R&D investments in recent-IPO ﬁrms have a larger elasticity
with respect to COGS in generating revenue than their established counterparts.

534
535

7. Discussion

555

7.1. Deviating from the hypotheses

556

A summary of ﬁndings is provided in Table 6. The elasticity-related hypotheses (H1A and H1B) are that a ﬁrm's investment in
SG&A stock substitutes for, and that in R&D stock complements, its COGS allocation. We found support for these hypotheses except
for one out of the six conditions in Table 6: R&D stock does not complement the allocation for COGS in established ﬁrms. Utterback
(1996) provided evidence on regimes when the products are mature, typically after the emergence of dominant designs, where
process R&D can reduce production costs (and thus COGS). Arguably, recent-IPO ﬁrms may not face the emergence of a dominant
design and can focus on product R&D within a single market. Established ﬁrms, on the other hand, often must address multiple
market segments that are characterized by dominant designs, and may be faced with a portfolio of product R&D and process R&D
decisions (Chao et al., 2009), whose combination may cancel out the increasing effect that product R&D investment can have on
COGS. We have no way, however, of correcting for the effect of process R&D on aggregate COGS productivity. (Furthermore, a
process diversiﬁcation may not exhibit a one-to-one mapping into product diversiﬁcation, which diminishes the usefulness of
product diversiﬁcation as a measure).
Similarly, our hypotheses about adjustments with respect to the ﬁrm's actual growth rate in revenue (H2A and H2B) are
supported for R&D in two conditions, but not for SG&A. That is, recent-IPO ﬁrms tend to consider their COGS productivity while
making both SG&A and R&D allocations in aggregate, but with a negative impact from SG&A investments. Established ﬁrms, on the
other hand, tend not to look at COGS productivity when selecting their SG&A nor do they tend to look at R&D investment. The
association between the SG&A growth-rate adjustment and COGS productivity may not be captured in established ﬁrms because,
again, managers are faced with a portfolio of product/process R&D decisions, and also, the linkages between SG&A growth and
aggregate COGS productivity are not easy to establish in such settings.
We also examined the robustness of the ﬁndings in Table 6 by changing the values of d and e to extreme values in their range
(i.e., 0 and 0.99), as shown in Table 5. The 4th, 7th and 10th columns correspond to the base case (d = e = 0.15) discussed earlier.
Results from the base case change to a small extent, but the signs and ranges of the imputed values of elasticity parameters α and β
do not change. Consequently, our ﬁndings regarding H1A, H1B, H4A and H4B (as summarized in Table 6) still hold true. Also, H2A
remains unsupported and H2B remains supported for the combined and the recent-IPO sample; H2A and H2B remain unsupported
for the EST sample.
Our ﬁndings regarding H3 are affected by the obsolescence rate values. Established ﬁrms are more productive than recent-IPO
ﬁrms operating at low obsolescence rates, and the reverse is true for recent-IPO ﬁrms, where they become more productive at
higher obsolescence rates. A plausible explanation for this dependence may be that when stocks of SG&A and R&D fall rapidly (e.g.,
d = e = 0.99), a good amount of radical innovation may be taking place in established ﬁrms, possibly even disruptive change, so
that the stock of prior SG&A and R&D lose their relevance in the generation of revenue. We performed additional regression tests
using a ﬁrm-type dummy (EST_Firm) as the interaction variable, and veriﬁed the sensitivity of H3 to the prevalent obsolescence
rates (details omitted for space consideration).

7.2. Inﬂuence of industry effects

588

The disaggregation of industry and ﬁrm effects has been a central issue in the development of the RBT (Lippman and Rumelt,
2003). The industry sectors we have followed are undergoing rapid technological evolution and continue to generate a large
number of startups and IPOs (Technology Review, 2009). Management theorists (McGahan and Porter, 2002) and analysts
(Genomeweb, 2003) following various industries tend to recognize that such differences across industry sectors should exist.
However, the literature does not explain the recent-IPO versus established-ﬁrm asymmetry. Industry growth rates (ghati) are
signiﬁcant in Model 1 (combined sample) and in Model 3 (recent-IPO ﬁrms only). These growth rates are correlated with other
sector variables such as age and the sector dummy variables (Industryi) as shown in Table 3. Hence, it is no surprise that including
the industry growth rate as a control variable eliminates the signiﬁcance of the sector dummy variables from the base case.
A second construct worth examining is liquidity, that is, the amount of cash carried by the ﬁrms. Table 2 shows that, in all four
industry sectors, recent-IPO ﬁrms have more liquidity on average than their established counterparts, even though the established
ﬁrms have much more revenues. Arguably, this could result from the fact that recent-IPO ﬁrms are hedging their risks by carrying
larger amounts of cash because their revenues are smaller and presumably more volatile. Some post hoc analysis underscores this
fact. For instance, between 1997 and 2001 Angeion Corporation, an established medical device ﬁrm and an outlier in our dataset,
experienced a growth rate that was nearly six times greater than the industry average. The reverse can be true for the revenue
growth rates of the electronic and software ﬁrms. For instance, between 1996 and 2000, Applix, a then recent-IPO ﬁrm, had a
growth rate that was nearly six times less than its industry average. Consequently, smallness, which is often associated with
recent-IPO ﬁrms, does not necessarily mean faster growth.

7.3. Implications for dynamic RBT

606

RBT scholars have called for an examination of how resources are assembled over time, while accounting for variations in rates
of growth (McKelvie and Wiklund, 2010). We develop a formal model that considers the dynamics associated with stocks of
capabilities (e.g., R&D and SG&A) and tests the conditions for when these capabilities act as substitutes for or complements to
COGS, while considering their growth rates. Our contributions are brought into focus when we compare the implications of our
results with recent ﬁndings in dynamic RBT. For instance, Sirmon et al. (2009) examined the contingent nature of resource
investment and deployment decisions, indicating that ﬁrm performance suffers when managers' investment decisions deviate
from the norms of rivals for both human and physical capital. Speciﬁcally, ﬁrm performance is improved by making congruent
resource investment and deployment decisions as opposed to optimizing either decision independently.
Similarly to these asset orchestration decisions, we demonstrate the contingent nature of the decisions on investment in
resources for marketing and administration, research and development, and production. We show how these investments change
based on ﬁrm characteristics (recent-IPO vs. established ﬁrm) and industry growth rates, further supporting the contingent
argument in dynamic RBT. Moreover, we establish a mechanism to assess the elasticity of these investments to determine the
nature of resource complementarities while accounting for growth. Our results suggest that follow-up studies of dynamic RBT
should explicitly consider contingencies, such as growth rates, while testing for complementarities. For instance, if SG&A, R&D and
COGS data are assembled at the business unit level, our model can be used to examine the dynamic assembly of resources during
distributed (i.e., cross-business unit) collaborations, as suggested by Martin and Eisenhardt (2010).

8. Conclusion

623

The intended contribution of this research is to link dynamic models of ﬁrm growth to the RBT context. We examined a
comparable set of 16 recent-IPO and 16 established ﬁrms in four industry sectors for a period of seven years each. While we were
not privy to ﬁrm strategies and their implementation at the level of individual products, the aggregate outcomes of such
implementations are reﬂected in the COGS-productivity measure. Our work is relevant to business model measurements because
it incorporates theories (e.g., Short et al., 2008) and anecdotal evidence (Lah, 2010) that indicate that some managers and ﬁnancial
analysts discuss and compare business models in terms of the portions of revenue devoted to aggregate SG&A, R&D, COGS and
proﬁts.
Since our proposed production function does not use capital and labor as factors of production and instead focuses on various
types of expenditures (i.e., SG&A, R&D, and COGS) that may promote the growth of ﬁrms, our research highlights the potential
importance of both the magnitude and the rate of growth in SG&A and R&D investments as signiﬁcant determinants of COGS
productivity. Also, the robustness of many of our ﬁndings with respect to changes in the rate at which a ﬁrm's SG&A or R&D stock
decreases over time might suggest that resource allocation that inﬂuences COGS productivity is not necessarily sensitive to
obsolescence rates. For the life cycle of ﬁrms, our investigation highlights the asymmetry of the impacts of these determinants
based on whether the ﬁrm is a recent-IPO or established, with the SG&A magnitude being signiﬁcant only later in the ﬁrm life
cycle. Hence, we argue that our dataset on SG&A, R&D and COGS reﬂects the de facto strategies and operational performance of the
ﬁrms. For instance, a ﬁrm such as Walmart (not included in our dataset) or Micron (a major maker of PCs and memory chips
included in our dataset) may be following growth strategies based on low cost. The COGS productivity of such a ﬁrm ought to be
higher than the industry average.
Our analysis also contributes to the policy debate on the R&D tax credit for growth-oriented ﬁrms, especially immediately
following IPOs (Atkinson, 2007). Empirical evidence on claimed R&D tax credits indicates that “as a percentage of average assets,

the average amount of [R&D] tax credit claimed per company is a decreasing function of size” (Ernst and Young, 2008). Our
ﬁndings for the established ﬁrms appear to be in sync with this evidence. More interestingly, our ﬁndings also indicate that, during
the early growth phase of recent-IPO ﬁrms, SG&A investments played a key role as substitutes for COGS. That is, it is difﬁcult for
recent-IPO ﬁrms to foster growth through R&D alone, and they could use a complementary tax incentive to invest in SG&A (e.g., for
marketing programs). A second policy implication of our investigation is based on the importance of liquidity in the life cycle of
these ﬁrms. Supporting the ﬁrm's liquidity needs (e.g., though loan guarantees for certain technology sectors such as energy ﬁrms
engaged in clean technologies) may provide more resources for SG&A and R&D, which will foster growth.
The implication of the regression coefﬁcients associated with the signiﬁcance of ‘a’ and ‘b’ are that managers in recent-IPO ﬁrms
consider their actual growth rates in revenue and deviate signiﬁcantly from them while making SG&A and R&D allocations in order
to control revenue growth. Tracking and accounting for ‘a’ and ‘b’ during a ﬁrm's resource allocation process, and their relevance
for competitive strategies, thus appear important for ﬁrm growth. Our results further imply that, during growth, ﬁrms should track
not only these growth-rate adjustments, revenue and industry sector growth rates, but also their own COGS productivity along
with the obsolescence rates d and e during their annual planning and strategy formation process. A longitudinal view of these
parameters could enable these ﬁrms to test whether their strategy is on course, when compared to their peers. These ﬁrms could
also look for opportunities by examining their R&D and/or SG&A elasticity with respect to COGS, and look for biases or shortsighted choices that may be integrated into their aggregate resource allocation processes.
Our study also comes with limitations, which open doors for additional research. Some of our sample ﬁrms had gone through
acquisitions, while others had shown negative proﬁts for a few quarters, but we did not need to exclude any ﬁrm because it failed
during or after the period of observation. To that extent, our work suffers from survival bias. Also, we did not allow the elasticity
terms to vary over time. Such adjustments would have enabled us to characterize the time period when the decision of recent-IPO
ﬁrms can converge with the growth-related allocation choices made by their established counterparts. A third shortcoming,
especially for the established ﬁrms, is that ﬁnancial data typically aggregate portfolios of business units that offer diverse products
(Wernerfelt and Montgomery, 1988) and thus, the results of our analysis could be confounded by such diversiﬁcation effects.
Further, our empirical study is restricted to a time horizon and industry sectors where the average growth rates (as shown
in Table 2) are positive. Application of the framework to ﬁrms in a declining economy or with capital constraints may yield
another set of ﬁndings. Lastly, our results on asymmetries could be exploited to set up managerial incentives in settings where
growth and proﬁtability are central concerns (Chao et al., 2009). We have shown that the productivity results are sensitive to
obsolescence rates, but we have not been able to account for product versus process innovation effects explicitly due to data
limitations. We leave these as issues that need further scrutiny to the realm of growth-adjusted dynamics associated with business
venturing.
