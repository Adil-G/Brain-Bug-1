Ventures: An Experimental Investigation
Article Type: Full Length Article
Abstract: A critical decision that entrepreneurs in early-stage ventures
often encounter is the form in which they need to market their innovation
in the marketplace. There are three broad strategic alternatives, which
we collectively term as Product-Form Strategies. These alternatives are:
market the intellectual property (e.g. licensing strategy), market
intermediate products (e.g. components strategy), or market complete
systems/solutions (e.g. systems strategy). Despite the importance of
matching a chosen product-form strategy and product-market entry, scant
work has shed light into what factors influence decision-makers to choose
one product-form strategy over another. Drawing on theories of firm
scope and the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a theoretical
framework and test the integrative scope dimension using a 2x2x2 full
factorial, within-subject, Experimental Vignette Method (EVM) employing

hypotheses that technological, environmental, and firm-specific factors
influence expert angel investors' product-form strategy decision.

Determinants of Product-Form Strategy Decisions in Early-Stage Ventures: An
Experimental Investigation

Abstract
A critical decision that entrepreneurs in early-stage ventures often encounter is the form in which they
need to sell their innovation in the marketplace. There are three broad strategic alternatives, which we
collectively term as Product-Form Strategies. These alternatives are: market the innovation as
intellectual property (e.g. licensing strategy), market intermediate products (e.g. components strategy),
or market complete systems/solutions (e.g. systems strategy). Despite the importance of matching a
chosen product-form decision with the appropriate market, scant work has shed light on what factors
influence decision-makers to choose one product-form strategy over another. Drawing on theories of
the scope of a firm and the resource-based view of the firm, we develop a theoretical framework and
test the integrative scope dimension using a full factorial, within-subject controlled experimental study
employing active Angel Investors as study participants. We propose and find support for hypotheses
that technological, environmental, and firm-specific factors influence expert angel investors’ productform strategy decision. Implications for theory and practice are drawn.

<-----Page 2----->1. Introduction
A fundamental strategic dilemma facing all firms is the decision of how to transform an idea
into a successful market offering. Research by Frias et al. (2015) and John et al. (1999) reports that
there is a continuum of alternatives for transforming an idea into a market offering. However, there
exist three primary alternatives for firms in general. For example:
Imagine a startup team that has developed an innovation designed to improve copper mining
through advanced navigation technology. This innovation better assesses and predicts
temperature, fuel requirements, and moisture levels in the mine while simultaneously tracks
proximity of nearby mining equipment. This technology provides tremendous value in the
market because it reduces costs, allows for better organization of labor crews, and improves
safety. However, the startup team is faced with the dilemma of deciding how to best form their
idea into a saleable product. First, the technology could take the form of software or
intellectual property that is sold to another firm who could then integrate the intellectual
property into their complementary technologies. Alternatively, it may be commercialized in
the form of the GPS tracking device, in which case the navigation technology could be
integrated into the device by the startup firm or it could be outsourced to a manufacturing firm
that could perform the necessary tasks to ready the technology for sale by the startup. Third,
the advanced navigation technology may be commercialized as excavation equipment—ready
for use by miners—with the advanced navigation technology integrated into a final good.

The strategies are to market intellectual property (i.e. a licensing strategy), market intermediate
products (i.e. components strategy), or market complete systems/solutions (i.e. a systems strategy)
(Ghosh et al. 2015). We call these alternatives product-form strategies. The choice of product-form
strategy is especially important for early-stage ventures1 for a variety of reasons. For example,
researchers have suggested that early-stage ventures are especially vulnerable to product-form strategy
because they have a limited ability to recover from failed commercialization strategies (Shane and
Cable 2002; Bhide 2000). We also know that early-stage ventures typically suffer from an inability to
properly market their product offering (Bruton and Rubanik 2002) and consequently, they are more

We make explicit the distinction between early-stage ventures and established firms because their decision of ‘what to
sell’ at the product-line level is typically synonymous with their ‘business model’. That is infrequently the case for
established firms with multiple product lines. For example, firms may choose to sell systems in some markets and
components in others. As such, the business model—for established firms—is typically a decision of ‘what to sell’ at the
product-line level.

the success of early-stage ventures is the entrenched business relationships and longstanding industry
norms that may be foreign to these new businesses when they enter a market (Baldwin and Clark
2000). Given the importance of this issue, it is surprising to find so few studies examining this strategic
decision from an early-stage ventures perspective. Thus, a primary goal of this research examines how
product-form strategy impacts commercialization efforts of early-stage ventures. To understand this
strategic decision we executed a two-stage research study: a qualitative theory building stage and a
quantitative theory testing stage.
In the theory building phase, we undertook a two-year examination of product-form strategies
from the perspectives of both entrepreneurs and investors. Our goal was to examine how both internal
members of venture teams as well as external evaluators of the viability of the technology examine the
product-form strategy decision. This study led to nearly 700 pages of transcribed notes, observations
of 52 entrepreneur pitches, interviews with over 40 entrepreneurs and investors (both angel investors
and venture capitalists), and many examples of past and current product-form strategy deliberations.
We found that participants described product-form strategy as having implications for marketing
strategy as well as the overall firm strategy. Topics such as targeting, positioning, product definition,
time-to-market, inter-firm relationships, segmentation, competitors, price point, and expected profit
margins, the business model, entry/exit strategy, and attractiveness to potential investors were revealed
to be related to product-form strategy. This qualitative inquiry helped us understand the relationships
and processes involved in the investment screening procedures of early-stage ventures we learned that
angel investors and entrepreneurs frequently deliberate openly about product-form strategy during
pitches held at angel screening meetings. We also learned that angel investors rather than
entrepreneurs are often more experienced in the commercialization process due to the relatively larger

2

<-----Page 4----->number of startups in which they have participated and to which they have provided support
throughout their careers as business-owners and investors.
Based on this extensive enquiry, we identify three underlying mechanisms as primary
influencers of the product-form strategy decision. Briefly, the mechanisms included: modularity,
which is the ease with which the final good can be put together without proactive coordination efforts
by a single firm (i.e. the need for adaptation), enforceability which is the perception of the strength of
the venture’s intellectual property (i.e. the ability to safeguard the technology against appropriation),
and resources which are the possession of intangible expertise and/or skills allowing for improved
dissemination and utilization of information related to product development activities (i.e. inimitable
firm capabilities and resources). Putting together the different product-form strategies and its
influencing factors we propose a compact decision-making framework for early-stage ventures.
In the second stage, we tested the various components of our framework using a controlled
experimental study among “expert entrepreneurs” (i.e. active angel investors). In particular, we asked
the participants to evaluate different venture vignettes—similar to those they encounter during their
activities as angel investors—with the intention of choosing among product-form strategies. We then
analyzed their responses to test whether the underlying mechanisms revealed in our initial study were
consistent with the findings in an experimental investigation of product-form strategy. We found
support for the various components of the theoretical framework proposed. Our findings revealed that
the ease of integrating the idea and interfacing technologies (i.e. modularity) suggested less integrative
product-form strategies. Second, it was preferable for ventures with technologies deemed to have
strong intellectual property protection to sell less integrative product-forms. Third, ventures with
extensive product development resources should sell technologies with more integrative productforms.

3

<-----Page 5----->Taken together, the theory building and testing stages of our research contributes to existing
literature on product-form strategy in various ways. First we identify and test new and unique factors
impacting product-form strategy. Second, it extends studies in the strategy literature by identifying
how product-form strategies in marketing are integral to the decision of ‘what to sell’ rather than the
‘make versus buy’ approach often considered when firm-boundary questions are examined (Jacobides
and Winter 2005; Sanchez 1996; Sanchez and Mahoney 1996). Specifically, our work reveals how
product-form strategy can identify where a firm chooses to connect to the market and how these
alternative forms may dictate the required resources and relationships that the firm must engage in to
organize the activities necessary to sell their chosen product. This study may provide complementary
information to that of the findings described in previous work examining how investors utilize
information to assess likely new venture profitability (Shepherd et al. 2000). Finally, this work may
illustrate how product-form strategy is considered by angel investors and may in some cases, identify
when a firm should choose one alternative versus another to avoid rejection by investors2.
In the sections that follow, we start by presenting a theoretical framework developed as a result
of our grounded theory approach to understanding the product-form strategy decision. We then
describe the experimental vignette method (EVM) that was employed in our current study, define the
factors of importance to angel investors when deliberating about product-form strategy, test those
factors with a regression model, and provide the results. In the final section, we provide a detailed
discussion of the implications of our research for practice and research, and suggest avenues for future
research in this area.

The first author observed and recorded interactions among entrepreneurs and angel investors, which reflected a conflict
between the entrepreneurs’ chosen product-form strategy and potential investors’ preferences. In some cases, ventures
were not chosen to return for further screening because the entrepreneur would not agree to change their product-form
strategy to the preferred choice of the investors.

<-----Page 6----->2. Theory
2.1 Defining Product Form Strategy Alternatives
Product-form strategies are the means by which innovations are translated into products that are
offered to markets. These strategies often determine competitive advantages or disadvantages for the
firms. Product-form strategies are the natural starting point for early-stage technology ventures
because such ventures typically originate from one idea or invention, and they are often organized by
the activities required to sell their idea. It is during this period of development that initial firm-level
boundaries are formed.

<<<<Insert Figure 1>>>>

Figure 1 illustrates how product-form strategies also define the scope of the activities necessary to
sell the market offering. We call this the integrative-scope of the product-form. We define it as the
frame for the activities and resources required of the selling firm and consequently those required of
supply and distribution channel members. The integrative scope dimension of a product-form has the
following range: (1) Low - a strategy of selling licenses for intellectual property (IP) but not selling
goods or services, (2) Intermediate - a strategy of retaining the IP and selling components
(intermediate goods) to an immediate customer who in turn provides goods and services to others, (3)
High – a strategy of retaining the IP and selling end-user systems (both final goods and services).
More steps on this continuum may be defined. For example, components can be described as
“subcomponents,” “subsystems,” and “larger subsystems.” It is from such observations of
deliberations between angel investors, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, along with analyses of
their proposals for funding, that the continuum was developed.
Our continuum is consistent with that of John et al. (1999) who articulated a similar array of
product offerings (e.g., licenses, components and systems), which they term as “vertical positioning”.
5

<-----Page 7----->There are two important differences in the underlying theoretical dimensions of these continua. First,
the vertical positioning dimension takes the perspective of the customer(s) rather than the venture(s).
Second, the vertical positioning dimension indicates the place that a specific customer might have in a
particular value chain, but not the portion of the total value chain that the immediate customer provides
to its customers or perhaps the ultimate users. For example, from a customer’s perspective, buying a
license (“high” on the vertical positioning dimension) requires that more goods and services must be
created (by someone) than if that same customer purchased components or systems (“low” on the
vertical positioning dimension). On the other hand, from the venture’s perspective, selling licenses
(“low” on the integrative scope dimension) eliminates the need for the venture to create additional
goods and services necessary to provide end-user benefits.
Teece (1986) and Novak and Wernerfelt (2006) question when a firm will choose to “make” versus
“buy” activities required to produce elements of a good and suggest an underlying framework
identifying when we may expect to see firms with a smaller or larger scope. As product-form strategy
is also a question of “scope” at the product-level, the organizing principles of TCE provide an
appropriate starting point for understanding the venture’s decision of “what to sell”. However, unlike
the traditional “make versus buy” decision which organizes production activities, we are examining
how the organization of activities internal to the firm represent what the ventures must organize to sell
the chosen market offering to immediate customers. For example, we are not suggesting that the firm
is required to manufacture all of the elements of a component to sell a component (Ghosh et al. 2015,
John et al. 1999). Instead, the firm must only coordinate the activities required to sell the market
offering. Consider the mining equipment example again, the decision to sell GPS tracking devices (i.e.
a component strategy) does not require the firm produce all of the elements of that component.
Instead, the firm could choose to outsource some of the elements while manufacturing others.
Additionally, the firm could choose to outsource the entire production process by coordinating only the
6

<-----Page 8----->design and development but outsourcing all manufacturing to channel members. Either way, the
product-form strategy does not change. The firm has chosen to sell a component that is intended to be
integrated in mining equipment by downstream channel members. Therefore, the integrative scope of
the product or service is a decision about what activities the firm coordinates to sell a product rather
than what is chooses to produce.
2.2 Identifying unique product-form influencers among early venture firms
While prior research provides us with some guidance of how to sell an innovation; there is little
inputs for what factors are likely to affect the ‘what to sell’ decision. In the theory building research
phase, we indulged in an extensive and exhaustive qualitative phase to identify the various factors that
are likely to affect product form strategy especially among early ventures. We conducted depth
interviews and participant observation of angel screening meetings across five angel networks in the
southwestern portion of the United States. Data was gathered from entrepreneurs, angel investors, and
venture capitalists. Data are gathered before, during, and after angel screening meetings to provide
different samples of technology and to allow participants to describe current and past product-form
decisions.
In sum, our observations and interviews found that product-form strategy decisions are made
by a comparative assessment across strategies to identify how to best convert the idea into a market
offering. Our analysis revealed (as described by Corbin and Strauss 2014; DeWalt et al. 2011) three
primary mechanisms driving the product-form strategy decision include: the need for adaptation, the
need to safeguard intellectual property, and the availability of firm–level expertise related to product
development (Ghosh et al 2015).
Before we explain in detail the various influencers and the predictions, Figure 2 below provides
examples of product-form strategies taken from our participant observation of angel screening
meetings. Each example provides a brief description of (1) a venture’s technology as described by
7

<-----Page 9----->their respective entrepreneurs, (2) the attributes of the venture as described by angel investors, and (3)
the factor identified to impact the underlying theoretical mechanism revealed as a result of our
analyses of data collected in our qualitative study.

<<<<Insert Figure 2>>>>

2.2 Hypotheses
2.2.1 Influencer 1 - Modularity: The Ease of Technology Interface
Modularity is a characteristic of the technologies that ventures may employ and a factor
underlying the ease with which the final good used to generate a product can be put together without
extensive coordination effort on the part of a single firm. Specifically, it refers to the extent to which
the elements of a particular product design are interdependent within units and independent across
units (Baldwin and Clark 2000). Returning to our mining example, if the advanced GPS technology
required extensive calibration and adaptation to ensure precision among the engine components,
software system, and other navigational tools equipped within the excavator then it is likely to be more
costly to make adaptations via the market. Alternatively, if the GPS device can easily be integrated
into the current software and hardware components housed within the excavator, then the firm may
find it comparatively more costly to coordinate all of these activities internally (e.g. it will sell a
component rather than a system).
Highly modular designs enable ventures to (1) leverage greater product variety, (2) speed the
introduction of new products, and (3) lower the overall product design and development costs
(Sanchez 1996, p. 126). Because modularization requires less managerial authority and control,
effective coordination of the development processes may be achieved without the added costs of more
hierarchical governance mechanisms (Sanchez and Mahoney 1996). Furthermore, if innovations are
designed to be easier to mix-and-match at the beginning of development processes or if the elements of
8

<-----Page 10----->the innovations reside within markets where modular approaches are customary, then the innovations
are better suited to creating product variations with different bundles of functions, features, and
performance levels (Baldwin and Clark 2000). As a result, ventures operating with technologies that
offer standardized and interchangeable product designs (high modularity) will coordinate in the market
(Novak and Eppinger 2001). Thus our first hypothesis is:
Hypothesis 1: Modularity is negatively related to the integrative-scope
of product-form strategies.

2.2.2. Influencer 2 - Enforceability: Safeguarding Intellectual Property
Enforceability is a characteristic of the venture’s market environment as it relates to the
intellectual property protections afforded to a technology based upon its legal rights. It refers to the
difficulty of writing and executing a reliable contract for the use of a technology. Such contracts
require specification of property rights, monitoring activities related to the intellectual property, and
enforcement of contractual terms. The failure of any of these can become a problem and result in the
loss of valuable intellectual property. This is an especially important issue for entrepreneurs who are
often seeking investor support with little to offer other than their intellectual property (Gans and Stern
2003). Arguably, such risks of appropriation are the most salient supply-side risk to the development
and commercialization of technical knowledge (Teece 1986, Pisano 1989; Williamson 1991; 1985). In
particular, enforceability without the resources to protect technologies is critical for firms at this stage
of development.
Weak protections of technological know-how make it more difficult to transfer technology
between firms. In turn, the likelihood of leakage of valuable intellectual property (Teece 1986) and the
nature of inter-firm governance can influence efficiencies within the market (Oxley 1999). Thus, our
use of enforceability refers to the degree to which our participants perceive legal agreements to be
effectively compelling to safeguard intellectual property and contractual agreements (Henisz 2000).
9

<-----Page 11----->In circumstances were intellectual property protections are perceived to be weak; one strategy
to safeguarding technological know-how is to develop a more integrated technology commercialization
strategy (Farrell 2002; Teece 1986, p. 287). Such integrative products fortify the core intellectual
property (IP) by combining components into a system, which benefits from a unique combination of
patents and trade secrets (Baldwin and Clark 2000). These are valuable strategies because evidence
suggests that intellectual property rights enforceability varies widely across markets and product-forms
(Henisz 2000; Henisz and Macher 2004; Brouthers et al. 2003)3. Consequently, a lack of
enforceability causes an increase in the costs of coordinating within the market relative to internal
coordination (Oxley 1999). Thus, a high level of integrative product scope (e.g. a systems strategy) is
relatively more cost efficient when the enforceability of intellectual property is weak. We propose that
in markets with weak property rights protection more integrative products safeguard a venture’s
defense against appropriation. Therefore, more integrative product-forms will be chosen when the
enforcement of intellectual property rights is weak.
Hypothesis 2: The enforceability of intellectual property rights (safeguarding) is
negatively related to the integrative-scope of product-form strategy.
2.2.3

Influencer 3 - Resources: The Ability to Develop and Market the Product
A firm’s product development resources (PDR) refer to its stock of assets that enable it to

undertake the design, development, production, and marketing activities related to the final endproduct (Ghosh et al. 2015). This resource stock could include non-imitable and firm-specific
activities, routines, and structures such as involving internal marketing and technical people, and
external suppliers in product design & development, a venture team with cross-functional expertise
hired to design and develop products that solve complex customer-side problems, and developing an

3

Recent patent reform proposals have drawn heated debates between industry lobbyists arguing for and against measures to
increase enforceability; these debates suggest that some industry-level executives are dissatisfied with their current ability
to protect innovation within their prospective industries. See Patent Reform Act of 2013.

10

<-----Page 12----->information infrastructure to enable more effective dialogue between members of these teams as well
as suppliers, potential customers, and investors. They are defined as the processes and mechanisms in
place to collaborate, design, and market a technology and they allow a venture to design their product
and generate market value (Barney 1991). In our context, this asset often stems from the ability to map
user-needs as tangible product development capabilities (Moorman and Slotegraff 1999). This often
results in a continuous dialogue between engineering (e.g. design) and marketing (e.g. development
strategy) experts working in combination for the purpose of new product development. Specifically,
the key task of creating and marketing a final end-product falls on the firm who has to undertake a set
of core activities that include: (a) choosing the design and development of the technology and aesthetic
architecture (b) organizing the production and supply of required components and constituent parts and
their assembly into the final end-product, and (c) undertaking marketing and related channel activities
to sell the end-customers.
Madhok (2002) suggests that firms will develop and deploy these resources and capabilities in
search of a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the ability to develop and market a technology lends
credibility and influence to the likelihood of the venture’s success (Sudek 2006). For early-stage
ventures, these product development resources may come in the form of a member of the
entrepreneurial team with a background in both sales and engineering, or an interdisciplinary
background with successful product launches in the past. Such resources can also be beneficial for
direct customer interaction, dialogue, and building relationships during early-development stages of
the venture. They are indicators of the firm’s advantage relative to competitors and can be used as a
mechanism to generate increased value for the venture (Wernerfelt 1984). Finally, this type of
knowledge-based asset may be particularly beneficial for superior market performance (Vargo and
Lusch 2008; 2004; Miller and Shamsie 1996). As such, ventures possessing these resources are may
be better able to design and develop end-user technologies (i.e. systems strategy). Thus we argue that
11

<-----Page 13----->ventures with extensive product development resources are better able to economize on their
transactions costs related to the development of the final end-product. Consequently, we predict that
more integrative product-form strategies will be chosen by firms with high levels of product
development resources (PDR).
Hypothesis 3: Product development resources (PDR) are positively related
to the integrative-scope of product-form strategy.

See Figure 3 for a model identifying the hypothesized relationships among these mechanisms and their
implications for product-form strategy.
<<<<Insert Figure 3>>>>
3. Method
3.1 Overview
To understand how these mechanisms may impact product-form strategy decisions, we
followed the approach used by Wathne et al. (2001) and developed a full factorial, within-subjects
research design intended to provide maximum statistical power (Green and Srinivasan 1990). We
employed experimental vignettes of venture scenarios designed to be similar to those observed during
our qualitative examination of product-form strategy (Aguinis and Bradley 2014). The responses to
these vignettes were analyzed to explicitly test the theory presented above. We also explored the data
for potential aspects of the theory that were not specified in the hypotheses.
3.2 Source of Data: Angel Investors
We selected a set of expert participants (Wiklund and Shepherd 2008) for this study who are
angel investors that focus on high technology, early-stage ventures. Angel investors are excellent
study participants for this research for a number of reasons. For instance, in addition to funding, they
often provide managerial expertise needed for a venture to become a revenue generating business
(Degennaro 2010a; Bygrave and Reynolds 2004). This expertise comes from their own experiences
12

<-----Page 14----->launching companies, their industry experiences with established firms and from previous deals in
which they have participated. According to Hudson (2014), active angel investors have spent 14 years
as entrepreneurs and have founded 3 companies. In contrast, entrepreneurs typically had been
involved in fewer ventures, developed only 1 or 2 innovations and have less commercialization
expertise (Gans and Stern 2003). Angel investors provide billions of dollars annually to twenty times
the number of early-stage companies as venture capitalists (Hudson 2014). Additionally, angel
investors reported screening many applications, in some cases over 100 applicants per month.

3.3 Data Collection: Experimental Vignette Method (EVM)
Gathering data from angel investors presents some special challenges. First, investors may
utilize differing factors to determine how to best structure an investment (i.e. entrepreneur likeability,
industry experience, prior sales). Second, investors may have some reluctance to share knowledge that
they may consider to be part of their competitive advantage as investors. Third, the behavior about
which we are inquiring is typically a result of implicit processes that are not easily explicated. Indeed,
some investors report that most of their decisions were made by ‘gut’ or a ‘hunch’. A method for
dealing with such challenges is the use of experimental vignettes. This is an increasingly popular
approach to examining causal relationships in business research (Aguinis and Bradley 2014; Atzmüller
and Steiner 2010).
Following the approach taken by Shepherd et al. (2000) we used angel investors, venture
capitalists, business executives, and entrepreneurs to evaluate and develop the vignettes, while utilizing
a separate sample for study participants. This development process is particularly critical for ensuring
realistic scenarios in practice (Scandura and Williams 2000). Consequently, using all of these
resources and the insights from our exploratory research, we gave investors realistic contextual
information while controlling for factors outside the primary focus of our study (Raaijmakers et al.
2014). The venture scenarios are plausible and similar to those encountered in real angel investor
13

<-----Page 15----->screening meetings (consistent with Roehling 1999; Woehr and Lance 1991). Study participants were
given information about the scenario venture’s growth potential (Mason and Stark 2004), market
dynamics (Bachher and Guild 1996), market size (Sudek 2006), supply and distribution resources
(Winborg and Landström 2001, level of technological superiority of the product (Roure and Keeley
1990), and scalability (DeGennaro 2010b)4. Additionally, our exploratory research found that angel
investors normally evaluate about 3-10 proposals per meeting, thus we believe our choice of eight
vignettes provides a realistic exercise. Finally, where possible, we included different images and
colors to improve the readability and engagement of the vignettes (Aguinis and Bradley 2014).
3.4 Manipulations, Measures, and Controls
3.4.1

Experimental Design
A full factorial design of the three factors (modularity (H1), the enforcement of intellectual

property protection (H2) and product development resources (H3) each varied at two levels (high and
low) resulted in eight vignettes. The specific description of the low and high level of each factor as
operationalized in the vignette is described below.
The levels of modularity of the technology were:
High: Design features make this technology easy to interface with other
complementary innovations.
Low: Design features make this technology difficult to interface with other
complementary innovations.
The levels of legal enforceability of intellectual property were:
High: Industry and legal environments provide strong protections for the venture’s
intellectual property.
Low: Industry and legal environments provide weak protections for the venture’s
intellectual property.
The levels of product development resources (PDR) were:
High: The venture has extensive capabilities to collaborate, develop, and market
4

Although these factors have previously been shown to impact angel decision-making (Maxwell et al. 2011), many such
control variables become more important during subsequent stages of the angel screening process.

14

<-----Page 16----->technology intensive products.
Low: The venture has few capabilities to collaborate, develop, and market technology
intensive products.

3.4.2

Measures

After reading each vignette, the participants were asked to respond using two separate measurement
scales. The first scale is a choice among three broad alternatives that closely reflect the terminology
commonly used among angel investors. These alternatives are:
A System is a high level of integrative scope and is defined as a combination of different
components, which have been integrated into a plug-and-play device. Additionally, this
product-form strategy required “architecture” to ensure the components were properly
integrated.
A Component is a middle level of integrative scope and is defined as a part or element of a
larger composite system that needs to interact with other complementary parts and elements to
generate its greatest value potential (as determined by the customer).
A License is a low level of integrative scope and is defined as a “licensing agreement”
transferring technology/IP/know-how to another independent party, on an exclusive or nonexclusive right for a pre-specified period of time.
Subsequently we will refer to this scale as the product-form scale. The second response employed a
seven-point Likert scale indicating the level of integrative scope that should be chosen for
commercialization. This is subsequently referred to as the Integrative Scope scale. Figure 1 presents
these two scales. The specific wording to describe systems, components and licenses is presented in
the Appendix.
3.4.3

Minimizing noise through experimental control
We employed vignettes that describe each venture as having a “high-technology product with

significant potential for growth in consumer and business applications.” These vignettes were new to
the participants (i.e. not abstracted from an actual company), but were created to represent a scenario
similar to those observed during screening meetings. These vignettes were also not presented to
participants’ interviewed in the previous study.
15

<-----Page 17----->We excluded specific references to any particular industry or technology market to alleviate
potential biases from participants’ previous experiences (Shepherd et al. 2000). We also excluded any
discussion of the entrepreneur’s personal characteristics because although previous studies identify the
importance of personality and other individual characteristics (e.g. Mason and Stark 2004; Sudek
2006), participants could not make accurate judgments of an entrepreneur’s characteristics (e.g.
trustworthiness, passion) from a scenario-based study (Maxwell et. al. 2011). Furthermore, we
excluded financial projections from our vignettes. While actual proposal submissions to angel
networks typically contain five-year financial projections our angel investor participants described
such financial projections as conjecture, which is assumed to be grossly inaccurate and is largely
ignored in their decisions to invest. This was particularly true for ventures with no sales at the time of
the investment screening5. Another reason to exclude this type of information is to help avoid
information processing biases and cognitive overload.
3.5 Pretest
After initial review and adjustment, the vignettes were structured as paper booklets (similar to
those observed during screening meetings) presented for comments to the executive directors of two
angel networks, to several angel investors and also to the CFO of a venture capital firm. Based upon
their feedback we made revisions and then provided the revised vignettes for follow-up review. Once
these recommended adjustments were made, we developed both a paper booklet and a digital version
of the vignettes to ease the participation process for the investors.
3.6 Sampling
We initially recruited approximately 100 participants actively engaged with accredited angel
investor networks in the Southwest region of the United States. From those 100 participants, 26

5

According to our participation observation, entrepreneurs typically pitch their venture as profitable within two years of the
requested investment and describe exponential revenue growth in their five-year projections.

16

<-----Page 18----->investors completed all eight vignettes. Participants’ reported an average of twenty years of industry
experience and an average of 7 investments. Some participants had invested in as few as 3 early-stage
ventures and others greater than 20. The repeated measures approach (multiple vignettes) allows for
the collection of a relatively large amount of information from the participants (Hughes and Huby
2002). This approach is particularly beneficial for situations such as ours where the population (i.e.
angel investors) is often difficult to access by researchers (Aguinis & Bradley 2014).
3.6.1

Sample Validity
The order of presentation of the eight vignettes was randomized between participants. In all

conditions, the respondent was asked to consider these vignettes in the same way that he or she would
evaluate “real” proposals in screening meetings. Since these respondents routinely evaluated actual—
albeit prospective—investment proposals on similar criteria, we believe fictitious scenarios are parallel
to their typical activities as angel investors evaluating the future potential of a venture (Aguinis and
Bradley 2014). To enhance the context realism of this task, the first author, when possible, collected
the experimental data during angel screenings meetings (consistent with Aguinis and Lawal 2012).
3.6.2 Respondent Reliability
An assessment of the appropriate level of the integrative scope for product-form strategies is a
subjective judgment regardless of whether it is of vignettes or actual proposals. As a result, it is
important to consider a participant’s reliability (Aguinis and Bradley 2014). Reliability is essentially
the degree to which a judge is consistent in repeated evaluations of the same thing. This can reflect the
judge’s degree of comprehension of the phenomena being evaluated and/or the degree of attention that
the judge is devoting to the task. Following Aguinis and Bradley (2014), we examined reliability using
duplicate vignettes randomly presented to some of the participants. A simple comparison of the
agreement between the first and the duplicate responses provided by the participants was applied
(100% through 0% agreement). Seventy-six percent of the participants were consistent, 12% were
17

<-----Page 19----->partially consistent and 12% were completely inconsistent. As a result, data from the three
inconsistent (not reliable) participants were removed (Aguinis and Bradley 2014). The remaining
participants have an average of 87% consistency. The data were then screened for outliers and five
observations (3%) were removed because they adversely influenced the stability of the relationships
among the variables.
3.6.2

Dependent Measures Validity

The two measures of product-form strategy described above were compared to investigate their
validity. The partial correlation (controlling for differences among participants) between these two
measures is .92 (p < .001). This supports the presumption that they are alternative measures of the
integrative-scope of the product-form strategy dimension. In our subsequent analysis we employed
both forms of measurement in an effort to provide greater robustness to the results and to identify
results that may be sensitive to the differences in these scales of measurement.
3.7 Tests of Hypotheses
The test of the hypotheses was performed using ordinary least squares regression, controlling
for differences among the participants and employing separately the integrative-scope scale and the
product-form scale (reported individually in Table 1). The overall models are significant for both
forms of measurement (p-values < .001) and they account for 16.6% and 23.4% of the variance for the
integrative-scope and the product-form scales respectively.
<<<< Insert Table 1 Here>>>>
All of the hypotheses from the model were supported both in terms of their significance and in the
direction of their signs. Modularity (H1) is found to have a negative effect on both the integrative
scope and product-form strategy measures (standardized 𝛽̂ = -.180; p < .009 and 𝛽̂ = -.263; p < .000),
indicating that when the process of interfacing complementary innovations is relatively easy and less
18

<-----Page 20----->costly (i.e., modularity is high) then ventures should sell products with low levels of integrative scope
(i.e., licenses). Enforceability (H2) also has a negative effect for both measures of integrative scope
and product-form strategy (standardized 𝛽̂ = -.164; p < .016 and 𝛽̂ = -.251; p < .000), indicating that
less integrative product-form strategies (licenses) should be adopted if the environment has a high level
of enforceability (strong IP rights protection). Product development resources (H3) is found to have a
positive effect (standardized 𝛽̂ = .345; p < .000 and 𝛽̂ = .339; p < .000). This suggests that a venture
with a high level of new product development resources should sell more integrative goods (e.g., final
goods and systems).
3.8 Explanatory Framework: Exploration of Interactions
Our model as shown in Figure 3 makes main effect predictions, but given the nature of the
research design (full factorial) design we are also able to investigate potential interactions. Results
from a generalized linear model (GLM) revealed that the addition of four interaction terms increased
the adjusted R-square values for these models to .202 and .277. However, only the interaction of
modularity by enforcement was found to be significant (standardized 𝛽̂ = -1.88, p < .040) when the
integrative-scope scale was employed. When the product-form scale was employed, the interactions
between Modularity and Enforcement and also Modularity and Product Development Resources
(PDR) were significant (p < .015 and .023 respectively). Please see Table 2.
<<<<Insert Table 2 Here>>>>
The difference in the results between the two forms of measurement may reflect the fact that the
integrative-scope scale is not based on the common industry terminology or the language used during
angel screening meetings. Thus the participants may have been more uncertainty about the integrative
scope scale which employs numerical scale values. In contrast, the product-form scale closely matches
the conceptualization and terminology expressed by the angel investors. This terminology (e.g.
“components” and “systems”) is typical of terms used in international engineering standards
19

<-----Page 21----->(according to the IEEE Computer Society: Standard 1220-2005 aka ISO/IEC 26702). Since many of
the participants have previously worked in various engineering-related roles, perhaps this terminology
is more meaningful to them.
The interactions provide additional insights about the relationships between these variables and
suggest that the evaluation process for early-stage ventures is a complex decision. For example, when
the venture is operating with modular technology, but has extensive product development resources,
the participants prefer less integrative product forms. This suggests that although the product
development resources may provide an advantage for the firm, it may be less costly for the firm to sell
a less integrative product.
4. Discussion
Product-form strategies have critical implications for both marketing and firm strategy. For
early-stage ventures this decision identifies where the firm will participate in the supply chain and the
necessary resources and relationships required to sell a product. Both angel investors and
entrepreneurs make deliberate decisions about how to effectively commercialize an idea as an
exchangeable market offering. Impacting that decision are three driving mechanisms: the ease with
which the final good can be put together without proactive coordination efforts by a single firm (i.e.
modularity), the perception of the strength of the venture’s intellectual property (i.e. enforcement), and
the possession of intangible expertise and/or skills allowing for improved dissemination and utilization
of information related to product development activities (i.e. resources).
This study extends our understanding of product-line level decisions and lends support to a
mid-level theory extending a stream of research founded in transaction cost economics (TCE) and the
resource-based view (RBV) of the firm (Ghosh and John 1999) to identify the driving forces behind
product “scope”. As the product-form strategy choices themselves are a reflection of the scope of the
activities the firm chooses to be responsible for when deciding what to sell in the marketplace, our
20

<-----Page 22----->findings suggest experts may use similar principals to that of the traditional “make versus buy”
principals illustrated in TCE (Coase 1960; Williamson 1985; Teece 1986).
Furthermore, the results of this study may also have implications for the work of Cabigiosu and
Camuffo (2012) and Novak and Wernerfelt (2006), which consider how the underlying mechanisms
associated with a combinative lens of TCE and RBV impact industry structure. Notably, our work
identifies where early-stage ventures, with one idea to commercialize, may operate in the supply chain
however, this position may change for firms selling more than one product.
We identify integrative-scope as a critical dimension of product-form strategy and suggest that
a broader examination of product-form strategy for other related dimensions is important to add clarity
to this rudimentary examination of this strategic decision. Since prior research suggests angel
investors paradoxically prefer “to support products that solve a real customer problem and preferably
are not marketing intensive” (DeGennaro 2010a, p. 17) this is particularly important for marketing
strategy. Furthermore, since our study explicitly focuses on product development related resources
and how they impact the “what to sell” decision it is illustrative of the importance of marketing
resources for understanding product “scope” and firm-level boundaries for early-stage ventures.
With regard to the driving mechanisms of product-form strategy, we find that modularity and
enforceability of intellectual property rights have negative impacts on the integrative scope of productform strategies. This suggests investors would prefer that ventures sell less integrative products (e.g.
licensed technology or components) rather than systems when the firm’s technologies easily interface
with other technologies (i.e. high modularity) and when the perception of intellectual property
protection is strong (i.e. high enforceability). This supports the notion that a comparative assessment
of costs across product-form strategies reflects situations where the market is less costly than internal
coordination of activities (Jacobides and Winter 2005). Alternatively, when investors perceived a

21

<-----Page 23----->venture to have a comparatively high level of product development resources stemming from expertise
of the management team than more integrative product-forms were preferred (e.g. a system strategy).
Finally, we also found a moderating relationship between modularity and enforceability
suggesting that investors perceive less integrative product-form strategies to be preferable when
modularity and enforceability of intellectual property protections are high. Similarly, our exploratory
examination of the relationship between modularity and product development resources suggests that
even when ventures have extensive product development resources (PDR) they continue to choose less
integrative product-form strategies. This has important implications for our understanding of the scope
of the product because previous studies suggest firm scope is synonymous with product-level scope
(Novak and Eppinger 2001: Sanchez and Mahoney 1996).
5. Managerial Implications
Our emphasis within this new venture context is to understand the ‘what to sell’ decision. That
is, to identify the most effective strategy for converting an idea into a form that is exchangeable in the
market. Our results suggest that investors utilize a series of criteria to determine where early-stage
ventures should participate in the value chain and that understanding these heuristics is important for
both investors and entrepreneurs. For investors, this may illustrate some of the reasons behind venture
failures and successes. For example, for ventures selling technology positioned to be sold as
licenses—which may have been better suited for selling a component—our research findings may
provide insights for future investments. Due to the importance of investors, especially angel investors
in early-stage funding and their level of obscurity as private investors, our findings add to an important
discussion of how entrepreneurs in the seed/startup stage of development (Maxwell et al 2011; Sohl
2003) can appropriately pitch their invention to investors. As a result, the heuristic utilized by angel
investors in determining how an entrepreneur should commercialize their technology is revealed in the
choices made by the investors in our study.
22

<-----Page 24----->This is important for two reasons. First, our depth interviews with angel investors revealed that
none of them had an explicit framework for decision-making. Instead, the investors reported that most
of their decisions regarding commercialization strategy and whether to invest were based on implicit
gut feelings or hunches. Consequently, our study provides an explicit framework to explain their
hunches and also suggests the entrepreneur may or may not have a “matching” strategic choice in mind
with regard to their preferred product-form strategy. Second, this work provides a framework for
entrepreneurs when they examine their own venture. Presumably, a better understanding of the
heuristics utilized by angel investors during their screening meetings would also provide entrepreneurs
the opportunity to enhance their actual pitch to potential investors prior to the initial screening meeting.
In particular, prior research suggests investors used an abbreviated model for decision-making likely
due to the time restrictions and large number of investment proposals to be considered (Tversky 1972).
Coupled with the near impossibility of acquiring investment capital in various sectors (Holaday et al.
2003), it is important for entrepreneurs to guard against any potential early rejection by understanding
how their proposed product-form strategy may be a factor used to “weed out” investments.
6. Limitations and Future Research
This study is limited by several factors. First, we tested our hypotheses in one particular
context, namely new, early-stage technology ventures seeking funding from angel investors.
Additionally, we controlled for industry and technology-specific information. This was done for
several reasons: (1) we wanted the angel investors to use a compensatory decision model in making
their assessments, which allows for only a few variables to be included, (2) we wanted to alleviate bias
resulting from personal experiences, expertise, and preferences for a technology and product markets
and (3) we wanted to test the measures emerging from our grounded theory research (Glaser and
Strauss 1967). While this approach does not present real scenarios for the participants, we argue that
this approach is most appropriate for this context (i.e., angel investors). Further, since this is the initial
23

<-----Page 25----->test of our theory of product-form strategy we limited the number of factors examined in this study.
Nonetheless, it is reasonable to suggest caution—during the normal course of business—as these
contextual factors would likely impact the commercialization strategy recommended by the investors.
Second, although the vignette approach possesses several distinct advantages, it simplifies the
phenomenon of interest. For example, we treat modularity as a one-dimensional technological factor,
but other dimensions of the technology may also influence product-form strategies, such as
complexity, innovativeness, and diversity (Singh 1997; Nagarajan and Mitchell 1998). Similarly, in
our exploratory results modularity significantly interacts with intellectual property rights enforcement
and product development resources. Thus it is reasonable to assume that these factors can be
influenced by other factors as well. Future studies could examine how other factors may impact
product-form strategy success and/or whether established firms choosing to diversify among current
product offerings may have an impact on the focal product-form strategy.
Next, future research could greatly expand upon our initial framework to explore other aspects
of the venture’s business model and commercialization strategy. For example, concerns about internal
manufacturing versus outsourcing (e.g. make-versus-buy) may impact optimal product-form strategies.
Presumably the decision to sell a component, for example, would need to be followed by decisions
about whether the venture is going to create all of the necessary ingredients internally, or purchase
some or all from the market. As an example, consider an early-stage venture with angel support
looking to sell a hardware component. Our results suggest this product-form strategy because the
venture is operating with a technology that is perceived to have a high level of intellectual property
enforceability. However, one could imagine the case where the component was a radical departure
from current technology and although the intellectual property is easily protected, the venture cannot
sell its technology to a downstream manufacturer for integration with their component because of the
incompatibility of platforms (Baldwin and Clark 2000; Teece and Pisano 1994). As a result, the
24

<-----Page 26----->venture may have to sell a more integrative product by purchasing other components and completing
the integration internally or look for a joint venture to assist in the development process (Henderson
and Clark 1990).
Finally, our study provides a single lens for examining product-form strategy— angel investors.
Although prior research suggests angels are typically the business “experts” in the venture team (Gans
and Stern 2003), entrepreneurs could also provide a compelling account of the critical aspects of their
technology, their venture team, their presumed market of entry, and the regulatory environment, which
may impact the appropriate product-form strategy. Entrepreneurs typically pitch technologies sold as
systems. Of the 40 ventures we observed, 34 were pitched by entrepreneurs as systems due to their
perceived ability to generate the highest margin of return. Four ventures were pitched as components
and the two remaining ventures were pitched as potential licensed technologies. Upon observing these
screenings, we found seven entrepreneurs were asked to alter their product-form strategy to less
integrative product-forms. Our discussions with entrepreneurs revealed they believed selling systems
would allow them to sell their technology at a higher price point and consequently, selling “bundled”
goods leads to more profits. Angel investors, however, noted that those particular ventures were not
suited to sell as systems due to such factors as the technological capabilities, resources of the venture,
and limited intellectual property protections (thus our theoretical framework). Both licensing and
component strategy were observed as the viable alternatives in those cases. This could be a result of
their level of expertise as investors or a particular expertise in the relevant industry (Wiklund and
Shepherd 2008).
7. Conclusion
This study contributes to the literature in three important ways. First, it empirically tests
emergent influencers of early-stage ventures decisions of “what to sell” via the angel investment
evaluation process. This provides the first experimental examination of product-form strategy. It
25

<-----Page 27----->extends work that explores the impact of alternative cost assessments on the firm’s boundaries
(Jacobides and Winter 2005; Novak and Eppinger 2001, Gans and Stern 2003) by considering this
comparative evaluation at the product level. Second, this study contributes to the literature examining
angel investment processes. Specifically, prior studies related to how angel investors evaluate firm
strategy and the factors impacting the firm’s decision of ‘what to sell’ have largely been ignored.
Third, this study extends and lends empirical support for recent work examining resource-based and
transaction cost theories in marketing (John et al. 1999; Ghosh and John 1999); by examining how the
need for adaptation and safeguarding intellectual property, along with differential resource profiles
may impact the effective strategy for converting an idea into a market offering.
