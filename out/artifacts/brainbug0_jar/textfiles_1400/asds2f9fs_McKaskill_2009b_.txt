Raising Angel & Venture
Capital Finance
An entrepreneur’s
guide to securing
venture finance

<-----Page 1----->Angels and Venture Capital firms are in the
business of generating a high rate of return on
their investment, not in creating or building
businesses.
To be successful, the investor needs to achieve
an exit of their investment within three to five
years and that means planning the exit strategy
from day one.
The strategic trade sale is the preferred
investment exit method.
The business plan sets out the operational
detail of how the firm will create the necessary
conditions for achieving the exit for the
investor.
If you can’t create the necessary platform for
an Initial Public Offering, you are going to have
to sell your business.

‘Early-stage investing is all about finding and nurturing a nugget of value with
the goal of presenting the improved value for acquisition by a company in whose
hands that value can continue to grow and reward. Investors need entrepreneurs
who want to build and sell such companies. While they often share the same
goal, investors and entrepreneurs frequently struggle to understand each others’
perspective. These are the myriad deals that don’t fail, they never happen because
of a basic failure to communicate.
With his usual clarity, Tom explains the investor’s thinking to an entrepreneur
and offers a practical guide to preparing for and pursuing such investors.’

ew entrepreneurs succeed in raising Angel or Venture Capital
finance. Many business owners don’t bother to apply
knowing that they won’t be successful. Others simply don’t need it and have
an operation capable of generating the free cash flow they need to grow their
business. Only a very few are able to meet the requirements of the Angel or
Venture Capital (VC) fund and succeed in getting an injection of funds.
However, this type of funding is not a recipe for success. Around 50% of Angel
investments are in ventures which fail. More than 20% of VC investments are
written off and at least a further 20% fail to achieve their target returns. On the
other hand, Angels and VC funds do succeed in picking winners and spectacular
returns have been achieved in a limited number of deals.
Over the period 1978 to 1999, I was fortunate to have raised venture capital
twice. The first time involved a software firm in the UK which I started in 1978
with two partners. By 1984, we recognised we needed to acquire one of our
software suppliers to be able to control the direction of software development
we were dependent on. We spent more than 12 months walking the streets of
London looking for venture capital to finance the acquisition.
Eventually we were successful in raising US$1.5 million for 20% of our equity
from a corporate venture fund. A few years into the new structure, the business
was in trouble. Our investor was acquired and our investment did not fit in with
the investment objectives of the new owners. We were successful in buying back
most of the shares of the VC fund for about US$30,000. A few years later, with
160 employees, 16 distributors and more than 4,500 customers, we sold out to
a US-listed software company for US$9.6 million. Had the VC fund stayed in, it
would have made a positive return on its money, although not the ROI it would
have liked.
After working for the acquiring corporation in the US for three years, I formed
a new firm, building supply chain optimisation software. We started with 12
people from the former firm which meant that we had a proven development
team and proven management. After spending two years building the first
modules of the new suite of products, a small company called Red Pepper sold
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

xv

<-----Page 15----->optimised scheduling software was purchased by Peoplesoft for something like
23 times revenue. Recognising that we were in a boom market we set out to
raise venture capital.
This time I was wiser, with some prior success and a proven team. However, I
still spent nine months going from VC fund to VC fund trying to raise US$2 million.
I discovered that the VC funds all specialised in industry, investment stage, size
of deal and location. However, rather than miss out on the next Microsoft, they
would still see you – just in case. Finally, we raised US$2 million from a corporate
venture capital fund for 20% of the equity.
Two years later, we had used up most of the money and had achieved little.
The market proved much more difficult than we expected. The early indications of
a boom market were not realised and several firms in the sector were in trouble.
SAP, the world’s largest application software provider, then announced a full suite
of products in our sector, quickly followed by similar announcements by their
major competitors. Most of these products were ‘in development’.
Soon our prospects had essentially disappeared. We were faced with
dramatically reducing the size of the business or selling out. We decided to sell
out. Within a few weeks we had eight firms interested in buying and a week later
received an offer from Peoplesoft at six times revenue. The VC fund came out in
front with a reasonable return.
When I returned to Australia in 2001, I was appointed Professor of
Entrepreneurship at the Australian Graduate School of Entrepreneurship. Over
the next few years I had time to reflect back over 20 years’ experience as an
entrepreneur over four different ventures. I also had the opportunity of working
with many start-up ventures and with several venture capital firms. Certainly, in
the past 30 years, the venture capital market has matured. There are now many
Venture Capital Funds or General Partners in the US, UK and Australia with many
investments to their credit. We all now have a much better idea of what it takes for
a new venture to be successful, although we still don’t have the secret to success.
More recently I have become active in an Angel Group and have been involved
in educating Angels on selecting and exiting investments. One thing which is now
very clear to me is that the objectives of the Angel and VC fund are rarely the same
as the entrepreneur seeking venture capital. It is only when the entrepreneur
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

xvi

<-----Page 16----->understands that he or she has to tailor the venture to meet the requirements of
the investor, and not the other way around, that the parties have a real chance
of succeeding.
The objective of this book is to show the entrepreneur how they can create
a business which matches the investment objectives of the Angel or VC fund. In
doing so, there is a high probability of raising finance. Venture capital is not for
everyone no matter how profitable the venture might be. Angels and VC funds
are not in the business of solving an entrepreneur’s need for funding albeit that
may be the outcome. They are simply there to achieve a high rate of return for
themselves, their investors or limited investment partners. The entrepreneur
who understands this and builds a proposal to meet their objectives, should be
much more successful in gaining Angel or Venture Capital finance.

A very large number of people have contributed to my knowledge of this topic.
Hundreds of entrepreneurs who have been through my classes and workshops,
Angels who have attended my training sessions and discussed their investee
firms with me and VC executives I have worked with on exit strategies for their
investee firms. Each conversation, question and problem has helped me refine
my knowledge of Angel and VC finance.
My life partner, Katalin Johnson, has been with me every step of the way,
participated in the seminars, workshops and most of the conversations. She has
assisted me greatly by asking the hard questions, reviewing the material and
making her own contribution to the content.

very entrepreneur I know expects to build a winning business. Whether
it is the business they have right now or the next one they have in their
plans, they hope, one day, to get it right. They are optimists. Fortunately for
all of us, they are prepared to risk their savings and their time to have a go
because without their drive, creativity and perseverance, many of today’s large
corporations would not be in existence.
One could also say the same about Angel and Venture Capital funding.
Without their funding and active involvement, many of the successful companies
of today would have floundered. This partnership between entrepreneurs and
private equity capital has created significant wealth for both parties and, along
the way, many jobs, new innovative products and a major source of export
earnings. However, it is a very small part of overall private enterprise capital
and the chances of a successful outcome are only fair.
Because of all the public relations and hype around venture capital, we are
left with the impression that it is a major contributor to business growth and
job creation but the truth is that it is relatively insignificant in overall terms.
Only about 1 in 10,000 private firms will have independent private equity at any
point it time and only about 1 in 20 firms seeking external private equity will be
successful in receiving it. So why is it seen to be an important factor in business
development?
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 20----->Chapter 1: A Wealth Creation Partnership

The answer is found in the role that private equity plays in early stage, high
growth ventures. To appreciate that role, we must first understand what it is
and how it works.
There are various forms of independent private equity. Angels typically
provide finance for very immature ventures. Formal Venture Capital funds
tend to undertake deals in the business expansion to late stage of venture
development. The large Private Equity funds invest in mature businesses which
are undertaking a reorganization through a management buyout or are aiming
for a public listing. Even the terminology is somewhat confusing. In some markets
the term venture capital refers to any independent private equity investment,
especially from investment funds, while in others the term refers to different
types of investment. In more established markets, such as the USA, Venture
Capital refers to seed, early stage and some expansion capital, while Private
Equity normally refers to late stage, mezzanine, buy out and management buy
out or leveraged larger scale investments.
Collectively the term Private Equity (PE) can be used to cover all forms of
independent investments. In this book, the term Venture Capital (VC) will
be used to refer to the form of private equity most often raised by emerging
enterprises, that is, those seeking funds from business Angels or Venture Capital
Funds to develop their business concept or to support the initial growth phase.
The common feature of VC investments is that they provide business finance
in relatively high risk situations where other forms of finance, such as bank loans
or lines of credit are not available. Because there is a high risk, high reward
element in these deals, there are both significant failures as well as spectacular
successes. It is mostly the long term successes which give the VC sector its
reputation.
Private equity fills a gap in the market of business finance, however, it is
very focused and, therefore, the vast majority of businesses do not satisfy
the investment criteria. Private equity investors are seeking opportunities for
returns well above what an average public equity investment would achieve.
They accept that the investment will be tied up for some time and the venture
they are investing in is of a somewhat risky nature. They look for investments

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 21----->Chapter 1: A Wealth Creation Partnership

which have the potential for very high rewards. These ventures will always have
a high growth potential component. That, in itself, means these ventures are
unusual as only a very small percentage of businesses ever succeed in reaching
a few million dollars in revenue.
To generate a high return, lets say in excess of 20% per annum, the venture
has to have the possibility of generating high revenue growth or creating
significant strategic value. This potential exists in only a very small percentage of
early stage businesses. The vast majority of high growth potential ventures are
unable to inherently generate enough cash to fuel their business development
plans, thus creating the opportunity for private equity investors to participate.
Without private equity, most of these ventures would fail or never realize their
potential.
This is the genesis of the entrepreneur/private equity partnership. These
two parties come together to create something which neither could do by
themselves. In doing so, they have the opportunity of creating a business
venture which can generate significant rewards for both. This is the place where
the entrepreneur accepts that a small part of a larger pie is better than no pie at
all or a much smaller pie which is not getting bigger. It is also a place where the
parties have to work together to be successful. As we will see in later chapters,
that is not without it challenges as these ventures tend to push the envelope and
risks, disruptions, delays and surprises are the norm rather than the exception.
The Private Equity market is much misunderstood by the average
entrepreneur. They have little understanding of the structure of the
private equity market and tend to see it as one size fits all - ‘Venture
Capital’ without appreciating the different forms of private equity. Most
start-up entrepreneurs see Venture Capital as the solution to all their
problems. Venture Capital it seems is simply there for the taking – if only they
can have those few minutes to pitch their groundbreaking idea. The limitations
of lack of experience, a yet to be completed product in a yet to be proven
market seem to be small hurdles whichthe venture capital firm can surely solve
for them. However, few really understand how these funds work and very few
understand the impact that taking the money will have on themselves, their
businesses or their future.
Most entrepreneurs seek VC to solve a funding problem. They seem to think
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

4

<-----Page 22----->Chapter 1: A Wealth Creation Partnership

that the purpose of VC is to solve their problems, whatever they might be, and that
access to money is the key to success. Almost as if throwing money at their great
idea will solve any basic flaws in the idea. In high growth firms there are usually
lots of constraints to growing the business and lots of places where additional
funds could be usefully directed. This might be to complete a research project,
launch a new product into the market, build out an executive team, expand the
capacity of the business or its market presence and so on. In their quest for Angel
or VC finance, the entrepreneur often thinks that by solving their own problems
they will automatically provide a good investment for the VC investor.
However, few have ever thought of the specific needs of the Investor and what
they want out of the investment or what limitations, constraints and motivations
they work under. While they understand that the return sought by Investors is
higher than say a bank, they have little appreciation of the risks that Investors take
and how they manage those risks or what this means in terms of how they judge
applicants or negotiate the investment agreement. Successful entrepreneurs who
have taken a business to an IPO or made substantial personal wealth through
an Angel or VC backed venture often only experience the good times and are
more than willing to recommend this form of equity finance. However, a portion
of Angel and VC backed ventures fail or end in disappointment for both the
entrepreneur and the Investor. Investors anticipate some level of failure and
manage their investee firms accordingly as they have learnt over time to take a
hands-on approach to their investments.
Entrepreneurs who have raised Angel or VC funds have often been confronted
with a whole range of issues which they have not experienced before, or were
not expecting. Often to the surprise of the founder, the Investor insists on a
formal Board, a say in the strategy, a veto over certain operating decisions and
regular financial and operational reports. In addition, the investment agreement
or shareholders agreement may contain clauses which mean that, in certain
circumstances, the entrepreneur can be dismissed and their business sold from
under them.
This all sounds very painful for the entrepreneur – so why bother? What is
missing in this scenario is an educated entrepreneur who understands how Angel
or VC finance works and how to optimise the use of such funding so that the
entrepreneur can achieve his or her objectives alongside those of the Investor.
Angels and VC firms play a very important role in the structure of venture

funding – but it has a limited role and is really only appropriate for certain types
of situations and certain types of endeavours. But for those which can meet the
requirements of the Investor and understand how to leverage the relationship,
it can provide a platform for wealth creation unparalleled by any other form of
finance. Many successful entrepreneurs have launched lifelong careers in high
growth enterprises through their first Angel or VC backed venture.
Perhaps the least understood aspect of Angel and VC finance is the need
for an exit event for the investor. There are basically two types of Angel and
VC backed ventures; financial and strategic. The financial venture will strive for
high growth in revenue and profit and will exhaust the supply of cash to drive
growth. On the other hand, a venture which creates strategic value will use
whatever cash is available to build an asset or capability which will be attractive
to a large corporation. Both these ventures eat cash and rarely throw off spare
cash to pay dividends to the investors. In fact, Investors assume this will be the
case and understand that they will only see a return of their original investment
and a profit on the activity when the business is able to achieve an ‘exit’ event.
In the case of a financial venture that would be an Initial Public Offering (IPO),
achieved by only a very small percentage of investee firms, or a financial trade
sale. Strategic ventures generate a return to the investors by being acquired
by a large corporation in a trade sale. VC investments are often called ‘patient
capital’ simply because they have to wait for the venture to achieve one of these
exit outcomes.
The need for an exit event is fundamental to an Angel or VC investment. It
is the only practical manner in which the investor will achieve a return of their
investment and a profit from the transaction. Given the critical nature of the
exit, it is the most important characteristic of the decision to invest and the
highest priority aspect of the business development strategy. It also means
that an entrepreneur who seeks equity finance needs to accept that his or her
venture will be directed towards an exit as a condition of the investment. With
the exception of the rarely achieved IPO, this means the business will be sold in
a trade sale within a few years of the investment.
Almost without exception, a trade sale will see the end of the business as an
independent entity and, almost certainly, the senior management team will exit

at the same time. While this may seem like the end of the grand adventure, it
really is the start of a new one. The cashed up entrepreneur achieves a reward for
their creativity, energy and innovation and has the chance to do it again, retire,
become an Angel investor or become active in philanthropy. Not a bad outcome
for their contribution. One journey finishes and another starts, but they do need
to accept that by taking the funds, the likely outcome will be that this baby will
grow up and go its own way.
With a greater appreciation for how Angel and VC finance works, the
entrepreneur can decide if they want to take this path to wealth creation. It is
not without its challenges but it a path worth exploring if the underlying venture
has the potential.
The purpose of this book is to help the entrepreneur decide if this is the right
path for them. It seeks to educate the entrepreneur on how Angel and VC finance
works, what the Investor seeks in an investment and how they manage that
investment through to an exit transaction. It will help the entrepreneur to judge
whether they have a venture suitable for investment and whether they wish to
be part of such an activity. It also lays out a comprehensive process which the
entrepreneur can follow that will assist them in raising Angel and VC funding.

Private Equity
Private Equity comes in various forms and generally depends on the stage
of development of the investee firm. Knowing the extent to which the business
has matured is often an indication of the risks the business faces and the type
of support it needs to get to the next stage.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics’ 2001 Special Article – Venture Capital
Survey uses a multiple stage classification to describe business maturity. The
definitions describe stages at which Angel or Venture Capital finance is invested.
•	 Seed: product is in development. Usually in business less than 18
months.
•	 Early: product in pilot production. Usually in business less than 30
months.
•	 Expansion: product in market. Significant revenue growth.
•	 Turnaround: current products stagnant. Financing provided to a
company at a time of operational or financial difficulty.
•	 Late: new product or product improvement. Continue revenue growth.
•	 Buy out: [leveraged buy out (LBO), management buy out (MBO) or
management buy in (MBI)]: a fund investment strategy involving the
acquisition of a product or business, from either a public or private
company, utilising a significant amount of debt.

A similar classification is provided by the British Venture Capital Association.
In their case investments in private companies are classified by the stage at
which the funding is needed. Stage definitions are:
Seed 	
Stage	
Start-Up 	
Stage	

Financing for product development and initial marketing. Companies may be
in the process of being set up or may have been in business for a short time,
but have not sold their products commercially and are yet to generate a profit.

Expansion 	
Stage	

Financing for growth and expansion of the company which is breaking even or
trading profitably. Capital may be used to finance increased production
capacity, market or product development, and/or to provide additional working
capital.

Replacement 	
Capital	

Purchase of shares from another investor or to reduce gearing via the
refinancing of debt.

Buy out	

The acquisition of a significant portion, majority control or 100% of businesses
which normally entails a change of ownership. Funds are often used for
expansion, consolidations, turn-arounds, and spinouts of divisions or subsidiaries.

There are only a limited number of Venture Capital funds focused on financing
seed or start-up stages, although this is often the stage where Business Angels
play a major role.
An emerging company which has constructed an experienced management
team, a robust competitive position and strong gross margins usually has little
need for Angel or VC investment. Early stage ventures with strong profit and
high growth potential may be able to skip Angel financing and go direct to
formal venture capital. The Angel plays the middle role: funding the business
that has yet to stand on its own feet and not yet mature enough or with enough
potential to attract venture capital. Angels typically invest in seed, start-up or
early stage businesses.
Angels often play the financing role between ‘family, friends and fools’, often
referred to as ‘close money’ and formal venture capital. Coping with what has
come before and what comes after their involvement in the venture is a challenge
for the Angel. On the one hand, Angels need to develop the business given the
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

9

<-----Page 27----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

constraints inherited from earlier investors and then they need to prepare the
business for the next round of investment, usually from formal venture capital.
Even though the majority of their investee firms will not require venture capital,
this will not always be apparent in the early stages of the Angel’s involvement
with the investee firm.
Business Angel finance, the role of the Angel and the manner in which Angels
work will be covered in greater detail in the next chapter.

Family, Friends and Fools
Most new firms start with whatever funds the new enterprise team can
scrape up between them. This may be advances on credit cards, savings and
bank loans (generally secured on property). This is the entrepreneur’s money
and if they lose it, they have only themselves to worry about. Most ventures start
this way and may never require further shareholder investment. The profits are
normally re-invested to fund additional working capital as the business expands,
however, funds for expansion are often limited as the founding team usually
exhaust their personal savings. To keep the enterprise going and to fund the
next stage of development, founders normally turn to their family and friends.
However, everything has a price and even money from those who are
close comes with its own problems. While they may not have the same ROI
requirements as an Angel or be subject to the regulations and timescales of the
VC, investment from family and friends (close money) has its own issues. Fools
are said to be investors who throw their money in on the off chance that it might
make a return, but generally don’t risk very much and have low expectations of
getting the money back.
New ventures are not without their risks. Australian research indicates that
up to 70% of new start-ups will fail within five years. Further, few will ever grow
beyond six people and very few will achieve significant size. The chance of losing
the money from relatives and friends is reasonably high.
One of the considerations which new venture entrepreneurs face is the
impact on their relationships with family and friends of the venture failing.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

10

<-----Page 28----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

What happens when the venture fails and close relatives have invested life
savings into the business, having been sold on the dream of owning part of the
next Microsoft? Few non-business people really appreciate the risks of a startup. Everything appears attractive up-front when it all looks so easy and they are
sold on the idea of their young relative growing a monster company. But when
it fails and they accept that their relative simply didn’t have the experience to
make it work, will they really be happy to write off the investment, or will this
be a lifelong problem between them?
The same could be said of close friends. Being work colleagues, school friends
or social friends hardly qualifies people to undertake the stress and rigor of
going into business together. What happens when their talent and experience
proves not to be the level required, they don’t really want to put in the time or
they want to have the final say on all decisions? Then there is the dysfunctional
team which may cause the failure of the venture or may need to be broken up
by forcing some of the team to quit. If they have money invested in the venture
and still own equity, how are the remaining shareholders going to buy them out
or deal with their ongoing equity interest?
Many start-ups involve couples, business colleagues, school friends and
relatives. Not all of them will appreciate the time and effort which must be
put into the venture to get it to a reasonably profitable, sustainable state.
There are many stories of partners working long hours, taking low salaries and
undertaking activities they are not trained for just to survive. Not everyone
going into the venture is capable or willing to put in the effort and time it takes
to get something up and running.
Close money may or may not come with other constraints. If a founding
investor is working in the business, they may well feel an equal partner and
want to be actively involved in the decision-making on a day-to-day basis.
While this can work in very small firms, it becomes very problematic as the firm
grows. As more staff join and the firm becomes more complex, some formal
organisational structure is required. At this point, the question of who is boss
and who makes the decisions becomes a real issue of debate and often conflict.
With independent people, this can be more easily resolved; however, when
the other person is a spouse, cousin or best friend, the issue is not so readily
resolved.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

11

<-----Page 29----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

At the same time, family investors who don’t work in the business may feel
a need to interfere if they see something they disagree with, even without
understanding the situation or the business requirements. So the wife of the
cousin who sees differentials in remuneration or different workloads may feel
compelled to voice criticism to the aunts and uncles. Now the managers are
spending time defending their actions to people outside the firm who may have
no idea of the pressures they are under.
Then there is always the issue of a family member, friend or fool who decides
that they would like their investment capital back before the other shareholders
are ready to exit the business.
An issue common to many new ventures owned by married couples are the
problems which arise when they start a family or go through a divorce. Where
other owner/managers are involved in the business and one needs to take time
out for family reasons, this can create tension and assertions of unfairness and
inequality. Where a divorce occurs, it may be impossible to continue a close
working relationship. The issue of ownership and involvement can become a
very messy problem, often resulting in the failure or sale of the firm.
A major consideration for the entrepreneur is what happens to the original
team as the firm grows. Will they be capable of playing their part in the
management team of a firm which grows to 30, 100 or 500 people? If they don’t
have the experience, personality or capability to handle the tasks, how will the
problem be resolved?
Investors are often confronted with these complex personnel situations.
As an external and perhaps a more objective investor, the Investor needs to
tread carefully around these relationships. Clearly, if they don’t see that a
constructive business environment exists, or one that can be readily resolved
through discussion and a realignment of roles, responsibilities, remuneration
and objective decision-making processes, they are better off rejecting the
investment. If the Investor thinks the team is not capable of delivering the
growth and profit required, they will simply walk away from the investment
opportunity. If there is a problem between founders and early investors and the
Investor feels that this will limit the process of building the business, then they
are better off not investing.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

12

<-----Page 30----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

At the same time, the Investor needs to acknowledge that the venture
probably would never have survived had it not been for the investment, time
and commitment of those people who were willing to come in at the start. This
is an interesting problem for the Investor to deal with.
Before proceeding to invest, the Investor must be satisfied on the following
issues:
Will the family, friends and fools interfere in the negotiation for the
investment, the management of the company or the decision on the
exit strategy?
Do the family and friends who helped start and grow the company
form part of a management team? Does the investor have confidence
in them and is he willing to trust them to grow the business to achieve
its potential?

Current management and shareholders should be aware that these issues
will need to be addressed as part of the investment agreement. The Investor
may require that some of these problems be resolved as part of the decision
to invest. This may involve a restructuring of the business, new job descriptions
and a more formal organisation structure. The Investor might also be willing to
buy out some of the early shareholders in order to simplify the shareholdings.

Venture Capital Funds
Venture Capital is the most formalised form of private equity investment.
Unlike most Angel investments where the Angel takes a personal role in deal
due diligence and management, Venture Capital provides a channel whereby
high net-worth investors can participate in higher risk ventures without having
to personally undertake the burden of venture evaluation and management.
The VC fund itself provides the expertise in sourcing, evaluating, investing,
managing and harvesting the venture investments.
Whereas most Angels invest in their own right, VC investment is through
a fund. The common structure of a Private Equity Fund or Venture Capital
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

13

<-----Page 31----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

Fund is the Limited Partnership. This structure is commonplace in both the
USA and UK markets and has been introduced in Australia. The benefit of
this structure is that the fund itself is not a legal entity for tax purposes
for the investor. There is a pass through treatment of any gains for tax
purposes. Thus any gains and losses pass directly to the investor and are
taxed in their hands. The investor also has the benefit of limited liability at
the level of the fund itself. No liability from the investee firms can pass back
to the investor. A comprehensive description of the Limited Partnership
Agreement can be found on the British Venture Capital Association website
(see www.bvca.co.uk/).
Funds are normally closed-end in structure, meaning that the investor has
very limited or no ability to withdraw their investment during the fund’s life.
Funds are typically established for a 10-year life, but may be extended in some
circumstances. The investor (also known as a Limited Partner) commits to make
available funds as needed for the underlying venture investments. Investments
are then normally made by the Investment Manager (otherwise called a General
Partner) generally over the first one to five years of the fund life. As investments
are harvested, proceeds are returned to the Limited Partners and not reinvested into new opportunities. Since the timing of exits cannot be known in
advance, Limited Partners must be prepared to wait for some time before they
start to see any return on their funds.
In his book, ‘Early Exits: Exit Strategies for Entrepreneurs and Angel Investors
(But Maybe Not Venture Capitalists)’ Basil Peters notes the following:
Most VC funds are designed for a lifetime of 10 years. But in
practice, the actual lifetime of technology (IT) VC funds averages
closer to 13-14 years.
Limited Partners typically give a wide degree of discretion to the General
Partner to invest on their behalf as they cannot know before the fund starts
to operate the types of investments which may present themselves. The fund

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

14

<-----Page 32----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

agreement typically specifies the minimum and maximum investments the
fund can make in any one venture. The Limited Partners are committed to the
investments made by the General Partner and there is generally no ability for
the Limited Partner to withdraw from any investment made by the General
Partner. Typically, General Partners or Fund Managers issue a Prospectus or
Information Memorandum to investors to raise their investment capital.
The typical Private Equity Fund terms are:
Minimum investor commitment	

Often $5 million or greater.

Manager’s commitment	
		
		

General Partners typically invest their own money in the
fund. Often this will be around 1% of the total fund and is
sometimes a prerequisite of the Limited Partners.

Partnership term		
		
		

The fund life is normally 7-10 years with the
possibility of limited extensions to facilitate exits.
Distributions may be made as investments are sold.

Investment/commitment period	 On average, Private Equity Funds invest committed 		
capital over a 3-5 year period.
Management fees		
		

Normally the management fee is set between 1.5% and
2% of committed capital.

Incentive/performance fees	
		
		

Typically 20% of the total returns and is usually only paid
once the Limited Partners achieve a predetermined hurdle
rate. This is known as the ‘carried interest’.

Preferred return or hurdle rate	
		
		

The carried interest may not be paid out until total returns
exceed some agreed threshold. Currently (2004) this is
around 8%.

In the USA comparable data is difficult to find. However, the National Venture
Capital Association (NVCA) represents 460 venture capital and private equity
firms (see www.nvca.org). In 2004, VC firms invested US$21.2 billion. Of this
65% went into early or expansion stage companies and 33% went into later
stage companies. One directory lists more than 1,400 VC firms in the USA (see
www.vfinance.com).
In the UK, there are several VC directories, one of which is published by the
British Venture Capital Association (BVCA). The BVCA has more than 170 full
members and 150 associate members (see www.bvca.com.uk). Worldwide
investment by UK PE firms was £9.7 billion. The number of companies financed
was 1,301. Another VC directory for the UK is available from VCR Directory Online
which lists more than 3,000 investors across Europe (see www.vcrdirectory.net).
General Partners have the responsibility of sourcing, evaluating and
negotiating investments in private firms. This can be a lengthy and timeconsuming task. Due to the immature nature of many of the firms being
examined and the uncertainties associated with their products and business
models, combined in many cases with the lack of proper systems or audited
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

16

<-----Page 34----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

accounting records, considerable expertise is needed to undertake the
task effectively. Since such experience is in limited supply, Venture Capital
Funds have difficulty recruiting senior managers, although the work may be
outsourced in some areas to external advisors. The ability of the VC Funds to
invest is constrained by the number and experience of their managers. At the
same time, firms receiving investments (investees) are looking to their General
Partners for advice, contacts and help securing customers, grants and staff.
When investee firms get into trouble, such as not achieving targets, making
losses or losing key staff, General Partners need to devote considerable time
to their current investments and have little time to source and evaluate new
investments. General Partners will also be actively involved in setting strategy,
planning and executing the exit. Around 70% of the General Partner’s time is
taken up working with their investee firms; hence the capacity of the Venture
Capital Fund is limited. Venture Capital Funds therefore typically make few
investments: only a few in any year. They often have limited time to carefully
evaluate new investments and often spend only a few minutes on an executive
summary establishing whether the proposal is worth further investigation.
Even when a proposition looks attractive, extensive time will be spent with
the new venture team evaluating them as well as the merits of the business.
Considerable due diligence will be undertaken before any investment is made.
Often 20-30 or more proposals will be investigated for every single offer made.
The 2004 Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey reported similar ratios.
‘The selection of investee companies (into which venture capital is invested)
was an intensive process. The total of 137 venture capital managers reviewed
10,530 potential new investments during 2003/04 and conducted further
analysis on 1,067 of those, with 181 being sponsored for venture capital. These
managers spent a total of 179,000 hours with the investee companies (190,000
in 2002/03), advising and assisting in the development of the enterprises.’

<-----Page 35----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

In the 2007/8 ABS survey, fund managers spent on average 3.9 days a month
on each investee company.
Due to the complexity of the business proposals, VC firms will often limit
themselves to specific industry sectors where they have both the expertise to
evaluate the deal as well as the experience and networks to add value to the
investment. In the US and UK markets some funds have a single industry focus;
however, in Australia most funds have a more general focus.
VC firms will also often limit themselves to certain development stages,
such as start-up, expansion or buy out, where they can add real value. VC firms
which spread themselves across too many sectors or too many stages will often
be viewed less favorably by investors as they will see higher risks in such a
spread. At the same time, larger funds prefer only to invest larger amounts as
they can only support a limited number of investments. A typical fund invests
in approximately 10-12 investee companies with individual investments of
between 5-15% of the individual fund’s total investment capital. The increasing
cost of proposal analysis and subsequent due diligence is itself an inhibiting
factor. If only one in ten proposals investigated are being invested in, the
average cost of investigation of an investee firm is quite high. Therefore small
investments are simply not economical.
The drift towards larger funds and the lack of early stage expertise within
the VC community has led to an increasing shift of investments towards later
stage investments. For example in 2003, 55% of venture capital investments
in Australia went into various types of buy outs of existing businesses – the
vital seed, start-up and early expansion phases accounted for only 16% of
investments.

Many of the more successful and longer established VC firms receive so many
business proposals that they restrict their time to recommended proposals
from individuals or professional firms which have already reviewed the business
plans, so they can better use their time. It also means that to access the better
VC firms, an entrepreneur needs to first work with an Angel or professional firm
which has access to the General Partners.
The legal structure of the fund, the manner of remuneration for General
Partners and the process in which Limited Partners achieve a return of
their initial investment plus their desired ROI, means that investments
need to be harvested within a relatively short period of time. Most VC
firms target a period of between 3-5 years for harvesting. However,
if you take out the last year for the exit execution, this leaves only
2-4 years to create the pre-conditions for a successful exit.
If investments go over the five-year mark they are at risk of running up against
the fund term. This means the General Partner has to apply to the Limited
Partners for an extension or they need to force an exit event. To achieve a 25%
compound return, they need the value of the investment to double almost

20

<-----Page 38----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

every three years. An investment that has been in play for six years needs the
capitalised value to have reached 3.8 times the initial investment. If the VC fund
only held 20% equity in the investment, a $2 million investment in a $10 million
capitalised firm has to achieve an exit valuation of nearly $38 million to provide
the VC firm with a 25% ROI over the six years. Since few firms consistently
achieve this type of growth, the pressure is on the VC firm to choose the right
investments and then to actively manage them to get the desired growth rate.
Any slippage from the agreed targets will create considerable pressure on
the VC to intervene to sell the business or to replace the management team
to get the firm back on track. Few entrepreneurs seeking VC investment really
appreciate the impact on the firm of a 25% cumulative growth in value and how
difficult it is to reach.
Usually the VC fund is a minority investor which normally would give them
little power or authority to force a sale of the investee firm. However, the
investment agreement would typically provide the VC fund with the power to
intervene to ensure they are able to exit under certain circumstances. Typical
provisions would include the following:
	

Voting trust: Entrepreneurs hand over shares if they don’t perform. The VC
has the ability to take control, notwithstanding it is initially in a minority
position.

	 Unlocking provision: A shareholder receives an offer they don’t wish to
accept but the VC does – the shareholder must buy the VC out.
	 Put provision: The VC may have the right to sell the business to the ‘highest
bidder’ if an exit is not achieved by a given date.
	 Registration and public offering provision: The VC may require an IPO after
a given date. If this is not possible, the firm will be sold.

Many people incorrectly think that VC General Partners are business experts
who are knowledgeable about growing a business. In truth, most of them
have a banking and finance background, with limited management experience
outside the banking and finance sector and little hands-on experience in most
of the markets in which they have investments. In many cases, the investment
manager acting for the VC firm will be in their late 30s or 40s, have not worked
in any sector other than financial services and have never undertaken any
entrepreneurial activity. Their ability to help with specific experience in the
development of a long-term strategy or with market development is limited.
Some of the better funds have expanded their investment team with managers
with operational experience, but these are certainly in the minority.
The more experienced General Partners will have learnt through a series of
investments, will have developed good networks across a range of industries and
will have participated in several exits as well as several write-offs. However, this
experience can make them more cautious in their assessment of opportunities.
For the most part, VC General Partners are financial administrators. They
are good at financial analysis, working the ratios, accounting for the money and
making sure the legal requirements are satisfied. But they can only remain in
the VC business if they can raise a new fund, since funds have a limited life.
Raising a new fund means delivering healthy returns to their Limited Partner
investors. That means getting both the investment and the exits at the right
price. Without the exit returns, they don’t achieve their bonuses and they don’t
have the opportunity to raise a new fund.
Mature VC firms which have been actively involved in funding emerging
companies for a number of years have discovered just how hard it is to cope
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

22

<-----Page 40----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

with innovations, emerging markets and untried teams. Those VC firms
typically have recruited senior staff who have technical (and often business)
qualifications as well as a number of years of senior operational experience
if not direct entrepreneurial success. In mature markets such as the USA, top
VC firms will not employ an investment manager who does not have senior
operational experience. While they have discovered that financial administration
can be outsourced, operational experience is a real asset when it comes to
understanding how a value proposition will achieve traction in the marketplace
and understanding whether or not the management team has the attributes to
build a good business.
Occasionally a VC firm will be able to sell to another VC firm which might be
interested in taking the business to the next level of development. An early stage
VC firm may sell their position to another VC firm interested in an expansion
investment. This may also involve a further round of investment in the investee
firm. VC firms attempt to maximise the value of their return through the most
favorable exit vehicle. IPOs generally achieve the best returns with buybacks
usually the lowest positive return. As an indication of the frequency of each
type of exit, consider the following data sets.
In Australia, from March 2000 to September 2002 there were a total of 209
exits, of which 117 or 55.6% were at a profit, 10 broke even, and 79 or 37.8%
were at a loss.

In 1999/2000, 24 companies were sold, 12 companies went public, four
companies were bought back and 19 investments were liquidated. The value
of exits during the year 1999/2000 was A$536 million. The average trade sale
was A$3.7 million, while the value of all IPOs was A$346 million.

Exit data from the UK for 2004 shows that, by value, 28% was from trade

Unlike VC funds, Angels are not restricted by the closed fund limitation, thus
they can stay with their investments longer if the occasion warrants. They can
also be more selective with their investments. The General Partner of a VC fund
is under pressure to allocate the money during the early phase of the fund and
so a high volume of possible deals needs to be sourced for evaluation. Angels
can invest without an expectation of a positive return, perhaps to ‘give back’ or
to fund or assist a young entrepreneur. The VC firm can really only be involved
if it can see a healthy return for their Limited Partners.
Angels typically invest in one in three proposals which they evaluate where
VC funds only invest in one in one hundred. Perhaps, because of the higher
cost of investing and the higher return expected, the VC firm has a much more
difficult task in finding appropriate investments.

Private Equity Funds
Another form of private equity is the Private Equity (PE) Fund, a term
normally reserved for funds which invest in late stage ventures. Where Venture
Capital Funds typically take a minority investment in a firm and actively manage
through the original management team, the Private Equity Fund typically takes
100% or a majority stake in an investment. PE firms typically aim to acquire
firms where direct intervention can overcome prior problems or constraints
and provide a short-term turnaround situation or performance uplift which will
yield an attractive return. PE firms look for inefficiencies to exploit. Common
approaches are:

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

25

<-----Page 43----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

•	 Improve the profitability. Access to more experienced management,
networks and technical knowledge may provide the basis for a relatively
easy improvement in profitability.
•	 Buy at a favorable price when the market is low and wait until the
market improves when valuation multiples are higher.
•	 Break the business up and sell off the assets or business units. Some
businesses are undervalued where one part of the business is more risky
or where the market does not understand the business economics. More
focused businesses will often sell at a higher multiple.
•	 Leveraged buy out. The PE firm uses debt to finance a major part of the
buy out. When the value improves, the returns to the equity portion are
magnified due to the high debt component.
•	 Management buy-out.
•	 Management buy-in.
•	 Make bolt-on acquisitions to generate economies of scale or gain access
to new products or markets.
PE could be used to remove the burden of existing debt which might allow
the business to reinvest and grow. Existing management may be retained with
incentives or may be allowed a minor equity position as an incentive.
PE investment may be used to provide existing management with the
opportunity to buy out the existing owners, re-engineer the business and then
position it for an IPO. The PE firm would use the IPO as their exit strategy leaving
the management team in control post IPO.
PE funds have become active in ‘sell down’ transactions in recent years. This
occurs where the PE fund buys shares from a founder representing only part
of the ownership, although most often the majority. In this way, the founder
has the opportunity to cash out part of their investment in the enterprise. The
PE firm will then work with the founder to actively progress the business to a
higher exit valuation which could be achieved either through an IPO or a trade
sale. In undertaking the development strategy, the PE firm may arrange for
additional debt financing, replace some of the management team, restructure
the Board of Directors, assist with acquisitions and development of new strategic
partnerships and so on.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

26

<-----Page 44----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

This strategy has the advantage of allowing time for the business to be
properly prepared for an exit with the active co-operation of the founder and
the management team. The founder may also achieve a secondary harvest at
a higher valuation. An Angel might seek out a PE fund as an exit strategy if the
business could be substantially developed with significant capital injection, a
new management team or as part of a roll-up strategy.

Corporate Venture Capital
An Investor may co-invest with a corporation or seek follow-on funding
from a corporation as part of an exit strategy. Many corporations have Venture
Capital Funds specially for the purpose of investing in early stage ventures. The
manner in which these corporate funds are managed and the terms under which
funds are invested closely mirror traditional Venture Capital Funds. Ventures
successful in acquiring a corporate investor can often gain additional benefits
beyond those which can be offered by the traditional Venture Capital Fund.
Corporations have a variety of reasons for investing in early stage ventures
although the most common are:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

access to specialised knowledge, intellectual property or equipment
exposure to emerging technologies
investment in potential acquisitions
understanding of new or emerging markets
access to entrepreneurial talent
preventing competitors from acquiring a technological breakthrough.

For the new venture, a corporate investor could provide the following
benefits:
•	 access to industry expertise, networks, equipment and/or research and
development facilities
•	 access to a key customer or to an established distribution channel
•	 access to complimentary technologies.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

Typically, Corporate Venture Funds invest in their core or closely related
technologies.
According to a joint study by Venture Economics and the National Venture
Capital Association in United States, in 1994 only 2% of venture capital
investments were corporate venture capital, but in 2000, corporate venture
capital accounted for 17%, nearly US$20 billion. In four years, from 1996 through
the end of 1999, the number of companies investing in outside ideas increased
elevenfold, from 30 to 330. During the same period, corporate venture capital
spending rose from US$100 million to US$17 billion annually.

Accessed 3/01/04

In 2003, US$1.1 billion was invested in the USA in growth orientated
companies by corporate venturing groups, representing 6% of all VC investment.
The amount invested by corporate venture capitalists has tracked similarly to
the trends of the overall VC industry. The 2003 figures were close to the activity
seen in the last pre-bubble year, 1997, when corporate venturing groups
invested US$957 million, also representing 6% of total VC invested in that year.
Source: http://www.nvca.org/nvca02_04_04.html Accessed 3/01/04

There is limited information available about Corporate Venture Capital Funds
in Australasia.
Overseas and local corporations may undertake venture investments through
a local fund, via a traditional Venture Capital Fund or through a local subsidiary.
The major problem which most corporate businesses have with VC investments
is access to experienced VC executives. Since the VC investment model is one of
active intervention as well as portfolio investing, this type of investing is foreign
to most corporations. Many will invest in an established VC fund in order to
access the investment evaluation experience and venture investment skills.
An early stage venture which can clearly show how their innovations relate
to the business of a large corporation should include that corporation in their
list of potential investors. However, corporations not familiar with investing in
early stage ventures can be a mixed blessing. Because they are not familiar with
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

28

<-----Page 46----->Chapter 2: Sources of Private Equity

the norms of such investments, the firm may find itself wasting considerable
time trying to convince the corporation of the value of an external investment,
although benefits may come from a more favorable valuation, access to
corporate resources and an early exit opportunity.
The entrepreneur should be wary of the motivation of the corporate investor.
Their involvement is mostly driven by their own strategic objectives and their
support may be highly influenced by wanting the investee firm to develop
in a particular direction. They may inhibit, consciously or unconsciously, the
direction of the business and limit the exit opportunities.

ngel investors, often simply referred to as Business Angels or ‘Angels’,
are high net-worth, non-institutional, private equity investors who have
the desire and sufficiently high net worth to enable them to invest part of their
assets in high-risk, high-return entrepreneurial ventures in return for a share of
voting, income and, ultimately, capital gain.
Angel investment is normally the first round of external independent
investment. Angels normally invest in early stage ventures where the founding
team has exhausted their personal savings and sources of funding from family
and friends. These ventures are not sufficiently developed to stand on their
own, or sufficiently attractive to gain venture capital funding. These ventures
exist in a halfway state, often between possible failure and take-off. Typically
the management team lacks experience in a growth venture and the business
needs not only the additional funding, but also mentoring to take it to the next
stage of development.
Investing in early stage private companies has many drawbacks, which is why
this form of investment is typically undertaken by individuals who can afford to
lose the money and/or are willing to wait some years before they see a return
on their money.

<-----Page 48----->Chapter 3: Angel Investor Finance

To put this into context, private early stage ventures have the following
attributes:
•	 The shares are not freely traded and no established market exists for
them. An investor is forced to wait for a liquidity event such as a trade
sale or a public listing.
•	 Novel business concepts and inventions are often associated with
emerging and untried markets. The risks in the venture are likely to
be higher and some aspects of the business subject to high levels of
uncertainty.
•	 Products may be new and/or under development and still subject to
technical and market risks.
•	 The knowledge of the product and its design may be highly dependent
on a small number of key staff, who may not necessarily have proven
business experience.
•	 The small size of new ventures and their lack of presence in the market
mean they may be highly susceptible to changes in market conditions.
Timing may be critical to survival. Small delays in product release or in
achieving revenue milestones may be sufficient to cause failure of the
enterprise.
•	 There is limited access to further finance if the business encounters
delays or undertakes operations which require additional funds.
•	 Early stage ventures typically have little collateral to pledge for loans.
•	 Early stage ventures often have a high cash burn rate as they have yet to
reach a critical mass where they are self-funding.
•	 Funding for acquisitions or expansion can be limited.
•	 Valuations are problematic – if not speculative. Shares are not readily
traded and so no public market value exists for the firm. Often there
is little historical performance and future revenues and profits are
uncertain.
•	 Minority shareholders have little power unless it is through an
investment agreement. Even if they disagree with management actions,
they have little power and can’t sell their shares easily.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 49----->Chapter 3: Angel Investor Finance

Angel investments are both risky and problematic. Since most new venture
entrepreneurs lack the business experience to anticipate many of the problems
they will encounter as the enterprise grows, the investment risk is generally
seen as considerably higher than a public corporation.
Private equity investment is often referred to as ‘investing in securities
through a negotiated process’. Unlike purchasing shares in a public company,
the investor in a private enterprise negotiates the terms and conditions under
which the investment will be made. A defining characteristic of Angel investing
is that it is a ‘transformational, value-added, active investment strategy’, in
which the investor expects to have a hands-on approach to their investments,
not possible in public company investments.
Entrepreneurs often seek out Angel investors to help them develop their
business. Apart from the funding they bring, an Angel would be expected to
contribute in one or more of the following ways:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

industry experience
experience in start-up or business building
networks
experience in raising venture capital
access to VC firms
access to strategic partners.

There are different types of Angels. An Angel with direct experience in the
firm’s industry and with entrepreneurial experience can help with business
development, recruitment, sales, strategy, contacts and so on. Their expertise
and experience can be an invaluable help in developing the business. Often
cashed-up entrepreneurs with start-up experience will invest back into new
ventures. They can bring the experience of a successful venture through its
growth stages. However, they may not have experience in the industry in which
the firm operates. Wealthy and/or retired corporate executives often make
investments in new ventures within their industry. They can assist with customer
introductions, recruitment and risk assessment. However, many Angels are
simply wealthy individuals with a desire to invest in the private sector and their
only real contribution is finance.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 50----->Chapter 3: Angel Investor Finance

The new venture entrepreneur may find Angel investment very useful as a
bridge to VC finance. The Angel can provide much needed finance as well as
assist in developing the business further to prove the business model.
One Canadian study showed that 57% of firms with Angel financing
subsequently obtained VC funding.	
Source: http://www.smartlink.net.au/library/riding/1 Accessed 31/12/04

However, Scott A. Shane in his book ‘Fools Gold?: the truth behind angel
investing in America’ disputes this as a general relationship and indicates that
the probability of follow on VC is significantly lower.
So what does the typical Angel look like? There have been a number of studies
of Angels across several countries; however, because Angels typically stay out
of the public eye and are often reticent to speak of their investing experience,
data has been difficult to collect and therefore the samples have been relatively
small. Even so, the findings are relatively consistent across several studies.
The Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire
has created a profile of the ‘typical (USA) Angel investor’. The predominant
characteristics are:
•	 Angels tend to invest close to their home base, usually no further than a
half-day’s drive.
•	 Individual Angels rarely invest more than a few hundred thousand
dollars in total.
•	 Angel investors tend to be older, wealthier and better educated than the
average citizen, yet a large number are not millionaires.
•	 Angels anticipate an average annual return of 26% on their investments.
•	 Angels expect that up to one third of their investments will fail, resulting
in significant capital losses.
•	 Angel investors reject seven out of every 10 deals that cross their desks.
•	 Deals are rejected for a variety of reasons, including poor growth
potential, overpriced equity and inexperienced management team.

An overview of the Australian Angel investment environment is provided
below:
Example
‘The private nature of Angel funding means that much information about
activity in Australia is anecdotal.
It appears that most investors are worth upwards of A$10 million, often have
an entrepreneurial background and take stakes of between A$250,000 and
A$4 million. Equity investment generally concerns small or medium sized
enterprises (SMEs).
Some Angels also provide loan finance, independently or as part of packages
from lending institutions.
Some government and industry studies suggest that the size of the local Angel
market is 35% to 50% of VC investing, significantly lower than that of Canada,
the US and UK where Angel investing is greater than the total of formal venture
capital funding.
Investment criteria appear to be similar to those of VC funds (e.g. rate of return,
cash flow, capital growth and time to exit). Most Angels, in contrast to VC fund
managers, appear to be averse to publicity – one reason may be wariness about
approaches by entrepreneurs – and limited requirements for public disclosure
of investments means that information about the sector is problematic. They
appear to be biased towards early stage and start-up enterprises rather than
funding expansion capital or management buyouts.’

In their book Angel Capital, Benjamin and Margulis describe the typical USA
Angel as follows:
•	 46-65 years of age, male
•	 postgraduate degree, often technical

•	 invests between US$25,000 and US$1 million per transaction
•	 prefers participation with other financially sophisticated individuals
•	 strong preference for transactions which match with technical expertise
•	 23% prefer to invest close to home
•	 maintains an active professional relationship with portfolio investments
•	 invests in one or two transactions per year
•	 diversification and tax shelter income are not the most important
objectives
•	 term for holding investment is eight years
•	 looks for rates of return from 22% to 50%: minimum portfolio return
20%
•	 learns of investment opportunities primarily from friends and trusted
associates; however, majority would like to look at more investment
opportunities than present informal referral system permits
•	 income is US$100,000 per year minimum
•	 self-made millionaire.
By contrast, a study by Professor Kevin Hindle and Robert Wenban of
Australian Angels found that: there were two dominant groups – those with
university education and those without, they were slightly younger than their
American equivalents, invested less per transaction and were mostly ‘general
managers’ or ‘people managers’ by background, although most had been
involved in several start-up ventures. They typically invested 10-14% of their
net worth in new ventures, although one quarter invested over 25% of their net
worth. They were investing in about one third of proposals considered.

Motivation for investing varies slightly among the countries for which survey
data is available. Benjamin and Margulis, in their book Angel Capital, provide
the following reasons:

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

35

<-----Page 53----->Chapter 3: Angel Investor Finance

•	 improve self-image, self-esteem and recognition, ‘you never know how
much you know until a small company turns to you’
•	 alleviate concerns – help others
•	 obligation to give back, the ‘joy of giving’
•	 get ‘first crack’ at next high-rise stock prior to IPO
•	 habit, addicted to high-risk ‘rush’
•	 fun and exciting
•	 ROI 30% minimum
•	 desire to take charge of the stock selection process more directly.
It may be that their sample has more hi-tech Silicon Valley entrepreneurs
and thus is not representative of Angels in other countries.

In contrast, Australian Angels appear to have a greater focus on the
investment returns.
The amount of net worth invested in private equity by Angels varies
considerably and appears to be somewhat based on the total worth of the
individual as well as their prior background. Estimates vary from 5-50% of net
worth with the average differing across countries. For example, one German
study reported the average to be 20%.
Amounts invested by Angels tend to vary from country to country. Individual
investments tend to be somewhat larger than where Angels act in a group to
co-invest. The majority of Angel investments are co-investment situations.

In a Scottish study, 38% of Angels had an SME background while 60% had no
SME experience. Similar studies have been undertaken in Australia, Germany
and Singapore. While the distribution of responses is not identical for each
country, the results are not markedly different.
Rates of investment compared to deals screened seem to be comparable
across several western countries. A German study reported an investment
rate of one or two out of every nine investigated. Investments take generally
between 20 to 90 days from initial contact and involve, generally three to six
negotiation sessions.
Research in the USA suggests that Angels invest in about 10 times the number
of companies as the VC firms but the total amount of investment by dollar value
is somewhat similar. The most recent estimate (2002) is 400,000 active Angels
in the USA investing US$30-40 billion in 50,000 early stage ventures.
‘Through 2001, the 220 members of Tech Coast Angels (Los Angeles, Orange
and San Diego Counties) made approximately 800 investments in 52 companies
totalling US$40 million in 81 rounds of investments. The average investment is
just over US$40,000 and 95% of the individual investments have been in the
range of US$20,000 to US$100,000. Fifty per cent of the investment rounds
totalled US$500,000 or less.’

angel investing network: Tech Coast Angels, Venture Capital, Vol. 4, No. 4

Returns on investment and exit paths tend to vary from country to country,
possibly depending on the state of the economy at the time of the research,
the availability of a robust secondary public listing market and the type and

investment through a trade sale.

remuneration for their time spent on the business

approval rights over executive remuneration
approval rights over issue of options
the right to put the business up for sale if certain milestones are not
achieved
the right to replace the CEO if certain milestones are not achieved.

Angels are normally active ‘hands-on’ investors. They expect and often enjoy
being directly involved in the management of the venture. In fact, this is often
one of their prime reasons for investing. They typically spend time with each of
their investments on a regular basis.
A study of Angel investors in Germany showed that Angels typically spent 6.2
days per month on their investments, averaging 1.34 days per month on each
investment, with the most time being spent on their most recent investees.
More active investments might involve a day per week.

Angel investors play a very important role in developing early stage ventures.
It is their combination of funding and mentoring that makes their contribution
so advantageous to a fledgling business. Certainly, without Angel help, many
early stage businesses would flounder. Even though many fail, at least half grow
into more substantial businesses providing essential job and wealth creation.
There are many sites offering information on Angel finance in the USA and
several directories of Angels and Angel Networks. One site offers access to more
than 20,000 Angels (see www.vfinance.com). The Angel Capital Association has

Strategic v.s Financial
Ventures

T

here are basically two types of ventures which attract Angel or VC
investment. These ventures create a return to the investor through their
exit event. Financial ventures create value on exit via a financial trade sale or an
IPO by assigning a value to the future profit generating power of the entity being
sold. Alternatively, a strategic venture creates exit value, not on the basis of what
profit it could inherently generate, but on the basis of what future profit could
be generated by the buyer exploiting the underlying assets or capabilities of the
entity being acquired. These are fundamentally different types of businesses
and the Angel or VC investor has to ensure that the business development
process and the exit preparation align with the appropriate exit.
In order to assess the potential exit value of any entity, we must first
understand how the business creates value for its buyer (financial or strategic
sale) or its future public shareholders (IPO). Those businesses which deliver
inherent profitability must create value for its future owners through enhanced
profitability and future profit growth. By contrast, strategic value businesses
create value by enabling a large corporation, the strategic buyer, to exploit a
significant revenue opportunity enabled through the combination of the two
companies. The strategic seller builds value by developing strategic assets and
capabilities which a large company will exploit.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

43

<-----Page 61----->Chapter 4: Strategic v.s Financial Ventures

In the case of a strategic sale, it may not matter whether the selling business
is making a profit, has revenue or is growing. This is in direct contrast to a
financial exit which is entirely based on revenue and profit growth which the
business itself must deliver to its new owners.
Because these outcomes are very different, the manner in which the Angel
and VC investors will evaluate the investment and then should plan the exit
for their investee business depends greatly on which type of exit is most
appropriate.
I have grouped financial trade sale and IPO under the financial exit as they
both have the same basic value creating process, they both need to generate
a future stream of positive earnings to create a successful exit event. The IPO
exit is an extreme situation of a financial venture where the projected revenue
levels and the projected market capitalization is very high. While the IPO exit
requires a more sophisticated organization to be successful, the fact is that
both the financial sale and the IPO require a proven, high growth potential
business concept to generate a successful exit value.
Smaller firms and firms with limited growth potential which create value
through projected net earnings need to be directed towards a financial trade
sale as they will not be able to meet the rather high threshold of revenue
and potential growth requirements needed for a successful IPO. Given that
only a very small percentage of firms are able to achieve IPO status, the vast
majority of firms need to be prepared for a financial sale. For the purposes of
this discussion, I am going to refer to all financial exits as a ‘financial sale’ with
the understanding that some exceptional firms will be able to achieve an IPO.
Also, for the purposes of this discussion, I am going to assume that all financial
exits will be to an individual or corporation, that is a ‘financial buyer’, and that
the buyer is setting the purchase price based on the anticipated future stream
of earnings from the acquired firm alone. That is, the buyer is not assigning
any synergy or benefit to the acquisition based on what is happening, or could
happen, in the rest of the buyer’s organization.
The financial sale is very different from a strategic sale where value is
created through the combination of the buyer and seller businesses. We
have all heard of businesses which were sold for many times revenue and
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

44

<-----Page 62----->Chapter 4: Strategic v.s Financial Ventures

staggering multiples of profit. These situations are all cases where the business
being acquired had something which the large corporation needed to counter
a major threat or to chase after a major new revenue opportunity. Most of
these acquired businesses had unique intellectual property, deep expertise or
well established brands or rights (e.g. to exploit forests, minerals, fishing etc).
The assets or capabilities being acquired were considered by the buyer to be
too expensive to copy, build or develop, or would take the buyer too long to
assemble or to create internally. The delay in acquiring the asset or capability
may also expose the acquiring corporation to an unacceptable level of risk.
In a strategic acquisition, a small business can often provide the means by
which a large corporation can quickly generate many times the purchase price
by leveraging its own assets and capabilities alongside those being acquired.
Such acquisitions are bought, not on the basis of the profits of the acquired
business, but on the value which can be generated within the combined entity.
Few acquisitions, however, fit this profile. I will use the terms ‘strategic sale’ and
‘strategic buyer’ to describe a situation where a business is sold on the basis of
its strategic value to the acquirer.
Businesses which are typically sold to a strategic buyer are those in
biotechnology, information technology, research and development, designer
fashions, mineral exploration, agricultural science, computer hardware and
telecommunications. Also companies in consumer packaged goods with strong
brands or with manufactured products which have global market potential can
often secure significant premiums on sale. Acquisitions which can deliver very
significant synergies in operating costs through integration would also fit into
this category.
Probably about 95% of all private businesses which are sold are acquired
by a financial buyer. In some, there will be synergies in the acquisition but
these will be minimal and not sufficient to override the need for the acquired
business to show its inherent profitability. Most companies don’t have the type
of assets or capabilities to leverage large scale opportunities for an acquirer.
Instead, they build profits through their own inherent competitive advantages
for a local customer base.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

45

<-----Page 63----->Chapter 4: Strategic v.s Financial Ventures

A financial buyer seeking an acquisition will often have many choices of
similar businesses, although sometimes geographically separate. The buyer
may be buying a business to own and manage or a corporation undertaking a
consolidation strategy by acquiring many businesses of a similar type. What the
financial buyer is acquiring is a profit stream and so the basis of the purchase is
simply how much profit the firm makes now and is likely to make in the future.
Purchase value is calculated almost purely on the inherent profitability of the
acquisition with little regard to the combination synergies in the acquisition.
The seller to a financial buyer must put effort into increasing profit and profit
potential.
Businesses which would normally be sold to a financial buyer are professional
services firms, marketing firms, management consultancies, distribution
companies, trucking companies, most retail businesses, wholesalers, import/
export companies, agricultural enterprises, printers, professional practices,
builders, construction companies and so on. Non complex manufacturing also
attracts a high proportion of financial buyers. Basically any business which does
the same as many other businesses will fall into this group.
Businesses acquired to be operated as a stand alone business will be purchased
on the basis of their inherent profitability as there are no synergistic benefits
in the deal for the acquirer. Therefore, a business bought by an individual who
wants to invest retirement or redundancy funds to buy a business to manage
will be a financial sale. Similarly, a business purchased by a private equity fund
which intends to increase its profitability through new management, increasing
its debt level and refocusing the business will also be a financial sale.
Businesses acquired by corporations can be expected to have both financial
and strategic contributions. Many acquisitions are undertaken for roll-up,
consolidation or expansion purposes. These businesses typically are purchased
to add revenue and profit generation through their own inherent operations
although the acquirer may gain some synergistic benefits from operating at
a larger scale or some benefits through reducing duplicate functions, but the
prime consideration is generating operating profit from the business purchased.
The purchase price would be driven by the current and potential profit of the
acquired business itself. While the additional synergies may make it more
attractive, the seller would need to prepare the business for a financial buyer.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

46

<-----Page 64----->Chapter 4: Strategic v.s Financial Ventures

Acquired businesses which are expected to contribute significant synergistic
benefits to the acquiring corporation may contribute little inherent profit. They
are acquired because of the benefits which the acquiring corporation expects
to achieve through the combination of the businesses. In most cases, these
acquired businesses bring some asset or capability to the acquirer which the
corporation is able to leverage through their own operations thereby generating
significant future revenue and profits for the acquirer. A seller who was able to
make such a contribution would seek out a strategic buyer.
Some firms will be able to do both. That is, they will have good profit
capabilities and also be able to provide strategic benefits to the acquirer. But
one will be more significant than the other. To the extent that strategic value
benefits are greater than inherent profitability benefits, the seller would be
much better off seeking a strategic buyer. Financial sales are always going to be
limited by the profit generating capability of the seller. A strategic sale, however,
is only limited by the size of the opportunity generated within the acquiring
corporation. Thus, a very large corporation that can significantly leverage the
strategic contribution of a small acquisition may be prepared to pay many times
its financial sale value to ensure it receives the benefits of the acquisition rather
than allow it to be acquired by one of its competitors.
I have extensively examined the process of a financial trade sale and have
documented a methodology in my book, The Ultimate Deal 1, which can be
used by business owners to significantly improve their sale value.
My book, The Ultimate Deal 2, examines strategies which owners of businesses
with strategic value will use to sell their businesses to a strategic buyer. Angels
and VC investors who wish to examine the strategic sale preparation process in
greater detail should also read my e-book ‘Invest to Exit’.

I am sure that some companies can do both, but when they look at the
processes involved and the priorities which will determine where to use their
surplus cash, you often see a clear choice – they don’t have the resources to
do both so they need to decide which strategy is going to give the highest exit
price.
There is sometimes the possibility that a single venture can throw off more
than one exit. This can happen where the firm has developed IP across multiple
markets or solves quite different problems. It may be worth separating the
different IP into distinct ventures and preparing each for an exit.
Another possibility is that a single venture may have quite different activities
each of which could be directed towards their own sale, perhaps with some being
financial sales and others being strategic sales. This can happen, for example,
where IP is the basis of a sales transaction of a product but is then followed by
maintenance or service sales. The IP may appeal to a global corporation but
they may have no interest in the local services business. In such a case, it may

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

50

<-----Page 68----->Chapter 4: Strategic v.s Financial Ventures

be worthwhile splitting the business and selling the different parts to different
buyers.
Companies which are sold as a financial sale are those which provide the
buyer with a platform which enables the buyer to generate a stream of future
earnings through the use of the resources contained within the acquired
business. While these might be augmented by the buyer through the insertion
of better processes, more capable management and better funding, essentially
it is the same underlying business which is generating the profit stream. Thus
any acquisition valuation will be based on the net present value of those future
earnings. Most businesses fall into this category. Financial buyers typically buy
retail, wholesale, light manufacturing, transport, property and services based
businesses.
You increase the value of such businesses by reducing the inherent risks for
the buyer, improving the visibility and reliability of future earnings forecasts,
improving on-going profitability, building growth into the business and finding
ways to create growth potential for the buyer.
By contrast, those businesses which appeal to strategic buyers have some
underlying assets or capabilities which a large corporation can exploit through
the buyer’s own organization. Small companies will often develop products or
services which can be sold by the acquirer through their very large distribution
channels. In the right circumstances, a buyer might be able to scale the revenue
by 50 to 100 times that of the seller just by having the right access to global
customers. The key to a strategic sale is to find a large corporation which can
exploit the underlying asset or capability of the seller to generate very large
revenues. In these situations the size, revenue, number of customers or
employees or level of profits of the seller may be entirely irrelevant. It is the
size of the revenue opportunity of the buyer which is the key to strategic value.
A business which has the right type of assets or capabilities which can
generate strategic value may be much better off putting additional effort into
developing those assets and capabilities to provide greater or earlier revenue
generating power for the intended buyer. A higher exit price will be achieved if
the buyer can scale or replicate the asset or capability faster and can integrate
the seller’s business quicker. The only size consideration for the seller is to be
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

51

<-----Page 69----->Chapter 4: Strategic v.s Financial Ventures

big enough to provide the launch platform for the buyer to fully and quickly
exploit the strategic value.
Entrepreneurs need to be sensitive to these two types of ventures as it
directly impacts the evaluation of the venture for Angel and VC investment and
directly impacts on the manner in which the business would be developed for
an exit.

A Compelling
Investment Opportunity

B

usiness advisors often talk about a compelling business concept and
encourage entrepreneurs to create a venture which has high growth
potential. They then assist the entrepreneur to build a business plan around the
compelling business concept so that the entrepreneur can seek out investors
to help them realize the business potential. However, what they have missed
in all this work is that the Angel and VC investor is not that interested in the
business, the product, market or what customers think of the product or service
being developed or sold. What they really want to hear about is a ‘compelling
investment opportunity’. They want to be convinced that their investment funds
will be used to create a successful exit event so that they achieve a great return
on their investment. Their interest starts and ends with how the entrepreneur
is going to make them money not produce the world’s best widget.
The investor will approach the investment opportunity with a set of
assumptions as to how the business will be developed and how the exit will
be achieved. Almost without exception, those assumptions will include the
following:
•	 The business is almost certainly going to be sold within 3-7 years.
Outside a boom market, very few firms make it to an IPO.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

53

<-----Page 71----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

•	 The entrepreneur and most of the equity holding management team are
unlikely to stay with the business once it is sold to a corporate buyer.
•	 The investor, in most cases, will not be involved in the day-to-day
operation of the business but will play a mentoring and strategic role.
•	 The investor can be expected to provide specific help in an aspect of the
business where they have deep personal experience.
•	 A primary activity of the investor will be to ensure the business
implements formal operational management systems and good
governance processes.
•	 The investor will most likely hold at least one Board seat.
•	 The valuation of the business at the time of the initial investment has to
take into account the risks associated with the investment and therefore
is likely to be much lower than the entrepreneur thinks the business is
worth.
One of the evaluation issues facing the investor is whether the business will
have a financial or strategic exit. Clearly, the financial venture must be able to
prove out an entire business model and be able to convincingly demonstrate a
capability to produce significant growth in revenue and profit. This is in contrast
to a strategic venture which must simply show that it is an ideal acquisition for
a large corporation. While there are a number of attributes which both these
ventures must demonstrate, the hurdle for the financial business is significantly
higher.
For a financial investment to have a serious chance of being successful,
resulting in an IPO or financial trade sale, it needs to show that it can demonstrate
the potential to achieve the revenue and profit levels to provide a good return
on the investment. In order to do so it is almost certainly going to have to satisfy
some basic high growth potential criteria. These include the following;
•	 Clearly identifiable and reachable customer with a compelling need.
•	 An emerging and growing market with significant global potential which
is fragmented and where demand exceeds supply.
•	 A business model with sufficient barriers to entry to protect the business
over the first few years.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

54

<-----Page 72----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

•	 A growth strategy which can achieve the levels of revenue and profit
within 3-7 years to easily sustain the ROI needed by the Investor.
•	 A proven product or service which has clear customer acceptance.
•	 A management team which can demonstrate they have the skills and
experience to execute the growth strategy over the next several years in
conjunction with assistance from the Investor.
•	 A set of shareholders and a management team willing to sell the
business within 3-7 years and walk away if necessary.
•	 A robust exit strategy with a high probability of execution within 3-7
years.
•	 A well-defined plan for the use of the investment funds which is directly
linked to clear and measurable targets which in turn support the exit
strategy.
•	 A robust business strategy and cash flow which can cope with things
going wrong and can still, in the worst case, return the initial investment
to the investor.
•	 A team willing to negotiate a realistic valuation.
For a strategic investment to be successful it must be able to show a highly
probable exit through a strategic trade sale. In the assessment of a strategic
venture, the business needs to demonstrate the potential to achieve the strategic
sale. This means the business should display the following characteristics;
•	 Clearly identifiable and reachable customer with a compelling need.
•	 An emerging and growing market with significant global potential which
is fragmented and where demand exceeds supply or an established
market which would rapidly absorb the firm’s product or service.
•	 A product or service with sufficient barriers to entry to protect the
business over the first few years.
•	 A level of scalability or replication in the product or service which can
generate significant new revenue for the strategic buyer in the first few
years after the trade sale.
•	 A proven product or service which has clear customer acceptance.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 73----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

•	 A management team which can demonstrate that they have the skills
and experience to execute the strategic trade sale over the next several
years in conjunction with assistance from the Investor.
•	 A well-defined plan for the use of the investment funds, which is directly
linked to clear and measurable targets which in turn support the exit
strategy.
•	 A robust business strategy and cash flow which can cope with things
going wrong and can still, in the worst case, return the initial investment
to the investor.
•	 A set of shareholders and a management team willing to sell the
business within 3-7 years and walk away if necessary.
•	 A team willing to negotiate a realistic valuation.
You might argue that it is near impossible to find an early stage venture that
meets either of these sets of criteria. Your proposal to the investor should be
able to demonstrate that you can satisfy one of these business models. You
need to convince them that you and your management team can take them to
a successful exit.
Angels and VC investors generally invest where they can see that the venture
can be developed over a few years to the point where it can be sold to a corporate
buyer or taken to an IPO. Your task as the entrepreneur seeking investment
funds is to convince the investor that, with their funds and assistance, you can
develop the business to achieve the desired exit.
Your investment proposal will need to show that you understand what the
investor wants in an investment opportunity and that you have a business
venture which will satisfy their objectives. In setting out your business venture
you will need to examine a number of areas of the business to show that you
can meet their investment criteria.

The market analysis
There are many marketing texts that you can read which talk about market
segmentation, customer buying patterns, pricing models and so on. Most likely
the Investor will have read those and so understands the jargon. The key to
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

an investable business is more about the execution of a business plan over a
limited period of time to achieve the exit conditions. This might be a stated level
of revenue and profit, rather than developing a sophisticated marketing plan for
market domination. Alternatively, it might be in preparing a product or service
for a strategic buyer’s market. If the life of the venture is to be 3-7 years before
an exit, then very specific targets need to be achieved.
Whether it is the target market of the venture or the target market of the
strategic buyer, it can be expected to have the same fundamental attributes.
The target market definition needs to be very simple, robust, obvious and easily
proven. The ideal model is characterized by the following:
•	 Well-defined, identifiable and easily reachable customers who have a
high compelling need to buy, a willingness and ability to pay the price
and are in sufficient numbers that the revenue targets can be readily
achieved.
•	 A segmented market where it is possible to significantly differentiate the
product or service from competitors and where that differentiation is
difficult to copy or neutralise.
A financial venture would also need to be able to demonstrate the following:
•	 A total market which is growing, has global potential and would be
attractive in the long-term to a major corporation.
•	 A fragmented market which enables growth by acquisition.

The customer
The better business to be in is where the business has a list of all possible
customers for the product or service. Alternatively, the customer can be readily
reached through an established, or readily built, distribution channel. The
investment proposal should be explaining:
•	
•	
•	
•	

the profile of the ideal customer
how contact will be established
what their buying pattern is
how they have the purchasing power to readily meet the sales price.

You see businesses all the time which reach out to the general public in the
hope that they will buy. A retail store, a restaurant and the internet marketing
firm are all hoping they can attract customers. But they have little influence over
the buying cycle. On the other hand, customers which can be clearly identified,
named and are able to be approached with a value proposition are much easier
to sell to. This is not to say that other models are not successful, however, they
generally carry a greater risk.

The compelling need to buy
Few people understand just how hard it is to build a value proposition which
compels a customer to buy. Most products are chosen on a whim, can be readily
deferred or have many alternatives and substitutes.
Example
Distinction Software Inc. a business established in 1994 in Atlanta,
USA, by Dr. Tom McKaskill developed a sales forecasting and inventory
planning system for high volume, low cost consumer packaged goods.
Using prospect data the software could show a 15-30% reduction
in safety stock over a three month period providing an investment
payback of 3-6 months on the software cost. Even though many
corporations expressed interest, few made the investment. Why?
After five years it became apparent that only corporations that
had deep-seated inventory problems were willing to make the
organisational and system changes to implement the software. For the
others, their profitability was high enough that the changes required
to implement the software were simply ‘too hard’. For the software to
work effectively the customer needed to change job responsibilities,
reporting lines and data ownership. The ‘compelling need to buy’ only
existed in a few corporations. For the others, it was a desirable, but
not necessary, thing to do.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

58

<-----Page 76----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

Think about these questions:
What problem is the venture solving?
Is it satisfying a need or a desire?
What degree of compliance (penalty or cost) results from not buying?
What happens if the customer does not buy?
Are there alternatives to the firm’s product or service?
Who is required to solve the problem? What happens to them if they
don’t?

Market characteristics
Historically, most investors have preferred their investee companies to
operate in medium-sized global markets as this will ultimately attract the
corporate acquirer or will be the basis on which to launch an IPO. Investors
now are much more attuned to the need for an exit event and so for them, it is
not whether the market is small or huge, it is simply whether the target market
over the next 3-7 years can provide the firm with the capability to achieve the
valuation required for the investor to exit. In the end, it all comes down to
valuation on exit and ease of exit. The target market may be directly addressable
by the investee firm or could be the target market of a strategic buyer.
For a financial venture, a larger fragmented market where new products
and services can find a reasonable size niche market are preferred by investors
as this is easier to achieve than global domination or a share in a commodity
market. The firm has to demonstrate in its investment request that it can secure
the level of revenue and profits required to achieve the valuation target. Even in
a very large market, a lack of customer demand for the specific offering of the
firm won’t make the target numbers.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

59

<-----Page 77----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

For a strategic venture, it is whether the potential strategic buyer has an
existing market which can be readily addressed or a potential market which
they can exploit.
Basically the entrepreneur must establish, with a reasonable degree of
certainty, that the revenue, cash flow and profit targets of either the firm itself
or the intended buyer can be achieved. This requires a very good understanding
of the marketplace, an understanding of the needs of the customers and some
level of proof that customers will buy in the quantities forecast. This might
be based on existing sales, prospect surveys or expert advice plus experience
within the executive team.
However, in order to show a probable exit path, the requirements of the exit
strategy need also to be shown. An IPO requires the company to confidently
build to, say, a $100 million valuation within three years after listing. Smaller
companies are not excluded from an IPO, in fact many companies smaller
than $100 million are successfully listed; however, they tend to miss out on
attracting institutional investors and in many cases do not attract broker
coverage, accordingly, they present a greater risk to maintain or increase values.
Furthermore, as the management team and the Investor usually have at least
part of their shareholding escrowed for a period of time, the exit value may
ultimately be at prices below the initial listing price. For an IPO exit the firm
needs to confidently show that it can achieve the revenue, cash flow and profit
targets needed to support the share price over a 3-5 year period after listing.
With an IPO exit, hopefully funding through the IPO and subsequent rounds of
public capital raising will fund growth. The business needs to have a very strong
product/market position to fuel growth.
For a financial trade sale exit, the requirements for revenue and profits are
very different. The firm need only show that it can reach the level of revenue
and profits needed to close the trade sale deal. In the case of a strategic trade
sale, revenue and profit targets could be zero or limited, that is, the deal is
based on some other aspect of the business which needs to be achieved, such
as a product development stage. At other times, the acquiring corporation may
want to see a limited number of customers actively using the product as a proof
of design, marketing and operational use.

<-----Page 78----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

In many cases, corporations enter into a strategic trade sale with an emerging
firm to acquire a product which has considerable global potential. In proposing
a trade sale exit strategy, the firm needs to convince the investor of the ultimate
size of the market which would attract the proposed buyers, whether they be
a financial or strategic buyer. Thus market size and competitive positioning
become important, not for the short term, but to secure the ultimate acquirer.
You should explain the structure of the industry and show an analysis of the
market dynamics to demonstrate the business or product potential.
Which companies are growing and why?
Which firms are declining and why?
Is this an emerging market where demand exceeds supply and thus
even poor businesses will survive?
Given the product positioning, which market is the firm attacking and
what retaliation, if any, can the firm expect from the current players?
Is this a market which will attract new entrants and, if so, how will the
firm defend its business from the new competition?

Competitive analysis
Angels and VC investors prefer their investee companies to sell products
or services which are differentiated from their competitors. They like to see
differentiation based on some level of innovation in product, process or business
concept. The innovation itself needs to be difficult to match over the period of
time needed to achieve the exit target.
If an IPO is planned, the product needs to be sufficiently different to be able
to sustain a long-term competitive advantage. This is the only position which
will allow the firm to achieve the revenue, cash flow and profit levels needed to
sustain the share price in the public market.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

61

<-----Page 79----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

In a financial trade sale, the firm has to be able to demonstrate revenue
growth into the medium term. Competitive advantage is going to be a key
aspect of the business case to the buyer.
For a strategic trade sale, competitive position is not as important as being
the right product for an acquisition. However, if you look beyond the acquisition,
you have to deal with the competitive position of the acquiring corporation and
the subsequent merged operations. This means the investment proposal needs
to show how the acquiring corporation would use the firm’s products to secure
significant revenue. Although, this may be in combination with the acquirer’s
other products or by selling the firm’s products into their own customer base.
The competitive analysis needs to show very clearly why the firm’s products
are preferred in some market segments and to demonstrate reasonable proof
of that assertion.

Barriers to entry
Whatever the exit, the future generation of revenue and profit will require the
firm to establish that its products or services which drive revenue generation
and have a level of competitive advantage which itself has a significant degree
of sustainability. This implies a reasonably high level of barriers to entry.
There are two fundamental questions which the entrepreneur needs to
answer:
Why would customers buy our products or services?
What is to stop a competitor from taking the business away from us?

The first question should be supported in the proposal by the product value
proposition, a market analysis, a competitor analysis and the compelling need
to buy. ‘Why you?’ is also an issue of credibility. The firm or the strategic buyer
needs to be able to convince the target customer that they can trust it to deliver
and support the product. In the case of the investee firm, establishing the
product or service in the market may be achieved through the experience of
the team, from existing customer testimonials or through customer trials.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

62

<-----Page 80----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

The second question is simply about protecting the business from erosion
from existing or new competitors. What is to stop a much better funded,
larger, more aggressive competitor from duplicating what the firm has done
and offering greater incentives for their prospects to buy from them? This gets
down to: how is the firm or the strategic buyer going to protect its business?
Protecting the business is achieved by erecting barriers to entry. What can
the firm or the strategic buyer put in place to protect its competitive advantage,
distribution channel, ongoing customer revenue and source of supply.
Barriers to entry have one, or several, of the following attributes:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

high start-up costs
expensive to acquire
takes a long time to acquire
protected by patent, trademark or copyright
restricted under licence, rights or agreements
requires specialised knowledge which itself is in limited supply
highly innovative and not capable of reverse engineering
protected by ongoing customer revenue through high switching costs or
contracts
•	 ownership of or contracted distribution channel
•	 restricted or contracted source of supply.
Strong barriers to entry usually create the basis for a sustainable competitive
advantage. This is also the foundation of any longer term growth strategy for a
public listing. A strategic buyer will need to be convinced that these conditions
can be established by it subsequent to the acquisition.

The management team
The literature in the venture capital area is dominated by the quest for the
‘A team’. This is the super team. The ‘A team’ has done it all before and has
the skills, capabilities and diversity to cope with anything under any conditions.
Regrettably they rarely exist and Angel and VC firms have to put up with business
plan presentations from ordinary mortals.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

63

<-----Page 81----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

However, that is not to say that their objective is wrong. It is simply that
executives who have done it before have probably learnt from their successes
and failures. They are well connected in the industry and are knowledgeable of
other experienced executives and can easily recruit additional team members.
For the Angel or VC investor, it is all about reducing risk. If they can invest in a
well-rounded team with experience, they have a greater chance of achieving
their minimum targets.
The ‘A team’ also brings with them the following:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

a knowledge of Angel and VC investment requirements
willingness to negotiate a realistic valuation
experience with an exit
not as emotionally attached to the ‘product’
networks within the industry and with potential alliance partners.

For the Investor, members of an experienced management team are easier
to deal with and have a good understanding of the funding process.
Although the venture capital market has been operating in Australia and
New Zealand for more than 20 years on a formal basis, there are still very
few experienced management teams which have gone through a formal
private equity investment and exit cycle more than once, unlike the US and
European markets which have floating management teams which move from
one investment with an Angel or VC firm through to an exit and on to another
investment.
Many of the deals brought to the Angel or VC firm for funding simply lack
an experienced set of executives. There can be no question the entrepreneur
brings the idea, the passion, the vision and the energy, but other team members
usually make it work.
When the investor looks over the business plan, they are working on the
activities which need to be executed to deliver the critical targets. This might
be sales, marketing, product development, quality control and so on. For
each of these activities, they want to know who on the team will deliver this
operationally.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

64

<-----Page 82----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

The real test to be applied here is operational. Given where the business is
today, can the team execute, with reasonable confidence, the activities needed
to get them to the exit conditions within the 3-7 year period? In some cases the
investor will be making a judgement as to their own impact on the ability of the
firm to achieve such results. So the fundamental question which the investor
has about the management team is: ‘Can the team and I together achieve the
targets needed to exit?’
For most exits, this will be a trade sale and the management team may not
be needed beyond that. Not all proposals need the 20-year veteran or the
executives recently cashed out from their IPO. In fact, this may be the wrong
team for a clearly defined trade sale exit.
The business proposition also needs to show who is going to deliver on each
of the major activities needed to reach the exit conditions. Any weakness in the
team will need to be addressed by the investor. The management team can be
supplemented with experience from a Board of Directors, a Board of Advisors
and external consultants. Where the management team is not complete, the
Investor will want to see an acknowledgement that the existing management
recognise this deficiency and accept that new talent will need to be recruited to
deliver on the business targets. Some of the founding shareholders may have to
step aside. This is a critical time for entrepreneurs as they need to put together
a team which has a high probability of meeting the targets.

Operations
Day-to-day monitoring of the business is an essential characteristic of a wellrun firm. The firm has to know where it is, what it needs to do and have the
systems, policies and procedures in place to monitor and correct deficiencies.
The reason why Angels often become involved in early stage ventures is
because it is this experience they can bring to the venture. From their past
experience with start-up and high growth revenue ventures, they have learned
the importance of being well informed and taking remedial action early.
Operational systems include all the budgeting, financial and operational
reporting systems, performance setting and monitoring processes, and systems
and reward schemes which encourage the right behaviour. High growth
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

65

<-----Page 83----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

businesses are finely tuned because they consume cash in building capacity.
They have little room for mistakes and therefore early warning systems and
quick response systems are very important.
At the same time, the business must manage its contractual risks. Well
written contracts with customers and suppliers, well-designed contracts of
employment, well documented intellectual property ownership and assignment
are all components of good management of risks.

Product development
It is unlikely that an investor will ever know as much about the product as
the entrepreneur and his team. Even if they have a technical background, this
can be out-of-date quickly and they are rarely in a position to adequately judge
the quality of the product development systems or the reasonableness of the
timescales. This is therefore a high exposure area for the investor. To overcome
this limitation, the entrepreneur will need to show adherence to budgets
and targeted timescales, or show how the available products are capable of
producing the results required. The entrepreneur must accept that keeping
development costs under control and meeting development timescales is
critical to ensuring the investors ongoing financial support.

Later Stage Investments
More mature firms with established management, proven products and
demonstrable revenue streams, often seek funds for market expansion, filling
out product portfolios, acquisitions or working capital. Such firms offer a very
different risk profile to the private equity investor compared to a start-up or
early stage venture. However, such investments are not without their risks.
Firms often seek external private equity finance because they don’t have the
tangible assets needed by traditional banking lenders. Thus the ‘assets’ which
underwrite the funding are often ‘soft’, such as patents, brands, copyrights or
simply a good business model. As such, they are harder to value and often hard

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

66

<-----Page 84----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

to liquidate. Even so, they may be good revenue generating assets and can
provide some level of comfort to the investor.
The investor is still concerned with an exit. He will need to balance two
opposing concerns, the upside potential of the business and the risks of failure.
The upside opportunity will be presented in terms of building market share,
establishing overseas offices and penetrating existing markets with additional
products. However, the risk will be in the execution. Does the team have the
skills and experience to deliver the target numbers? Will the market support
their growth?
With more mature enterprises, the investor has a much greater body
of evidence to examine how well the company performs strategically and
operationally. The investor will still need to conduct extensive due diligence to
uncover any weaknesses or risks. Established products and relationships can be
examined to determine market potential and service excellence.
Many entrepreneurs seek finance at this level to provide a boost to their
business so they can reach a size and profitability where they can convert equity
to debt or take the company to an IPO. This recapitalisation enables them to
gain larger critical mass while at the same time gaining back the equity passed
to the investor as part of the financing deal. The entrepreneur is betting they
can generate the level of security needed to fund debt within a relatively short
period of time (3-7 years) to take out the investor.
Entrepreneurs are often reluctant to part with equity, seeing this as loss
of control and/or loss of upside potential. However, a deal which allows the
entrepreneur to redeem the investor’s shares at some agreed formula can be a
very attractive method of building up the business with an opportunity to buy
back the external equity. Expansion finance which is used to build up tangible
assets, decrease revenue and profit volatility or increase the portfolio of revenue
sources, can provide a platform for negotiating debt to repay an investor.
Entrepreneurs interested in short-term equity investment with redeemable
options need to have a clear focus on the security requirements for debt
finance. These factors then need to be built firmly into the business plan with
the agreement of the investor. Even partial redemption, swapping some equity
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

67

<-----Page 85----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

for debt, during the investment period, may be an attractive option for both
parties.
However, the entrepreneur still needs to accept that there is a potential pitfall
in bringing in an investor. An investee firm which fails to meet agreed targets
or fails to generate sufficient free cash to fund debt obligations is still subject
to intervention by the investor. The investment agreement would normally
allow the investor to take action if the investment is in trouble. No business
is entirely free of risk, even if this is external to the firm and even to their
marketplace. The entrepreneur seeking later stage financing cannot guarantee
they can recapitalise or take the business to an IPO. Failure to provide a liquidity
opportunity for the investor will result in intervention by the investor to ensure
that there is an exit opportunity while the business still has real worth. This will
often result in the firm being sold in a trade sale.
In more mature businesses, the investor is likely to play a very different
role than that undertaken in early stage ventures. Where early stage ventures
typically need advice and direction in moving the business to profit, growth
and sustainability, later stage businesses often only need help at the Board
level. Their needs are more likely to be advice on strategy and creating the right
foundation for an IPO or major trade sale. Good governance, good reporting
systems and a structure which reduces internal risks need to be developed.
Investors in larger ventures often assist with global expansion, help establish
strategic relationships and assist with VC rounds.

The Investment Proposal
Any request for Angel or VC finance should have a comprehensive business
plan. It is not that the investor could not understand the business from a
discussion or presentation, it is just that it is more efficient in the long run
for the entrepreneur to have it all documented in advance. The investor can
then reject it with a quick glance at the executive summary, review it prior to a
meeting, use it to open discussions with other co-investors and use it to drive
the due diligence process if they wish to proceed.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

68

<-----Page 86----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

The general view is that, if the entrepreneur cannot put together a good
business plan explaining every aspect of their business, they probably don’t
understand the business well enough to grow it to the point the investor
desires. Part of the entry test for investment is that the entrepreneur have the
necessary literacy, numeracy and communication skills to run the business. The
business plan is one of the tests they need to pass.
The major benefit to the investor of the business plan is to provide an
opportunity for the management team to demonstrate they can build a model
of the business which an outsider can understand. The model needs to be
holistic. It has to explain every aspect of the business in sufficient detail to show
that they understand how all the parts have to work together over time.
The investor is being asked to invest considerable funds in a business which
they are trying to understand. It is unlikely that they will ever understand the
business as well as the entrepreneur and the management team. Since the
investment is only for a short period, say 3-7 years, they need to see a strong
possibility of a trade sale or an IPO during that time. What the entrepreneur
needs to demonstrate in the investment proposal, in non-technical terms, is
that he or she can achieve those objectives.
Most business plans are simply projections of the past. It is simply Excel
madness. It is almost as if, by putting the data into Excel and projecting it
forward for three years, it will happen. Of course it may. But that would be
more hope than strategy. Forecasts need to be based on a set of realistic and
defensible assumptions. For many entrepreneurs, the business plan is an
expression of what they would like to happen. They work backwards from what
they would like to happen to establish the growth rate that will get them there.
Alternatively, they use a set of assumptions which seem reasonable and build
their business plan on those assumptions. This is often presented as the classic
‘percentage of the market’ plan: ‘The market is huge and we only need 2% of
the market to be a $100 million business.’
However, most often this is not supported by any validation that the customers
will buy the firm’s products or that they will buy in the volumes asserted. The
business plan needed by an Angel or VC firm has a very specific purpose. It is to

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

69

<-----Page 87----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

convince the investor that the firm can deliver the objectives they have for the
use of their money. Put simply, that means:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

a 25% plus ROI
known expansion opportunities
an exit via an IPO or trade sale in 3-7 years
identified potential trade buyers
limited support required
relatively low risk.

Many entrepreneurs think the purpose of Angel or VC finance is to help them
grow their business, or they think that the investment is simply another form
of finance that will help them overcome some constraint within their business.
What they fail to appreciate is that Angel and VC finance is specifically designed
with certain objectives in mind which can only be achieved by developing the
business so that the investor can achieve a good return on their investment
usually through an exit event in a relatively short period. The purpose of the
business plan is to prove that those objectives can be met.
The business plan the entrepreneur needs to produce should have the
following three components:
Where is the venture now and what is the growth opportunity?
What is the exit strategy?
How are they going to achieve it?

The business plan should also include details of the management team
and their capacity to deal with the business development strategy along with
the how the funds sought are going to be utilised in support of the business
objectives.
Where is the venture now?
The entrepreneur should have a well-articulated business opportunity which
needs Angel or VC finance in order for it to be achieved. So the first part of the
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

70

<-----Page 88----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

proposal for Angel or VC finance should be about the business opportunity and
the extent to which it has been validated.
It is almost always going to be the case that the entrepreneur will think only
in terms of building a financial business. They will seek to generate significant
revenue and profit to justify the Investment. It is highly unlikely that they will
have thought of an IPO or a Strategic Trade Sale exit or be able to show how this
could be achieved. Their inclination will almost always be to prove a traditional
business model concept. What they need to do is to switch focus and show how
the exit will be achieved.
The proposal should demonstrate the strength of the growth potential of the
underlying product or service as this will be critical for an IPO or trade sale exit.
The entrepreneur should be explaining the following :
•	 What is the business concept?
•	 What is the size of the target market and how will the firm secure its
share?
•	 Who is the customer?
•	 What is the benefit to the customer and where is the compelling need?
•	 What price and why?
•	 How is the product or service distributed to the customer?
•	 What is the competitive advantage?
•	 How is sustainability of the business achieved?
If the business is already operational, the existing business should be able
to demonstrate the operational aspects of the business model. This should
validate the product/market information, the financial aspects of the business
and the management team’s capabilities. If there is a strategic exit opportunity,
this information may deal with how the strategic buyer would execute on some
of these elements.
In summary, the investor needs to be convinced that this is a good business
with a good idea or strategy, is well run and has a good chance of achieving the
financial or strategic exit required.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

71

<-----Page 89----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

What is the exit strategy?
Most Angels and VC firms have similar objectives for their investments. While
they enjoy the involvement with emerging companies, they want their money
back with a 25% plus ROI within 3-7 years. Therefore, the investment proposal
should clearly set out how much Angel or VC finance will be needed and how
the investor will achieve that objective.
The investor needs to know which exit strategy is being proposed and why.
Potential multiple exit opportunities are even better as they bring flexibility
and reduced reliance on equity market cycles. The vast majority of firms simply
cannot meet the attributes of an IPO. For others, the IPO strategy cannot be
met with their existing business model and it will take a number of acquisitions
to create the right IPO vehicle. Only very few will have the right mix of products,
markets and potential to undertake an IPO and also meet revenue and profit
targets for several years beyond. Since an IPO generally achieves a much higher
ROI than a financial trade sale, the IPO strategy should be followed. However,
a trade sale alternative should be articulated in the proposal for periods where
the market is unreceptive for an IPO.
For the trade sale exit, the entrepreneur should be setting out a comprehensive
road map for how the sale will be achieved. This should include identification
of specific potential buyers, the tactics which will be employed to develop
relationships with each and an estimate of the likely sales price.
How are you going to get there?
The business plan is simply about execution. The business is at point A (now)
and it needs to get to point B (the exit), what are you proposing to do to get
there? You need to set out exactly how you are going to put the strategy in place
over the 3-7 year timescale.
Some Angels prefer to keep it simple. Knowing that the management team
is somewhat green and need help to develop the business, they need to ask:
Exactly what are you going to do with my money?

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

72

<-----Page 90----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

Say you are a $1 million revenue business. To get to the exit point, you may
need to grow the business to $4 million. Alternatively, you may need to complete
product development or establish trial customers to prove the product. How
are they going to do it? It is not simply an extrapolation of the numbers. You
need produce operational plans for every part of the business.
•	

A detailed marketing plan
–	 Size, growth, customer profile, competition
–	 Promotion, advertising, PR plans
–	 Proof of effectiveness

•	

A sales plan
–	 Closure rates, remuneration plan
–	 Recurring business revenue and targeted prospects
–	 Sales targets and recruitment and training plan

•	

An R&D plan
–	 Product development and release milestones
–	 Quality assurance, recruitment and training plan
–	 Equipment plan

And so on.
There is nothing wrong with an entrepreneur admitting they need help to
develop such a detailed plan, but the investor is likely to delay making any
substantial commitment until a proper business plan is in place, even if they
help develop it. Only by getting down to this level of detail will you understand
just how much finance and effort you need, but also, just how likely the business
is to succeed.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

73

<-----Page 91----->Chapter 5: A Compelling Investment Opportunity

Before committing to the investment, the investor will need to review every
part of the plan and see exactly what each manager will be doing to contribute
to the overall plan. The business plan should also set out an organisational
plan (including recruitment and training) and plans for office accommodation,
manufacturing and warehousing space, infrastructure and finance. A set of
projected financial statements should be available.
An investor will ask; ‘Show me exactly how these revenue numbers are going
to be made?’ They may want to see a breakdown of forward revenue projections
for both recurring revenue and new business. The recurring revenue should
be supported by actual contracts with customers. The new business should be
supported by a prospect generation and sales closure plan that targets specific
customers or specific channels and so on.
The more you can show you really understand how to make the targets
and you have the people, systems and processes in place to do so, the more
convincing your plan will be.
At the same time, the growth plans may call for new management positions
to be filled, in which case an executive recruitment plan should be included in
the plan.

Which business plan layout
There are many examples of conventional business plan structures in
textbooks and on the internet. Those offered by VC firms are good guidelines
for the content. However, it is the way it is put together that is important.
Remember that the business plan should be about how you are going to meet
the investor’s objectives, not how you are going to meet yours.
For an insight into how a typical VC business plan might be structured, review
the description provided on the British Venture Capital Association website in
the document A Guide to Private Equity (see http://www.bAngela.co.uk/).

Exit Strategies

There are two major paths to a successful exit of the firm. One is to sell the
firm. This might be to another business (trade sale), usually a corporation in a
similar or related field or to another Angel or VC Fund (secondary buy out), or to
a wealthy individual. The second path is to list the firm on the stock exchange,
an initial public offering (IPO).

Initial Public Offering
The requirements for listing a firm are quite onerous and expensive. Unless
the listing results in a share price which can maintain a position at least as
good as the sector index, the listing will not achieve an exit the shareholders
anticipated (assuming the shareholders hold shares in the listed company). Just
having liquidity of the shares via a market listing does not in itself guarantee
the value achieved by the shareholders will be greater than an outright sale to
a corporation.
Some private companies undertake an IPO, or a back-door listing (acquire
an existing but dormant publicly listed corporation), with the intention of using
it to raise funds or to sell shares. Typically, back-door listings are done with
smaller companies. However, unless the size of the shareholding in public hands
is significant, generally thought to be above $100 million, there is insufficient
liquidity to create a market to sell shares.

<-----Page 93----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

The table below shows the types of characteristics which best suit an Initial
Public Offering (excluding speculative ventures such as biotechnology and
resource ventures).
Attribute

		Requirements for long-term attractive public listing

Revenue	

$20 million plus ($100 million plus the most successful).

Net profit 	

Profitable for three years with minimum of $2 million in the year prior to
listing. Projected profits growing over next few years.

Scope	

National or international markets.

Portfolio	

Range of products with some in different markets.

Potential	

Major national leadership or global markets.

Management	

Majority with public corporation experience and some with experience in
larger corporations.

Board	

Significant industry and public corporation experience.

CEO	

Able to deal with market analysts, institutions and shareholders.

R&D	

Products in various stages of development to ensure continued market
leadership.

Cash	

Sufficient funds to meet forecast plans without further capital raisings.

Funds use	

Funds raised to be used for market development, innovation, overseas
expansion, acquisitions, working capital, repayment of debt.

Advantage	

Clear competitive advantage based on strong intellectual property and/or
proven innovative business model.

	

	

	

	
	

Public awareness 	Products and their benefits are easily understood by the public.
Support	
	
	

Listed shares are large enough in value and number in institutional and
public ownership to encourage market analysts to track the stock. Generally
this means a market capitalisation of at least $100 million.

Since few companies in private ownership can meet these requirements, an
exit strategy aimed at an IPO is not a viable option for most privately held firms.
That is not to say the smaller companies cannot exit through an IPO, but the
above provides the best foundations for success.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

76

<-----Page 94----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

Generally it will take a minimum of $500,000 in legal and accounting expenses
for even the smallest and simplest IPO. According to KPMG Corporate Finance’s
2004 Australian Capital Markets survey, the average cost of raisings up to $10
million was 10.1%, falling to 4.7% for raisings greater than $500 million. If only
a small amount is to be raised, this cost is very high for the funds received. At
the same time, an IPO usually involves significant work for the top executives.
This has often been thought to be 50% of the CEO and CFO’s time over the
six months prior to the IPO. This is a very significant burden on the firm and
requires the rest of the management team to bear the burden of day-to-day
management during this time. A USA listing would be more expensive in annual
expenses due to the greater disclosure requirements.
The overall consensus of private equity advisors is that only four factors are
considered key to a successful IPO. The first factor is the venture should have a
strong competitive advantage and sufficient growth potential to achieve a $100
million capitalisation value within about five years of listing. Neither the current
level of revenue or profit is considered significant compared to anticipated
revenue and profit. This factor also goes a long way to explaining why low
growth firms which have low margins either don’t make it to the exchange or
have to be significantly larger before they can.
The next major factor is the depth and experience of the management team
and the industry experience of the Board of Directors. Again this is not surprising
when you consider that the shareholders are backing a group of individuals to
take them to the size necessary to support the $100 million capitalisation. A
new management team or one which has significant technical depth but little
management depth is not going to be received well.
Knowledge of the IPO process itself by the management team is a major
factor. This demonstrates just how important the roadshow to the brokers
and the presentations to institutional investors are. Achieving significant share
purchase commitments up-front is almost a necessary condition for a float.
Knowledge of retail and institutional investor risk and return requirements and
being able to convincingly show growth potential is an imperative. Investors are
typically risk-averse and will quickly zero in on potential risks in the venture.
The management team must be able to convincingly demonstrate knowledge
of their business, their industry and how to mitigate possible risks.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

77

<-----Page 95----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

Finally the firm must have the best possible advisors. The best advisors and
investment bankers are expected to have the best due diligence processes,
require the highest standards of preparation but also carry the highest level of
credibility to the market. They are also very selective in who they represent.
Too many entrepreneurs see an IPO as a means of solving their own business
problems rather than seeing it as a means where retail and institutional
investors achieve a return on their investment. Without gaining the support of
a significant number of retail investors and/or support from some institutional
investors, the firm is likely to push themselves onto the market by satisfying the
minimum listing conditions and then find that just being publicly listed does
not solve their inherent problems. As we have seen many times – the market
penalises those which don’t perform. In many cases, these firms would have
been better to wait until they had more robust growth potential before listing.
It may not be possible for the major shareholders to exit at the time of the
IPO or even within some years. Markets are very wary of public issues where the
key managers sell off their shares completely. In a situation where the results
are not achieved subsequent to a sale of shares, the inside shareholders could
also face legal charges of insider trading.
A firm which wants to undertake an IPO exit needs to build the IPO profile
above. So, to the extent that it cannot meet the requirements within the existing
business, the additional attributes need to be developed or acquired. With 3-7
years to execute the IPO strategy and especially with Angel and VC financing,
a firm may be able to achieve the necessary characteristics given the right
starting point. Many companies which attract funding have already identified
strategic acquisition opportunities to bring economies of scale and growth to
the company.
In some sectors, building a company via acquisitions is a possible strategy.
Certainly in the years 2002 and 2003, firms in the biotechnology sector in
Australia needed to undertake consolidation to gain additional resilience,
product portfolio spread and critical mass. Too many biotechnology firms were
undercapitalised, had very narrow product ranges and too little revenue spread
from licensing to longer-term production products.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

78

<-----Page 96----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

Often in emerging markets there will be several firms with complementary
products, often selling to the same customers or working with the same alliance
partners. These could be brought together to provide a platform for an IPO
vehicle. However, there needs to be an obvious and demonstratable synergy
between the products and the firms. Just lumping a number of firms together
to reach the revenue and profit targets is unlikely to convince the institutional
investors they are investing in a sound platform of future growth.
At the same time that the underlying product portfolio is being built, the
firm needs to construct a management team capable of running a growing
public corporation. Public corporation experience, experience with larger
corporations, deep experience in the industry and a good track record, are all
essential characteristics for the IPO management team.
The IPO strategy needs to show, in considerable detail, how the IPO prospect
profile will be achieved. Underpinning the plan should be documented
representations from respected accountants, lawyers, bankers and brokers who
are willing to work with the firm on building the IPO strategy.

Trade Sale
Most Angels and VC Investors exit or harvest their investment through a sale
to another firm. This is called a trade sale.
Where possible, the Investor will seek a strategic trade sale to order to meet
or exceed their return on investment (ROI) needs. A strategic sale occurs when
the value placed on the business exceeds its fair market value (FMV). The FMV
is most often determined by looking at the current business as an investment by
an independent investor looking for a return on their money. The current profit
is taken as indicative of the ongoing profitability of the firm and ROI. Since few
owner/managers operate the business to maximise profits, this will normally
undervalue the business.
A conventional sale based on an EBIT multiple would certainly be attractive
to an Investor if a strategic sale was not possible. In that situation, attention
needs to be given to increasing operating profit, decreasing risk and establishing
a growth potential in order to secure the best price.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

79

<-----Page 97----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

However, normally a strategic sale can be expected to achieve a sale price
considerably above a conventional sale price. The key to a strategic sale is to
find a corporate buyer which has a need for the assets and/or capabilities of the
firm. This strategic fit can come from any number of possible areas:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

customer base
distribution channel
brands
patents, trademarks, licences
key employees
access to specialised knowledge and so on.

Strategic buyers most often come from within the industry in which the firm
is operating. They can be suppliers, customers, alliance partners, joint venture
partners or competitors. Sometimes the sale will be to a corporation not in
the sector. They may want to acquire a presence in a market/geography as a
foothold or may wish to diversify.
The Proactive Sale Strategy developed by the author defines a process which
can be used for financial and strategic trade sales. This methodology has five
major components:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

alignment of interests
due diligence and good governance
creating value for the buyer
selecting buyers
building relationships with potential buyers.

(a) Alignment of interests

In order to be prepared for a trade sale, especially when there is time
pressure to set up and consummate a deal, the various stakeholders need to
agree on the possible outcome. There is little point in progressing a deal if the
Directors cannot agree on what they want, or the shareholders cannot agree on
a reasonable price. A negotiator cannot go into a meeting to secure a deal if the
interests of the major stakeholders are unclear. Experienced Investors usually
have the Board focused on exit strategies from the first Board meeting.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

80

<-----Page 98----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

The major stakeholders who are critical to executing a deal are:
•	
•	
•	
•	

members of the Board of Directors
management
Investor along with other shareholders
key employees.

The Investor needs to ensure that all stakeholders are focused in regard
to the two extreme situations: a forced sale due to decline in the viability of
the business or a planned sale over a longer term. Once the CEO has a list of
requirements, opinions, conditions and issues which need to be considered,
he/she can start to bring all elements together to arrive at a strategy which
could be followed in these two extreme situations.
(b) Due diligence and governance

Nothing kills a deal quicker than an uncertain or immeasurable risk. Many
people think the valuation on sale is due simply to revenue and profit. What
happens in practice is the buyer conducts an extensive due diligence into every
aspect of the firm’s operations in order to uncover actual or potential problems,
risk and liabilities. Since each of these requires time and funds to resolve, the
offered price is likely to fall as the review goes forward. At some point the risk,
time and cost to fix the problems become so great that a deal is not possible.
The task of the Board from a directional perspective together with the CEO
from an operational perspective is to establish the firm and its operations to
minimise risks to the buyer. This includes putting into effect such things as:
•	 Standardised and documented contracts with customers and
suppliers.
•	 Industry standard terms of employment, benefits and entitlements.
•	 Full ownership and tracking of intellectual property.
•	 Full compliance with industry, health, safety and environmental
regulations.
•	 Comprehensive reporting, budgeting and planning systems.
•	 Policies, procedures and processes covering critical aspects of the
operations.
•	 Industry knowledgeable accountants and lawyers.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

81

<-----Page 99----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

The key to passing a business to a buyer is to put yourself in the buyer’s
shoes and think through the integration and operations of the business after
the acquisition. The task of the CEO and management team is to ensure that
the business can operate effectively after the acquisition without imposing an
undue burden on the buyer.
Included in the planning for a sale should be a consideration of the roles of the
key employees. In most acquisitions some roles will change, some staff will be
made redundant and some key employees are needed to ensure a transition of
knowledge. How can you ensure that this process happens without disruption?
This means determining retention terms for some, redundancy packages for
others and incentives for all staff to make the transition happen as smoothly as
possible.
(c) Creating value for the buyer

In a financial exit, the firm needs to create value through the generation
of future net earnings. Preparation for sale would focus on improving internal
processes, reducing expenses, increasing revenue and margins, adding revenue
growth and then seeking out opportunities for potential growth.
Strategic acquisitions occur because a corporation has a need for some asset
or capability which the firm has. Generally this is something which the firm
already leverages to create its own competitive position. As part of the Strategic
Sale Strategy, the Entrepreneur needs to think carefully through the operations
of the business and isolate those things it has and those things it does which
could be used by a large corporation to resolve a threat or generate significant
new revenue.
Assets or capabilities which create strategic value should be based on one, or
several, of the following characteristics:
•	 difficult or time-consuming to copy
•	 protected by patents, trademarks or copyright
•	 only available through licensing or registration which is limited in
supply
•	 unknown due to confidentiality or trade secrets
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

82

<-----Page 100----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

•	 requires specialist knowledge to acquire or utilise
(d) Selecting buyers

Financial buyers are often corporations undertaking a roll-up or consolidation
strategy. They are looking for well managed firms in their sector which can add
revenue and profit to group earnings.
A strategic buyer is a corporation which is prepared to pay a premium over fair
market value because the business solves a critical problem for them or offers
them a good opportunity for additional revenue and profit. The best strategic
buyers are ones which can exploit an opportunity by offering a unique product
on a much larger scale than the firm is able to with its limited resources. The
Investor should look for corporations which can overcome whatever constraint
is holding back the business.
Buyers normally come from within the industry, so start by listing companies
in the same industry as the investee firm. You then need to select those
companies which have the capacity and experience to do the deal. Corporations
with experience at acquisitions and which have ample size and funding are
much easier to deal with. The ideal buyer will typically be at least 8 times the
size of the seller.
(e) Building relationship with potential buyers

Trade sales are mostly made between parties which already have some
knowledge of each other. This could be informally through networking functions,
between prior colleagues or could be a formal trading relationship such as a
partner or distributor. Other relationships can exist through Boards of Directors
or Boards of Advisors or equity participation. The key to a trade sale for an
Angel or VC funded company, as with any other company, is to be prepared.
Any early stage venture is going to experience some turbulence and not
everything will go according to plan. In terms of exit preparation think of the
situations you may experience.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

83

<-----Page 101----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

1. You need to sell
Not everything is going to go according to plan. Sometimes market conditions
change and the business is no longer capable of reaching the targets initially
set or may no longer be viable. Rather than let the firm become insolvent or
bankrupt, the exit plan should be established early so that there is little delay
in executing a trade sale. This way the maximum benefit can still be extracted
from the failing business.
Often time is against you. If the management team has not put an exit
strategy in place, they will have little time to prepare or to initiate discussions
with potential buyers. If they have not set up the relationships in advance,
especially with overseas buyers, it probably is not going to happen the way
you would like. Without planning, the ability to attract a buyer who will pay a
premium value for the company is significantly constrained.
By setting up relationships in advance and by knowing why the corporation
would want to buy the firm and who to deal with inside the potential buyer,
management can execute the acquisition discussion quickly. As long as the firm
has several potential buyers, competitive tension in the deal can still result in a
very attractive sale price.
2. The firm is approached with an offer to buy
Many Angel and VC funded firms are targets for acquisitive corporations.
However, when the offer comes management may be unprepared. They are
often unsure of an appropriate price. If management is unprepared and needs
to go through extensive due diligence, this not only takes considerable time, but
it uncovers risks to the buyer. Instead of closing a good deal the firm will end up
with a disrupted business, staff who are stressed due to uncertainty and a price
the shareholders would normally not have accepted. Management may also
have talked themselves into the deal. Management will have taken their eyes
off the ball and will have much to do to recover.
How much better would the situation be if the firm had already lined up
several possible buyers? They can now announce that they are prepared to sell
and take on all offers. Management will have prepared the due diligence files
and can execute the deal quickly with little disruption. The staff understand the
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

84

<-----Page 102----->Chapter 6: Exit Strategies

process and have incentives to ensure the best deal is done. The exit strategy
should be canvassed with staff from an early stage so they understand the
objectives of the Investor as a shareholder in the company.
3. The Investor and management decide to sell
Experienced Investors and good management should already know of the
best potential buyers and through business operations should already be in
a position to actually know those parties. If management have prepared the
company for sale over many years, they are best placed to drive the exit process
rather than have it drive them. The Investor and management simply need to
decide on the timing.
It is a highly desirable characteristic of Angel or VC funding that the Investor
exits the investment within a relatively short period. Few Investors like to have
their funds tied up for more than five years in a venture. If the prospective
investee firm articulates a viable and well-articulated strategy for a trade sale
going into the funding negotiations, it will greatly improve their case and the
Investor’s confidence for achieving the Investor’s exit objectives.
With the trade sale exit strategy outlined here, you can be reasonably assured
that you will gain the best price you can and know the corporation doing the
buying will make more money out of it in the future. If the Investor has a very
good idea of the trade sale exit opportunity, he can spend the time assisting
management to develop the business and build a strong case for the buyer. This
focus makes it easier for the Investor and the entrepreneur to work together
since they have clearly defined common objectives.
This process is well proven. If you think of the firms you have seen sold at
large premiums, you will always find they created significant value for the buyer.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

Preparing for the
Investment

R

aising VC funds is a process that will involve several parties. The smart
entrepreneur wants the best investor, however, the best ones don’t go
looking for investment, they attract them from known and trusted business
colleagues. To find the right Angel or VC investor, the entrepreneur needs to build
up a network of knowledgeable contacts within the investment community. The
process may well start with a local professional advisor and then extend through
more experienced advisors to the ultimate Angel or VC investors.
Professional advisors help to educate the entrepreneur, prepare him or her for
the evaluation and the negotiation and ensure that the ultimate deal is fair for
both parties. In the end, there is no substitute for quality – both in the professional
advice and in the Investor that the entrepreneur ultimately works with.
Only a small number of entrepreneurs will ever raise Angel and Venture
Capital finance once and even fewer do it several times. Therefore
very few have built up knowledge of the venture capital investment process.
Working with professional advisors who participate in these transactions on a
regular basis can provide the entrepreneur with insight into how best to prepare
for discussions with the Investor. Not only can this save time but it should lead
to a better deal for the entrepreneur. The professional services firm should be
able to provide introductions to better investors, ensure that the deal is fair and

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

86

<-----Page 104----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

reasonable and set the right expectations up front so that all parties understand
how best to work together for mutual gain.
Accessing the right Angel or VC firm is also an important part of the investment
process. Not all Angels or VC firms have the same capabilities, networks and
capacity to work effectively with the entrepreneur. Finding the right one can be
critical to the ultimate success of the venture.

The professional accounting and advisory firm
The type of advice and help which a professional accounting firm can provide
includes assistance in the following areas:
Valuation
The services firm can assist the entrepreneur to prepare a valuation of the
business either prior to the investment or at the anticipated exit. If the firm
has prepared a valuation of the current business and projected valuation of
the business at the proposed exit point, this will contribute considerably to
the equity share discussion with the Investor. The advisory firm can assist in
the preparation of the valuation or review the financial projections for the
entrepreneur, check the completeness and accuracy of the information and
review the underlying assumptions and values.
Checking the business plan
The business plan is the foundation document which will be used by the
investor to evaluate the investment. It is important that the business plan be
prepared thoroughly, be properly explained and contain the information needed
by the Investor to undertake due diligence on the opportunity. The advisory firm
can review the business plan and show where additional information is needed.
Reviewing financials
Current financials need to be prepared according to generally accepted
accounting principles and presented in a conventional format which allows easy
analysis. The accountant can ensure that the statements are prepared correctly
and the accompanying data fully supports a detailed investigation.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

87

<-----Page 105----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

Advice on use of debt and equity structures
The business may be able to support some level of debt as well as an equity
investment. Using debt should reduce the equity share which the firm would
give to the Investor. The advisors may also be able to show where cash may be
better managed in working capital, accounts receivable and accounts payable
to reduce financing needs as well as provide independent advice on debt fees
and terms.
Helping with introductions and referrals
Well-established advisory firms participate regularly in transactions involving
Angels and VC funds. This would include investments, acquisitions, trade sales
and IPOs. They are, therefore, in a good position to know local Angels and VC
funds on a personal basis and certainly by reputation. The advisory firm can
assist with preparing information on the firm for an investment proposal and
assist with Angel and VC introductions. An accounting firm can help short list
the Investors to approach and can help with introductions or referrals. Since
many Angels and VC funds only deal with referred proposals, this can make
a big difference in accessing quality Investors. It can also assist in getting an
opportunity to the top of the pile as advisory firms act as a pre-reader of
opportunities and provide a deal flow which expects a timely response from
the better investors.
Reviewing term sheets
While term sheets are typically set out in a conventional format, the
Entrepreneur may wish the advisory firm to review the term sheet before it is
sent back to the Investor.
Assisting in negotiations
The Entrepreneur who is represented by a well-established and respected
advisory firm is likely to be better prepared for the negotiation. At the same
time, the Entrepreneur should expect that the Investor will be equally
represented by their own advisory firm who would be familiar with private
equity transactions. The terms and conditions of the investment should be
reviewed by a knowledgeable party so that the Entrepreneur knows that the
terms of the investment are reasonable and standard. This should result in more
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

88

<-----Page 106----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

productive discussions and is likely to be better for the ongoing relationship
between the parties. Investors prefer to deal with entrepreneurs who are
represented by a professional firm as they know that the entrepreneur will not
need to be educated about the investment terms and conditions, the required
rate of return, management controls and exit requirements of the Investor.
Due diligence
Due diligence will be carried out by the Investor as part of the initial
evaluation of the investment opportunity. This is mostly a product/market
evaluation to see if the business environment can support the projections of
the firm. After the term sheet is issued, the Investor will carry out an extensive
review to further assure he has a thorough understanding of the business and
the management and has uncovered any data discrepancies and investment
risks. The professional advisory firm can help the Entrepreneur prepare for a
due diligence investigation by identifying any problems, risks and deficiencies
which need to be addressed.
Advice on pensions, options schemes and remuneration
The professional advisory firm can review these before an investment is
made to ensure the current remuneration and benefits are fair and reasonable
and provide the most positive basis for the planned exit.
Tax advice
The firm can expect to change significantly over the period of the investment
and beyond the exit. Their current tax planning may not be suitable for such
changes. The accountant can review the current business processes for
compliance, tax collection and reporting.
Exit strategy assistance
A well-articulated and probable exit strategy needs to be prepared as part
of the business plan. If this has not already been prepared by the entrepreneur,
the advisors can help to define acquisition value, identify potential buyers and/
or show how the firm can best position itself for an IPO or a trade sale exit.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

89

<-----Page 107----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

Commercial review of agreements
The accounting firm can review legal agreements to ensure they are
commercially acceptable. This review should also be done in conjunction with
the firm’s legal representatives.

The professional legal firm
The type of advice and assistance which a professional legal firm can provide
includes the following:
Review share purchase agreement
The share purchase agreement would normally be prepared by the Investor’s
lawyers. This is a complex legal document which few entrepreneurs will have
ever seen and certainly few would understand at any depth. The professional
legal firm can review the document, explain the terms and conditions to the
entrepreneur and work with the Investor’s legal representative to finalise the
agreement.
Prepare warranties and indemnities
The firm would normally be expected to provide warranties, representations
and indemnities to the investor. The professional legal firm can prepare
the warranties and representations and indemnities documents for the
Entrepreneur.
Review new employment agreements
The Investor should expect the key executives to enter into employment
agreements and will expect to have significant control over their remuneration.
Those agreements would normally contain restraint of trade and/or noncompete clauses. The professional legal firm can review these agreements.
Prepare disclosure letter
The firm should be prepared to disclose any issues which may affect the
decision of the Investor. It should also identify any potential risks of the business.
The professional legal firm can prepare the these disclosures and advise the
Entrepreneur how to deal with theses in the negotiation.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

90

<-----Page 108----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

Review corporate documents
As part of the preparation for investment, the professional legal firm will
review the corporate documents which authorize the firm to undertake business
to ensure that it meets the requirements of the Investor. This review would
normally extend to board minutes, shareholder agreements, option schemes
and any material contracts the firm has entered into.
The Entrepreneur should plan for 5-10% of the money invested to be spent
in professional services fees, noting that smaller deals are likely to have a larger
percentage of advisor’s fees.
Not all professional services firms have the necessary experience to
undertake this type of work effectively. An Entrepreneur seeking their first
investment should not assume that their current professional services provider
has the expertise to properly advise him in this area. Before starting to incur
costs for this service, the Entrepreneur should undertake some due diligence
and investigate the extent to which the firm has a track record of success
advising Entrepreneurs seeking investment from Angels or VCs. Asking for
references would not be unreasonable and they also should be asked for a
list of transactions which the firm has participated in and some details of the
work performed for the clients involved. The Entrepreneur should also ensure
that the expertise is still with the firm and ask to be allocated an advisor with
personal experience in these types of transactions.

Selecting an Angel or Venture Capital Fund
Angels
and
VC
firms
vary
greatly
in
their
capabilities and the extent to which they desire or are
able to intervene directly. Some firms prefer a hands-off approach and thus seek
a management team able to execute the business plan without intervention.
Other VC funds prefer to assist with the selection of some of the management
team, stay close to the action and actively participate in setting up deals,
promoting the firm and establishing networks.
Most experienced Angels and VC firms are reasonably good at declaring the
type of investments they are seeking. They will normally provide an indication
of the stage they prefer and the level of investment which they typically
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

91

<-----Page 109----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

make. These attributes will allow the entrepreneur to prune down the list of
Angels and VC funds to those which are active in their target area. Next the
entrepreneur can exclude those Investors who target specific industry sectors
that are inappropriate. This should leave a smaller list which the entrepreneur
can investigate more thoroughly.
The entrepreneur needs to assess what type of assistance (if any) is needed
from the Investor. Possible issues might be:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

recruiting senior executives;
recruiting Directors for the Board;
accessing industry advisors;
helping with staff recruitment;
providing accounting, tax and finance assistance;
providing legal advice especially in contracts and IP;
helping with banking relationships;
providing assistance with closing large customer or distributor deals;
access to possible acquirers;
experience with an IPO process; and
expertise with overseas markets.

The entrepreneur needs to identify how important various characteristics of
the Investor are. For example:
•	 How experienced is the Angel or the VC team? How many firms have
they invested in and what is their performance?
•	 What experience do they have with similar ventures at their stage?
•	 What experience do they have in their industry?
•	 What has been their success with prior entrepreneurs? Have they
been able to work with them or have they been replaced?
•	 Have they been able to secure follow on investment?
•	 What has been their success at trade sales and IPOs?
With larger funds, the day-to-day management of the investee will typically be
handled by either an Associate Director or Director of the VC fund. This person
or the Angel will most likely sit on the Board of Directors and be involved in the
development of strategy. It may be of some importance to the Entrepreneur just
how much experience the Angel or the VC fund representative has. A person

92

<-----Page 110----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

with limited business experience may be more of a liability than an asset to the
business.
Part of your investigation should be to investigate the Angel or VC fund to see
if you would want them as a partner in your business. Aspects that you should
look into include:
Reputation

The better Angels and VC funds are well known to the professional services
community. Ask for advice from your advisor, lawyer, accountant and banker. Most
Angels and VC funds will work with sets of lawyers and accountants on each deal
they conclude. The larger professional services firms do the majority of the deals.
Compatibility

You will be working with the Angel or the VC fund and its nominees on your
Board for some years. You need to be comfortable with the people you are dealing
with and the way in which they prefer to do business.
Investee references

Take the time to talk to the CEOs of the investment portfolio firms. You might
also like to talk to those entrepreneurs who have worked with the Investor and
have exited. What type of support did they provide to the firms? How did they
react to changes in plans, disappointments and missed targets? How did they
work with the firm on strategic issues, exit plans, subsequent fund raising rounds,
closing deals, providing access to networks etc? Would they recommend them
to you?
Generally speaking it is not wise to approach too many Angels or VC funds at
the same time. The industry is quite small and most executives in the industry
know each other, often work together in consortium funding deals and participate
in industry functions. The Entrepreneur who shops around will be identified
relatively quickly and probably be dismissed or avoided as the Angels and VC funds
may not believe they will get enough time and attention from the entrepreneur
to undertake their own initial investigation.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

93

<-----Page 111----->Chapter 7: Investor Presentation Techniques

Some Angels and VC funds will only deal with referrals and not look at
unsolicited business plans. The VC Fund research data shows that most business
plans are only read as far as their executive summary (about 16 seconds on
average). Thus having a professional services firm make the introduction provides
the Angel and VC funds with some level of comfort that the basics have all been
covered. The professional services firm will also provide advice on which Angel
or VC fund is best suited for the investment sought.
Many firms with Angel investors will go on to raise Venture Capital finance.
The initial due diligence undertaken by the Angel investor and his participation
in the business can often provide the level of comfort that the VC fund is looking
for. Often angel investors have had prior experience co-investing with a selected
VC funds and thus the introductions carry greater weight.
The initial approach to a Angel or VC fund should be with an executive
summary. This way the Investor can have a brief review of the investment
opportunity without the complication of having to deal with a detailed business
plan. If the summary is of interest, it may request a meeting before going into
the business plan detail. It will use this meeting to assess the entrepreneurial
team as well as the proposed venture.
You may be concerned about confidentiality. Normally this would not be an
issue with an established and reputable Angel or VC fund. However, you might
like to take some steps to provide yourself with a higher level of comfort. This
would include seeking advice from a professional services firm which works
actively in the area of private equity finance. Check to see that the Angel or VC
fund has no conflict of interest with its other investments, provide confidential
data only during later discussions, initially just provide the executive summary
and consider using a confidentiality agreement.

Investor Presentation
Techniques

T

here are as many different forms of investor pitches as there are investors.
If you are looking for a silver bullet, there isn’t one! For every investor
who prefers a two minute presentation, there will be as many who want 20
minutes. For every Angel who wants you to tell them how much money you
are seeking up front, there will be just as many who would rather have that
information at the end when they know what you want to do with the money.
However, don’t be despondent. Over 50% of the presentations I hear are
seriously lacking and almost all of them have some vital bit of information
missing. Rarely have I heard a great pitch. If you can avoid the obvious mistakes,
you will be in the minority and if you can provide the essential information,
you will be well received. There is nothing wrong with generating questions at
the end of a presentation, but what you don’t want is your audience to be left
wondering why they wasted their time because they don’t understand what
you do or what you want from them.
Building a story about your business and being able to present it to different
audiences is an essential requirement for any entrepreneur. If you are looking for
investment, recruiting a key executive, selling to that first customer, borrowing
money from a bank or trying to convince a supplier to give you extended
credit, you need to be able to give a succinct and compelling explanation of
your business. They can’t be expected to wade through all the details of your
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

95

<-----Page 113----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

business to discover if it makes sense. Unless you can provide a short sharp
‘pitch’ on your business, you are going to miss out on some great opportunities.
The short version of your investor presentation is often referred to as an
‘elevator pitch’ and is part of the language of venture capital. It derives from
an exercise that MBA students were required to do as part of their training in
entrepreneurship. You are told you have entered an elevator and next to you
is a venture capital executive who will get off the elevator in two minutes. You
have two minutes to present a compelling argument as to why he should meet
with you so that you can explain your venture in more detail. People who work
exhibition stands know the drill very well although they rarely get 2 minutes. If
they are lucky they might get 20 seconds.
There is a lot to be learned from building a 2 minute pitch on your venture
and trying it out on people who know nothing about your business. The first
thing you learn is that 2 minutes goes by real fast. You have to use words
sparingly and stick to the most important points. The next thing you find is that
your audience does not understand your business at all. They fail to grasp what
a great business idea you have, how great the product or service is and how
important it is that they invest in it. Basically – they don’t’ get it!! Of course
it does not take a rocket scientist to discover that this is not their fault. You
have simply failed to structure the explanation in such a way that they could
understand it. So go back to the drawing board and start again.
Many people make the mistake of being too technical and providing too
much detail, forgetting that the aim of the pitch is to convince the non believer
about how financially attractive and robust the business venture is. Generally,
the greatest mistake is to fail to provide a clear explanation of the essence of the
business; what problem are you solving, how you are solving it and for whom,
how big is the opportunity, what is your competition and why you think you can
be successful.
For an investor to be seriously interested, they need to see a customer with
a compelling need, a product or service that has unique, hard to copy attributes
which fulfill that need and enough potential customers to make it a reasonable
size business. You have to convince them that you have the team that can
execute on the opportunity. Lastly, it has to provide a good return on their
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

96

<-----Page 114----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

investment through a public listing or by selling the business within a relatively
short period of time, say, 3 – 5 years. You need to be able to deliver that message
in two minutes. A longer presentation allows you more time to present greater
detail but the core message is the same.
At one investment pitch session for angel investors which I attended, eight
seed and early stage ventures were given 20 minutes to present their investment
opportunity. The presentations varied from poor to very good and from boring
to passionate. However, most of them failed to clearly define the problem they
were solving and why their solution was better than the competition. Some
forgot to provide statistics on market size, what portion they could capture
within a reasonable period of time and how they were going to do that. Not
one of them had a clear explanation of the exit strategy, perhaps the most
fundamental aspect of any angel investment.
I suspect that with further probing, all of these ventures could have been
made to look attractive. Angel and VC investors are not typically passive
investors who put their money in and wait for the cheques to come; they
are active investors who typically assist the venture to develop. They do not
expect the business model to be ideal at the initial investment stage, but they
do expect to be given enough information to decide whether to spend more
time in the investigation of the opportunity. Most of these ventures wasted
their presentation time at this forum as they were poorly prepared, had failed
to test out their presentations with non expert audiences and lacked practice.
Following each presentation, the angel investors were given an opportunity to
ask questions and the teams were able to see where they had failed to present
essential information. Fortunately for them, they also received some very good
advice on areas where their business strategies could be improved.
Whether you have 20 seconds, two minutes or an hour to present your
business opportunity, you do need to prepare and practice the presentation
otherwise you are wasting invaluable opportunities. As a potential recruit, a
prospective customer or investor, I want to be convinced by both your passion
and your argument. If you can’t explain succinctly what you do and why I should
be a part of your grand venture, why should I waste my time working with you?

What Investors Want to Know
Put yourself in the investor’s shoes. Why are they there and what do they
need to know to have an active interest in talking to you further? Remember,
they hear lots of presentations, don’t really care about the product or service
and are really interested in the risks and rewards for their investment. Keep in
mind that without a highly probable exit event, they don’t get their money back
and don’t achieve a return on their investment, so don’t forget about the exit.
While there is no ‘one size fits all’ presentation, the basics should include the
following:
Introductions
Who are you, what is your position in the business and what is the name
of the business.
What does the firm do?
You should be able to state what your business does in a few sentences.
“We provide security safety fences for high rise building developments”
“ We develop skin care products designed for tropical climates”

What problem or need are you addressing?
You would be surprised at how often I ask ‘What problem are you solving?’
at the end of a product presentation. I hear all about the features and
functions, how it beats the competition and that customers love it, but
half the time I am not told what problem or need it addresses. The key
here is to explain why customers need the product. What pain are you
addressing? What need are you satisfying? Why can’t the customers defer,
delay or avoid buying it? What evidence do you have that your solution is
effective and that customers will buy it at the price you propose?
Who is the customer?
I want to know exactly who the customer is and why they need it. How

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

98

<-----Page 116----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

do you put yourself in front of your target customer with a compelling
proposition?
What is your competitive advantage?
A strong competitive advantage means that you solve the problem better
than anyone else and that customers with that need or problem prefer
your solution. You also need to demonstrate that you can protect your
advantage over time through some registered IP (patent, brand, copyright,
license, trademark etc) or a level of deep expertise which is difficult to
copy, mitigate, develop or acquire.
How big is the market?
This is where evidence is required about the number of potential buyers,
the manner of distribution and the conversion rate of prospects to sales.
“In our initial pre-release testing we had a take-up rate of 9 in 10 tradesman. With 600,000 tradesman in our target region, we can expect
sales of $2 million within 2 years of the initial marketing campaign.
Replacement sales are anticipated to be at a rate of 20% per annum.”

What is your distribution strategy?
How are you going to distribute the product and put your product or service
in front of your target customer? There are a variety of strategies which can
be used; direct sales, internet, retail, wholesale and manufacturing license.
Which ones will you be using and why do you think they will be effective in
meeting your revenue and profit targets?
What is your exit strategy?
Unless you have an exceptional high growth venture which could achieve
an IPO, your business will need to be sold in a trade sale to achieve an exit.
What is your target exit date? Which companies have you identified who
would be interested? Why would they buy your business and what is the
estimated sale price?

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

99

<-----Page 117----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

What do you need to do to achieve the exit?
What are the milestones you need to achieve and tasks you need to
complete to succeed in a trade sale or IPO event? This might include product
development, proof of concept, revenue targets, strategic relationships
and so on. If the exit is a trade sale, you should have selected the potential
buyers, have a plan to approach them and understand why they would
want to acquire your firm.
Who is going to do the work?
Who is on the management team? What are their qualifications and
experience and which positions need to be filled for you to deliver on your
strategy? Why do you think this team is capable of achieving the milestones
and exit outcome? It is OK to have an incomplete management team but
you should show how you plan to fill those vacant positions.
How much investment do you need?
How much funding do you need, when do you need it and what is the
money going to be used for?
What are you offering the investor?
While this will certainly be negotiated, if you can, you should give some
idea of the level of equity participation and the likely return to the investor.
Be prepared! You may expect to have 20 minutes to present and then be told
you have only 5 minutes. You may anticipate doing a formal presentation to be
told that they only want a short description of the investment proposal.

The Elevator Pitch
Sometimes you only have a minute or so to get the message across. In
those situations you need to focus on the essentials and ensure your audience
understands what you do and why they should come and talk to you after your
presentation.

Here are two examples from ventures which I have been involved with. Each
of these presentations could be done is less than one minute.
Investor Pitch for Pioneer Computer Group (1990)
My name is Dr. Tom McKaskill and I am the President of Pioneer Computer Group, a software development business located in Northampton, UK, with offices in London, San Diego and Auckland. The business
develops, markets, implements and supports integrated enterprise
wide resource planning (ERP) applications for both discrete and process manufacturers and a set of software development tools (4GL).
The business currently employs 160 staff and has revenue of $15 million.
PCG has over 200 customers for its ERP systems and over 2,000
customers for its 4GL products spread across 16 countries supported
by its own staff and over 20 distributors. PCG has partly completed the
world’s first 4GL, relational database ERP system for process manufacturing which has received significant interest from early customers,
distributors and our major strategic partner, Digital Equipment Corporation. The process manufacturing ERP market is anticipated to be the
next big growth market in the software applications space. PCG have
just signed an agreement to install the system in 16 factories of a large
UK based manufacturer, the largest manufacturing software contract
signed this year in Europe.
PCG is seeking $2 million to complete the development of the process
manufacturing suite, set up trial sites in the USA and seek a strategic
US buyer for the business. We estimate sales of the new product to
exceed $100 million in the first two years of release in the USA giving
a potential trade sale exit value of around $50 million within 2 years.

This explanation would be improved if I had identified the potential buyers
and the reason why they would be willing to pay a premium to buy the business,
but you can see how much information can be delivered in a brief statement.

Investor Pitch for Distinction Software (1997)
My name is Tom McKaskill and I am President of Distinction Software,
a software development company which provides an integrated suite
of software modules for supply chain optimization for medium sized
process manufacturing companies who manufacture high volume, low
priced consumer packaged goods.
Our product suite optimizes the relationship between retail demand,
warehouse inventory, logistics, manufacturing capacity and raw material inventory. The package uses a sample of client data and shows a
payback time on the cost of the software of less than 6 months.
The product suite is one of only a limited number of fully completed
and implemented supply chain optimization products worldwide.
The market for such products is growing rapidly and there is keen
interest from large application software providers to enter this market.
These products are highly specialized, take years to develop and are
expensive to complete.
Our exit strategy is to sell the business to a global software corporation providing them with an immediate revenue opportunity within their
existing customer base as well as a strong competitive advantage for
future sales. We estimate an exit price of around $60 million.
We are seeking $2 million to complete multi-lingual translation, multicountry trial implementations and documentation and training material
required for a global release.

This description was my first attempt. Note that I do not mention revenue,
staff numbers or projections. With any presentation, you should improve each
time you do it. It is important to be able to explain your business in one minute
or in a description which is no longer than one page.

Powerpoint Presentation Guidelines
There are lots of ways of doing a presentation and therefore there is not one
format which is perfect but the basic rules of presentation still apply.
Do’s of Presenting
•	 Outline why you are there
•	 Tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them and then tell
them what you told them
•	 Have a logical flow, be confident, positive, focused and professional
•	 Use photos, diagrams and videos to demonstrate your product
•	 Show you know what you are talking about
•	 Be honest (identify problems, risks, outstanding work)
•	 Tailor your presentation to the target audience (why are they there)
•	 Be realistic and reference your data sources
•	 Limit the number of points to a slide
•	 Use at least an 18pt font. Major bullet points should be at least 24pt
Don’ts of Presenting
•	 Don’t make ambiguous, vague or unsubstantiated statements
•	 Don’t use technical or industry jargon
•	 Keep the sizzle down - stick to the meat
•	 Keep the slides simple and to the point
•	 Don’t be casual, uninterested or otherwise engaged - show you are
keenly interested in the decision
•	 Don’t read and don’t present financials to 3 decimal places.
Powerpoint is a very powerful tool but can be over-used. The slides are there
to allow you to convey information - remember that your audience can read so
you don’t need to read them out. The order of slides allows you to control the
flow and pace of the presentation. You are telling a story, make it interesting but
stick to the central theme.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

103

<-----Page 121----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

Your audience should be able to read everything on the slide within a few
seconds. Don’t put so much information on the slide that it distracts them from
listening to your explanation.

Use fonts you can read from a distance. Avoid TLCs and technical jargon if
you are presenting to a non-technical audience.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

104

<-----Page 122----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

Ensure the colours you use are easy to read. Put contrasting colours together
so the text can be read easily.

Avoid using backgrounds which have lots of different colours or shades. It is
very difficult to get contrasting colours when you have complex backgrounds.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

105

<-----Page 123----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

You are presenting to a professional audience so avoid the gimmicks. Don’t
use fun graphics, noises or fancy animations.

Your audience wants to read what is on the slide.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

106

<-----Page 124----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

Why Are You There?
Be very clear in your own mind what you want to achieve from your
presentation and ensure you come back to that at the end. Listen carefully to
the questions and make sure you answer them rather than simply repeat what
was in your presentation.
Learn from every presentation:
•	 What went right, what went wrong?
•	 What questions came up later - can this information be incorporated
in the presentation?
•	 Find out where the weak points were.
•	 Where were you not convincing?
•	 In the story, strategy, concept - what did you miss?
•	 Who or what do we need to do to be successful?
Your presentation is only the first step, you need to have a plan to follow
up on the meeting. Ask for business cards of those who would like a further
discussion. You can also ask if you can send them additional information.

Presentation Checklist
After you have put your presentation together, check it against the following
list. Depending on the type of business and the type of exit, not all of these
items will be relevant and some will need more detail than others.
Almost without exception, you will have made some assumptions about
your audience, especially their knowledge of your industry and technology. You
need to deskill your presentation for a general audience. The best way to do
this is to give the presentation to people from outside your sector. Try it on
friends, siblings, your spouse/partner/mother and your co-workers. If there
is something they don’t understand or have difficulty following, you need to
change your presentation. At the end of the presentation, you might ask them
questions about your business and investment opportunity and see if they
understood it. These days it is not essential to wear a business suit and tie but
neat and professional is important.

Introduce yourself and your other presenters
Who are you and what do you do?
What problem or need do you satisfy?
Is the customer clearly identified?
Are you showing why the customer should buy from you?
Are you identifying your principal competitors?
Are you identifying your sustainable competitive advantage?
Are you showing who the management team is?
Do you have financial projections with worst, likely and best case?
Are you identifying the risks in the deal?
What problems are unresolved or needed additional work?
Do you have a well defined exit strategy?
Have you identified what needs to be done to deliver on the exit
event?
•	 Have you said why you are there and make the investment request?
•	 Is the investment opportunity well defined and convincing?
•	 Are your Powerpoints clear and easy to read?
Depending on whether you are a financial or a strategic exit, your explanation
of what is important can be very different. With a strategic trade sale, the key is
to identify the strategic buyers and explain why they would want to undertake
the acquisition. In a financial sale or an IPO, you need to show that you can
create a high growth venture.
The last time I raised venture capital I did over 30 presentations to venture
capital firms in 5 cities up and down the eastern seaboard of the USA. Each
time I learnt a little more about what they were interested in and refined the
presentation. What I also found was that even the best opportunity had to fit
into their investment criteria, investment portfolio, sector preferences and
level of investment. You may need to do a number of presentations to different
audiences before you find a match.
Some organisations will have a preferred presentation outline which they
would like you to follow. Ask them if they have a specific format which they
prefer. Often they will want an executive summary either in advance or on the
day. This needs to cover the major points of the investment proposal and should
include contact details for those who wish to explore your proposal further.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

108

<-----Page 126----->Chapter 8: Investor Presentation Techniques

Some organizations like to have a written business plan available for those who
wish to examine the proposal further.
With formal Powerpoint presentations, many organisations like to hand out
a copy of the slides to the audience so they can make notes during and after the
presentation. Remember to invite the audience to ask questions and offer your
business card for follow-up discussions.
Most investors try to put themselves into the shoes of the target customer
and ask the question “Why would I buy this product and from this firm?” They
try to do this as early into the presentation as possible so they can understand
the business. This means that it is really important to deal with this issue as
early into the presentation as possible. Showing the product, demonstrating it
or showing a short video or photo of it in use can be quite effective.
I have sat through many presentations where I didn’t understand what the
product was or what problem it solved until well into the presentation. The
problem for the presenter was that most of the audience were not listening to
the content because they were still focused on working out what the business
did. You should not be spending more than a minute or so on describing your
product or service. Once the audience understands what you do, move on to
the core of the presentation which is about what you need to do to develop
the business, the investment required and the return which the investors
will receive by participating in the venture. If you are at the idea stage or still
developing your business concept, simply state that in your presentation, but
ensure that your host understands that prior to the presentation and has the
opportunity of setting the right expectation for those who will be attending.
If you are not sure what level of detail is required in the presentation or are
unfamiliar with some of the terms used by investors, ask your host. You can also
learn a lot about Angel and Venture Capital funding from articles, websites and
books. The more familiar you are with the requirements, the better prepared
you will be to deliver your presentation and answer the questions.

Valuation

O

nce the investor has evaluated the investment proposal, the discussion
will usually move to the question of valuation. Entrepreneurs have
always seen the initial valuation as the most important part of the investment
process – as this can impact greatly on what they walk away with on exit. At the
same time Investors see entry valuation as the key to the investment return –
if they get too little equity they may not get a reasonable return on the exit if
the venture is not overly successful. Thus valuation discussions can be stressful
on both parties and often somewhat emotional. Finding a path through this
discussion is critical if both parties are to proceed with the investment and still
retain a positive working relationship.
Traditionally Investors and entrepreneurs have used the existing revenue
and profit or near term revenue and profit as the basis of a valuation discussion.
While the exit is always a consideration, few use this to arrive at a current
valuation. Typically, exit planning is deferred until the investor has made the
investment and had some experience with the venture when the investor has
a better idea of the market and the venture capabilities. But in fact, this is the
critical event and should play a much greater part in the investment decision
and the valuation discussion.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 128----->Chapter 9: Valuation

Valuation
Valuation of an existing business before VC and Angel funding and valuation of
a business following funding has to be the most controversial topic in the venture
capital literature. It is the greatest source of conflict between entrepreneurs
and Investors, is plagued by emotion, misunderstanding, entrenched position
taking and ignorance. It has often been said that 40% of deals fail to secure
funding due to a failure to agree a valuation. What is regrettable is that it is
highly possible that many of these ventures could have made both the Investor
and the entrepreneur considerable wealth.
Valuation is the process of estimating the monetary amount the firm is worth
based on its future expected returns. Valuation is a function of risk and return
and considers:
•	
•	
•	
•	

the expected return from an investment in the firm
the expected returns from investments in other comparable firms
the risks associated with the expected return
any other relevant characteristics of the firm or the industry/
geography in which it operates.

A more conventional definition of market value is: the price that would be
negotiated between a knowledgeable and willing but not anxious buyer and a
knowledgeable and willing but not anxious seller acting at arm’s length within
a reasonable time frame.
While this is probably not true of Angels, entrepreneurs often refer to venture
capitalists as greedy, one-sided, ‘vulture capitalists’. On the other hand, venture
capitalists and Angels complain of entrepreneurs being unrealistic, unwilling to
negotiate a fair value and ignorant of the balance between risk and return.

Valuation models
In the absence of an independent offer to buy the firm, the valuation of a
private firm is a highly judgemental process. Valuation models are each designed
with different purposes in mind. Like the problem of identifying cost, (historical
cost, replacement cost, market price, incremental cost, inflation adjusted cost,
depreciated cost) it depends what you want to use it for.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

111

<-----Page 129----->Chapter 9: Valuation

The major valuation models are:
•	 Earnings-based
-	
Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings
-	
Discounted future cash flows (DCF).
•	 Asset-based
-	
Going concern value
-	
Realisation value
•	 Industry-specific based
-	
Market value
-	
Rules of thumb.
In emerging businesses seeking venture finance, only the earnings based
valuation models are relevant. Traditional earnings based valuation methods
have been established to value existing business where historical data can be
used to show revenue and profit trends and where established products have
a market presence. However, most emerging ventures which seek funding are
of limited life, have little history and a somewhat speculative future. Thus while
traditional methods of valuation don’t really apply, the entrepreneur should be
familiar with their use as valuation discussions may involve them. In order to
start any sort of meaningful discussion, the conventional approach to valuation
for an investment has been to write a forward projecting business plan and
then to try to use this as the basis for discussion.
Most Investors will estimate a future (exit) valuation based on a four to six
times earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) multiple of the projected profit
at the time of harvest of the investment and then work backwards using an
internal rate of return (IRR) to reflect the risk in the venture to arrive at a
post funding valuation. Early stage ventures may attract a 55% IRR with more
advanced ventures attracting 20% to 40% depending on the expected risk.
However, even this valuation is highly speculative as more funding rounds
may occur, each setting a new valuation at the time of funding. To arrive at
the equity percentage for the Investor, the investment required is deducted
from the post-funding valuation and then the ‘pre-money’ valuation is arrived
at. The Investor’s equity percentage can then be calculated from the ratio of
investment to post-money valuation.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

112

<-----Page 130----->Chapter 9: Valuation

Strategic trade sales require a different approach as the valuation is based
on the expected earnings of the buyer in the first few years following the sale.
However, a valuation can be applied to this stream of earnings to arrive at an
exit value.
Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings
Capitalisation of future maintainable earnings methodologies include:
•	 Price earnings ratio (PER)
•	 Pre-tax earnings multiples such as earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), earnings before interest, tax
and amortisation (EBITA) and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT).
Earnings-based valuations are used as a proxy for the Discounted Cash Flow
(DCF) methodology.
The PER can be applied in two ways:
•	 Total value of the firm: PE multiple x net profit after tax (NPAT)
•	 Value per share: PE multiple x earnings per share (EPS)
The PER is applied to an estimate of earnings after tax. The value derived
using a PER is a valuation of the ordinary shareholders’ interest. This is described
as an equity value.
Valuations based on EBITDA, EBITA or EBIT multiples calculate the Enterprise
Value of the firm before factoring in the way it is funded. The Enterprise Value is
typically adjusted for the following items to calculate an Equity Value:
•	
•	
•	
•	

Interest-bearing debt
Surplus assets
Contingent liabilities
Future capital expenditure

Some sectors have well established valuation norms. These can vary with the
economic cycles reflecting likely growth or depression trends. Multiples applied
to mature industries with little likelihood of growth are generally lower than
multiples applied to growth sectors. Firms which have experienced higher than
average historical growth will usually command a higher multiple on the basis
that future growth is also expected to continue at higher than average rates i.e.
history is often used as a prediction of the future.
The assumption underlying the PER method is that the firm has stable or
predictable earnings, that these will continue on a linear path for some years,
the business will not change from its current business model and there is an
appropriate debt/equity mix.
It is useful to set valuation expectations prior to going into a valuation
negotiation. If the sector is currently valuing listed corporations at 10 times EBIT
and the firm is seeking something higher, they have unrealistic expectations. If
on the other hand they are seeking five times EBIT, you probably have a basis
for negotiation.
The earnings used in a valuation need not be the actual historical earnings.
Earnings should be adjusted for abnormal, extraordinary and non-recurring
items to determine a normal level of earnings. If the entrepreneur can show
highly probable growth with achievable revenue and profit targets, future
earnings might be used to calculate a market valuation. However, it is important
to avoid double counting growth by using future earnings and applying a ‘growth
multiple’.

Discounted cash flow (DCF)
A DCF has two elements:
•	 forecast of future cash flows of the firm for a number of years into
the future
•	 discounting the forecast cash flows back to a net present value (NPV)
using a discount rate which reflects the riskiness of those cash flows.
•	 The preparation of a DCF can be challenging as it can be difficult to:
•	 accurately forecast cash flows for a number of years into the future
•	 select an appropriate discount rate.
The discount rate should represent the risks associated with generating the
expected earnings of the firm. In many cases entrepreneurs and Investors will
simply use the Investor’s investment hurdle rate.
This method is somewhat more problematic. It is based on discounting
future free cash flow to a present value. The free cash flow, or uncommitted
cash surplus, represents the cash available to pay off the initial investment plus
provide a return on that investment.
Most high growth businesses invest heavily in growth capacity. This might be
R&D, sales force, promotion, channel expansion and so on. Few entrepreneurial
ventures have spare cash.
The DCF discount rate in an Angel valuation is likely to be 35-40% and a VC
fund 25% -35%.
When deciding on a valuation for a strategic exit, a value is arrived at for the
exit price and then discounted to a NPV.
Fundraising alternatives
It is useful to put Angel and VC investment into context.
Let’s say the entrepreneur wanted to borrow $1 million. His choices are a first
or second mortgage on his personal home, a loan secured on business property,
a loan secured on inventory, or a loan secured against debtors.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

115

<-----Page 133----->Chapter 9: Valuation

Secured loans can normally be recovered by the lender as a market exists for
the pledged asset. The lower the likelihood of recovery, the higher the interest
rate and the lower the percentage advanced on the value.
Borrowing against the entrepreneur’s home would possibly result in a
professional valuation, which may be lower than the entrepreneur would
willingly agree and a loan of probably not more than 80% of the valuation.
A bank is likely to seek higher rates of interest on a second mortgage to
compensate them for the additional risk of the second mortgage. If scheduled
repayments can’t be met, the bank has the right to sell the home and recover
their debt plus accumulated interest and costs.
Securing a loan on business property may be a little more expensive as
business properties generally experience more fluctuations in value. A premium
above a second mortgage on a house is likely.
Taking a loan on inventory is of much higher risk as the inventory may suffer
from obsolescence or damage. Usually the recovery can only be made at an
auction which itself often returns much lower values than in the normal course
of business. So an advance of not more than 50% of book value may be made
but with an interest rate higher than the above mentioned rates. A similar
treatment may be applied to debtors except that it may be limited to 50% of
approved debtors, perhaps only those aged 30 days or under.
Now let’s consider the typical early stage entrepreneurial business, which
will display some or all of the following attributes:
•	 uncertain cash flows
•	 few tangible assets
•	 some specialised equipment which typically becomes technically
obsolete
•	 few debtors
•	 little inventory
•	 new and sometimes unproven products or services
•	 often an immature management team
•	 an emerging market which is yet to be stabilised
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

116

<-----Page 134----->Chapter 9: Valuation

•	 no established market for shares, especially a minority holding
•	 uncertain timing of revenue and profitability.
So, unlike a secured investor such as a bank, the Investor has an illiquid
market in which to sell the shares, is dealing with high levels of uncertainty in
the business and the market and the management team has no security for the
investment.
If a risk free rate in Government Bonds is yielding, say, 6% over a long term,
what return should an Angel or VC investment under these riskier conditions
return over a portfolio of such investments? The typical Angel or VC investor will
invest across a range of ventures expecting to return, on average, approximately
5% above long-term share market returns. However, within this portfolio some
investments can be expected to be written off, some may break even, some
may make a reasonable return and one may make a sizable return. In order
to achieve a 15-20% average pre-tax return, the Investor needs to set a pre
tax hurdle rate of at least 25-30%. Investors with a technology, biotechnology
or early stage investment focus tend to seek higher returns (potentially in the
order of 35-40%) due to higher failure rates. Only a small percentage of the exits
will exceed 7 to 10 times their investment, thus the Investor may set a relatively
high hurdle rate knowing that those investments which fail or have poor returns
will pull down the average.
Most entrepreneurs will accept this logic. So where is the problem? The
problem is in the often extreme views of the likely outcome. Entrepreneurs
by their very nature are optimistic. Investors, while not being pessimistic, are
cautious and have been conditioned by failed ventures, all of which started out
looking very positive. In truth, it is the pursuit of the target value which often
causes the venture to fail. If the Investor has to achieve a high value to exit their
investment with a good return, the pressure is on the entrepreneur to push the
growth rate. It is often this pressure which creates the conditions for insolvency
and failure.
At the same time, the gold medal for an Angel or VC investment is an IPO, not
withstanding that the most common exit mechanism is a trade sale. This means
ever growing revenue and profit targets. However, the successive yearly targets
are inherently risky. The growth rate puts huge pressure on the organisation
and the cash needed to fuel the investment in inventory, debtors, recruitment,
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

117

<-----Page 135----->Chapter 9: Valuation

training, accommodation, research and development, development of
distribution channels, customer support and so on. Much of the investment is
in growth preparation rather than in servicing the current customers.
Let’s consider an example:
The business is achieving $5 million in sales with 20 staff. It is currently
making 5% net profit after tax ($250,000). The business is valued at six times
net profit after tax, therefore the pre-investment valuation is $1.5 million. The
firm raises $1.5 million for 50% share giving it a post-investment valuation of $3
million. The Investor expects to achieve an ROI of 25% with a planned exit in
four years. Assume that revenue grows at 40% per annum and the revenue per
head remains constant.

Imagine all the things which can go wrong over that five-year period: the
market may change with new competitors, the market size may be considerably
less than estimated, new technology may make the product obsolete, the firm
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

118

<-----Page 136----->Chapter 9: Valuation

may be unable to recruit quality staff at the rate needed and so on.
While size is not the only determinant of a company’s ability to undertake
an IPO, in the above example the growth rate would most likely be insufficient
to create an IPO opportunity and therefore the Investor would need to pursue
a trade sale as an exit mechanism. For the same firm to gain the level of sales
and profitability to achieve an IPO, they would have to grow at a significantly
higher rate.
The business risks associated with high growth rates are significant and
require a massive change in organisation structure, processes, systems and
formalised controls.
The executives who are capable of running a 20-person firm are probably
unsuited to a 200-person firm. Very few entrepreneurs have the skills to make
this transition.
The Investor who pushes an investee firm to an IPO may create the seeds
of their own failure. Regardless of the product/market opportunity, very few
management teams are capable of managing a high level of growth. Growing
firms tend to require significant levels of working capital and investment into
the business. Consequently, cash reserves are generally stretched and even
a small mistake can result in rapid dilution of cash reserves sending the firm
to the brink of insolvency. As Investors require an exit, in these circumstances
some Investors may panic, replace management and probably push the firm
into a fire sale to recover as much of their investment as possible.
The initial valuation may create the platform for future failure. The higher the
initial valuation, the greater the pressure to grow and the higher the likelihood
of failure.
To protect the investment from some of the risks mentioned above, the
Investor is likely to push the initial valuation down so that they have a greater
chance of gaining a final exit which will return the ROI needed. They also build
in conditions which allow them to replace management if the team fails to
achieve the milestones needed to keep them on track to reach the target exit
valuation.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

119

<-----Page 137----->Chapter 9: Valuation

A lower valuation has the benefit of taking some of the pressure off the
entrepreneur. Reaching a target ROI for the Angel or VC investment is more
likely, the intermediate milestones are likely to be more easily reached and
there is not undue pressure on growth. The downside is that the entrepreneur
will give up more equity at the lower valuation.
Which valuation should you use?
Too many entrepreneurs produce five year forecasts based on assumptions
which are, at best, educated guesses as to the state of the economy, the
reaction of competitors and the behaviour of prospects. They then use complex
formulae to work out a Net Profit After Tax (NPAT) over five years. From this
profit forecast they calculate a valuation to four decimal places using an assumed
discount rate. At the very best, it is one person’s view of the future, but it fails to
recognise that any other view might be equally valid.
In truth, no-one can accurately predict the future. The entrepreneur is
generally going to be optimistic and the Investor somewhat pessimistic.
Somehow they have to come to an agreement on a valuation or the negotiation
simply never goes anywhere.
Entrepreneurs should be highly averse to high valuations. While they look
good at the start of the venture, they place unrealistic expectations on the
business to perform. Even the slightest slippage can lose the entrepreneur his
business. Investors are not known to take shortfalls kindly. The problem is that
they have their own investment to protect. Far better for both parties to agree
a lower/negotiated valuation where the Investor can readily make his hurdle
rate and the entrepreneur has a better chance of staying in control and making
a reasonable return on his effort.
Negotiated valuation
One method of arriving at a valuation is to consider what the valuation of
the business may be at a future exit date and discounting this value back into
today’s dollars. This method also has more relevant application to strategic
sales. The future exit valuation of the firm is highly speculative and is a metric
of real interest to both parties. If it was known with some certainty, the current
valuation could be more readily determined by using a discounted cash flow
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

120

<-----Page 138----->Chapter 9: Valuation

methodology. The discount rate could be adjusted for higher levels of uncertainty
but it would still be a place to start.
So, for example, a firm with an exit valuation of $10 million in three years
with a discount rate of 40% would be worth $3.64 million now. A $1 million
investment would thus gain the Investor 27.5% shareholding.
Possible alternative valuation scenarios to the above are:
•	 The Investor wanted some higher comfort factor. A higher rate of
discount may be used, say 50%, which would result in a lower Net
Present Value (NPV) of $3 million giving the Investor 33% equity.
•	 The Investor wanted some higher comfort factor. A lower exit
valuation may be used, say $8 million, which would provide a NPV of
$2.9 million, giving the Investor a share of 34.5%.
•	 The entrepreneur is more optimistic than the Investor and believes
that an exit valuation of $20 million is likely. This would give a NPV of
$7.3 million and the Investor share of this would be 13.7%.
The real problem lies in the balance of risk and reward. If in fact a low exit
value was achieved, both parties lose but the Investor is likely to be the one
with the highest cash investment loss. The entrepreneur and his team will have
put time and sweat in but probably much less cash.
At the same time, if a high value is achieved, both parties would seek the
upside. The entrepreneur would most likely claim that he deserves the most
credit because it is his vision, business model and leadership that are probably
the key to success, not the cash from the Investor. The Investor would most
likely argue that the business could not have achieved the high valuation
without the cash injection from the Investor. The Investor of course wants the
lower valuation in case things go wrong and so the upside is much higher. The
entrepreneur wants a higher valuation to limit the equity of the Investor if the
venture proves very successful.
A solution for both parties lies in negotiating a valuation formula which both
parties can live with. This could be a stated value at somewhere between the
Investor valuation and the entrepreneur’s valuation, or it could be a starting
value but with equity adjusted up or down for different levels of success.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

121

<-----Page 139----->Chapter 9: Valuation

So, for example, the parties could agree a strike point which would
determine initial shareholding. This could then be adjusted for higher or lower
exit valuations. For example, the parties could take the two opposing valuations
and use these as a basis for calculating the shareholding at exit.
Negotiated valuation – Example 1
•	 Investment is $3 million for an initial 33% equity share.
•	 Exit after three years.
•	 The Investor estimates a $25 million exit.
•	 The entrepreneur estimates $50 million.
In this example the parties have agreed on the following:
•	 Investor’s equity share will remain at 33% for all exit valuations below
their expected valuation of $25 million.
•	 The Investor’s ROI on exit valuations between $25 million and $50
million are held at 40% thus giving the Investor certainty of returns.
•	 Where the entrepreneur’s estimate of $50 million is achieved, he
retains a greater proportion of the equity (i.e. the Investor’s share is
reduced to 16.4%), but the return the Investor earns is significantly
greater than at lower valuations.
•	 Consequently in this example both the entrepreneur and the Investor
share in the upside of higher valuations.

Negotiated valuation – Example 2
Alternatively, a much more aggressive model would see the valuations
move in the Angel’s favour with lower exit valuations and more security on the
downside for the Angel. This acknowledges the need for the Angel to achieve
their desired ROI. At higher exit valuations, the pendulum swings the other way,
increasing the reward to the entrepreneur for outstanding performance.
In this example:
•	
•	
•	
•

The Angel estimates a $25 million exit.
The entrepreneur estimates $50 million.

In the example set out below, the parties have agreed the following:

security on the downside.
•	 The entrepreneur retains a greater share of equity at higher
valuations while still allowing the Angel to earn a significant rate of
return.

<-----Page 142----->Chapter 9: Valuation

This type of formula can be used over successive rounds of Angel or VC
funding. Each round would put in place the formula for determining the share
of the final exit valuation to the new investor.
The entrepreneur who is unwilling or unable to accept a lower/negotiated
valuation, should consider seriously a ratchet where the entrepreneur earns
additional equity for achieving certain pre-agreed milestones/targets. These
targets could be qualitative or quantitative in nature.
Investors want to ensure that, at the very least, they don’t lose any money
on the deal. An investor is much more sensitive to a loss than to a significant
gain. There is considerable pressure on the Investor to push down the valuation.
However, a lower valuation means the entrepreneur makes much less when
they exit the business and therefore the Investor needs to find a valuation figure
which strongly motivates the entrepreneur.
Angels and VC investors can use a variety of techniques to achieve this
balance. One simple technique is to set the return to the Investor at a specified
rate of return. Any excess over this amount from the exit proceeds goes to
the entrepreneurial team. Another technique is to establish the investment as
preference shares with an accumulating dividend. Since preference shares are
paid before ordinary shares, the Investor will recover some or all of their money
before other shareholders share in the proceeds. An Investor may also have
some ordinary shares to give him a percentage of the higher exit valuations.
Some Investors use options to provide additional incentives to the
entrepreneur and senior management to allow them to accumulate additional
equity in the business. The options may be set against certain milestones or
performance targets which represent higher potential exit proceeds. The
entrepreneur gains a greater percentage of the proceeds as the options kick in
at higher exit valuations.
An anti-dilution clause in favor of the Investor in an investment agreement
has the effect of protecting some or all of their investment in the event that
the valuation falls with a subsequent funding round. This clause adjusts the
shares of the Investor so that their original investment retains its monetary
value under the new valuation. In this situation, it is the original founders who
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

125

<-----Page 143----->Chapter 9: Valuation

suffer the negative adjustment. However, this type of adjustment is typically
not readjusted with a subsequent higher valuation.

process.
This
approach
is commonly used by an experienced Investor with many investments and by
Angel syndicates, Angel Groups and VC firms. Individual Angels often go by their
gut feel or a ‘seat of the pants’ judgement, however, fewer mistakes are likely
to be made with a more systematic and comprehensive process. Also, if other
Angels are investing at the same time, the individual Angel doing the evaluation
would be better able to later justify and defend an investment recommendation
if a more formal process was followed. Given the high level of Angel syndicate
investments over the past several years, the process set out here will apply to
an Angel co-investment situation.
The purpose of the staged process is to eliminate, at the earliest possible
time, those investments which fail to meet the criteria established by the
Investor. Each successive stage involves higher levels of expenditure on time and
professional services and investigation expense. Only very few firms progress to
the later stages.
The overall duration of the process will vary according to the complexity
of the proposal and the ease with which the detailed investigations can be
completed. Larger Angel syndicates and VC firms can be expected to have more
formal processes and perhaps more sign-off stages. It is unlikely that funding
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

127

<-----Page 145----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

would be provided in less than three months with the average taking closer to
six months.
(a) Initial contact
The better and more established Investors prefer to receive their initial contact
through a referral. However, whether it comes with a recommendation from
another Angel, professional services firm, personal contact or simply through
the mail, the initial review of the proposal will be a quick read of the executive
summary to see if the size of funds required, the stage of investment, the
industry and the geographical location are of interest. If interested, the Investor
will ask the Entrepreneur and one or two members of the senior management
team to come to a brief meeting where the proposal will be discussed.
(b) First formal meeting
The purpose of the first meeting is for the Investor to evaluate the Entrepreneur
and the management team. The Investor should set the expectation that the
management team should come prepared to answer detailed questions about
all aspects of their business. They may be asked to do a formal presentation on
the business opportunity for 10-30 minutes.
(c) Exchange of information
If the initial meeting goes well and both parties are interested in going forward,
the Investor would normally request a business plan (if the management team
has not already provided one) as well as contact details of other executives in
the firm, names of referees, key customers, suppliers and distributors. The firm
may be unwilling to provide confidential information at this stage but should
provide sufficient information for the Investor to decide if they wish to expend
more time and expense on evaluating the investment.
(d) Informal due diligence
The Investor would normally conduct a limited investigation into the market,
the firm and the business proposition. This will often involve contacts with
industry executives they already know or with other Angels or VCs active in the
sector. The Investor might also visit the offices of the firm and interview the
key executives and key employees. The market analysis would normally include

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

128

<-----Page 146----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

an investigation of competitors and some validation of the customer benefits
associated with the products or services offered by the firm.
(e) Term sheet negotiated
The Investor would then brief the firm on the evaluation of the proposal
and the terms under which an investment would be undertaken. During this
discussion the Investor and firm agree a valuation or valuation formula, discuss
costs and fees and decide on the equity to be taken by the Investor.
(f) Investor quality review
Before proceeding to issue a term sheet, the Angel syndicate or VC firm
may wish to have the proposal presented to them with a justification of the
investment to be made. This is an internal check to ensure that due process and
adequate product/market opportunity evaluation has been carried out. The
presentation would normally include a limited financial model of the business
over the likely term of the investment. Additional analysis may be required
following the discussion and before individual Angels or the VC Fund issue the
term sheet. Larger deals may require more extensive and expert investigation.
In these situations the Investor may outsource part of the work to professional
services firms and specialist market analysis consultancies.
(g) Term sheet issued
Once the initial due diligence has satisfied the Investor that the investment
should move forward to a detailed investigation, the Investor would issue a
formal offer in the form of a heads of agreement called a term sheet. This sets
out the terms and conditions under which an investment will be made if the
proposal satisfies a more detailed and formal due diligence investigation. The
term sheet is not binding on either party at this point. However, the Investor
may expect the firm to deal exclusively with them during the detailed due
diligence period.
(h) Investment approval
Once the term sheet has been issued and accepted by the firm, a more
extensive financial modelling exercise may be undertaken to help other Angels
or other VC Fund partners understand the risks and opportunities in the deal.
This analysis would look at the likely investment returns under different risk
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

129

<-----Page 147----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

conditions. Exit strategies will be formulated under different performance
assumptions. Once this additional work has been undertaken, the proposal will
again be reviewed, perhaps by a larger number of Angels or the full investment
committee of the VC Fund. Larger Angel syndicates and VC Funds will have a
formal authorisation process for the detailed investigation. This protects the
syndicate and VC firm from an over enthusiastic Angel or investment manager
and allows a wider range of expertise and experience to review the proposal
before the syndicate incurs the expense of a detailed due diligence investigation.
(i) Formal due diligence
Upon signing the terms sheet, the Investor and their professional advisors
will examine the company’s corporate structure, assets, intellectual property,
financial statements, material contracts, employment agreements and any
actual or threatened litigation. Technical specialists may be hired to review R&D
results and plans, specialist equipment or foreign market plans.
(j) Formal approval
Once the detailed due diligence has been completed the proposal is reviewed
again to ensure that risks have been adequately assessed. If the Angel syndicate
or VC firm is still comfortable with the investment and the ability for the lead
Angel or investment manager to manage it, formal approval will be given to go
forward with the investment.
(k) Legal documentation
Upon completion of due diligence, parties typically prepare and sign the
following formal legal documentation:
Subscription agreement: which sets out the number and price of shares,
funding tranches and dates of subscriptions, detailed warranties
concerning the company, rights attaching to shares and conditions
precedent to funding. Subscription agreements may also cover future
subscriptions by the Investor, the founders, other shareholders or key
staff and ratchet mechanisms to re-allocate shares in the event of over
or under performance by the business.
Shareholders agreement: which sets out the ongoing relationship between
the shareholders and the company as agreed in the term sheet.

Intellectual property acknowledgment deeds: is an acknowledgment by
other parties that they have no rights to any intellectual property which
they develop and assigns all such creations to the company.
Executive service agreements: will bind ‘key’ employees to the company
for a period (usually two or three years), and will set out the employees’
terms of service, remuneration and bonus entitlements.

Once the final documents are signed, the Investor will issue the first tranche
payment to the firm. Follow on payments will be made under the terms of the
agreement, but may be subject to performance achievements.
Normally the investee would be expected to reimburse the Investor for all
the expenses associated with making the investment if the investment is made.
If an investment is not made, only where the firm has misrepresented material
facts or withdraws after the due diligence costs have been incurred will the
Investor expect to recover their investigation costs.
Where an investment is made, the firm would normally reimburse the
Investor for the external expenses incurred in the due diligence process. This
would include professional fees and external consultant’s costs and will occur
with or without a transaction proceeding. Even on a small investment these can
be expected to be $50,000 to $70,000. For a larger deal, it could easily exceed
$250,000. Some funds charge an advice fee if they have helped to structure
part of the deal with external parties. If the venture is relatively small and the
product/market issues are straightforward, it may be sufficient for the Investor
to undertake a limited due diligence and use a regional or local professional
services firm thus cutting down on the costs.
The Investor is normally appointed as an external Director to the firm and
the company would normally be expected to pay a Director’s fee, in most cases
it would be around $15,000 to $25,000. Larger companies will incur higher
Directors’ costs.
Some Angels and VC firms charge an annual management fee which might
vary but often can be around 1% of the amount invested.

Term Sheet and Deal Structure
The term sheet sets out the terms and conditions of the investment in the
firm. Term sheets can vary in length and complexity but would normally contain,
at least, the following clauses:
•	 The number and price of the shares in the company to be purchased.
These are normally set up as preferred shares with cumulative
dividends (where declared). The preferred shares would normally be
paid out in full prior to any payment to ordinary shareholders in the
event of the liquidation or sale of the firm. This section would also
state what other shares are issued as well as the capitalised value of
the business. The value of the business is then used to calculate the
percentage of the shareholding that would be owned by the Investor
subsequent to their investment. The preferred shares are normally
converted to common shares on liquidation or exit. However, in the
event of failure, the preferred shares are entitled to first call on the
liquidation proceeds. The Investor would normally be entitled to at
least one seat on the Board of Directors and would have certain veto
powers or power of approval over:
–	 the capital expenditure budget
–	 the annual operating budget
–	 any debt or asset lien over a specified value
–	 appointment of CEO, CFO and senior executives
–	 remuneration and employment conditions of senior
management

		

–	 any issue of additional shares
–	 a change in the number of Directors
–	 any dividend
–	 any major change in structure, assets, merger, acquisition or
disposal

–	

the use of the invested funds.

•	 The Investor may require their percentage of the total capital of the
firm not be reduced in a subsequent share offer at a price lower than
the one they came in on (anti-dilution rights).
•	 The Investor will be entitled to ‘piggyback’ the registration of their
shares with other shares being registered for sale.
•	 If at least 75% of the shareholders accept an offer to sell the company
the balance of the shareholders agree to the same conditions of sale
(‘drag along rights’). This may be extended to enable an Investor to
‘drag along’ the other shareholders where the Investor accepts an
offer to sell shares after an agreed period of time.
•	 The Investor has the right to purchase shares in any new issue of
shares in the same percentage as their holding.
•	 If a founder has an offer to sell his/her shares, the Investor has the
right to participate by selling the same percentage of their shares
(‘tag along rights’).
•	 The Investor can require their shares be purchased plus accumulated
and unpaid dividends after a specified date in specified stages
(redemption rights).
•	 The offer to invest will be conditional on adequate due diligence and
the production of various documents.
•	 The offer is confidential and will only be open for acceptance for a
specified period of time.
•	 Each party will be responsible for its own professional fees.
The term sheet is an offer to invest. Until accepted, any terms and conditions
can be negotiated, although many of the terms and conditions are standard
and are unlikely to be varied since they protect the Investor in the event of the
business failing to meet their objectives.
In most circumstances term sheets are not legally binding, but provide
guidelines on matters to be documented in subscription and shareholders
agreements.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

133

<-----Page 151----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

An example of a term sheet is provided by the British Venture Capital
Association under the title Example of a Term Sheet for a Series A Round (see
www.bvca.co.uk). While these are local UK legal documents, the terms are
very similar to those which would be present in most other legal jurisdictions.
Another example is given at:
http://www.angelblog.net/The_One_Page_Term_Sheet.html
In most cases the term sheet is issued prior to the completion of due
diligence. As such the Investor will usually reserve the right to amend the terms
of the term sheet should anything of concern be found during the due diligence
process.

Due Diligence
Once the Investor has issued a term sheet and this has been formally accepted,
the Investor will proceed to a full analysis of the investment opportunity. At
this point commercial analysts, lawyers and accountants acting on behalf of
the Investor will undertake a due diligence investigation. The Investor will incur
considerable costs in this investigation and will want to ensure that the firm
is acting in good faith during this period. To protect himself, the Investor will
normally request the firm execute an exclusivity agreement where the firm
agrees not to seek investment from any other party during the due diligence
period. A penalty may be agreed for a breach of this condition.
One objective of the due diligence process is to investigate the firm to see
if the business itself has any major problems which have not been identified in
the information already provided to the Investor. The due diligence process will
undertake a validation of all aspects of the existing business as presented in the
business plan. This would include most of the following:
•	 background checks on the key executives and key employees
•	 review of all financial information and additional investigations where
necessary to validate key numbers
•	 inspection of all key contracts
•	 interviews with major customers, suppliers and distributors

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

134

<-----Page 152----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

•	 verification of costs, expense levels and purchase commitments.
This process will check the integrity and honesty of the firm as well as provide
a view on how well the business is managed and on the adequacy and accuracy
of the information which is being used in the business. It will also uncover how
well the key executives understand their own business and the ease with which
they are able to access and provide additional details necessary to the analysis.
A key part of the due diligence process is for the Investor to identify anything
which would incur additional costs, create delays or expose the business or
the Investor to actual or potential liabilities not identified in the information
provided to the Investor. Items which frequently create problems include:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

non-standard customer contracts
non-standard supplier agreements
harsh lease conditions
loose IP agreements
overly generous reward and remuneration systems
generous health or vacations benefits
shareholders’ rights, legal structures, joint ventures, option schemes
and
anti-dilution arrangements
poor reporting systems
out-of-date equipment
poor quality products or services
personal use of company funds or resources
pre-existing obligations, rights, commitments or restrictions
non-standard rights of existing debt holders.

A business which is effectively and efficiently run, has good customer,
distributor and supplier relationships and has good internal reporting systems
which monitor performance, ensure adherence to compliance regulations and
protect the business from mistakes, should have few problems in satisfying the
Investor.
After the firm has satisfied the Investor with regard to its current operations,
the Investor will examine the business projections and other planned targets
and milestones which underpin the business plan. This is the area which exposes
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

135

<-----Page 153----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

the Investor to the greatest risks. This investigation will review the following:
•	 the identification of the prospective customers and the quality of the
benefits the customers gain from the product or service
•	 the size and growth rate of the prospective market
•	 the size, strength and strategies of current and potential competitors
•	 the quality of the intellectual property underpinning the business
plan
•	 the quality of the sales, marketing and distribution strategies
proposed
•	 the likely ability of the management team to be able to execute the
business plan
•	 availability of executive and specialised staff needed to grow the
business
•	 the quality of the exit strategy proposed
•	 the likely cash flow over the expected investment period.
To the extent that uncovered risks reduce the probability of achieving
the desired outcome or delay the time to execute, the value of the potential
investment declines. In some cases problems can be overcome by installing
additional controls, renegotiating agreements and putting in place alternative
strategies. However, these may result in additional costs or delays in executing
the business plan. To the extent that problems cannot be easily resolved or the
entrepreneur is reluctant to make changes, the investment will incur greater
risks. At some point the Investor will decide that the risks are too great and will
decide not to make the investment.
If the investigation results in an agreement to proceed with the investment,
the firm will most likely incur the costs of the due diligence plus the legal fees
associated with the preparation of the investment agreement. Fortunately,
emerging businesses are often quite small and the amount of investigation
needed to understand their current operations is also small. Due diligence costs
should be reasonable relative to the size of the investment.
Part B of this book sets out an ideal operations checklist against which the
current business can be measured. Start-ups and early stage firms are unlikely
to have sophisticated control and reporting systems in place, but these can be
introduced over time as the business develops. The checklist can form a guide
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

136

<-----Page 154----->Chapter 10: Finalising the Investment

to the development of the governance and operations management within the
firm as it prepares for its next stage of growth. Firms which anticipate accessing
venture capital or expect to undertake an IPO will need to score highly across all
elements of the operations Index.

or the entrepreneur to dramatically increase the probability of
successfully raising Angel or Venture Capital finance he needs to create a
business proposal with these characteristics:
•	 a well-articulated and highly probable exit strategy within three to
five years;
•	 a detailed plan to achieve the exit conditions;
•	 an experienced executive team that can deliver on the plan;
•	 a product/market opportunity that has sufficient competitive
advantage that it has a high probability of reaching the exit
conditions; and
•	 an initial valuation and a likely exit valuation that will provide the VC
fund with a 25%+ plus ROI.
The entrepreneur needs to accept at the outset that there is a high probability
that the exit will be by way of a trade sale, in which some of the executive team
may be made redundant. Even if an IPO strategy is planned, a trade sale should
also be considered as part of exit planning.
The successful entrepreneur creates a business opportunity which meets
the objectives of the Angel or the VC fund, not the personal ambitions of the
executive team. Private equity investors are not solely in the business of building
firms or the commercialisation of inventions. Whilst this may be a by product of

<-----Page 156----->Chapter 11: Conclusion

their investment, their principal focus is simply to invest their own funds or the
funds of their private investors and administer that investment to an exit to gain
a high rate of return to the investors. In the case of the executives of a VC fund,
their personal remuneration is tied to that of their investors and their future
tied to the total return on the fund, thus their motivation is the return on the
investment, not being nice to the entrepreneur or keeping the business going.
The entrepreneur who creates a business opportunity which meets these
needs has a high probability of raising finance.

Introduction

A

ngels and VC investors
typically
invest
in
startup or early stage ventures
where
the
business is
somewhat unsophisticated, management often inexperienced, products
are in development or in their early release stage and internal systems are
poorly developed. In these circumstances it is unrealistic to expect that the
business will be as ‘investment ready’ as it would be for an expansion stage
or late stage venture capital investment. Therefore, instead of measuring the
business proposal against an established business, the Investor will look at the
management team and the underlying assets and capabilities of the business
and try to measure whether it has the potential to emerge into a profitable,
sustainable, growth business or a strategic value business which could provide
the Investor with the exit they desire.
Anticipated development of the business should provide the potential
of taking the firm to an ‘investor-ready’ state if further capital injections are
required. At the same time, the Investor should be preparing the business for a
trade sale, since this is the most likely exit path. An IPO is unlikely, but possible;
the Investor should keep this in mind as they investigate the business and help
it grow and develop.
Part B sets out pre-investment selection criterion of the prospective investee
firm. The first evaluates the alignment of the investee shareholders and
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

141

<-----Page 159----->Part B: Indices

management and then there are three major development charts; the first
assists the Investor to evaluate the venture potential and the second provides a
means of guiding the development of the internal governance and management
processes and systems which will be needed for an effective exit. Using these
Indices, the Entrepreneur can judge the attractiveness of the venture for outside
finance. Finally, the Strategy Index guides the entrepreneur on the process of
raising finance.
The Awareness and Alignment Index (AAI) has been designed to capture the
attitudes and preparedness of the entrepreneur, shareholders and management
team of the business to a possible injection of external capital. Using the AAI,
the Entrepreneur can work through the issues which will confront the Investor
as he assesses whether the management and shareholders are ready for an
injection of external equity finance. The Entrepreneur can use the AAI to
prepare the venture for investment.
Once the Investor is convinced that the firm understands the nature of an
external equity investment and the impact it will have on the current managers
and shareholders, the Investor will then use the Venture Potential Index (VPI) to
measure the quality of the investment proposal. The VPI provides a systematic
method of measuring the quality of the business concept in terms of its ability
to support development of the business to a point where a profitable exit can
be achieved. An investor ready business is generally regarded as one in which an
Angel or Venture Capital (VC) fund would be keen to invest. The list of attributes
has been refined in consultation with a number of successful entrepreneurs who
have raised venture capital, a number of private equity professional advisors as
well as a number of venture capital general partners.
The Entrepreneur who is keen to develop their business using external
private equity can use the VPI to measure their ‘investor ready’ state. Where
they see deficiencies, they can, where possible, adjust their business concept,
change products, markets and organisational structure and so on, to create a
better candidate for investment. However, a venture which scores low on the
VPI and which cannot be readily changed, will be an unlikely candidate for
external private equity finance.
The Entrepreneur should also be sensitive to the fact that the VPI keeps in
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

142

<-----Page 160----->Part B: Indices

mind the potential for a trade sale exit and assesses whether the venture has
the potential for either a financial or strategic exit.
The next Index is the Operations Development Index which (ODI) should
be used as a checklist in evaluating the quality of operations management in
the venture. Its primary purpose is to provide a guide for the development of
governance and operations management once the investment has been made
and to indicate to the Investor how much work needs to be done to prepare
the venture for an exit. A business which scores more highly on the ODI will
be a venture which is easier for the Investor to work with and will be better
positioned for an early exit. Certainly those firms which achieve a higher score
on the ODI will be more effectively and efficiently managed and so allocating
resources to improve their situation according to the ODI would benefit day-today operations.
Raising Angel or VC finance is a process which needs to be managed over
time. There are a series of actions which need to be taken both within and
outside the firm to secure the investment. The final Index, Strategy, provides a
process whereby the firm can assess its progress towards closing an investment
proposal.
Each attribute of the Indices helps to define the state of readiness of the
firm either for investment or exit. It is unlikely that any firm would have an ideal
position on every item; however, the scoring will indicate where improvements
can be made or problems addressed. The AAI will show the Investor where
the firm is currently in their preparation for external investment and should be
used by the entrepreneur to stimulate discussion and action within their firm
to ensure the firm is better prepared for initial discussions with an external
investor.
The VPI can be used to undertake an initial evaluation of the likelihood of
being able to secure investment and then later to guide development of the
business to an investor ready or exit objective. The ODI will help identify just how
well developed internal processes of governance and operations management
monitoring systems are and guide development work on their implementation
and improvement. In many cases, specialist assistance will be required to
implement changes needed to reach higher Index scores.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

143

<-----Page 161----->Part B: Indices

The purpose of the Indices is to help the Entrepreneur evaluate their own
chances of securing investment and to manage the process of securing the
investment. The first three Indices mirror what an Angel or VC investor will
evaluate in assessing the venture for investment. It is thus a comprehensive and
systematic way of investigating a proposed investment and should help isolate
any serious deficiencies in the proposed business. Each question or attribute
will provide an insight into the business and the work which will be needed to
make it investor ready.
Angel and VC investing is a process not an event. Historically, many Angels and
VC Investors thought that they could rely on their gut feel or on their evaluation
of the entrepreneur and a quick walk around the firm’s offices to judge the
quality of the investment proposal. While these factors are important, the
investing process has become much more formal and sophisticated, especially
through the development of formal Angel syndicate investing. Angels and VC
investors now appreciate that a systematic and comprehensive review is more
likely to catch fatal flaws and problems.
In many cases, the effectively managed firm will score highly on an attribute.
In other areas, where no attention has been given to preparing the business for
an external investment, little will have been done. By scoring these attributes,
you will find out the status of the business and identify what needs to be done
to prepare it for external investment. Alternatively, you may find out something
which will cause you to abandon seeking external investment.
The Indices are constructed with an ‘attainment’ or ‘achievement’ scale of
1-5. To complete an Index, you should circle the description which is closest to
the current position.

Once you have identified where the firm is on the attribute, you will be able
to see from the later descriptions the actions which you might need to take to
turn this venture into one which will attract Angel or VC investment.

and
VC
investment
is
beneficial
for
many businesses, but it is not for everyone. In
fact, it may directly contradict some shareholder’s plans for the business. At
the same time, the venture may be inappropriate for an external investment.
What is clear is that the shareholders and senior management team should
understand the domain and objectives of the Investor and seriously consider
whether they are willing to meet the conditions and obligations inherent in
that type of investment. The business which is able to show the potential for a
successful exit sought by an Investor would stand a good chance of gaining Angel
or VC investment, but the conditions which come along with the investment
may still be unacceptable to the business. Thus some education in this area is
certainly beneficial for anyone considering this type of investment.
Once the nature of an Angel or VC investment is understood, there still needs
to be a clear understanding on the part of the shareholders and management as
to the objectives to be achieved through the investment. Those objectives need
to be aligned closely with those of the Investor.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

145

<-----Page 163----->Part B: Indices

A1.	 Majority shareholders agree on an external equity 	
	
financing strategy
The obvious implications of an external investment are:
•	 A dilution in existing shareholders’ equity.
•	 Some constraints on executive decision-making, especially with regard
to the issue of shares, extensions of debt and executive remuneration.
•	 Management will be expected to agree to various performance targets.
Failure to achieve those may result in a loss of voting rights, termination
of management contracts and the business being sold.
•	 Internal systems will become more formal and a higher emphasis will be
placed on record keeping, governance and compliance.
•	 A formal Board of Directors will be required (if it does not exist already)
and the Investor will almost certainly want at least one position on that
Board.
•	 An exit strategy for the Investor will most likely have to be achieved
within 3-7 years. This may be in the form of a buyback, trade sale or IPO.
•	 Additional rounds of capital injection may be required from Angels or a
VC.
The majority shareholders need to seriously consider the implications on
their own ownership positions and, where appropriate, their roles as managers
and directors. The majority shareholders need to agree on the need for the
external investment for there to be an effective plan to proceed to raise the
investment.

Self-assessment
1.	 Discussions have not been undertaken with or between the major
shareholders.
2.	 Majority shareholders have talked about taking on an external
investment but have not taken the discussions seriously or established
any consensus about timing.
3.	 The shareholders have agreed on raising external capital but as yet have
not decided on a strategy.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

146

<-----Page 164----->Part B: Indices

4.	 The majority shareholders have agreed how they will approach the
project of raising external capital and have formulated a strategy but
have not taken professional advice on whether the strategy has a
reasonable chance of success.
5.	 The majority shareholders have refined a strategy in conjunction with a
professional advisor.

A2.	 Managers and owners agree on use of funds
Any approach to an external investor should be able to show how the use of
the investment funds will directly contribute to the development and growth of
the business and to achieving the objectives of the Investor. Too often applicants
seeking Angel and VC investment are focused on solving business problems,
refinancing an ailing business, buying out a shareholder or trying to build a cash
buffer, rather than directing their attention to providing the external investor
with an outstanding opportunity. Even where there is an obvious investment
opportunity, there may be disagreement among the managers and owners over
how the growth and profit objectives are to be achieved.
Angel and VC investors are rarely experts in a specific business, especially
when a business works with complex technologies or is based on specialist
knowledge. Thus the investor is reliant, to a large extent, on the managers of
the business to come up with a resilient plan to achieve the growth objectives
needed to satisfy the investment objectives. Unless the management have taken
the time and effort to develop such a plan, disagreement is likely to occur in the
management team as the investor digs into their intended strategy. Nothing is
likely to kill off a deal faster than an investor being exposed to a lack of agreed
strategy or a team which clearly is not in synch.
The management team needs to be able to show the Investor a robust
business plan which incorporates the use of the investment funds and shows
the expected growth of the business and how the objectives of the Investor can
be achieved. This needs to be endorsed by the majority shareholders and by the
current Board of Directors. To ensure the plan is consistent with the requirements
of the Investor, it should be presented in a way that the Investor can evaluate
it and build an investment proposal for discussion with any co-investors. It
would be helpful to the Investor if the business plan had been reviewed by
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

147

<-----Page 165----->Part B: Indices

professional advisors who work frequently with Angel and VC investors. This
would be helpful to the Investor as the professional advisor’s recommendations
for layout, style and detail and any changes they advise on the use of the funds
could be agreed with management and majority shareholders and incorporated
into the business plan before it is sent off to the Investor for evaluation.

Self-assessment
1.	 Senior management and majority shareholders have not discussed how
any investment would be used.
2.	 Discussions have been held by senior management but there is no
consensus on how or where the funds will be used.
3.	 Managers and majority shareholders are agreed on the priorities for the
use of investment funds but have yet to integrate this into a proposed
investment business plan.
4.	 A detailed investment business plan has been created which shows how
an external investment would be utilised and has identified the results
which would accrue to that investment; however, professional advice
has not been sought as to whether this would meet the needs of the
Investor.
5.	 Professional advice has been sought on the use of the funds and
adjustments have been made to the investment business plan to
incorporate that advice.

A3.	 Entrepreneur and key managers are committed to 	
	
the venture
Without the entrepreneur and the key management team the venture is
unlikely to be successful. The Investor needs to see a commitment on the part
of the key individuals to ensure they will put their best efforts into the venture.
The Investor is not a full-time member of the management team and so is reliant
on the entrepreneur and the management team to take the business forward.
The business has to be operated on a daily basis by those most committed to
it, even if the task becomes onerous or stressful. The Investor wants to see that
these individuals have something at risk if the venture fails and much to gain it
if is successful. The Investor needs to have some assurance that members of the
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

148

<-----Page 166----->Part B: Indices

team won’t bail out when things go wrong or when they need to step up their
commitment to see the venture through hard times.
A condition of many external investments is to have senior management
share in the risks as well as the rewards. This may be through an equity stake,
employee options, generous bonuses on successful completion of milestones
and/or a bonus on a successful exit. A business which does not reflect this
balance of risk and reward for key individuals will need to implement ownership
and bonus structures which provide the Investor with an assurance that the key
individuals are committed to making the venture successful.

Self-assessment
1.	 The firm has not considered this issue. Some key individuals do not have
equity or options and bonus systems are not in place to motivate longterm commitment.
2.	 Most senior management have equity but, for some, their allocation is
not at a sufficient level to ensure long-term commitment. Small bonuses
are possible on achieving individual objectives.
3.	 Each of the senior management team has adequate incentives in the
form of equity and/or options to be committed to the venture. Other key
employees have bonuses for personal achievement.
4.	 Senior management and key employees have equity and/or options
sufficient to motivate them to stay committed to the venture. In
addition to personal bonuses, there are corporate-wide bonuses for
major milestones. The system of rewards has not been reviewed by
a professional advisor to ensure it would be sufficient to support an
external investment.
5.	 The allocation of equity and options and the system of bonuses have
been reviewed by a professional advisor and adjusted to assure an
Investor that it provides a good basis for key executive and key employee
commitment to an external investment.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

149

<-----Page 167----->Part B: Indices

A4.	 Key shareholders are familiar with exit conditions
External investors are faced with a lack of liquidity when it comes to
recovering their investment in a private business. Generally few investors wish
to hold a minority position in a private company as they have little control
over the events of the business and generally are unable to recover their
money when they need it, especially if the business gets into trouble. Thus the
investor imposes on the firm a series of conditions which will effectively force
the business to undertake a liquidity event within a reasonable period of the
investment, say 3-7 years, in order for the Investor to recover their money and
hopefully achieve a reasonable return on their investment.
The exit conditions are mainly as follows:
•	 If an offer is received for the business, the Investor may force the
shareholders to accept it.
•	 If the shareholders wish to sell their shares, they will not be able to do
so without selling those of the Investor.
•	 The business may need to undertake an IPO within a set period or, failing
that, be put up for sale.
•	 The existing shareholders may be required to buy back the shares of the
Investor after a certain period where failure to do so would result in the
sale of the business.
•	 Failure to achieve agreed performance targets may result in the Investor
taking control over the business. Once this is achieved, the Investor
might decide to sell the business in order to liquidate their investment.

Self-assessment
1.	 Key shareholders have little or no knowledge of Angel and VC
investment conditions.
2.	 Key shareholders are agreed which the firm could be sold if they fail to
meet targets but are unaware of how this would work operationally.
3.	 The key shareholders are aware of the different conditions which will
be imposed on them in terms of the performance requirements of the
Investor but senior management and majority shareholders have not

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

150

<-----Page 168----->Part B: Indices

discussed how this will work or how they will manage the business to
meet those targets.
4.	 Senior management and key shareholders have developed an external
investment plan, with events and targets which senior management
believe are achievable, which will meet the management and exit
requirements of the Investor and still leave them in control during the
investment phase.
5.	 The firm has engaged a professional advisor to brief them on the
investment conditions of an external Investor and has reviewed the
investment plan to ensure that management has a reasonable chance of
meeting the Investor’s conditions.

A5.	 Cost and time for raising funds is understood
Few entrepreneurs appreciate the level of time, effort and costs which they
will incur during the process of raising external investment. Those who have
been through the process estimate that 50% of the CEO’s time and much of
the CFO’s time over a period of three to nine months will be consumed with
preparation, presentations and negotiations. In addition, the due diligence
activity can easily consume many months of staff time. During this process, the
business has to be directed and managed without impacting on revenue and
profit – a very tall order indeed.
Better preparation can considerably ease the burden on the executive team
and administration staff. This may include compilation and update of due diligence
files, a periodically updated business plan, regular and comprehensive monthly
management reports, compliance audits and performance reviews based on key
performance indicators and budgets. By working with knowledgeable advisors
during preparation for an investment, the time to find the right investor will
be cut and the discussions streamlined as the executive team will be better
prepared for the negotiations.
An Investor will want to spend time with the senior executives to get to know
them and to develop an understanding of the business. This will take most
senior executives away from the business for significant portions of time. The
business needs to have a plan in place so that the rest of the executive team can
carry on without undue disruption to the flow of activity.

<-----Page 169----->Part B: Indices

Self-assessment
1.	 Senior management and majority shareholders have not discussed the
time and resources required to raise external investment.
2.	 The firm has some idea of the time and effort required but has yet to
allocate these or consider how the business will operate while senior
management is diverted into that activity. The cost incurred to raise
funds has not been estimated.
3.	 Advice has been sought on the process of raising investment and the
amount of time and effort has been clearly identified but responsibilities
for activities and succession plans have not been planned or agreed. The
cost incurred to raise funds has been estimated.
4.	 Responsibilities for the investment raising activity have been allocated
but responsibility for managing the ongoing operations has yet to be
clearly allocated and assigned.
5.	 A plan has been agreed with senior management and subordinates with
respect to roles and responsibilities for undertaking the investment
activities as well as the running of the day-to-day operations. A budget
has been allocated for the costs associated with raising the investment.

A6.	 Board of Directors accept authority limits of an 		
	
external investment
Many immature businesses seeking external investment have little
experience with formal Boards of Directors and will find the process of setting
up a Board and handing over authority for significant strategic decisions very
uncomfortable and often frustrating. No longer can the executive team meet
whenever they feel like it and make a decision which materially affects the
shape of the business. More developed firms which have constituted a Board
of Directors may have friends and family on the board and perhaps a trusted
family advisor, such as a local lawyer or accountant. With the introduction of the
external investor, the role of the board will change markedly and the existing
executive directors will have to justify their actions, defer major decisions to
the Board and allow the Investor to have the final say on a number of strategic
activities. This can be very confronting to the entrepreneur who is used to
having the Board rubber stamp his or her actions.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

152

<-----Page 170----->Part B: Indices

The investment agreement will specify that a number of activities can only
be taken with the approval of the external director. This would almost certainly
include issuing new shares, declaration of a dividend, changes in senior
management remuneration, changes in levels of debt and approval of capital
expenditure. The following descriptors refer to the Board of Directors prior to
an investment.

Self-assessment
1.	 The Board of Directors have little understanding of the authority limits
imposed under an Angel or VC investment.
2.	 The Board of Directors understand that there will be some constraints
on decisions they make but are unfamiliar with the type and extent of
such limits.
3.	 The Board of Directors has reviewed a list of the limits on authority
which will be placed on them by an Investor but have yet to translate
these into operational or strategic impact.
4.	 The Board of Directors understands and accept the limits on their
authority imposed on them by an Investor but have yet to translate this
into operational details and procedures.
5.	 The Board of Directors have reviewed the authority limits imposed by an
external investment with a professional advisor and has implemented
various limits on the authority of management and established
procedures for how issues relating to those items will be handled in
Board meetings.

A7.	 Post-investment management roles and 			
	
responsibilities accepted
Experienced Investors place great emphasis on having the right management
team in place. This reflects the wisdom of having an experienced team with
the right mixture of qualifications, skills, networks and industry experience but
also the lessons learned over the years by Angels and VC Investors that few
plans are implemented as expected. The experienced entrepreneurial team
adapts to changing circumstances and copes well with unforeseen events. The
current management team will be thoroughly scrutinized and gaps exposed.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

153

<-----Page 171----->Part B: Indices

The Investor may well suggest (and impose) management changes either
through a new alignment of roles and responsibilities or the introduction of
new executives.
Clearly it is in everyone’s interest to have a successful venture. The business
which sees an investment as an opportunity to introduce new talent into the
business will be well received by the Investor. Finding experienced executives
who have experienced growth to the level the venture needs to achieve can
make all the difference in the success of the venture. At the same time, the
entrepreneur will need to acknowledge that some of his current team may be
inappropriate for the new growth plan. Regrettably that means that some of
the current executives may lose their jobs or be relegated to more junior roles.
Understanding that such changes may occur and being willing to work through
them to find the best overall solution, will be critical in securing an investment.

Self-assessment
1.	 Senior management and majority shareholders are not aware that any
changes could or would be made to their senior management team or
their responsibilities.
2.	 Senior management have reviewed their management experience and
functional expertise and experience and have determined that they have
some gaps but are yet to develop a plan to address them.
3.	 Specific skill gaps have been identified in the management team. Senior
management and majority shareholders have acknowledged that the
Investor may require changes in responsibilities, a new organisational
structure or some new senior executives. However, this has not been
accepted by senior management and they have not accepted that it
might be a condition of the investment.
4.	 Senior management and the majority shareholders have acknowledged
and agreed that they lack a number of skills, the organisation structure
may need to be changed, an Investor may require some new executive
talent and their current roles and responsibilities are most likely to
change.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

154

<-----Page 172----->Part B: Indices

5.	 A professional advisor has reviewed the management team, organisation
structure and responsibilities and proposed changes in structure and
roles. The advisor has also helped the firm to develop a proposal for
filling gaps in the management team which has been included in the
investment plan. The current management acknowledge that an Investor
may have a different view and the new structure and roles will need to
be negotiated and agreed with the Investor.

A8.	 Angel and VC valuation models are understood and 	
	
accepted
Many deals are never concluded or, in fact, never proceed to substantial
business negotiations because the majority owners have quite unrealistic
views about what the business is worth. It is important that the firm seeking
external investment have some understanding of valuation methodology.
While it is always possible for valuation formulae to be used which are based
on performance or on an exit value, it is unlikely that this will be agreed in the
early stages of the discussion.
It is important that each party accept the valuation norms of the Angel or VC
investment sector prevailing at the time they are seeking investment. This way
valuation does not get in the way of the negotiations proceeding. Variations to
the norm can then be negotiated based on how future risks may be translated
into equity share. The process set out here provides a basis for negotiating value
but it starts with an understanding of conventional valuation techniques. From
that point, the entrepreneur or Investor can argue for a variation which perhaps
better reflects the risk tolerance of each party.
Few entrepreneurs have current knowledge of what is happening in the Angel
and VC investment sector and this is where access to knowledgeable advisors
can be a great help. The advisor can provide the entrepreneur with information
on current transactions and also work with the firm to develop a valuation
which could be used in the investment discussions. An Investor will recognise
that the entrepreneur has sought professional advice and will be expecting that
the valuation proposed will be close to the final negotiated value.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

155

<-----Page 173----->Part B: Indices

In the case of a potential strategic trade sale, the entrepreneur or the Investor
may have some view on the value to the potential buyer and this may be used
as a basis for a valuation discussion.

Self-assessment
1.	 The firm has no appreciation or knowledge of how an Angel or VC
Investor will establish valuation and equity arrangements.
2.	 The firm understands conventional valuation formulae and anticipates
that this will be used by the Investor as a basis for negotiation but has
no real understanding of how the final valuation and equity share will be
determined.
3.	 The firm has some familiarity with valuation techniques used by the
Angel and VC investment sector and some knowledge of how equity
will be structured following an investment but does not have a good
understanding of how this might be applied in their venture.
4.	 The firm has built a valuation model based on conventional Angel and
VC valuation methods and has determined what they believe will be
a reasonable basis for valuation and equity share but has not had this
validated by a professional advisor.
5.	 The firm has engaged a professional advisor to assist in the development
of a valuation and equity share model which would be acceptable as a
basis for negotiation with an Investor.

A9.	 Level of finance required is realistic
What can go wrong will go wrong. Perhaps not – but this is the view which
most Investors take when evaluating the level of investment required to provide
a firm basis for development of the venture. Under-funding during the critical
growth stages can place the business in a desperate situation where product
development is not quite finished, cash flows are not yet positive or market
development has not reached a critical turning point. Typically, the only option
firms have at this point is to seek a further injection of cash. Unfortunately this
can often only be achieved at a valuation lower than the one established when
the initial Angel or VC investment was made. Investors will negotiate hard to
avoid this situation.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

156

<-----Page 174----->Part B: Indices

A realistic view of the funds needed can only be achieved through a thorough
simulation exercise of the venture. Various scenarios need to be created across
a range of possible outcomes which include worse case, most likely and best
case situations. In this way, the sensitivity of the venture to the level of funding
needed and the estimated return to an Investor can be ascertained. With this
knowledge, the firm can better negotiate the investment. It may be possible
for the investment to be taken in tranches to reflect funding needs and for
the equity position to be adjusted accordingly. The Investor can then set aside
the maximum likely investment funds but recognises that not all of it may be
needed.

Self-assessment
1.	 Senior management has not undertaken any rigorous analysis of the
financing requirements of the business.
2.	 The funding requirements of the current business are well known
and understood but this has not been reviewed in light of the ROI
requirements of an external investor.
3.	 The firm has considered the ROI requirements of an Investor and has
considered the impact this might have on the business strategy and but
has yet to translate this into the business plan.
4.	 The ROI requirements have been worked into the business strategy
and into the operational business plan, establishing the level of funding
which would be required from an Investor, but this has not been
reviewed by a professional advisor.
5.	 A professional advisor has reviewed the funding requirements,
requested a sensitivity analysis on the strategy and assisted the firm to
establish the level of funding they believe an Investor would be expected
to provide in order that the investor’s desired ROI has a reasonable
chance of being achieved.

Venture Potential

T

he essence of any Angel or Venture Capital investment
evaluation
is
the
quality
of
the
management
team (as discussed in Awareness and Alignment) and the quality and viability of
the business concept itself. That is, how and where is the money made and how
does the investor get a return on their investment? The Investor is looking for
a set of attributes which, in a holistic manner, provide a strong and compelling
business case for an investment. Each attribute should lead to a high probability
of a successful outcome. Any attribute which has a weak situation leaves a gap
in the plan and can lead to failure or erosion of the business by an internal or
external weakness or threat.
We need to differentiate in our evaluation of a potential investment between
those ventures which are being prepared for a financial exit, a financial trade
sale or an IPO, from those which are destined for a strategic exit. In a financial
exit, the robustness of the business concept and its ability to generate growth
in revenue and profits are critical. In a strategic exit, what we are seeking
are strategic value assets or capabilities and a management team to take the
venture to a strategic trade sale. In a strategic sale the buyer will be providing
the horsepower to take the product or service to market, capabilities to drive
revenue and profit growth may be of little consequence in the proposed venture.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

159

<-----Page 177----->Part B: Indices

The attributes listed in this Index are those which have been found to have
a significant impact on the success of financial ventures. While they apply to
all financial businesses, later stage businesses may already have moved past
the point where they can substantially change their market position, however,
these should have proven revenue and profit to show a viable business concept.
Many of the product/market attributes are also critical for strategic ventures.
An Investor in unlikely to find a venture which scores highly on all attributes,
but since they are constantly seeking investment opportunities, each possible
deal must compete with other investment opportunities which the Investor has
reviewed. The Investor is looking for those ventures which have the greatest
potential and the highest probability of success. It is almost certainly the
case that assistance from an Investor would improve the business, after all,
this is what the Investor is looking for – an investment where they can add
value through their knowledge and finance. The Investor may be able to find
additional executive talent to fill out the team, connect the firm with strategic
customers or alliance partners or secure a strategic supplier.
In evaluating the venture potential, it may be that the Investor, with superior
knowledge of a particular market, may see greater potential than has been
evidenced by the entrepreneur. For example, the Investor may know a strategic
partner relationship which can be readily secured or a potential acquirer for the
business. While such insights cannot be guaranteed, the Entrepreneur should
seek out an Investor who has experience in their sector so that synergistic
benefits can be tapped.

B1.	

Business and economic conditions support the venture

Ventures which are most likely to succeed are driven by significant change,
whether this is in technology, legislation, consumer values or the economy.
New technology often solves problems which were previously not able to be
addressed or significantly enhances productivity or reduces cost in solving
existing problems. Obvious demographic trends create new needs in housing,
aged care, infrastructure, travel services and so on. New legislation often creates
new opportunities in compliance training and auditing.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

160

<-----Page 178----->Part B: Indices

Investors look for the problem the business is solving. The more obvious
the problem and the greater the imbalance between demand and supply, the
more urgent the need is and the higher is the likelihood that the business will
be successful. Businesses need to solve a problem or meet a need and the
entrepreneur should be able to show the source of that need and the size of it.
This should be able to be validated with independent data.

Self-assessment
1.	 Evaluation has not yet been undertaken.
2.	 There are changes which appear to support the venture but evaluation
has not been undertaken. The proposal is based on personal opinion.
3.	 There are clear indications of changes which support the venture in
external independent information. Validation has not been undertaken
of the strength or likely duration of the need or to what extent the need
is currently being satisfied.
4.	 Business and economic conditions which support the venture are well
documented and supported by externally validated data. Informal
research shows that the business need is unsatisfied and a strong
demand for a solution exists.
5.	 Business and economic conditions strongly support the venture either
through legislative changes, strong demographic changes, major shifts
in consumer values, major changes in technology or major economic
shifts. The proposal is strongly underpinned with validation data, expert
opinion of customer needs and the lack of a currently available solution.

<-----Page 179----->Part B: Indices

B2.	
	

Well articulated, focused vision of the purpose of the
venture

	

More successful ventures have focus. They clearly know the problem they
are solving and have a very good description of their customer. They are able
to articulate why they exist, often in very simple terms. The purpose of creating
a short, focused vision of the venture is to ensure that all parts of the business
are heading in the same direction and are supporting the various parts and
not undermining it. Decision-making should become easier, actions are more
targeted and results can be measured in terms of where the business should
be heading.
Few external investors have the specialist knowledge to evaluate the technical
merit of a range of diverse business ventures. However, they can appreciate a
clear non-technical statement of what the business does and the need or problem
it is addressing. Nothing is more off-putting to an investor as the entrepreneur
who has a product that solves everything, which will be available everywhere
and should be bought by everyone. Nor do they appreciate the venture team
which can’t decide which of the many problems they are going to address first
or which market they are targeting. A clear, focused vision statement which has
been carefully crafted, matches the competitive advantages of the venture and
is agreed to by the venture team, is an essential part of the investment request.
In the context of a strategic venture, the vision of the venture may simply be
to prepare the business for sale. However, the venture needs to see its vision in
terms of the way in which the buyer would see the vision of the acquired firm.
Thus a clearly articulated vision of product/market positioning is still important.

Self-assessment
1.	 The venture does not have a vision statement.
2.	 The vision of the venture is stated in broad terms, lacks focus and may
be overly technical or lengthy.
3.	 The vision is brief but is overly technical, too long or fails to clearly state
who the customer is or the problem being addressed. The vision may
be stated in terms of a product for sale rather than a problem being
addressed.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

162

<-----Page 180----->Part B: Indices

4.	 The vision clearly states the target customer, the problem being solved
and is well focused and brief but is overly technical. The vision may be
focused on a single product rather than a range of problems which may
be addressed within a complimentary set of products or services which
could be developed and delivered over time.
5.	 The venture has a well-articulated vision of the business concept
including the problem being addressed and the solutions which are and
will be offered. The vision is brief and to the point and is stated in terms
that an educated non-industry investor can clearly understand.

B3.	

Innovative product, process or business concept

A business which does the same as every other business in the sector will
ultimately be forced to compete on price. If the product or service is the same as
others in the market, then without a competitive cost advantage over the major
expenses in the business, the venture has little chance of growth and certainly
is not going to reach the levels of revenue and profits which the Investor is
seeking. Cost advantages rarely drive significant exit values. What the Investor
will be seeking are products or services which are differentiated sufficiently so
they can command a premium price in a niche market.
The Investor looks for an edge. What is it that this business has or does which
will provide it with a competitive advantage? This almost certainly is driven
by an innovation in product, process and/or business concept. The size or
impact of the innovation is a metric which conveys information about the likely
competitive advantage. A substantial innovation which significantly changes
the cost structure of an industry, greatly improves customer value or opens up
solutions to formerly unsolved problems, provides the underpinning for high
rates of growth.
Obviously, the more unique the innovation and the more the customers
value the impact, the more it adds to the potential competitive advantage of
the venture. Innovation which does not add to customer value may in fact
detract from the worth of the venture. If the innovation adds costs to the
product but fails to add additional customer value, the venture is unlikely to

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

163

<-----Page 181----->Part B: Indices

succeed. Innovations which add costs but at the same time significantly improve
customer value can create a solid foundation for a business.

Self-assessment
1.	 The product or service is the same as many others in the market.
2.	 The product offered has only minor differences to the competition.
3.	 The product has clear differentiation from others in the marketplace but
the differences are not sufficient to necessarily capture customers from
competitive offerings.
4.	 The product has major differences from competitive offerings and
customers will value those differences. Products have a strong
competitive advantage.
5.	 The product has breakthrough advantages which clearly separate it from
competitors. Customers highly value the advantages and this will create
a leadership position. Products are the only offering in a new emerging
market or are the only products able to solve the target problem.

B4.	

Clear and compelling customer need

Clearly the most desirable position for any firm to be in is for their product
to be needed desperately by a set of customers. This does not mean something
they desire or would like to have, or even something they want to have. This
refers to something they must have and, better still, must have now! You may
well argue that few products can ever be so compelling but, in fact, many basic
products would fit that need. Each person has a need for food and water, basic
accommodation and security. Without electricity, water and sewage services,
life in urban areas would be impossible. This is possibly the major reason why
these services are regulated. Food is of course satisfying a basic need although
there are many alternatives. But the compelling need is still there.
Some conditions do create compelling needs. Virtually all regulations
have compliance requirements and associated penalties for non-compliance.
A product or service which stops you from being fined or going to jail has a
high compelling need to buy. Products and services which neutralise or reduce
physical or psychological pain and suffering easily fall into the class of products
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

164

<-----Page 182----->Part B: Indices

which have a compelling need to buy. However, products which have little
impact if not purchased, have many near substitutes or can be indefinitely
delayed have a low compelling need.
Some products, such as designer labels, well established and trusted brands
and products with high repeat-purchase attributes have a higher score on
compelling need to buy.

Self-assessment
1.	 The product or service has many competitive and substitute offerings
and is highly discretionary or optional. Customers regard the purchase as
a nice to have rather than a must have.
2.	 The product satisfies a clear customer desire but it is neither urgent nor
pressing and can be satisfied by a large number of alternative solutions
or products. Customers can decide not to buy without being overly
concerned.
3.	 There is a clear need, but satisfying the need can be deferred as it is
not an urgent need to satisfy. Customers have a strong preference to
purchase and would be concerned if they were not able to. There are
some acceptable near alternatives.
4.	 The need is obvious and of high value to the customer but may be
temporarily deferred or can be partly satisfied by poor alternatives.
Customers have a strong desire to purchase and would be seriously
concerned by deferring the purchase.
5.	 There is a compelling need to purchase to avoid high physical or
psychological pain, to avoid severe penalties or costs or to obtain/
maintain competitive advantage. Deferment is not really an option, nor
are there any substitute solutions.

B5.	
	

Sufficient, willing, funded, identifiable and reachable
customers

	

A great number of businesses target 16-25 year olds, time poor executives,
free thinkers or people with a desire to feel young at heart. The problem with this
approach is that it is difficult to be proactive, to actually reach out and connect
directly with the target customer. These businesses are highly dependent
on passing traffic for business. It is far better to have a clearly identifiable
target customer who you can directly and proactively approach. You need to
offer something for which you know they have already expressed a need. For
example, a product for registered dentists, members of a gym or subscribers to
a journal are easily approached with an offer to purchase.
A clearly reachable, identifiable customer is one you can get in front of with
your product or service message. Potential customers must be identified with
a location where you can deliver your message. This also needs to be cost
effective, thus a TV advertisement aimed at registered dentists does not make a
lot of sense when a trade journal, a dental conference or a direct sales visit to a
registered dental surgery would have a higher conversion rate.
An important attribute of the target market must be that they have the
willingness and the ability to spend on the product or service. Furthermore, the
business needs customers in sufficient numbers in order that the business can
make enough revenue and profit to be a viable entity.
In a strategic sale, it will be the ability of the buyer to reach a customer base
which will be critical to new revenue generation but the need to have a clearly
defined customer is still important for the strategic buyer. The definition of the
customer profile will often provide the key to the identification of the potential
strategic buyers. The customer/market definition required in a strategic sale
is that of the potential buyer. That is, which large corporations have a large
customer base of the target customer and have the capability and capacity to
sell the venture’s products or services into their customer base.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

166

<-----Page 184----->Part B: Indices

Self-assessment
1.	 Numbers of customers, their defined attributes and locations and
whether they are willing and able to buy have not been established.
2.	 Customer definition is reasonably clear but no attempt has been made
to establish whether they can be approached proactively, are willing to
purchase or are in sufficient numbers to make the venture attractive.
3.	 A clear definition of the customer exists, intention to purchase has been
established but the size of the market has not been established nor has
a program been developed to proactively reach them.
4.	 The size and location of a clearly defined existing and/or potential
customer market has been established. The size of the market has been
established and the level of buying intention has been estimated.
5.	 A clearly identifiable and reachable existing and/or potential customer
market has been defined and validated. There is a clear intention to
purchase the specific product of the firm and the size of the market
would support the projected revenue of the venture.

B6.	

Obvious and meaningful competitive advantage

If you have a product or service in a marketplace which is simply littered with
comparable offerings, you can have very little hope that your venture is going
to be successful. If everything you do to be different can be readily copied with
little effort, clearly you are in a business which has little chance of success. Only
by finding a strong point of difference in an attribute that the target customers
value will your own products or services carve out a segment of the market. The
most desirable position to be in is to have a product which not only fully meets
the needs of the target customers, but has no competitor or near substitute and
has significant barriers to entry.
For a competitive advantage to be meaningful it needs to be validated
by actual or potential customers. The difference must be meaningful and
sufficiently important to the target customers that they have a clearly expressed
preference for the product or service you are offering. Validation is also needed
to ensure that a close alternative product is not available. A competitor analysis
is necessary for you to validate your competitive advantage.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

167

<-----Page 185----->Part B: Indices

Self-assessment
1.	 A competitive analysis has not been undertaken.
2.	 The firm knows of a number of competitors but has not done any
systematic analysis of their position relative to the competition.
3.	 A competitive analysis has been undertaken and shows the firm has
some differentiation which should appeal to potential customers.
4.	 The firm has a clear competitive advantage in its target market and
has validated this with potential customers who value the differential
features.
5.	 The firm has outstanding differentiation which is highly valued by
the target market or there are no obvious competitors and there are
significant barriers to entry.

B7.	

Well protected sustainable attributes

While the firm may have established a competitive advantage with its product
or service, this is really only beneficial if it can sustain and/or protect it over the
long term. Sustainability can be achieved from registered intellectual property
(IP) such as is the case of patents or copyrights. Protection may lie in the fact
that the firm has certain rights which are exclusive or limited such as mining or
forestry rights or a licence to practice. Expert knowledge, if hard to acquire, in
limited supply or requiring extensive experience or training, may provide the
basis for a sustainable advantage.
Protection can be legal rights which attach to patents or licences. Products
and services can be protected by being difficult, expensive or time consuming
to copy. A business may protect itself by controlling elements of the market
such as preferred outlets, distribution channels or essential components. Other
firms may be effectively locked out of a market through customer or supplier
agreements or by controlling the source of an essential resource input. The
ability to defend encroachment is an essential factor in maintaining protection.
The firm which cannot defend a patent infringement, for example, has little
protection against a large well-funded predator.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

168

<-----Page 186----->Part B: Indices

The value achieved in a strategic sale is directly related to the level of
exploitation of the venture’s products or services by the buyer. Therefore, the
buyer is keenly interested in the level and sustainability of the competitive
advantage which will be passed to them by the seller.

Self-assessment
1.	 The venture has not been able to establish any long-term protection for
its products or services.
2.	 Products or services have short-term protection but this can be eroded
by a determined competitor or anticipated new products in the market.
3.	 Products have some level of long-term protection but only through an
aggressive product development process, strong customer service and/
or features which appeal to a niche market.
4.	 The firm has strong intellectual property protection through patents,
copyright or registration rights but these may be overcome or eroded
by a determined and well-funded competitor although this would take
some years to be effective.
5.	 The firm has very strong intellectual property protection through
patents, strong branding, high customer loyalty or highly specialised and
difficult to acquire knowledge. Significant funding and/or strong alliance
partnerships are present to defend IP which can be expected to deter
copying.

Resources and channels to distribute are in place or able to 	
be acquired

Great products or services which cannot be placed where customers can see
them, try them or buy them are simply not going to generate revenue in any
volume. A business which has an intention to grow, especially one wishing to
grow aggressively, has to find channels to market which will put its products
in front of the intended target customers in sufficient numbers for growth to
be achieved. There are many possible channels to market and the business
needs to choose those which are most appropriate for the type of product or
service being offered as well as the type and purchase preferences of the target
customer.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

169

<-----Page 187----->Part B: Indices

Some products suit direct sales or telemarketing and/or telesales, so capacity
must be built within those channels. Can the business acquire, afford and train
sufficient skilled numbers of staff to handle the intended volume? If the product
suits a high volume distribution channel, can that be acquired or contracted at
a price which is cost effective? Is the business able to utilise alliance partners
or joint ventures to take the product to market? Many small firms lack the
distribution reach to effectively scale their business and need to find partners
to help them get to market. Is the business able to clearly show how the target
volumes will be achieved through the chosen distribution channels and is it able
to show that those channels are available, willing and affordable?
In the case of a strategic sale, it is the buyer who will provide the channels
to market. The assessment of the venture potential will measure whether the
product or service being developed can be readily rolled into the potential
buyer’s distribution channel. If it can, then the venture can easily satisfy this
attribute.

Self-assessment
1.	 Distribution channels are not in place.
2.	 The firm is constrained by limited in-house distribution capabilities, lack
of access to distribution partners and/or powerful distribution channels
which control the interface to customers.
3.	 The firm has a well-defined distribution strategy but lacks an exclusive
presence, incentives for distribution channels to put above average
effort into the products or a lack of capacity to handle significant
volumes.
4.	 The distribution strategy is well defined, is effective in reaching the
target customers and can handle the volume of sales anticipated but
lacks robustness to be able to adapt to disruptive events or shifts in
channel commitment.
5.	 The distribution strategy is able to directly connect with the target
market in an arrangement which provides the firm with excellent and
timely exposure to the customer. The channels are highly motivated

and incentivised and have the depth and scope to cater for changed
circumstances and can readily support the volumes required to meet
financial objectives.

B9.	
	

Sales price and cost model provides robust achievable 	
margins

The business needs to be able to validate both price to customer and expected
costs of goods sold as well as fixed costs at each anticipated level of output. Prices
might be established relative to competitors, perhaps supported by marketing
survey data. Cost data may also have been established through competitor
information or perhaps through a cost build-up model using quotations for
external costs and cost allocation for internal costs. For established products,
prices and costs should have already been validated through existing sales.
The business model will need to show that reasonable levels of profit can be
achieved within a short period of time. Alternatively, a business which cannot
move into reasonable profit must have a reliable source of continued subsidies
to allow it to stay in business. The financial model should also be tested across
a range of possible business conditions to see if the business concept is robust
under worst, most likely and best case scenarios.
In the case of a strategic venture, the price and cost modelling must be
sufficient to encourage the strategic buyer to go ahead with the deal. If the
buyer can see a significant revenue opportunity with good margins and can
readily justify the acquisition, this will make it easier for the firm to be sold.

Self-assessment
1.	 Sales price and costs have not been established.
2.	 Sales prices are estimated and costs have been partly established but
neither validated.
3.	 Sufficient information on prices and costs has been ascertained to
establish that the products can be sold for a profit. However, a sensitivity
analysis has not been undertaken.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 189----->Part B: Indices

4.	 Prices and costs have been established and margins have been
determined to be attractive. Volume sales show that profit targets
can be reached, however, sensitivity analysis to cost variation or price
variation has not been undertaken.
5.	 Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken across a range of possible price
and cost scenarios and over worst, most likely and best cases and all
scenarios produce acceptable levels of profit achievement.

B10.	 Integrated volume operations (development,
	
manufacturing, logistics, support and infrastructure) are
	
achievable

	

Many products or service businesses look great when the volumes are small.
This is often because the founders take special care over the development and
delivery of the customer solution and the customer is given additional assistance
to ensure a satisfactory outcome. However, when the business grows, volume
production requires a level of planning and control which is not required or
needed when volumes or outputs are small. Logistics need to be much better
integrated, quality needs to be controlled throughout the entire value chain
and the business needs to have purchasing, human resources, marketing,
administrative and IT infrastructure to support complex operations.
Businesses which can handle 10 or 100 transactions need to be massively
redesigned when the volumes reach hundreds and thousands. How will the
business cope if it needs to manage multiple locations? Does the business
have the right people, structure and resources to build a larger, higher volume
business?
Scalability and/or replication are critical to a strategic sale. The venture needs
to be able to demonstrate that, in the hands of the buyer, significant volumes
will be able to be produced with stability in quality and reliability in timing.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 190----->Part B: Indices

Self-assessment
1.	 Assessment of volume operations has not been undertaken.
2.	 An operations plan has been produced but a detailed operations plan
has not been constructed to see if the plan is achievable.
3.	 The operations plan has been established at a low level of detail but
supporting plans for staff recruitment, training and infrastructure have
not been established.
4.	 A detailed operations plan has been compiled which fully supports the
growth plans of the venture. Supporting detail shows infrastructure, staff
and resource requirements, however, sensitivity analysis has not been
undertaken in areas where delays, variations in productivity or shortages
might occur.
5.	 A detailed, integrated, robust operational plan has been prepared which
includes all support operations. The plan has been reviewed under
various risk conditions and contingency plans have been developed to
mitigate or negate likely risk situations.

B11.	 Management team is experienced, complete, committed, 	
	
capable and entrepreneurial
Experienced investors know that business plans are very rarely implemented
as written. Every plan is based on a number of assumptions and those often
prove to be unfounded or are invalidated by economic, environmental and
industry changes. The business may not develop in the manner in which it was
originally planned. Experience tells the investor that the best solution to this
problem is to have a proven management team which has the experience to
cope with the changes that inevitably will occur. They look for an executive team
which has the qualifications, experience, mix of skills and industry networks to
implement the original plan but can also react to changing conditions and is still
likely to achieve reasonable results.
In the case of a venture being prepared for a strategic sale, the management
team, in conjunction with the Investor, must have the ability to undertake the
sale preparation process. This may include completing product development,

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

173

<-----Page 191----->Part B: Indices

establishing trial customers, building relationships with potential buyers and
engaging professional advisors.
In the case of a financial venture, it takes more than industry knowledge and
a capable management team to grow a business over time. Very few markets
are stable over many years, being impacted by new inventions, new entrants
and changing business models. Any business which grows over an extended
period of time must have an entrepreneurial capability. This is the ability to
see opportunities where others don’t, an ability to construct different business
models, a strong sense of timing about market changes, a willingness to have a
go in the face of incomplete or ambiguous market data and the acceptance that
some projects will fail.
Driving a business forward in the face of changing conditions also requires
leadership and good judgement. A strong vision, a sense of partnership
and involvement and a sense of personal achievement and growth are all
characteristics of a positive work culture. A business grows over time, not
by doing the same thing all the time, but by evolving to take advantages of
opportunities in the market place. A business which is open to new ideas,
willing to try new approaches to doing business and encourages people to try
small experiments will proactively generate avenues for growth.
Whether the intended exit is financial or strategic, Investors know that
they work in start-up and early stage ventures where the passion, drive and
energy of the entrepreneur and the management team are critical to success.
A good product or service, by itself, will not be sufficient to provide the traction
necessary to drive the business to success. The Investor needs to see indications
of what the team members have achieved individually and collectively; that
they have the ability to take initiative, be proactive and creative and have the
determination to succeed in this venture. The Investor also wants to see that
the executives are committed to the venture. This may occur through their own
personal financial investment, time invested in the venture or the fact that
they have put their personal reputations behind the business. Where there are
missing skills, the investor wants to see these are acknowledged and a proposal
put forward to recruit the necessary talent.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 192----->Part B: Indices

Self-assessment
1.	 Assessment of the current management team has not been undertaken
or no team has yet been assembled.
2.	 The current management team lacks some key skills, experience and
knowledge and plans are not yet in place to recruit to fill the gaps. The
current team has not acknowledged any deficiencies which need to be
filled. It is not obvious whether the team will stay with the venture if
the going gets tough. The team has not demonstrated entrepreneurial
activity.
3.	 The current management team is highly competent in most of the key
areas and has the skills and experience to take the venture forward. Key
gaps have been identified but a plan has not been developed to fill the
gaps. Some members of the team have made personal financial or time
commitments. Individuals within the team have shown entrepreneurial
activity but they have yet to demonstrate this as a team.
4.	 The management team has the experience, capability and knowledge
to take the venture forward and have plans in progress to recruit some
key individuals as part of the growth planned. Succession plans have not
been developed. The team has made significant financial, time and/
or reputation commitments to the venture. The team demonstrates an
entrepreneurial capability.
5.	 The management team is experienced, has the necessary range of skills,
experience and entrepreneurial capability to grow the venture and has
an organisational plan for both growth and succession. It is clear that the
team is very committed to the venture and will put in the time and effort
even if the venture proves to be more difficult than expected.

B12.	 Financial projections show robust acceptable ROI
The business concept should to be tested across multiple scenarios to ensure
that a reasonable financial return can be achieved even in the most unlikely
circumstances. When possible funding is added to the financial forecasts, the
forecasts should show that the Investor is able to achieve very good results.
Robust financial forecasts should declare and test the validity of the basic
assumptions. By changing basic assumptions to different possible situations,
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

175

<-----Page 193----->Part B: Indices

the model can be tested for robustness. Those assumptions which have the
greatest sensitivity can then be addressed with counter measures or additional
activities to minimise their impact.
Within the period of the investment where survival and operational
performance are critical, financial projections should include income statements,
balance sheets and cash flows. A breakeven analysis should be shown. These
various financial projections should be created under several possible scenarios
including worst case, best case and most likely case.
Estimates of exit values should be undertaken to show that the business is
able to achieve the rates of return desired by the Investor under all possible
exit scenarios. Remember that in the case of a strategic exit, revenue and profit
growth may not be relevant. What is important is to produce something which
the strategic buyer wants.

Self-assessment
1.	 Financial projections have not been prepared.
2.	 Financial projections have been prepared but are at a high level of
aggregation and are based on assumptions which have not been
validated. Detailed cash flows are not available.
3.	 Detailed financial projections have been prepared which show
acceptable levels of profits (if relevant) and ROI but some assumptions
are questionable and a scenario analysis has not been undertaken.
Detailed cash flows are available.
4.	 Detailed financial projections have been made which show acceptable
levels of profit and revenue growth (if relevant) and ROI. Underlying
assumptions have been validated and are acceptable. Scenario analysis
has not been undertaken.
5.	 Detailed financial projections with worst case, most likely case and
best case have been undertaken. Underlying assumptions have
been validated. Projections have been validated by an independent
professional advisor. Profit and ROI targets are robust and achievable
under all scenarios.

<-----Page 194----->Part B: Indices

B13.	 Risk analysis shows resilience to possible delays, shortages, 	
	
competitive retaliation, quality issues, failure to recruit the 	
	
right staff, etc.
Most simulations of financial projections concentrate on changes in revenue
levels but fail to take into account other risks which may be equally damaging
to the venture. The Investor needs to isolate those factors within the business
which can have the most disruptive impact on desired targets. It is only by
undertaking such an analysis that the Investor can uncover the likely risks which
can severely impact target achievement.
Once a risk assessment has been undertaken, those risks can be subjected
to their own mitigation planning exercise. A business plan which anticipates
potential problems can build contingency plans and take steps to avoid, mitigate
or reduce the impact of possible negative events. Risk analysis may result in
strategies being developed which change the order of introduction of products,
the timing of selected capital expenditures or planned targets.

Self-assessment
1.	 Risk assessment has not been undertaken.
2.	 Some major risks have been identified but a plan has not been
developed to deal with these when they occur.
3.	 Major risks have been identified and plans have been developed to deal
with them when they occur, but mitigation or avoidance plans have not
been implemented.
4.	 A risk analysis across the enterprise has been undertaken and plans have

5.	 The business strategy has been developed and implemented to take into
account those risks which would have a damaging effect on the business
achieving its objectives.

<-----Page 195----->Part B: Indices

B14.	 A robust and well-articulated exit strategy has been defined
Investors need to see a path to liquidity for their investment. Few Angel
or VC investors invest for dividends; most will be investing for capital gains.
However, whether they invest for dividends or capital gains, they still need to
have a mechanism for releasing their original investment. The normal form of
harvesting is either a sale to another business (trade sale) or a listing on a public
stock exchange (an initial public offering or IPO). Many investment proposals
use such exit phrases as ‘sell to a corporation in 3-5 years’ or ‘list on the stock
exchange in five years’ with no substance behind the statement. They have
neither identified who the potential buyer might be nor how they would be an
ideal candidate for an IPO.
The business proposal needs to demonstrate to the Investor a well-articulated
exit strategy which is meaningful. A trade sale strategy should have identified
potential buyers and have convincing arguments as to why the selected
corporations should buy the business. An IPO strategy should show how similar
businesses, with comparable products, services and growth patterns, were able
to list on the target exchange.

Self-assessment
1.	 An exit strategy has not been identified.
2.	 The exit strategy is very general and lacks detail or validation.
3.	 A possible exit strategy has been articulated which looks feasible but
lacks detail and resilience.
4.	 The exit strategy is very detailed, seems highly probable and includes
estimates of timing, resources required and costs for professional
services.
5.	 Professional advice has been received to validate the exit strategy and
adjustments have been made as a result. The exit strategy is highly
probable and resilient. Alternative exits are capable of being executed
depending on market circumstances.

Operations Development

T

he Operations Development Index (ODI) has been designed so that an
Investor can measure the quality of governance and operations
management within the investee firm. It can be used to evaluate the potential
investment as well as provide a tool for measuring the progress of development
of internal systems once the investment has been made.
A business can only be run effectively if it has the measurement and
reporting systems in place to set targets and review performance. The use of
KPIs, budgets and proper reporting systems are critical. Governance issues deal
with compliance and risk management and can be seen in good relationships
with customers, suppliers, bankers and so on. Operational excellence should
be an objective of the Angel as this can positively contribute to the value of the
business at the time of sale or as preparation for an IPO.
As part of the initial due diligence of the firm, the ODI can help the Investor
assess potential risks in the investment. When an Angel or VC investor enters into
an investment, they are exposed to the trading risks of the investee company.
They are also exposed to any current or contingent liabilities, current and
potential employee disputes, customer issues and supplier disputes. Once the
investment has been made, these risks will be managed through management
oversight and restrictions on how monies can be used and what loans can be
incurred.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

180

<-----Page 198----->Part B: Indices

The Investor will also have arrangements in place where they can more
actively intervene and sometimes take complete control if the business fails
to perform to agreed schedules and targets. However, this is little comfort to
an Investor who is reliant on the management team to operate the business.
Pre-existing conditions may be underwritten somewhat through warranties
and representations and failure of the business to perform may be somewhat
compensated for by a share dilution formula which adjusts the Investor’s
percentage of ownership, but this is little comfort to the Angel or VC firm which
has invested in a lemon.
The Investor needs to establish the level of risks associated with the
investment before they do the deal, not after. So an extensive investigation
will often be undertaken to uncover any skeletons which may lie in wait for
the unwary investor. Depending on the size and complexity of the firm, this
process can take many months and be very expensive. While this cost is usually
absorbed by the Investor, it is almost certainly factored into the valuation or use
of the investment funds. In some cases it may be underwritten or reimbursed
by the investee company.
The Investor will be trying to estimate the costs and time needed to be
devoted by the Investor, executives within the firm and external advisors to
bring the investee company up to the quality needed for an ongoing stress-free
operation. As items are uncovered, the Investor will need to estimate the time
and cost that will be incurred to resolve the issue. Of course, some may not be
that simple, cheap or quick to resolve. Other items may be serious and there
may not be an easy way to estimate the likely damage or cost to resolve. This
is particularly true with contingent liabilities, intellectual property ownership
doubts and unclear customer obligations which have not been fulfilled.
At some point, the Investor may simply decide that the level of risk is too high
to proceed, or they might decide that it will take too long and be too expensive
to establish the level of exposure in the outstanding issues.
Clearly a firm which appreciates the concerns of the Investor and has closely
managed its operations, managed its risk exposure and ensured that it has
fully complied with industry regulations, is a good candidate for Angel or VC
investment.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

181

<-----Page 199----->Part B: Indices

The ultimate due diligence test which could be used by an Investor is the
following:
Can I leave the investee firm alone to continue managing its operations without incurring any unreasonable level of risk?
Can I achieve my required ROI in the investment by devoting my effort
to where I can add the most value without being distracted with having
to clean up problems first?

Not all issues will be resolved by the firm in advance of an Investment, but
the more the firm can do prior to the investment, the easier it is for the Investor
to complete the due diligence investigation and move to consummate the
investment arrangements. A firm which is prepared for due diligence is a major
advantage for an Investor.
The initial investigation can provide the Investor with a checklist to be used
after the investment to drive improvement in the governance and operations
management of the firm. An Investor keen to see a trade sale or an IPO within
a few years of his investment should be sensitive to the positive impact a clean
bill of health on the ODI will have on the potential exit value of the firm.
In a trade sale situation where the potential buyer is a corporation, aspects
of the acquirer’s due diligence will deal with the actual integration of the two
companies. This will involve reviewing the costs, problems and delays of merging
the acquired business into their own organisation and will involve such things
as personnel systems, benefit systems, IT infrastructure and so on. The only
way the firm can prepare for this possibility is to ensure that they use industry
standard processes wherever possible.

Monthly financial and key performance indicator reporting 	
exists

The existence of a comprehensive reporting system is important for several
reasons. These are:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

It demonstrates that the firm is well run.
It shows that the management is effective.
It shows attention to detail.
It demonstrates that an underlying infrastructure is in place.
If comprehensive, it should show that problems are identified early and
addressed.

The financial reporting systems should produce balance sheet and income
statements, cash flow projections, aged debtors and aged creditor reports.
More sophisticated systems go beyond monthly financial reporting. Every
business has key performance indicators (KPIs) which demonstrate health
and competitive alertness. Reporting systems should be able to demonstrate
that the company is operating efficiently in all major areas of operations. For
example, in sales, reporting systems might examine tenders received, tenders
sent, contracts under review, contracts received and revenue to estimates.
In production, it might refer to actual production versus planned production,
overtime hours worked, rework hours, inventory levels and so on.
In a due diligence investigation, the Investor will be attempting to estimate
the level of intervention that is to be put in after the investment. To the extent
that good management systems are in place, this should considerably reduce
the Investor’s concerns.

A formal business plan has been prepared and is updated 	
periodically

Most business people would agree that business plans are outdated as soon
as they are printed. However, the discipline of preparing the business plan
captures the holistic nature of the enterprise. This is one of the few times where
management have the opportunity of rethinking the vision, goals and strategy
of the firm. It is by pulling it all together that they will gain insights into areas of
weakness and opportunities where the business can be improved.
For the Investor, a good business plan provides insights into the business. For
example:
What is the vision and how is this translated into strategy?
What are the competitive assets and competencies of the firm and
how are these being leveraged into competitive advantage?
Which markets do they compete in and how are they placed?
What are the assumptions behind the numbers and have these been
validated?
What risks are present in the business and how are these being addressed?
What is the worst case scenario?
Do they understand their underlying cost and revenue structures and
has this been translated into a breakeven analysis and a breakdown
of recurring and new business?

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

184

<-----Page 202----->Part B: Indices

Can they demonstrate clearly where the business comes from and
why?
Do they have clearly articulated marketing and sales plans with identified targets?
Has business growth been translated into a headcount plan and a
funding plan?

The business plan demonstrates that the management team understand
what it takes to be successful. It should be more than a spreadsheet, it is an
explanation of why the business is successful and should be backed up with
validation of assumptions.
The question that should be asked by the Investor is:
Can this business be run successfully without me having to intervene
to make it work?

It may not be the Investor’s intention to leave the business the way it is,
after all, part of the reason for selecting a specific investment is to leverage the
Investor’s knowledge and contacts. However, he should be trying to estimate
the level of effort he is going to have to put in to improve their operations
management. If the business can be left alone to run itself for some period
of time, the Investor can concentrate on future plans for the business without
having to shore up normal operations.
The business plan may also indicate where additional potential lies for the
firm. This helps the Investor to evaluate the opportunity and perhaps see how
the opportunity may be developed with additional resources or assistance from
the Investor.

Self-assessment
1.	 A business plan does not exist.
2.	 There is a business plan but it is out-of-date and/or incomplete.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

3.	 There is a comprehensive business plan but it simply projects past trends
and is not a strategy document.
4.	 A comprehensive business plan exists and is up-to-date but does not
have the depth or validation needed to provide a good explanation of
strategy or how the business might perform in the longer term.
5.	 A very comprehensive business plan exists which is of professional
quality and fully explains the business strategy, the capabilities and the
likely outcome of the business in the longer term.

C3. 	 A formal budget is prepared and actual performance is 	 	
	
monitored against budget
The preparation of formal budgets (profit & loss, cash flow and balance
sheet) serves a number of purposes including:
•	 quantification of formal business plan.
•	 identification of projected profit and loss and cash flow.
•	 a basis for financial discussions with external parties such as debt and
equity provider.
•	 a basis for monitoring the actual performance of the business against
the business forecast.
•	 a basis for performance evaluation of key staff and departments.
The budget should provide the basis for monitoring actual performance
against budget and should link the formal business plan to the actual
performance of the business.
Budgets should be prepared and monitored on a monthly basis. Budgets
should be prepared on a geographic and department basis in order to properly
assign responsibility and facilitate the management of variances.
Preparation of a formal budget and analysis of actual performance against
budgeted performance should provide the following benefits to the business:
•	 assist in identifying under or over performance against budget
•	 enable timely actions to be taken where actual performance is
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

186

<-----Page 204----->Part B: Indices

significantly different to forecast performance
•	 ensure key financial information is monitored at various levels
throughout the business
•	 promote accountability of key individuals and departments.
Evidence of regular budget to actual analysis by the business will provide the
Investor with greater comfort that the business has been actively monitored
and proactively managed and that business risks are being assessed on a regular
basis.

Self-assessment
1.	 A budget is not prepared and analysis of actual results to budgeted
results is not performed
2.	 There is a budget, but it is out-of-date, or not regularly monitored.
3.	 There is a summary budget, but it is not detailed enough, does not
link to the business plan, does not ensure accountability of key staff/
departments and is not regularly monitored.
4.	 A budget exists which partly assists in monitoring actual to forecasts of
the business (including accountability of key staff/departments).
5.	 A comprehensive budget exists which supports the formal business
plan and is a major tool in the ongoing monitoring and assessment of
business performance including monitoring accountability of key staff/
departments.

C4. 	 Full compliance with regulatory issues (e.g. environmental, 	
	
health and safety)
The Investor will be investigating the health of the business in terms of the
quality of its underlying systems. These will include all the compliance areas.
These will vary from industry to industry but may include:
•	 tax reporting (income, payroll and sales tax (BAS, VAT, GST, etc))
•	 company financial reporting
•	 corporate governance (shareholder tracking, board minutes, etc)

employment law reporting
mandatory insurance
health and safety practices and accident reporting
environmental compliance
industry-specific regulations.

These areas are critical in a review as they can point to weak management,
lack of concern for potential exposure and the possibility of litigation and
penalties. The exposure may not only be for ongoing practice, but may be
retrospective in more severe cases such as environmental issues.

Self-assessment
1.	 Compliance is not treated seriously and is inconsistently implemented.
2.	 The firm is concerned about compliance and has some systems in place
but a comprehensive program does not exist to ensure compliance or to
ensure completeness of coverage.
3.	 Compliance is treated seriously but is left up to individual managers and
there is no system in place to ensure that all areas are covered and full
compliance is occurring.
4.	 A full list of compliance issues exists, responsibilities are defined and
some areas have reporting systems to ensure that compliance is being
adhered to. Professional advice is being sought to undertake an audit in
order to put a comprehensive reporting system in place.
5.	 Compliance reporting is comprehensive and effective and is audited by
professional advisors on a periodic basis to ensure completeness and
effectiveness. No outstanding or anticipated litigation exists.

C5. 	 Customer relationships are managed to minimize litigation
Litigation and potential litigation occur when aspects of the business are
not conducted fairly, transparently and according to accepted standards of
good conduct. It is not sufficient to hope that external and internal relations
are managed well. The Investor will examine whether the firm has policies,
procedures and systems in place to ensure that they are doing so.
In the case of customers, the firm needs to conduct its business so that
customers clearly understand the obligations of the firm, customer expectations
are clearly understood and performance to documented and implied contractual
conditions is monitored. Products and services need to be fit for purpose, of
merchantable quality and sold with clear explanations of intended use. The
firm should be prepared to assist customers to ensure that effective intended
use can be readily achieved. Failure to understand the customer’s needs and
intended use exposes the firm to potential complaints, wasted resources and
possible litigation.
The firm should have in place fair and reasonable contracts or agreements
with customers, effective complaints handling processes and monitoring
systems to ensure obligations are met.
Investors will be concerned about potential risks. Poor customer handling
and poor internal processes suggest exposure to potential litigation, workplace
unrest and/or loss of customer respect and retention. These seriously damage
the company as a place to work or do business, potentially threatening the
viability of the business. The Investor does not want to inherit problems which
may distract from achieving the objectives in the investment. A firm with
underlying potential litigation can severely disrupt the firm and will probably
exclude it from a successful trade sale or IPO. The Investor may be better off to
walk away from the investment than to take the risk.

Self-assessment
1.	 Special effort is not taken by the company to avoid litigation in external
customer relationships. Accounts are not reviewed for current or
potential problems on any systematic basis. An escalation process does
not exist to deal with unresolved issues.
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

<-----Page 207----->Part B: Indices

2.	 The firm acknowledges that it can do better. Staff have been advised of
the implications of unresolved customer issues. A complaints system is
in place.
3.	 A formal customer complaints system is in place with proper escalation
procedures. Formal agreements exist with customers which deal with
outstanding problems.
4.	 Professional advice has been taken on establishing formal systems
of dispute resolution, complaints handling and problem escalation.
Contracts have been reviewed by professional advisors. Relationship
management training has been given to staff where appropriate.
5.	 Formal review systems are in place for all agreements with customers.
The firm is proactive in dealing with customers to ensure that
expectations are set correctly and are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Formal complaint handling systems and dispute resolutions systems are
in place with staff trained and advisors available. Professional advisors
review any serious disputes and provide advice on problem resolution.

C6. 	 Supplier relationships are managed to minimize litigation
Good supplier management is essential for the efficient operations of a
business. Litigation and potential litigation occur when aspects of the business
are not conducted fairly, transparently and according to accepted standards of
good conduct. It is not sufficient to hope that external and internal relations are
managed well. The Investor will verify that the firm has policies, procedures and
systems in place to ensure that they are doing so.
Some suppliers are more critical than others where they supply essential
parts, where there are no effective substitutes or the switching costs of moving
to another supplier is high. Managing supplier relationships is essential for the
health and ongoing effective operation of the business. The firm should have fair
and equitable agreements with suppliers and these should be industry standard
wherever possible. Supplier relationships should be managed by people in the
company who understand that relationships are more than simply placing
purchase orders and negotiating the best price.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

190

<-----Page 208----->Part B: Indices

The firm needs to be able to demonstrate to the investor that goodwill
exists in those relationships, the business values their suppliers and issues and
complaints are dealt with in a timely and reasonable manner.
Investors are always concerned about potential risks and disruption. Poor
supplier relationship management and poor internal processes to resolve
problems suggest exposure to potential litigation, workplace unrest and/or
potential loss of key suppliers. Failure to monitor payables and resolve disputes
may also affect credit rating. No Investor likes to inherit problems which may
distract them from achieving the potential in the investment. An investment in
a firm with underlying potential litigation can severely disrupt both the firm as
well as the Investor who may have to become involved to resolve the situation.

Self-assessment
1.	 Special effort is not taken by the company to avoid litigation in supplier
relationships. Accounts are not reviewed for current or potential
problems on any systematic basis. An escalation process does not exist
to deal with unresolved issues.
2.	 The firm acknowledges that it can do better. Staff have been advised of
the implications of unresolved issues. A complaints system is in place.
3.	 A formal complaints system is in place with proper escalation

outstanding unmet obligations and disputes.
4.	 Professional advice has been taken to establish formal systems of

The firm is proactive in dealing with suppliers to ensure that
expectations are set correctly and monitored on an on-going basis.

in place with trained staff and advisors available. Professional advisors
review any serious dispute and provide advice on problem resolution.

<-----Page 209----->Part B: Indices

C7. 	 Employee relationships are managed to minimize litigation
The Investor will want to know that good management practice systems and
fair and reasonable workplace conditions are in place for effective employee
management. Employees should understand clearly what is expected of them,
be provided with opportunities to provide feedback on their experience and
be given performance appraisals to ensure they understand how they are
meeting expectations. Processes should be in place to deal with harassment
and discrimination in the workplace. Only through effective and systematic
performance monitoring and corrective action can the firm adequately deal
with dismissals without creating situations which might lead to unfair dismissal
claims and possible litigation.
Every business is dependent on its employee’s goodwill and motivation. If the
workplace conditions are not fair and reasonable at a minimum and if justice
is not done and seen to be done, this creates a poor working environment. It
is inevitable that the firm will go through a series of changes of management,
systems and direction after the investment. This is going to take a lot of goodwill
and support from existing staff. An Investor doesn’t wish to start off this process
at a disadvantage. In addition, poor performance management processes expose
the company to claims for unfair dismissal or discrimination. No Investor wants
to be exposed to potential unquantifiable future litigation costs and damages.
Contingency liabilities are normally the death of a future trade sale or IPO.

Self-assessment
1.	 Special effort not is taken by the company to avoid litigation in
employee relationships. Workplace issues are left to local supervisors
and local management to resolve. There are no full-time or dedicated
employees responsible for compliance or to assist in resolving workplace
relationship issues. A systematic process does not exist to set and
evaluate performance.
2.	 The firm acknowledges the need to introduce more formal processes.
Job descriptions are in place for most of the employees and an
evaluation process is used for performance review and setting pay
increases.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

192

<-----Page 210----->Part B: Indices

3.	 Performance targets and formal reviews of achievement are in place. A
member of management is responsible for compliance. Management
has been briefed on workplace issues of harassment, discrimination and
performance review documentation and dismissal processes. However,
these are not systematically followed.
4.	 Formal processes exist for defining job descriptions, setting and
assessing performance targets and dealing with employee workplace
issues. Management has been trained on all aspects of compliance
and workplace performance and dismissal processes. No external
professional advice has been sought to audit the quality of the
processes.
5.	 Systems and procedures are fully documented and audited to
ensure full compliance with best practice in performance reviews,
dismissal handling and workplace incident handling. The company has
professional internal staff and/or external advisors to assist with any
serious incident.

C8. Credit worthiness with suppliers is excellent
The quality of external relationships is often an indicator of the quality and
integrity of the management team and the culture of the firm. As the business
grows some level of disruption to the business is likely to occur. During this
period the goodwill of suppliers is going to be necessary so that additional
problems don’t create crisis events. By reviewing credit payment performance
information and interviewing suppliers, the Investor can obtain a measure of
the way in which management has dealt with issues in the past.
Few companies are able to avoid fluctuations in their cash flow. However,
problems can often be mitigated by good relationships with suppliers. Suppliers
who are normally paid promptly and dealt with fairly are often willing to extend
additional credit for short periods during difficult times. This is especially true
if the firm has dealt with them honestly and shown past behaviour of bringing
situations back to prompt payment.
Those firms which keep their suppliers informed, proactively tell them about
impending issues and show good management skills in correcting problems
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

193

<-----Page 211----->Part B: Indices

promptly, are much more likely to be given extended credit to cover short-term
situations. A review of supplier credit performance will help the Investor gain
an independent measure of the quality of management and their culture and
values.

Self-assessment
1.	 The firm deals with suppliers at arms length and makes no special effort
to value their relationship. The firm makes no special effort to keep in
regular touch with them or to keep them abreast of business issues.
2.	 The firm is sensitive to dealing with suppliers and pays when possible on
agreed terms. However, suppliers are only contacted when payments are
already late.
3.	 The firm has processes for reviewing credit with suppliers and keeps
them informed of any issues where extended payment may be taken.
The firm has a member of management who meets with them on an
informal basis when the occasion arises.
4.	 The firm actively informs suppliers of account status and will pay early if
cash permits. Suppliers are kept informed of the level of likely business
which will be placed with them. When payments have been delayed,
senior management will personally contact the supplier to review the
situation.
5.	 Professional advice has been sought on credit worthiness best practice
and systems implemented. Senior management keeps suppliers
informed of any payment issues well in advance and before payments
are overdue.

C9. 	 Banking relationships are excellent
The quality of a firm’s relationship with their bank is a very good indicator of
the way in which they conduct most of their business. External relationships
are often an indicator of the quality and integrity of the management team and
the culture of the firm. With any significant business development, which can
be expected after an injection of capital, some level of disruption to business
is likely to occur. During this period the goodwill of suppliers, customers and
bankers is going to be necessary so that additional problems don’t create crisis
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

194

<-----Page 212----->Part B: Indices

events. By reviewing formal and informal contact with the bank, the Investor
can determine the manner in which management has dealt with issues in the
past.
Few companies are able to avoid some fluctuation in their cash flow.
However, problems can often be mitigated by good relationships with suppliers
and by working closely and honestly with the bank. Those firms which keep
their bank informed, proactively tell them about impending issues and show
good management skills in correcting problems promptly, are much more likely
to be extended a line of credit or a loan from the bank to deal with short-term
fluctuations. By examining how the firm has dealt with issues in the past, the
Investor can gain an independent measure of the quality of management and
of their culture and values.

Self-assessment
1.	 The firm deals with its bank at arms length and makes no special effort
to value the relationship. The bank is simply treated as a facility and the
firm makes no special effort to keep in regular touch with the bank or to
keep it abreast of business issues.
2.	 The firm is sensitive to dealing with its bank, however, the bank is only
approached when a need arises.
3.	 The firm has processes for reviewing its pattern of business with its bank
and keeps it informed of any issues where cash flow might be seriously
affected. The firm has a relationship with a named bank officer and
meets with them on an informal basis when the occasion arises.
4.	 Informal arrangements are in place with the bank to review business
performance and banking requirements. The firm also has periodic
formal meetings with the bank to review their banking arrangements
and banking facilities.
5.	 The firm has established formal meetings with the bank on a regular
basis where current and future banking requirements are reviewed.
Senior management of the firm are known to the bank and informal
social relationships are encouraged by the firm.

C10.	 Customer interaction, contracts and agreements are
	
industry standard

	

A firm incurs problems and costs when obligations under contracts are
unclear, incomplete, harsh or generous. Risks escalate when procedures
for handling disputes, complaints, claims or clarification are not clear or not
followed. When customers can make claims on the company which cannot
be substantiated internally, where the obligations are not clearly set out and
where the terms of payments are unclear, the firm can be exposed to potential
litigation, loss of resources or significant under payments.
A situation in which contracts can be customized to suit the customer
becomes an administrative burden. Few firms have the processes in place to
track individual contracts where obligations and terms vary from one contract
to another and so the likelihood of making a mistake in this situation is very
high. Problems can be greatly exacerbated if contracts are voluminous or held
at a place away from where activity is being undertaken.
Investors want to see a smooth administrative operation. If the contracts are
not standard or vary from contract to contract, costs increase. Risks may occur
if personal undocumented knowledge is required to manage the relationship.
If the person with that intimate knowledge leaves, so does the ability to handle
issues which arise.
Policies for dealing with customers should be clearly set out and staff trained
in the various activities which require interaction with customers. Errors are
easily made where inconsistencies in processes are allowed to occur.

Self-assessment
1.	 Interaction, contracts and agreements with customers are informal and
vary in approach, terms and conditions.
2.	 Staff are advised on how to deal with customers but this is not formally
supervised or reviewed. Contracts and agreements with customers are
mostly written but variations exist and these are not well documented.
Formal sign off of customer contracts is not in place where complex
projects are undertaken.

3.	 Staff are trained to deal with customer issues. The firm has policies
in place for most customer interaction but these are out-of-date and
compliance is not reviewed formally. Formal contracts and agreements
are used with customers but variations are common. Variations are well
documented and agreed by both parties. Formal progress monitoring is
in place and sign off occurs at key stages in projects.
4.	 Formal policies are in place for interaction with customers and staff
are trained on these. Compliance is monitored and issues dealt
with promptly. Standard contracts and agreements are in place with
customers and progress on long-term projects is monitored. However,
steps have not been taken to ensure that contracts are industry standard
and best practice for monitoring are in place.
5.	 Professional advice has been taken and recommendations implemented
to ensure that contracts with customers are industry standard and that
progress monitoring and sign off procedures are in place and being
followed. Periodic audit of customer contracts and progress tracking are
in place. Formal policies for dealing with customers are in force and are
regularly monitored.

C11.	 Supplier contracts and agreements are industry standard
A firm incurs problems and costs when obligations under supplier contracts
are unclear, incomplete, harsh, or generous. Risks escalate when procedures
for handling disputes, complaints, claims or clarification are not clear or not
followed. When suppliers can make claims on the company which cannot be
substantiated internally, where obligations or the terms of payments are unclear,
the firm can be exposed to potential litigation, loss of resources or significant
over payment.
A situation in which contracts can be customized for each supplier becomes
an administrative burden. Few firms have the processes in place to track
individual contracts where obligations and terms vary from one contract to
another and the likelihood of making a mistake is very high. This situation is
exacerbated if contracts are voluminous or held at a place away from where
activity is being undertaken.

Investors are looking for efficient administrative operations. If the contracts
are not standard or vary from contract to contract, smooth operations are
not possible. Further risks may occur if personal undocumented knowledge is

C12.	 Contracts can be assigned to an acquirer
Companies which are expected to be sold must have the ability to assign
the rights under their contracts, licenses and agreements to the new buyer.
Agreements which do not allow this inhibit the ability of the new owner to
operate the business. Some agreements have clauses which allow assignment
only with the permission of the other party. This agreement should be obtained
prior to going into an acquisition discussion.
Many agreements do not allow for assignment to a competitor. This is not an
unreasonable condition if such a change could potentially harm their business.
In this case, the firm needs to have a contingency plan to be able to replace that
part of their business if it is critical to their operation. Where such an agreement
might stop the acquisition from happening, the best action is to terminate the
agreement and replace it prior to preparing to sell.

Self-assessment
1.	 The firm is not aware of this requirement and does not know what the
status of its various agreements are in this regard.
2.	 The firm acknowledges that this would be desirable but has not
reviewed the contracts for compliance.
3.	 Contracts have been reviewed and those which do not allow assignment
have been identified and responsibility given to an executive to
renegotiate this condition.
4.	 Contracts have been renegotiated (where possible). The firm does not
see any situation which would inhibit an acquisition. Contracts have not
been reviewed by professional advisors.
5.	 Contracts, licences and agreements have been reviewed by professional
advisors and no critical impediment remains to assignment of rights.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

199

<-----Page 217----->Part B: Indices

C13.	 Intellectual Property is able to be traded and is
	
appropriately protected

	

Intellectual property (IP) covers those knowledge assets of the company
which can be sold independent of the people who created that knowledge.
Knowledge in the heads of employees which is not documented cannot be
sold without the employees who have it. Documented knowledge, where
the ownership may be in dispute or where ownership is unclear, cannot be
effectively traded. Other IP rights which are purchased and are critical to the
operation of products or services, need to be able to be sold or assigned to a
new owner. Any contractual impediments to the use of internal or purchased IP
will seriously inhibit a firm’s ability to exploit the IP and may seriously damage
the potential of a sale of the business.
Many acquisitions are targeted at acquiring competitive advantage through
the acquisition of firms which hold patent rights. Patents which have considerable
revenue generating potential can attract litigation over ownership rights if this
has not been carefully managed from the outset of a research and development
project as any employee who has worked on the project could potentially claim
an ownership share. The only way for the firm to protect itself from such a claim
is to have employees assign all rights of any inventions, or those relevant to
their workplace, to the firm. Alternatively, rights could be assigned to the firm
with acknowledgement of an ownership share, this leaves the firm in a position
to have full rights to exploit the patent subject to a royalty based on an agreed
formula.
Another aspect of IP is that the firm must ensure the IP was adequately
managed throughout the development process. IP management must ensure
that IP does not infringe any other IP rights, that the IP is appropriately registered
and that rights are kept current. Since many IP rights require registration in
other countries, the firm needs to have documentation of the extent of the
registered rights and be able to show how these may be further protected in
any future acquisition negotiation.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

200

<-----Page 218----->Part B: Indices

Self-assessment
1.	 An IP management program does not exist.
2.	 The firm acknowledges the importance of IP management but has no
formal system to register or protect it.
3.	 IP management is considered important and the firm has registered
various IP but the ownership trail is incomplete and may be subject to
dispute by current and/or past employees.
4.	 Formal IP management processes are in place. Rights are registered in
countries deemed appropriate for the business. Employees are required
to sign over IP rights as a condition of their employment. IP acquired
externally and used in the business will be able to be traded by a new
owner.
5.	 The firm has undertaken an audit by a professional advisor and
implemented systems and procedures recommendations to ensure full
protection of its IP rights.

C14. 	 Post acquisition changes in employment are planned for
Detailed consideration of the organisation structure following a possible
future acquisition will indicate which roles will need to change and which roles
will be redundant. Rather than leave this issue for the new owner to resolve,
the firm can negotiate potential changes with those employees who are likely
to be affected and put in place agreements which will smooth the transition.
A future buyer will almost certainly be confronted with the need to
make organisational changes. These will involve changes of management,
redundancies, roles and reporting lines. Many of these changes could
potentially effect compensation packages. Effecting these changes and avoiding
unrest, disruption and de-motivation will be challenging. The potential for
litigation is present where current conditions of employment are at odds with
the new situation. An employee who feels he or she has been misled or feels
constructively dismissed through the changes, may feel compelled to seek legal
advice.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

201

<-----Page 219----->Part B: Indices

Managing expectations, providing acceptable options for employees who
are effected and preparing staff for the likely change, is all part of preparing to
sell the business. Some employees may decide to take early retirement or seek
alternative employment. Others may see the change as beneficial and want to
stay on. Key employees need to be retained and need to be handled carefully
so that there are incentives for them to stay during a transition period. Others
may need to be given incentives to leave where their roles are being changed
significantly or where they are being made redundant.
In anticipation that the business will be sold in the future as part of the
strategy agreed with the Investor, the firm should put in place employment
conditions which will ease the path to sale and transition across to a new
owner. For example, current terms and conditions of employment may include
the option for the business to make the employee redundant on transfer of
ownership and state the level of compensation to be paid. Alternatively, a
retention bonus may be specified for key employees to encourage them to stay.
Benefits may be able to be changed on sale of the business.

Self-assessment
1.	 Attempts have not been made by the firm to implement changes in
employment conditions to facilitate the future sale of the business.
Discussions have not been had with employees about post acquisition
roles.
2.	 The firm has reviewed its organisation structure and determined those
positions which are likely to be changed, made redundant or are critical
to the transition. Some informal discussion at management level
has occurred. Formal changes have not been made to employment
conditions.
3.	 The firm has constructed a post acquisition scenario and identified
employees who will be affected. Retirement, redundancy and key
employee incentives have been constructed. Employment conditions
have been changed to reflect the possible future sale of the business.
4.	 Key employee conditions have been discussed with key staff and as a
result their conditions of employment have been changed to incorporate
a retention bonus. A termination package has been incorporated into all
Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

202

<-----Page 220----->Part B: Indices

employment agreements to cater for redundancies. Bonus, commission,
profit schemes and share purchase arrangements have all been modified
to lapse on change of ownership. Professional advice has been sought
on the arrangements.
5.	 Changes and incentives necessary to ensure a smooth changeover to
a new owner have been reviewed by a professional advisor and fully
implemented.

C15. 	 Employment conditions, salaries and benefits are industry 	
	
standard
Following any future acquisition of the investee firm, employees of the
acquired firm will normally be integrated into the employment, health benefits
and bonus systems of the parent company. When this happens, any deviations
between the two schemes will have to be resolved. This is normally a time of
considerable change in the acquired firm with employees fearful of their jobs.
The less change that is imposed, the smoother this transition will be.
Where remuneration systems are industry standard, few problems tend to
arise. Staff are neither paid too much nor too little. If the health insurance is
standard and bonuses are in line with industry standards, these can normally
be continued or transferred. However, if (say) vacation entitlements are overly
generous, this can create problems where they need to be curtailed or need to
be continued alongside fellow employees who receive less.

Self-assessment
1.	 Little or no effort has been made to ensure employment conditions are
industry standard.
2.	 The firm has no formal process for setting pay scales or for performance
evaluation. They believe they are paying reasonable levels to attract and
retain employees.
3.	 The firm recruits employees at competitive rates but internal procedures
for advancement are not checked with industry norms.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

203

<-----Page 221----->Part B: Indices

4.	 The firm is familiar with remuneration in their industry and tries to
follow industry norms. An external review has not been made of their
practices.
5.	 The company uses an outside firm of specialists to assist in setting pay
scales and conditions of employment.

C16.	 Option schemes and benefits are compliant with stock
	
exchange regulations

	

Many smaller firms offer incentives to attract and retain key employees.
These include options, share purchase schemes, bonuses, share allocation and
so on. Often these deals are done privately between the owner and the new
employee. Sometimes advice is not sought on the long-term implications of
these schemes on a possible sale of the firm.
Share purchase schemes and option schemes have attracted attention by
both the financial reporting agencies and tax authorities around the world and
so there normally exists a vast body of regulations governing these schemes.
While a scheme might be legal and even appropriate for a small unlisted firm,
the same scheme might be non-compliant for a listed company. Since most
acquisitions are by listed companies, this can be a real problem for a future
sale of the firm to a listed corporation. An employee will not be happy losing
benefits and may well resist any such change if they have a contract in place
which protects their benefits.

Self-assessment
1.	 Little or no effort has been made to ensure option schemes and benefits
are compliant with stock exchange requirements.
2.	 The firm is familiar with the need to have compliant schemes but has
made no effort to have their own schemes checked for compliance.
3.	 The firm has sought professional advice to check the degree of
compliance of their schemes and to advise of changes which may be
necessary.
4.	 The firm is implementing changes to their schemes to bring them into
compliance.

5.	 Option and benefit schemes are compliant with stock exchange
requirements.

C17. 	 Due diligence files are complete and up-to-date
The purpose of due diligence is to check the health of the firm and to identify
any potential risks. It also checks that the information provided by the firm is
complete and accurate. Checks will include:
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

supplier and customer contracts
licences, patents, trademarks and IP management systems
leases, distribution agreements and hire-purchase agreements
employment contracts, health insurance and bonus systems
complaints processing, dismissal processes and warranty systems
quality control systems
financial reporting systems, aged debtors and aged creditors
reference checks with customers, suppliers and professional advisors
background checks on key executives
R&D, manufacturing and distribution processes
banking relationships and loan conditions
shareholder agreements, option schemes and share-purchase schemes.

The information required for a due diligence investigation is extensive and
very time consuming to collect and collate. Often there are documents missing
or incomplete. However, it is through this process that the Investor will uncover
internal and external risks which can cause problems with their investment and
may create problems in a later trade sale or IPO. A check of the documents
themselves can often be a long and exhaustive process. Every contract, lease
and agreement is sometimes checked to ensure that it does not overly expose
the investor or acquirer. To the extent that professional advice from industryknowledgeable legal and accounting firms has been used, this process can be
dramatically shortened. Sometimes only a sample needs to be reviewed.

irms seeking
t o r a i s e A n g e l o r Ve n t u r e C a p i t a l f i n a n c e
often know very little about the nature of Angel or VC
investment or the role and objectives of Angels and VC funds. Well established Angels and
VC firms with good track records are actively sought by both investors and entrepreneurs
and don’t have the time nor the resources to deal with the many approaches they have,
thus need to screen entrepreneurs seeking finance and concentrate their efforts where
they can achieve the highest productivity for their time.
Investors often complain about the naivety of the entrepreneurs. Few they encounter really
understand the purpose of Angel or Venture Capital finance or the criteria which they use
to select investments. They often say that their first task is to educate the entrepreneur.
This environment provides, in fact, a very fertile ground for the entrepreneur who
approaches the Investor with a well thought out proposal put in terms which they can
appreciate and with the support of a professional advisor they respect. Where they can be
assured they are being offered a chance to look over a proposal which has been reviewed
by a knowledgeable professional advisor, it makes their life easier and more productive.
In fact, some Investors won’t entertain looking at a proposal unless it has come from a
respected angel or professional advisor.
Even when the Investor is approached using the proper channels, the well prepared
entrepreneur must still be able to deliver a written proposal in a form which allows the
Investor to easily evaluate the investment in their terms – that is from the viewpoint of the

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

209

<-----Page 227----->Part B: Indices

investor not the business builder. The proposal should be backed up with a management
team who can clearly articulate the benefits of the business in terms of growth, ROI,  risk
exposure and likely exit and do so in non-technical language.
The entrepreneur should also be well versed in valuation techniques and normal terms
of Angel or VC investment. Discussions with an Investor will be much more meaningful
and productive if the entrepreneur understands how Angels and VC funds work, how they
manage their investments and how they achieve a harvest on their investments. Using a
professional advisor to educate, advise and assist in this process will ensure that neither
the entrepreneur nor the Investor waste their time.

D1.	 Investment advisors have been appointed
Few entrepreneurs ever have the experience of raising Angel or VC finance and even less
do it more than once. Thus few ever build up the required knowledge and experience to
efficiently work through the requirements. A professional advisor who deals with Angels
and VC funds on a frequent basis not only understands the requirements of the investor
but should have contacts within the investor community to best advise the entrepreneur
on which investors to approach.
The process of securing an investment requires the firm to prepare a wide array of
information, not just on the business concept itself, but extensive information on
the business for the due diligence process. The professional advisor can assist in the
preparation of the investment proposal as well as ensure that the firm is well prepared for
the due diligence activity. A creditable and experienced professional advisor will ensure
that the firm does not waste their executive time pursuing the wrong strategy. Angel and
VC investors have a specific set of business and legal requirements and the firm needs
to ensure that it can meet these conditions.
Part of the process of selecting a professional advisor should be some form of reference
checking as well as a degree of comfort and fit between the parties. A firm which knows
what it is doing should have little hesitation in providing references to clients which they
have assisted through the same process.

1.	 Advisors have not been approached or appointed.
2.	 Advice has been sought as to which advisors the firm should work with but
approaches have not been made.
3.	 The firm has made an approach to one or more advisors and discussions have
commenced but appointments have not been made.
4.	 The firm has negotiated terms with one or more advisors, undertaken reference
checking and interviewed one or more clients which the advisor(s) have assisted
but agreements have not been entered into.
5.	 An investment advisor has been appointed.

D2.	 An equity investment/debt strategy has been formulated
Angel and VC investment should be part of an overall funding strategy being constructed
for the business. While equity investment has the advantage that it has no repayment risk
associated with it if the business is temporarily unable to fund dividends, it does dilute the
founders equity. On the other hand debt, while not diluting equity holdings, does carry
a risk in the event of non payment of interest and principal. Failure to pay interest when
due or to make the periodic loan repayments can result in the business being put into
receivership and perhaps assets seized and sold. Thus finding the right balance between
equity dilution and repayment risk is essential for longer term funding of the business.
The firm should be prepared to discuss the financing strategy with the Investor and be
able to show how the business will finance any external debt which it intends to take
on. Generally the Investor will require the firm agree to seek the Investor’s permission
before it commits to any additional external debt.
Self assessment
1.	 A strategy for the use of debt and/or equity investment has not been formulated.
2.	 The firm has identified a need for funding but has not translated this into how much
or what mixture of debt and equity would be appropriate.
3.	 A plan incorporating a desired level of debt and equity has been constructed but
this has not been tested against the business plan to see if it will adequately cater
for different levels of success in business outcomes.
4.	 The funding model has been incorporated into a business plan and has been tested
against various scenarios.

<-----Page 229----->Part B: Indices

5.	 The funding model has been reviewed by a professional advisor and adjusted
accordingly.

D3.	 A realistic valuation formula has been constructed
The valuation of the business prior to an Angel or VC investment (pre-money) is usually
a contentious issue for both founders and investors. The founders clearly want as little
dilution as possible while the investors want the downside protection of a low valuation
going into the deal. Unless both parties can move past the valuation issue, no deal will
be consummated.
Most Investors will argue for a lower valuation based on their experience of past
investments which went sour. Even when everything looks positive at the outset, their
experience shows that forecasts are rarely achieved and activities take much longer than
anticipated, thus their initial valuation needs to reflect this. On the other hand, the founders
will want to hold onto as much equity as possible, especially if the venture proves highly
successful. If the initial opening positions are too far apart, it is possible the discussions
will simply be terminated and no investment will be forthcoming. It is in the interest of
the firm to start with a realistic valuation and negotiate from that position. In the end, a
formula based valuation may be the best way to resolve any major differences in valuation.
Self assessment
1.	 A valuation figure or valuation calculations has not been undertaken.
2.	 Crude valuations have been discussed based on market transactions and industry
norms but specific calculations have not been made.
3.	 Conventional valuations using a fair market value formula have been undertaken.

D4.	 An executive summary and an investment business plan 	
	
have been prepared
Most businesses seeking external investment will have prepared a business plan but few
will have constructed the plan with the requirements of the Angel or VC investor in mind.
Most business plans are designed to develop the business rather than to show the Investor
how they can protect their investment and achieve their exit requirements. An investment
business plan needs to be constructed somewhat differently from a normal business plan.
Investors are unlikely to be familiar with the intricacies of the business and its marketplace,
thus the business plan needs to place the business into a context of customers, benefits,
competitors and market dynamics. Within this context, the investment business plan
needs to show how and why the business will be able to achieve the revenue and profit
projections and show how these numbers have been validated.
Investors often deal with hundreds of proposals and so a well articulated executive
summary needs to encapsulate the essence of the business opportunity, the investment
required, the proposed exit strategy and the expected returns to the Investor. Unless the
summary captures their attention, it is highly unlikely the rest of the business plan will
be read.
Self assessment
1.	 A summary or business plan has not been prepared.
2.	 Financial projections and annual budgets have been prepared but do not contain
information which would enable the business to be evaluated by an external party.
3.	 A business plan has been prepared for the normal operations of the business but
does not reflect the special needs of an Investor.
4.	 An investment business plan with an executive summary has been prepared
specifically for the purpose of raising equity investment but has not been reviewed
by a professional advisor.
5.	 An investment business plan including an executive summary has been prepared
specifically for raising equity finance and has been reviewed by a professional
advisor and adjusted based on their advice.

<-----Page 231----->Part B: Indices

D5.	 Appropriate Investors are identified
While there are many Angel and VC investors, each one has their own preferred investment
objectives which are based on their industry experience, the amount they have to invest,
the time they have available to manage their investments, their existing commitments,
travel preferences and so on. Just because an opportunity looks compelling from an ROI
point of view, does not mean that investors will be flocking to review the proposal. They
will know they will often have to get involved with the management of the business
or with the development of its market penetration or the final exit. These often require
familiarity with the sector and possible access to alliances, senior executive talent and
possible corporate acquirers.
At the same time, their desire to invest may depend on what other investments they have
and their risk tolerance. A Investor which has substantially allocated their investable funds
may not be in a position to make new investments. A VC fund which is fully allocated
may not be in a position to allocate new funds for some time. Angels and VC funds need
to balance their investments across different risks, thus an Investor may feel over extended
in one sector and not be willing to make further investments in that area. Alternatively,
a different Investor may be seeking investments in the firm’s sector.
Self assessment
1.	 Investors have not been identified or approached.
2.	 Angels and/or Venture Capital firms have been selected based on location and
personal introductions but this has not been done scientifically or with the advice of
a professional advisor.
3.	 A number of Investors have been identified based on their preference for industry
sector, size of investment and geographical preference but reference checking has
not been done and no professional advice has been taken.
4.	 Professional advice has been sought on the selection of Investors and a small
number identified for approach but no reference checking has not been undertaken.
5.	 A select number of Investors have been identified based on their preference for
industry sector, size of investment, geographical preference and so on. References
have been sought from current and former investees and other professional parties.

214

<-----Page 232----->Part B: Indices

D6.	 Creditable introductions to Investors are achieved
Some Investors have a policy of not reviewing unsolicited proposals. This is partly
based on the fact that they have a good pipeline of referred proposals from professional
advisors, former investees and colleagues but also because they simply don’t have time
to read a proposal which has not been professionally prepared and reviewed before they
see it. Investors prefer not to waste their time with poorly prepared information or with
unrealistic proposals. They expect proposals which they receive to have been referred
to them by knowledgeable persons and that they will not only be complete but also the
applicant will have realistic expectations on valuation.
Investors often complain that they spend too much time educating the entrepreneur about
how Angel or VC investment works. Some of the conditions attached to an investment
are confronting to an entrepreneur, especially when they see there is a chance they may
lose control of their business or their business can be sold from under them. While these
conditions may appear harsh, they reflect the reality of dealing with high risk ventures
where liquidity is a serious issue. Rather than having these difficult discussions, the
Investor would rather deal with proposals which have already taken into account the
manner in which the investment will be constructed and managed. At the same time,
they would rather deal with proposals which have the necessary information in them to
allow them to undertake a proper evaluation.
Self assessment
1.	 Introductions have not been arranged.
2.	 The firm has secured a letter of introduction from friends or a suburban accountant
or lawyer. The contacts with the Investor are not personal and are mostly ones of
professional courtesy.
3.	 Personal introductions have been arranged by friends and acquaintances of
the Investor. These individuals, however, are not familiar with Angel or VC
investments.
4.	 Introductions have been arranged to the Investor by individuals knowledgeable
about Angel and VC investments but not specifically about the preferences of the
specific Investor.
5.	 Introductions have been arranged by creditable professional advisors and/or other
investors who are actively involved in Angel or VC investment transactions and are

215

<-----Page 233----->Part B: Indices

known to the Investor. The introductions have taken into account the investment
preferences of the Investors being approached.

D7.	 Key messages are practiced and refined
Investors evaluate many proposals before they make a single investment, thus they tend
to use their time as efficiently as possible. They look for a venture team which can clearly
articulate the essence of both the business and the investment proposal. This is not just
because it helps them in their evaluation but because they know the team will have to do
this task many hundreds of times to customers, suppliers, alliance partners and potential
employees. A venture team which is unable to provide a precise definition of who they
are and why they are going to be successful probably has not yet come to grips with the
essence of the business and how it needs to be developed to be successful.
The vision of the business needs to be both compelling and succinct. The business
concept should clearly show how and why the business will be successful. The investment
proposition should show how much investment is required, what it is going to be used for,
what exit strategy will be undertaken and what return the investor can expect to receive
on their investment. The investment proposal should be presented in non-technical terms
if appropriate, be able to be adapted to different presentation lengths and show that the
supporting detail will demonstrate validation of the critical business issues.
Self assessment
1.	 No effort has been made to develop a clear vision and definition of the business
concept.
2.	 The firm can discuss their venture knowledgeably but this has not been tuned for an
investment audience.
3.	 The vision and definition of the business concept is well understood and has been
developed for an Investor but is too long, overly technical, lacks flow or is not
convincing.
4.	 The firm has developed a series of presentations for Investors including a short
pitch and a 20-30 minute business plan presentation. This has been tested and
practiced with colleagues and friends.
5.	 The firm has a well articulated set of informal and formal presentations which have
been reviewed with professional advisors and suit a variety of different technical
and non-technical audiences.

<-----Page 234----->Part B: Indices

D8.	 Multiple Investors are engaged
A good proposal should be offered to a small number of selected Investors. This is not to
suggest that it is shopped around, but each Investor will have their own portfolio strategy
and the worth of your venture, while attractive, may not suit the investment position or
timing of some of the Investors. You also want to have the opportunity of comparing
what additional value each Investor can bring to your venture. If the money available
is the same across the Investors, their added contribution in terms of networks, access
to experienced staff, ability to open doors to alliance partners and potential customers
should also be evaluated.
You also need to be comfortable with the people you will be dealing with, especially the
Investor or Investor’s representative who will be sitting on your board. You don’t want
to find yourself stuck with someone who has a different view of the world or a different
cultural or ethical position. It may be the case that the terms under which the Investors
are willing to invest are different in which case you need to weigh up the different tangible
and intangible benefits. Some may be much more willing to negotiate a formula based
valuation, for example.
Self assessment
1.	 Investors have not been engaged.
2.	 The firm has approached a number of Investors but has yet to move to a second
round of discussions.
3.	 Detailed discussions have been undertaken with several Investors and some level
of interest has been expressed.
4.	 Discussions with a small number of Investors have progressed to strong
expressions of interest or one Investor has been selected for extensive discussions.
A professional advisor has reviewed the discussions and advised on which Investor
to proceed with.
5.	 A small number of Investors have expressed strong interest and the firm has
agreed to proceed to develop a Term Sheet with them. A professional advisor has
recommended which Investor should be taken to Term Sheet stage.

D9.	 Offers received and negotiated
After the various Investment offers have been evaluated and some due diligence
undertaken on each of them, Heads of Agreement will be negotiated. This is something
that must be negotiated as there are many possible components to the investment deal.
You should spend some time prior to the meetings becoming familiar with the normal
terms of an Angel or VC investment and request clarification from your professional
advisor if you are not familiar with the implications of the various terms and components.
The verbal offer which you receive is not necessarily the last position of the Investor.
Investors are competing for your business in the same way that you are seeking theirs.
You should be trying to find a balance between your interests as founders and shareholders
with theirs as independent investors. If you push your position too hard, however, you
will probably not end up with a deal. But marginal aspects of the deal may still be subject
to movement on their side and you may be willing to offer some concessions on yours.
In the end, however, you still need to make the numbers and the timescales to protect
your investment in the business.
Self assessment
1.	 Offers have not been received.
2.	 At least one Investor has expressed strong interest but no discussion of an offer has
eventuated.
3.	 One or more Investors have expressed strong interest and have discussed the
investment evaluation process with the firm. One or more have indicated that
offers would be forthcoming after some additional due diligence steps have been
undertaken.
4.	 One or more Investors have indicated the broad terms of an offer. These have not
been responded to and not reviewed with the professional advisor.
5.	 Verbal offers have been received by the firm and have been reviewed by the
professional advisor. A response has been given to at least one Investor which
indicates that a written Term Sheet would be seriously considered.

Raising Angel & Venture Capital Finance

218

<-----Page 236----->Part B: Indices

D10.	 Term Sheet received and negotiated
The Term Sheet is the formal offer by the Investor. This will be issued only after they
have reached an understanding with you and have done initial due diligence on the firm
and the market opportunity. The Term Sheet means they are ready to put some serious
time into the full due diligence and working with you to make sure each party has a full
understanding of the journey that you will undertake together over the next few years.
However, even a Term Sheet can be negotiated to some extent. Often additional clauses
have been added by the Investors which have not been fully discussed or they have
assumed you are familiar with. These need to be examined, often in conjunction with
a professional advisor and then clarification sought. Sometimes minor items within the
Term Sheet can still be negotiated.
Often at this point, you have settled on your preferred Investor and only one Term Sheet
will be dealt with. Providing you have done your reference checking and are comfortable
with the Investor and the deal, there is no reason why you should not proceed at this point.
Make sure all the parties to the agreement on your side are willing to sign off on the deal.
Self assessment
1.	 Term Sheets have not been received.
2.	 A Term Sheet has been received but is unacceptable or has not been responded to.
3.	 Negotiations on the Term Sheet have commenced but there is still some gap
between the parties.
4.	 Negotiations have concluded on the Term Sheet and verbal agreement reached on
an acceptable arrangement. The firm is waiting on a new terms sheet.
5.	 A Term Sheet has been received which is acceptable to the firm and has been
recommended by the professional advisor.
