Abstract The temporalities of opportunism – a term that generally means “self-interest seeking
with guile” – have not been adequately examined in the literature. This article suggests that
opportunism is a variegated phenomenon that can be better appreciated by exploring the role of its
temporal dimension. Adopting this temporal approach, the article proposes a framework of
partner opportunism in strategic alliances that incorporates the two fundamental dimensions of
time and risk. It then discusses four types of partner opportunism in this comprehensive time-risk
framework. Finally, the article indicates directions for further research.

Introduction
A notable feature of business in recent times is the accelerated formation of strategic
alliances, or interfirm cooperative arrangements aimed at pursuing mutual strategic
objectives. Despite this encouraging trend, the failure rate of these alliances has been
remarkably high (Das and Teng, 2000a). One of the major reasons for alliance
dissolutions has been the opportunistic behavior of partners. Opportunistic behavior
refers to “self-interest seeking with guile” (Williamson, 1975, p. 9). In this article we
attempt to better understand the dynamics of such opportunistic behavior. We suggest
that opportunism is not a monolithic phenomenon, and that it would be useful,
therefore, to develop a more comprehensive framework of opportunistic behavior. In
that effort, we explore the temporal dimension that continues to be neglected in studies
of both opportunism among firms and partner opportunism in strategic alliances.
A review of the literature suggests that few guidelines are available for examining
various types of opportunism. We believe that recognizing the temporal dimension is
central to appreciating the essence of opportunism. Our approach to understanding
opportunistic behavior focuses on its two fundamental dimensions: time-span and risk.
The first dimension relates to the duration of potential negative impact of
opportunistic behavior on confidence in partner cooperation. This temporal
dimension, which we term as the time-span of opportunism, or “opportunism
horizon”, has not been explored in the literature, and is somewhat akin to the
well-known notion of time-span of decisions (Jaques, 1979). The second dimension, of
risk, captures the degree of the potential negative impact of opportunistic behavior in
terms of the apprehension that a partner may not be committed to mutual interests in
an alliance. An appreciation of the roles of both these dimensions is necessary for an
adequate understanding of the essential nature of opportunistic behavior. We believe
the risk consequences of opportunistic behavior can be better understood, and more
effectively controlled and prevented, if we recognize their potential in terms of the
temporal categories that we propose here.

<-----Page 1----->We divide the article into four parts. First, we elaborate on the temporal aspects of
opportunistic behavior, introducing the notion of opportunism horizon, or the period of
time during which there would be significant consequences from opportunistic
behavior. Second, we examine the nature of opportunistic behavior in strategic
alliances, clarifying, in particular, how the possibility of opportunism results in
relational risk in alliances. We then propose a time-risk framework of opportunistic
behavior based on the two dimensions of opportunism horizon and relational risk.
Finally, we indicate directions for further research and mention some of the significant
managerial implications of the framework.
Temporal horizons of opportunism
Opportunism in strategic alliances
Opportunism is widely construed as seeking gain for oneself at the expense of others.
Such behavior is usually associated with breaches of contract. We list in Table I some
illustrative observations from the literature on opportunistic behavior in strategic
alliances. As the table illustrates, scholars have focused on a wide variety of topics
relating to opportunism.
Opportunism takes various forms, depending on the mechanism used for the
governance of business activities. Unlike in markets and hierarchies, strategic alliances
attract substantial threats of opportunistic behavior, often a cause of their inherent
instability. Given the negative connotations of opportunism, scholars have also
investigated control mechanisms that might be used to curb opportunism.
As alluded to earlier, the literature on opportunism has generally treated it in
monolithic terms. Recently, however, Wathne and Heide (2000) offered a framework of
four forms of opportunism – namely, evasion, refusal to adapt, violation, and forced
renegotiation. These forms vary along two dimensions: existing vs. new
circumstances, and passive vs. active behavior. In this framework, evasion and
violation are opportunistic forms under existing circumstances, whereas refusal to
adapt and forced renegotiation are opportunistic forms under new circumstances.
Similarly, evasion and refusal to adapt are opportunistic forms that are passive,
whereas violation and forced renegotiation are opportunistic forms that are active in
nature. As will be evident from the framework that we propose in this article, the two
dimensions in our framework are different from those used by Wathne and Heide. We
are concerned with the degree of risk, our second dimension, not the mode of behavior.
Our first dimension, being introduced here, is the temporal span of opportunistic
behavior, or opportunism horizon.
The threat of opportunistic behavior is an integral part of the alliancing
phenomenon (Das and Rahman, 2002). Empirical investigations of various aspects of
opportunistic behavior in the context of alliances have been undertaken only in
relatively recent times. Lee (1998) finds support that decision-making uncertainty,
cultural difference, and economic ethnocentrism increase the possibility of the alliance
partner to behave opportunistically. Kale et al. (2000) introduce the notion of relational
capital, which is based on trust and interaction, and show that relational capital deters
partner opportunism. Deeds and Hill (1998) explore opportunistic behavior and its
potential threat in biotechnology research alliances. They find significant evidence that
a strong relationship between partners is a more effective deterrent of opportunistic
behavior than is the use of mutual hostages or rigorous contractual arrangements.

reduce transaction costs for all, individuals may be tempted to defect and be opportunistic while pretending to be trustworthy.
The extent of this temptation increases as more people are trustworthy, and it further depends on the efficiency and reliability
by which such defection can be detected and communicated, and the ensuing risk of a loss of reputation that is detrimental to
future partnerships” (p. 989). “Prior estimates of propensity towards opportunism are adapted as a function of events. If no
opportunism is perceived, the subjective probability of the partner’s taking advantage of opportunities for opportunism may
decline; when opportunism is perceived, it will increase” (p. 1003)
Weaver and Dickson (1998) “Perceived opportunism measures the difference between an alliance participant’s expectation of fairness and the perception
that an alliance partner has behaved in such a manner as to benefit his or her own firm without regard for the best interests of
others in the alliance. Perceived opportunism is the belief that an alliance partner has not adhered to the explicit or implicit
controls governing the relationship” (p. 507). “The variance in alliance outcome quality attributed to the perception of
opportunistic behavior is predicted to be above and beyond that explained by objective measures of opportunism as well as
the variance explained by goal-based and firm-specific factors” (p. 510)
Williamson (1975)
“Opportunism refers to a lack of candor or honesty in transactions, to include self-interest seeking with guile” (p. 9).
“Opportunism extends the conventional assumption that economic agents are guided by considerations of self-interest to
make allowance for strategic behavior” (p. 26). “The strategic manipulation of information or misrepresentation of intentions
. . . are to be regarded as opportunistic” (p. 26)
Williamson (1979)
“Where personal integrity is believed to be operative, individuals located at the interfaces may refuse to be a part of
opportunistic efforts to take advantage of (rely on) the letter of the contract when the spirit of the exchange is emasculated.
Such refusals can serve as a check upon organizational proclivities to behave opportunistically” (p. 240)
Williamson (1996)
“Because those who use transaction cost economics work out of a farsighted-contracting setup (contracts, albeit incomplete,
are nonetheless viewed in their entirety), the main message of opportunism is not that of Machiavellian grabbing or Get them
before they get us. Rather, upon looking ahead and recognizing the types of hazards that are posed by opportunism, the main
message is to give and receive credible commitments (in cost-effective degree)” (p. 50)

“The initial period in an alliance’s life will be characterized by low levels of opportunism. However, during the middle years,
significantly higher levels of opportunism are likely to be perceived as the project progresses. Finally, after this period the
level of opportunism begins to decrease” (p. 159)
“Opportunism may stem from the reluctance of members to fulfill commitments to partners in cooperative arrangements”
(p. 70)
“As bureaucratic structuring increases, the lack of autonomy and self-control creates frustration. This frustration is
particularly acute for the autonomy-oriented entrepreneurs in the wholesaling and retailing sectors of marketing channels. It
is translated into aggressive retaliatory behavior that is characteristically opportunistic” (p. 280)
“Results indicated that opportunistic tendencies did not diminish as the IJV relationship aged” (p. 79)

<-----Page 3----->They also find support for their claim that opportunism will vary within different
stages of the alliance life cycle. Weaver and Dickson (1998) observe that alliances
among small and medium sized firms are unique breeding grounds for opportunistic
behavior. Johnson et al. (1996) find that, in international joint ventures, the threat of
opportunism persists even after the relationship matures.
It is critical, when studying alliance management, to assume the existence of
opportunistic potential (Das and Teng, 1998). Opportunism can have several serious
consequences for any interfirm collaboration. First, the potential for opportunistic
behavior is a major source of transaction costs in interfirm alliances. Firms perceiving
the threat of opportunism are faced with a greater need for screening, negotiating, and
monitoring partners’ behavior, resulting in increased transaction costs. Second, given
that firms strive to maximize gains, self-interest seeking behavior will be prominent in
the alliance context. The failure to see beyond the short-term optimization of
self-interest hampers cooperative effort that is essential to alliance success. Perceived
potential for opportunism poses the most critical threat to satisfactory cooperation, and
is instrumental in causing alliance dissolution. Finally, both scholars and practitioners
need to appreciate the insidious nature of partner opportunism in terms of the
relational risk (discussed later) that it directly generates.
Importance of time in opportunism
When scholars have attempted to incorporate the element of time in their discussions
on opportunism, they have done so only in a tangential manner. Table II offers a
glimpse of the literature that deals with opportunism and time. While temporal aspects
have not been tied to opportunism in any systematic way in previous research, the role
of time in understanding opportunism is undeniable from the brief review of the
literature. This article directly links opportunism with time – to offer a better
understanding of the temporal dynamics of opportunism.
A member firm in an alliance, considered as the focal firm, can only realize the
impact of its partner’s opportunism in the course of future alliance activities. Therefore,
it becomes incumbent upon the focal firm to take preventive measures to safeguard
itself from the consequences of potential partner opportunism in the future. There is,
thus, a temporal span that the focal firm has to contend with to decide what kinds of
preventive measures need to be adopted. The challenge for the focal firm is to “see” the
potential threats of partner opportunism residing in the future (Das, 1987, 2004). Here,
identifying the specific opportunism type is also important, for different types connote
different dangers, and need to be curbed with unique combinations of deterrence
mechanisms.
As a general point, we should note that opportunistic behavior would hurt a firm’s
image, reputation, and future business potential. Thus, a firm (the focal firm as well as
its partner) that intends to continue operating in a specific market over the long haul
(perhaps to exploit industry-specific competitive advantages) will not find such
behavior a viable option (Axelrod, 1984; Heide and Miner, 1992). Indeed, as Hill (1990,
p. 507) observes: “the invisible hand of the market is an evolutionary selection
mechanism. In the long run, an efficient market will delete actors whose behavioral
repertoires (decision rules) depress performance” (Alchian, 1950; Nelson and Winter,
1982). He argues that opportunistic behavior does not pay in the long run, even under
conditions of high asset specificity, because the invisible hand of the market punishes

“In a multiperiod prisoners’ dilemma, both parties act with the
expectation that they may engage each other again. This expectation
of future economic relations, known as the ‘shadow of the future’
(Axelrod, 1984, p. 126), constrains the actors’ opportunistic behavior in
the current period” (p. 86)
“The propensity for opportunistic behavior is usually effectively
checked by the need to take account of the effect of the firm’s actions
on future business” (p. 44)
“RC [relational contracting] argues that concern for the long-term
health of the relationship leads to self-monitoring on the part of the
parties to the exchange and the deterrence of opportunistic action.
Therefore, characteristics of the partners or the relationship that are
conducive to the creation of a strong, long-term relationship should
serve as deterrents to opportunism” (p. 145)
“The invisible hand of the market mechanism selects organizations on
the basis of their repertoires of behavior, suggesting that the
distribution of cooperative and opportunistic actors is not exogenous
to the economic system. Rather, over the long run, the invisible hand
deletes actors who are habitually opportunistic” (p. 503)
“It is reasonable to say that prior to transaction, one is uncertain about
the partner’s potential opportunism, and hence should take
opportunism into account. Once one takes time into account, in
ongoing transactions, it is unreasonable to ignore the formation of
perceptions about propensities towards opportunism, and the
possibility of building trust” (pp. 987-988)
“The potential for opportunistic behavior should be assessed before
adopting budgetary reforms so that mechanisms can be developed for
checking it. Opportunism in a budgeting context is usually associated
with self-dealing by bureaucrats” (p. 206)
“Provided that opportunism is examined in the context of farsighted
contracting, the lesson is to look ahead, perceive possible hazards, and
take hazard-mitigating actions” (p. 48)

the opportunist by exposing its characteristics and eventually driving it out of the
market. This will cause other firms within the market to be reluctant to get involved in
such a high-risk relationship with the opportunistic firm. Evidently, there is a distinct,
if subtle, temporal consideration that informs the appreciation (by the focal firm) of
such potential opportunistic behavior (by the partner firm).
Time-span of opportunism (or opportunism horizon)
Time has been of abiding interest in many disciplines (see Das, 1990, for a compilation
of research contributions in 21 categories), and has recently attracted increasing
attention in the management field (e.g., Whipp et al., 2002). The notion of temporal
horizon has been applied to planning and risk in management and organizational
studies (Das, 1986, 1991, 1993; Das and Teng, 1997). Here, we introduce the notion of
the temporal horizon of opportunism, which we call “opportunism horizon”. In the
context of strategic alliances, opportunism horizon is the temporal distance between
the time a partner firm engages in opportunistic behavior against the focal firm and the

<-----Page 5----->intended point in the future when the substantive effects of the opportunism cease or
peter out. The span or horizon of partner opportunism is the temporal distance between
the moment the partner engages in opportunism to the point in time when the partner
can no longer continue to engage in such behavior. That is not to say that the
consequences or effects of that behavior will not continue to be felt by the focal firm.
However, the consequences of various types of opportunistic behavior of a partner
firm unfold at different points of time in the future. These consequences may have
potency, for adversely affecting the focal firm, for a short duration or for a long
duration. For example, payment delays can be considered a short-span opportunistic
behavior by a partner firm, because its effects will be realized relatively soon after the
initial act. Another example of short-span opportunism is the misappropriation of
quasi-rent generated from specific investments, because the effect of the
misappropriation can be felt soon after it takes place. Opportunism with a long-span
horizon is evident when a partner firm withholds necessary information to prevent the
focal firm from gaining a legitimate decision-making leverage. The effects of such an
action may not usually be realized right away, so that the opportunist may continue to
reap the unfair advantage from withholding information over an extended period of
time. Misrepresenting information or intentions also has a long-span opportunism
horizon because the effects of such actions would usually take some time to unfold.

Opportunism and risk in strategic alliances
It is generally recognized in the strategy literature that the potential for partner
opportunism adds to the element of risk in alliances. However, the precise nature of this
risk needs to be identified. The construct of risk in interfirm alliances has been
disaggregated into relational risk and performance risk (Das and Teng, 1996). Briefly,
relational risk in an alliance is the probability that the partner will not cooperate fully.
Performance risk refers to the probability of not attaining the performance goals even
when partners cooperate fully. Clearly, opportunism, or deceitful self-interest seeking,
generates only relational risk. Performance risk, by definition, does not relate to
opportunism because it is based on the given condition of full partner cooperation. In a
recent article, Ireland et al. (2002, p. 434) discuss these two types of risk in alliances in
the following way:
There are at least two types of alliance risks – relational and performance (Das and Teng,
2001). Relational risk is concerned with the probability and consequent actions when a
partner does not appropriately commit to an alliance and fails to behave as expected. Thus,
relational risk denotes decision makers’ concerns regarding the level of cooperation between
partners. Opportunistic behaviors that are oriented to the individual firm’s benefit rather than
to the good of the alliance demonstrate relational risk. Performance risk regards the factors
that may impede achieving alliance objectives. Relational risk is internally oriented and is
influenced in part by how each partner allocates and manages the resources it commits to an
alliance. In contrast, performance risk is externally focused. Relational risk is associated with
the relationship between partners; performance risk is grounded in the interactions of alliance
partners with the external environment. Finally, performance risk is common to all strategic
decisions while relational risk is idiosyncratic to individual strategic alliances (Das and Teng,
1996, 2000b, 2001). Alliance managers can have a much broader and deeper effect on
relational risk, primarily by carefully managing the firm’s social capital.

Thus, the construct of performance risk in interfirm alliances is no different from that
in single firms. Relational risk, however, is unique to strategic alliances. We should
note that the particular type of risk attendant to opportunism in alliances – namely,
relational risk – has yet to be adequately explored in the literature.
According to Das and Teng (1996, p. 831), “the term ‘relational risk’ addresses the
possibility and the consequence that the partners in inter-firm alliances do not fully
commit themselves to joint efforts”. We view relational risk in terms of the adverse
consequences of possible partner misbehavior, so that the magnitude of the risk to the
focal firm would be determined by the amount of potential damage. Therefore, the
perceived opportunistic behaviors of the partner that may not cause any substantial
harm to the focal firm can be said to entail low relational risk, whereas the behaviors
that may severely damage the focal firm would pose high relational risk. Note that we
are not using the notion of “risk” in the traditional sense of probability of negative
variance. Rather, our treatment of the focal firm’s relational risk assessment is
concerned with the adverse consequences of potential opportunistic behavior by the
partner firm. Both scholars and practitioners need to appreciate the insidious nature of
partner opportunism in terms of the relational risk that it directly generates.
The degree of relational risk is also a relative issue. In other words, our assignment
of riskiness to different opportunistic behaviors depends on the severity of the
potential damage of one type of opportunistic behavior vis-à-vis another. For the sake
of simplicity, we group different types of opportunistic behaviors into two broad
categories: low risk and high risk.
Shirking, free-riding, and withholding full cooperation in an ongoing alliance are
examples of opportunistic behavior whose potential occurrence could be sources of
relational risk. The level of relational risk a firm will experience will be proportional to
the perceived scope and consequence of opportunism. The higher the threat of
opportunism, the more will be the resultant relational risk. Relational risk can, thus, be
either low or high, depending on the threat level. Refraining from giving full effort for
the success of a collaborative project, delaying payments to partners, providing
sub-standard products, etc., are forms of opportunistic behavior that do not suggest the
highest degree of hostility or non-cooperation. In other words, these behaviors would
tend to result in low relational risk. Alternatively, there would be high relational risk in
the presence of stealing proprietary technology, distorting key decision-making inputs,
and similar activities.
A time-risk framework of opportunistic behavior
In this section we examine, in turn, the nature of short-span and long-span
opportunistic behavior and then integrate these two time-span categories with the
relational risk dimension, discussed earlier, to propose a time-risk framework of
opportunistic behavior (see Table III).
Short-span opportunism
As we mentioned earlier, opportunistic behavior of a partner firm is short span when
its effects can be realized by the affected focal firm soon after the opportunist’s guileful
action. This kind of opportunistic act arises from a conscious short-term decision of the
opportunist. Delivering substandard products, being deliberately wasteful of alliance
resources, and taking advantage of the focal firm’s resource commitments are

illustrative of short-span opportunistic behavior. The effects of this type of
opportunism are mostly predictable, given the short duration of its potency. The
nature of short-span opportunistic behavior is also fairly comprehensible in the alliance
context. Therefore, firms can often take necessary precautions (e.g., additional
contractual terms addressing specific short-range opportunistic scenarios) before
engaging in a collaborative project. Often such behavior will pose low relational risk,
so that the cooperative spirit may dampen somewhat but will generally endure.
However, short-span opportunism can also pose high relational risk in a collaborative
relationship, which may destroy the cooperative spirit.
Short-span and low relational risk (Type 1). When short-span opportunistic behavior
involves low relational risk, the alliance and the focal firm suffer relatively minor
setbacks. Failing to ship a specified amount of a product, or of the exact quality of
supplies in accordance with a schedule, being deliberately extravagant with alliance
resources, delaying payments, not adhering to the governance rules concerning the
relationship, etc., will all negatively affect the focal firm’s profitability, and even the
alliance’s performance occasionally. However, the intensity of the negative impacts is
usually not severe for the firm or the alliance. Unless this kind of behavior continues,
the focal firm will not perceive high relational risk regarding its opportunistic partner.
It is unlikely that this type of behavior will become a recurring phenomenon, though,
because such behavior is usually easy to comprehend and predict, and can therefore be
controlled by strictly invoking contractual provisions and focused monitoring.
However, if a partner firm succeeds in repeatedly acting this way, the affected focal
firm will suffer losses. We briefly describe a case to illustrate short-span opportunistic
behavior involving low relational risk.
In the alliance between Ciba Geigy, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, and Alza, a
small entrepreneurial organization, we can appreciate the effects of a partner’s shirking
behavior, a fairly common complaint in alliances. Doz (1996) reports that soon after the
birth of the alliance in 1977, Alza started pointing fingers at its Swiss partner for not
being fully committed to the alliance. Alza was unhappy about Ciba’s lackluster
approach to the alliance projects, and felt that Ciba’s shirking-type behavior was the
major reason for slow growth. By 1979, the two companies started resenting each
other’s behavior (i.e., Alza resenting Ciba Geigy for its sluggish pace, and Ciba Geigy
resenting Alza for its lack of respect for Ciba’s hierarchy), and the alliance headed
toward dissolution, which finally transpired in 1982.
This type of behavior is not a direct threat to the collaborative arrangements
existing between firms. Usually, such behavior harms alliance performance.
Obviously, the opportunist’s gain will outweigh its share of loss from the lower
performance of the alliance. The affected focal firm, however, will have to suffer its
share of loss from the alliance. It is possible that the alliance is eventually terminated,
but usually that will not be precipitous but gradual, with the affected focal firm
beginning its severance process once it observes this kind of partner opportunism.
Short-span and high relational risk (Type 2).Short-span opportunistic behavior of a
partner may also occur in the context of high relational risk, paralyzing the focal firm.
The partner firm may siphon off substantial benefits from the joint effort. Cheating,
stealing the focal firm’s technology, luring away its personnel, and misappropriating
quasi-rents from the firm’s transaction-specific investments are examples of this type
of opportunistic behavior.

<-----Page 9----->Consider the example of Craw-Kan Telephone Cooperative, Inc., a rural telephone
company of Girard, KS, that provided phone rooms to ETC, a telemarketer and
franchisee of AmeriCom, in exchange for ETC’s guarantee to buy 20 million minutes of
phone usage a year from Craw-Kan (Margolies, 2000, p. D24). However, once Craw-Kan
made its transaction-specific investment, ETC failed to keep its part of the bargain,
leaving Craw-Kan helpless with $1.2 million investment in the phone rooms. Craw-Kan,
consequently, sued ETC and its franchiser AmeriCom. Although Craw-Kan has won
the case, technical issues have rendered the court verdict questionable.
Whenever a firm in an alliance makes some transaction-specific investment, it
becomes vulnerable to its partner’s exploitation of the associated quasi-rents. Although
the focal firm may realize very early that it is being denied its fair share of the rewards
from the alliance, it may not be able to retaliate, because a break with the partner
will undermine the value of the transaction-specific investment. In other words,
the potential loss of investment from terminating the alliance will be greater than the
loss incurred from the partner’s opportunistic exploitation. This type of opportunism
often renders the victim helpless. The opportunistic partner continues to extract most
of the rent from the alliance, taking advantage of the focal firm’s transaction-specific
assets. Members could become bitter when the situation persists. Thus, this type of
opportunistic behavior stands in the way of cooperation and its possibility heightens
the relational risk in the alliance.
However, it is still possible to proceed with forming alliances involving
transaction-specific investments because short-span opportunistic behavior with
high relational risk can sometimes be predicted ex ante, and identified promptly ex
post. Also, if investment is tangible, its appropriation can be safeguarded through
contractual clauses and mutual hostages. It may be worthwhile sometimes to contest
such opportunistic behavior in court to recover the losses.
A subtle kind of opportunistic behavior may be in evidence when tacit knowledge
gets transferred from one firm to another. Often, the result can be fatal for the affected
firm. Bleeke and Ernst (1995, p. 99) provide an example of “what happened to a US
chemicals company – a world-class producer of industrial coatings – that formed an
alliance with a Japanese organization”. The US firm contributed production-process
skills, while the Japanese firm brought in key customers. Both of these resources –
production-process skills and connections with key customers – are tacit in character,
embedded in each company in complex ways, and not easily transferable. Hence, this
alliance experienced a few successful years in the beginning till one of the member
firms acquired the tacit resource of another. The Japanese firm “learned the
production-process skills originally supplied by the US organization, and it still
controlled the relationships with key customers”, and subsequently bought out the US
company (Bleeke and Ernst (1995), p. 99). However, it should be noted that this type of
opportunistic behavior is more problematic when the alliance is with a competitor and
less so with a firm operating along the value chain (e.g., a manufacturing firm’s alliance
with retailers and suppliers).
Long-span opportunism
The effects of long-span opportunistic behavior in an alliance take some time to unfold.
A firm may not be able to point to such long-range actions of its partner, but
can usually realize the possibilities of various types of long-span opportunism.

The consequences of the partner’s withholding information, distorting performance
results, nurturing hidden agendas, etc., may not become evident quickly to the focal
firm, so that a partner can continue to behave opportunistically for an extended period
of time. As with the earlier temporal types, long-range opportunistic behavior may be
associated with both low and high relational risk.
Long-span and low relational risk (Type 3). Even with low relational risk, a partner’s
long-span opportunism can result in substantial financial loss for the affected focal
firm. Consider the alliance between Siemens AG and RCA Corp., which ended abruptly
when RCA disclosed information that it had been withholding from Siemens (Parkhe,
1998, p. 428). By all indications, RCA had been considering a major change in its
business direction (moving away from its computer business, the basis for the alliance),
and from a cooperative standpoint it should have conveyed this information to Siemens
to let it prepare for exiting the alliance. However, for fear that this information may
prompt Siemens to be more cautious in contributing to the alliance, RCA kept its plan a
secret – it withheld critical information from its partner. It is unclear as to how long
RCA kept its plan a secret. Nevertheless, it was not until after RCA explicitly expressed
its intention to move out of its computer business that Siemens realized the adverse
fallout.
When a partner firm withholds critical information from the focal firm and attempts
to confuse and obfuscate calculatively, it is engaging in long-span opportunism with
low relational risk. Such behaviors create a strategic disadvantage for the focal firm in
alliance decision making. However, withholding information or creating confusion
may not seriously jeopardize the future of cooperation. If a firm detects such a problem,
it is more likely to become extra-cautious. Because this behavior is usually fairly well
hidden, it may take a while before the victim firm realizes its partner’s opportunistic
intentions. The loss from this type of partner opportunism would likely be greater than
in short-span opportunism with low relational risk.
Long-span and high relational risk (Type 4). Opportunism with a long-span horizon
and associated with high relational risk usually leads to the demise of an alliance.
Often the opportunist acquires the victim firm or some particular division of it.
Consider the classic case of Northwest and KLM’s transatlantic operating alliance that
was forged in 1992. In the beginning, KLM agreed to bail Northwest out of bankruptcy
by providing $500 million in fresh capital (Tully, 1996, p. 68). However, KLM
introduced “draconian terms . . . that would open a way for KLM to wrest control away
from the Americans” (Tully, 1996, p. 68). Although Northwest unwillingly accepted the
bargain, “two days before the meeting, KLM abruptly withdrew the proposal, leaving a
shell-shocked Northwest totally in the lurch” (Tully, 1996,pp. 68, 70). Apparently, it
was a calculated effort by KLM to take advantage of Northwest’s confused position.
Once KLM’s distortion of intention and information became known, major
shareholders (such as Richard Blum) accused KLM of “slyly unsheath[ing] a sword
at the 11th hour,” and co-chairman Checchi remonstrated bitterly that KLM’s behavior
was “‘blackmail,’ ‘extortion,’ and ‘betrayal’” (p. 70). Instead of bailing out Northwest
with $500 million, KLM finally squeezed $50 million in exchange for a series of
lucrative options and a promise to secure $500 million in permanent financing by the
end of 1993 (p. 70). Clearly, KLM’s promise was ‘self-disbelieved’ (see Williamson, 1975,
p. 26). But this time Northwest co-chairmen knew that KLM’s promise lacked
substance and the bankruptcy threat was still real (p. 72). Northwest eventually

<-----Page 11----->managed to secure a $870 million, three-year wage reduction deal at the last minute to
surmount the effects of KLM’s long-span opportunistic behavior in the context of very
high relational risk.
An affected firm may notice the consequences of this type of opportunism only after
some significant time had elapsed, and may suffer considerably. Because of loop holes
in most contracts, it is difficult to successfully prevent long-span opportunism. Thus, a
firm has to be especially alert for clues to detect long-range partner opportunism.
Concluding remarks
Theoretical contributions
Although time seems to be an important dimension of opportunism, there is a dearth of
research on the temporalities of partner opportunism. In this article we developed a
framework to better understand the variegated phenomenon of opportunism in an
attempt to facilitate its effective management. We proposed a time-risk framework of
opportunistic behavior based on the two dimensions of opportunism horizon and
relational risk. To our knowledge, the literature on partner opportunism has not
incorporated the time dimension in any systematic fashion.
We discussed how different types of opportunism vary in terms of the length of time
they take to unfold and the degree of relational risk they entail. We defined the
time-span of opportunism (short and long), or opportunism horizon, in terms of
the temporal distance between the time a partner firm engages in opportunism against
the focal firm and the intended point in the future when the substantive effects of the
opportunism cease or peter out. We also suggested that relational risk can be
considered in terms of low and high values. By integrating time-span and relational
risk, our framework allows researchers and managers to view opportunism through a
new lens, one that specifically recognizes the realistic roles of time and risk in
opportunism.
Limitations and future research
The categorization of opportunism into four distinct types can be useful in pursuing
fresh avenues for research. We indicate some of these research topics here, noting that
they are essentially meant to also address the limitations of the proposed time-risk
framework. First, it would be worth exploring if particular types of opportunism are
systematically more prevalent in certain kinds of alliances. In R&D consortia, for
example, Type 1 opportunism (short-span/low relational risk) may be very common.
Particular members of such consortia may well coast along without significant
contributions, even as they continue to receive the collaborative benefits from other
members. Similarly, it may be that technology-sharing alliances may provide more
room for Type 2 opportunism (short-span/high relational risk), since the scope for
misappropriating proprietary technology is greater. Long-span opportunism (Types
3 and 4) may be more prevalent in marketing alliances. Firms may withhold
information about marketing channels or misrepresent their abilities in managing such
channels in order to appear as potentially attractive partners in joint marketing
alliances, where each member markets both members – products. Clearly, a great deal
of exploratory research is needed to achieve an adequate grasp of the intricacies of
opportunism in the alliance context.

Second, our analysis also points to new directions in research in terms of the role of
the different types of opportunism in the evolutionary process of alliances and in
alliance performance (Das and Teng, 2002, 2003). It is likely that certain types of
opportunism will emerge or flourish early in the alliance making process vis-à-vis other
types. For example, opportunistic behavior that takes a long time to run through its
effects will become apparent only when alliance members have been involved in the
alliance for an extended duration. Also, it could be that opportunism that entails low
relational risk may take place off and on during several stages of the alliance process,
whereas opportunism involving high relational risk may usually occur once and only
well after an alliance has been forged.
Third, our time-risk framework of opportunism should be useful in surmounting the
basically static nature of the transaction costs approach, enabling us to appreciate
various relational issues that emerge over time in interfirm relationships. By explicitly
identifying time and risk as the underlying dimensions of opportunism (i.e.,
opportunism horizon and relational risk) we can now account for transaction costs over
time and appreciate trust building efforts en route.
Fourth, future research should consider incorporating other time related variables,
such as the temporal orientations of member firms, which may have significant effects
on intertemporal choice in opportunistic endeavors. This will also, of course, help in
better appreciating how time plays a central role in opportunism dynamics, and
thereby facilitate the management of partner opportunism. In the context of
international alliances, cultural differences may reveal certain types of opportunism to
be more prevalent or less detectable. Future research needs to link different cultural
dimensions to the prevalence of different opportunism types in alliances.
Finally, our time-risk framework of opportunistic behavior needs to be examined for
its applicability to the three major forms of alliances, namely, equity joint ventures,
minority equity alliances, and nonequity alliances. The differing potential for various
types of opportunism in these alliance forms needs to be assessed for effective alliance
management.

Managerial implications
We noted that strategic alliances are fertile breeding grounds for opportunistic
behavior. Our proposed time-risk framework of opportunistic behavior, along with the
extended discussion of the four types of opportunism, should serve as the essential set
of guidelines for managers to incorporate effective deterrence mechanisms to curb and
control opportunism. No doubt because of this need for appropriate deterrence
mechanisms, we find a number of them mentioned in the literature, such as rigorous
contractual provisions, mutual hostages, monitoring, and the like (Das and Rahman,
2001). We should note, however, that although some of these mechanisms seem to
generally work well, none of them promises to consistently curb opportunistic
behavior.
Although the applicability and appropriateness of each control mechanism is likely
to vary in different situations, the literature does not adequately address these
contingencies. Indeed, scholars with different disciplinary persuasions have taken
different routes in arguing for specific control mechanisms. By proceeding from our
proposed time-risk framework, managers in alliances should be better able to assess

<-----Page 13----->the particular applicability of each deterrence mechanism to the four types of
opportunistic behavior by partner firms.
