This paper argues that the contribution of some universities to local and regional economic
dynamism is much richer than overly mechanistic depictions suggest. Beyond generating
commercializable knowledge and qualified research scientists, universities produce other
mechanisms of knowledge transfer, such as generating and attracting talent to the local
economy, and collaborating with local industry by providing formal and informal technical
support. A detailed case study of the University of Waterloo, in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada,
with its progressive Coop and Entrepreneurial education programs, and innovative Intellectual Property policy, illustrates the way in which the university has contributed to growth
and innovation in the local and regional economy.

1. Introduction
Universities have emerged as central actors in the
knowledge-based economy, expected to play an active
role in promoting technological change and innovation.
However, the nature of their role in regional economic
development is less well understood than is often presumed. While the presence of a leading research university
is a critical asset for urban and regional economies, it is
not sufficient in itself to stimulate strong regional economic growth because universities tend to be ‘catalysts’ of
technological innovation rather than ‘drivers’ (Doutriaux,
2003; Wolfe, 2005a). Yet many policymakers still view
research universities as potential ‘knowledge factories’ for
the new economy (David, 1997), with untapped reservoirs of commercializable knowledge waiting to be taken
up by firms and applied. This mechanistic view of the
way in which basic scientific research is transformed into
commercial products demonstrates a misconception of

the commercialization process itself, as well as the role
that universities can and should be expected to play in
that process. The flow of knowledge does drive innovation, but knowledge transfer from universities to industry
is a fluid, complex and iterative process involving many
different actors. As a consequence, the role of universities in technology transfer and commercialization is
much more nuanced than traditional linear conceptions of
the innovation process assume (Stokes, 1997; Branscomb,
1997).
From a theoretical perspective, the linear approach
to technology transfer is being replaced by approaches
that emphasize the interactive and social nature of the
knowledge transfer process and the importance of tacit
dimensions of knowledge. The goal of this paper is to
suggest a more robust conception of the ways in which
university-generated knowledge is transferred into the
local economy. We argue that universities are not just
generators of commercializable knowledge or even highly
qualified research scientists; they provide other equally
critical mechanisms of knowledge transfer. First, they
generate and attract talent, which contributes both to
the stock of tacit knowledge in the local economy, as
well as to the ‘thickness’ of the local labour market

(Florida, 2002; Betts and Lee, 2005). Second, in addition to the conduct of basic research, universities provide
both formal and informal technical support, as well as
specialized expertise and facilities for on-going, firmbased R&D activities (Grossman et al., 2001; National
Academy of Engineering, 2003; Mowery et al., 2004).
Third, universities act as a conduit enabling firms to access
knowledge from the ‘global pipelines’ of international academic research networks (Bathelt et al., 2004; Lawton
Smith, 2003a; OECD, 1999). Finally, rather than acting
as ‘ivory towers’ insulated from their community, they
can function as ‘good community players’ that support
firm formation and growth by facilitating tacit knowledge
exchange among networks of innovative firms and acting
as ‘anchors of creativity’ that sustain the virtuous cycle
of talent attraction and retention (Wolfe, 2005a; Henton
et al., 1997; Gertler and Vinodrai, 2005; Betts and Lee,
2005).
This paper presents a theoretical discussion of the
recent literature on universities, innovation and regional
economic development, with a particular emphasis on
the process of learning and mechanisms of tacit knowledge exchange between universities and local actors.
It draws upon a detailed case study, based on 96 indepth interviews with firms, associations, and knowledge
institutions, of the dynamic cluster of information and
communications technology firms in the Waterloo region
of Ontario, Canada (Bramwell et al., 2008). The University of Waterloo, the leading post-secondary educational
institution in the region, emerges as a strong example of an ‘entrepreneurial research university’ that is
actively engaged with the process of economic development in the local community (Tornatzky et al., 2002). While
commercialization activities and the spin-off of startup
firms have clearly contributed to the region’s economic
success, other equally important forms of knowledge transfer are occurring and the university’s role in economic
development transcends the success of its commercialization efforts. In relation to the framework outlined
above, the University of Waterloo has been a critical
catalyst for local economic development through its ability to generate and attract the talent that underpins
academic and applied excellence in science, math and
engineering, support for local firm-based R&D, and its
explicit institutional support for entrepreneurial activity
at the local level. A research finding of particular importance is the intermediary function of the Co-operative
Education Program in facilitating the transfer of tacit
knowledge between students and local and non-local ICT
firms.
2. Universities and ‘Learning’ in knowledge-based
economies: the role of tacit knowledge and
interactive learning

innovations and a lot other things, you are not going to
go very far.1
The transformation of the post-war research system
in the leading industrial countries followed from the
demonstrated success of wartime R&D efforts that produced significant research breakthroughs in radar, atomic
weapons and other critical technologies. In this new
system, universities were privileged as a principal site
for the conduct of scientific research and their autonomy in this endeavour was left intact. Underlying the
post-war ‘social contract for science’ (Martin, 2003) was
the ‘linear model’ of innovation based on the assumption that “a rather straightforward conversion takes place
from investments in basic science to economic growth,
passing through applied science, technological development, and marketing” (Lundvall, 2002, p. 3).2 In recent
years, however, universities have come under increasing
pressure to move farther along the innovation continuum and supplement their traditional role in the conduct
of basic research with more applied research activities,
reflecting a shift in government expectations that public
investments in basic research should produce a measurable economic return (Etkowitz and Webster, 1998;
Geiger, 2004; Wolfe, 2005b). As a result, universities
have shifted their emphasis to include more applied
research of greater relevance to industry, and to diffuse
technical knowledge and provide technical support to
industry.
This shift in the balance between primary and more
applied research in the universities has not always been
matched by a corresponding shift in understanding of the
nature of the innovation process. This shift depends on the
recognition that the adoption and diffusion of new knowledge by firms involves the transfer of both codified and tacit
knowledge through a process of interactive and social learning (Lundvall, 1992, 2004; Maskell, 2001; Gertler, 2004).
The capacity for firm-based learning in a region depends
on their ability to exploit both external, codified and reproducible knowledge, which is often university-generated, as
well as the ability to develop and assess person-embodied,
tacit knowledge. The density of a firm’s interaction with
suppliers, customers, and knowledge institutions is critical
to the constant learning and adaptation that underpins the
innovation process. Successful learning through interaction
involves a capacity for localized learning within firms, and
between firms and supporting institutions. The regional
level is conducive to this form of learning because firms
within a region share common networks that facilitate
learning among them, and are supported by a common
set of regional institutions, including universities (Wolfe,
2005a).

People are preoccupied with spin-offs, with the idea
of starting something new. There is a lot of naivety
around this especially with people in government and
economists who think [that with] one good piece of
research and a patent and you can build a company. It
does not work like that. If you do not have at least 40

Confidential interview.
In a stylized linear model, the innovation process begins with basic
research that leads to new discoveries without consideration of potential
future applications, but which can launch potential applications that are
pursued and taken-up by firms through further applied research, development, design, production, and marketing. The later stages of this process
lead to the successful commercialization of new products and processes
(Brooks, 1996; Stokes, 1997).

Following Michael Polanyi, tacit knowledge refers to
knowledge or insights which individuals acquire in the
course of their scientific work that are ill-defined or uncodified and that they themselves cannot articulate fully. It
is highly subjective and often varies from person to person (Polanyi, 1962). Individuals or groups working together
for the same firm or organization often develop a common base of tacit knowledge in the course of their research
and production activities (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Dosi,
1988). Often this knowledge is deeply embedded in the
social and institutional procedures of the context in which
it is created. As Senker points out, scientific culture has
tended to minimize the importance of skills and tacit
knowledge for the research enterprise, yet “while tacit
knowledge can be possessed by itself, explicit knowledge
must rely on being tacitly understood and applied. Hence
all knowledge is either tacit or rooted in tacit knowledge”
(Senker, 1995, p. 426). The context of a university laboratory is equally shaped by the background knowledge
and skills of its researchers, as well as their goals, the
instruments, materials, other physical infrastructure, and
laboratory procedures that they use. Firms interested in
accessing this knowledge base must be able to access both
its tacit and its explicit, codified dimensions (Lucas and
Wolfe, 2001).
Because knowledge transfers are mainly personembodied, the ability to put information to productive
use and to support the development of new capabilities on the part of firms and other institutions in the
region requires interactive learning supported by talented people with a high level of skills, training and
experience. Firms must develop a considerable internal capacity for research – or an absorptive capacity –
which strongly conditions the quality of knowledge transfer from universities (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990; Pavitt,
1991). A key implication of this argument is that firms
require a strong contingent of highly qualified research
scientists and engineers, recruited primarily from universities, to maintain an internal ability to assess and
absorb scientific knowledge. These highly trained scientists and engineers bring to the firm not only a strong
knowledge base and research skills, but also a network
of formal and informal academic contacts acquired during their training. The role played by networks in the
process of knowledge transfer has been the focus of a
great deal of research which indicates that firms and
industries link with the publicly funded science base
in many informal ways.3 Bridging institutions such as
universities and public research institutes provide the
social interaction and networking capacity essential for
tapping into the shared intelligence of the firms and
the research organizations within a given geographic
region.

3
For example, in their study of public–private sector linkages in three
areas, Faulkner and Senker (1995) found that good personal relationships
between firms and public sector scientists were they key to successful
collaboration, because personal relationships build up understanding and
trust, which in turn leads to long-term contractual relationships. See also
Agrawal and Henderson (2002).

3. Linking universities and local industry: robust
mechanisms for knowledge transfer
Knowledge transfers between universities and other
economic actors are highly personalized, and as a result,
often highly localized, which underscores the significance
of geographical proximity for the process of knowledge
transfer. Proximity to the source of the research is important in influencing the success with which knowledge
generated in the research laboratory is transferred to firms
for commercial exploitation, or process innovations are
adopted and diffused across researchers and users. The
proximity effect of knowledge transfer provides a strong
clue as to why universities are increasingly seen as an
essential element in the process of local and regional
economic development, especially in knowledge-intensive
industries. The National Academy of Engineering in the U.S.
recently documented the multiple ways in which universities contribute to the development and expansion of local
industry: through the provision of skilled graduates who
become key players in local industry; through the conduct of long-term fundamental research that contributes
to the science base and understanding available to private firms; through the promotion of an atmosphere of
intellectual diversity that tolerates different approaches
to the solution of technical problems; through direct collaboration with industry both on specific projects and
in longer term relationships; by serving as test beds
for new technologies and research instrumentation that
are ultimately transferred to industry and finally as the
nuclei for start-up companies that spin-off to become the
seeds of new business (cf. also Feldman, 2003; Rosenberg,
2003).
An emerging theme in the literature on knowledge
transfer is the role of intermediaries in linking the producers and users of knowledge. While the concept of
intermediaries is widely used in the public policy literature, the theoretical literature on intermediaries that
facilitate university–industry linkages (UILs) is relatively
sparse. Because intermediaries can be independent organizations, or functions within organizations, and operate at
different scalar levels, it is most useful to use the concept
of intermediary as “a framework within which the roles of
different actors in a regional knowledge system can be studied” (Smedlund, 2006, p. 210). Nonetheless, there is some
consistency in the treatment of intermediaries as ‘matchmakers’ that seek to facilitate the transfer of knowledge
between those who generate it and those who use it—in this
case, between universities and local industry (Nabeshima,
2005; Smedlund, 2006). Some see the role of intermediaries as primarily a linear one to fill information gaps and
“pair up universities with firms which may be interested
in receiving specific assistance” (Nabeshima, 2005). Others
see the effect of intermediaries as broader than simple technology transfer, and see the creation of enduring linkages
and “the founding of structures and dynamics” as an additional important intermediary function (Smedlund, 2006).
In this more robust conception, Smedlund (2006) differentiates between the effect of macro, meso, and micro-level
intermediaries on the regional knowledge system, and
emphasizes that the mission of a local intermediary is to

<-----Page 4----->Author's personal copy

serve local firms by establishing contacts, arranging networks, and offering resources, as well as to “make the region
attractive for entrepreneurs and allure anchor tenants to
the region” (p. 218).
Another critical knowledge transfer mechanism is
found in the person-embodied knowledge of experienced
researchers. A number of recent studies have begun to
identify the finding and retaining of existing talent as a
critical factor influencing the growth of dynamic regional
economies, and universities are emerging not only as key
generators, but also as attractors of talent (Florida, 1999;
Betts and Lee, 2005). Florida (2002) found that experienced
executives will locate where other highly skilled people are,
and that highly educated labour flows to places that have
a ‘buzz’ about them—where the most interesting work is
being done. Gertler and Vinodrai (2005) characterize universities as ‘anchors of creativity’ that build quality of place
by fostering the openness, tolerance, and social inclusion
that attracts highly skilled researchers and students, which
in turn creates a ‘buzz’ that attracts more talent; a virtuous
cycle that underpins economic competitiveness in modern
societies. Knowledge flows, in the form of in-bound talented labour, act to reinforce the knowledge assets already
existing in a region.
From this perspective, universities can be seen as multifaceted economic actors that are embedded in regions, and
not only produce codified knowledge and human capital, but also participate actively as important institutional
actors in building and sustaining local networks and flows
of knowledge, and in linking them with global ones. However, the literature discussed above suggests that the role
of universities in regional economic development is much
more varied and complex than is often presumed (Wolfe,
2005a; Varga, 2001; Gibbons, 2000; Moore and Davis,
2004; Kenney and Patton, 2006; Lawton Smith, 2003b;
Boucher et al., 2003; Goldstein and Renault, 2004). While
the presence of a leading research university in a community is a critical asset for regional economic development,
its precise contribution is a function of the way in which
it interacts with and responds to the needs and interests
of local industry (Doutriaux, 2003). The impact of the university can extend beyond the provision of basic research
but, in order for this to occur, the knowledge assets of the
university must be properly aligned with the multifaceted
needs of local firms:
A large base of research and development is required
but not sufficient. The university must also address the
business, workforce, and community issues. The university must be aligned with regional interests and industry
clusters across a broad spectrum, not just in terms of
technical knowledge (Paytas et al., 2004, p. 34).
Active participation in the local community and economy is, in many ways, a matter of individual institutional
policy, and “the involvement of the university in the
region depends on the role that the university chooses
for itself” (Lawton Smith, 2003a, p. 6). The impact can
range from the “simply mercantile” effect of income generation effects to a “technologically pro-active model where
universities attempt to promote technology transfer to
influence the trajectory of local economic development”

(Lanza and Piccaluga, 1995 cited in Lawton Smith, 2003a).
While the regional economic impact of a university requires
more than “an active, engaged high quality university”,
almost all high-tech regional economies are anchored by
a research university, so the presence of such a university indisputably remains a key advantage (Tornatzky et
al., 2002). The Innovation U. project, a study of how a
small group of research-intensive universities in the U.S.
deploy their technological strength to build links with
local industry identifies the emergence of a new 21st
century model of an ‘entrepreneurial research university’
that “aggressively partners with technology-based industry and regional economic development interests, exhibits
and encourages entrepreneurial behaviour, and champions these new directions in its public pronouncements
and internal values” (Tornatzky et al., 2002, p. 14). In this
context, the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario,
Canada stands out as “the most entrepreneurial university,
possibly in North America, but certainly in Canada”.1
4. The Entrepreneurial University of Waterloo and
local economic development: a ‘Well-Connected’
institution
Today it is the University of Waterloo. If you sort of go
back in the cluster, if you like, it all comes from the UW
in some form or other. . . Is there a cluster around the
area, yeah there is. Is the external perception stronger
than it actually is, yeah I think so. . .We get referenced
in presentations in San Diego, Washington and New
York about this Waterloo cluster. . .but it’s clear that
the University of Waterloo is the one thing that pulls
it together.1
The Waterloo region is one of the most dynamic and
resilient sources of high-tech activity in Canada, with a
critical mass of 468 companies involved in either the
production or facilitation of high technology.4 A diverse
economy distributed across manufacturing, services, and
high-tech activities has enabled the Waterloo region to
weather economic shocks, such as the post-2000 dot.com
meltdown that devastated employment in other leading
ICT clusters in Canada and abroad. While the University of
Waterloo is only one of several vibrant centres of knowledge creation in the region, more than any other university
or college, it is considered to be the institutional centre
of this cluster of high technology firms.5 The depth and

Strong, well-established firms provide high levels of employment in
the automotive, advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, business and
services, education, environmental science, food processing, furniture
manufacturing, high tech, logistics and warehousing, R&D, and telecommunications industries (PWC, 2001; Canada’s Technology Triangle, 2004).
Currently automotive/metal manufacturing, education and business services sectors are the largest area employers (Institute for Competitiveness
and Prosperity, 2003).

The region boasts three other post-secondary educational institutions: Wilfred Laurier University (1960), The University of Guelph (1964),
and Conestoga College (1967), specializing in business, agri-biotech and
technical trades respectively, have all spawned high tech spin-offs. Local
firms also go slightly farther afield to hire from McMaster University
located in Hamilton. Although the regional economy includes three other
urban centres, Cambridge, Guelph and Kitchener, the regional marketing

<-----Page 5----->Author's personal copy

breadth of university–industry linkages in Waterloo are
indicated through the large numbers of university spin-off
firms, the amount of public and private research funding
it attracts, and its licensing and patenting activity. Beyond
these technology transfer functions, however, the results of
our study indicate that the University of Waterloo demonstrates a multifaceted capacity for knowledge transfer to
the local economy that supports local networks and flows
of knowledge, and links them with global ones.
During its formative years, several strategic and innovative decisions laid the groundwork for developing the
expertise, research capacity, and talent that characterizes
the University of Waterloo’s role as a catalyst for the
region’s high-tech economy. From its inception, the university has maintained a strong international reputation for
academic excellence in science, math and engineering. An
innovative Cooperative Education Program, where students
complete work terms in industry as part of their curriculum was adopted in the early days of the institution and
is the largest and most successful of its kind in the world
(Nelles et al., 2005). Equally influential is the Intellectual
Property (IP) Policy, where full ownership of IP rests with
the creator, allowing the individual faculty or student to
commercialize their ideas, which has been credited with
the large number of high profile start-ups and spin-offs in
the region. Many people credit Waterloo’s success to its academic and research excellence coupled with these last two
innovations:
There are two magic things about Waterloo: the Co-op
program selected faculty who had more of an applied
bent and if they were not like this when they got there,
their students would change them into this. Waterloo
also has the real tradition of inventor as owner. I have
been surprised at how big a thing this is symbolically. It
is more important that I thought it was.1
Starting in the mid-1970s, the exponential growth in
the high-tech sector was stimulated by a combination of
spin-offs from the university, the growth of existing firms,
in-migration of firms from outside the region, and through
independent start-ups (Xu, 2003). Of these sources, university spin-offs have had the greatest impact on the local
economy (Colapinto, 2007). The University of Waterloo’s
Technology Transfer and Licensing Office (TTLO) identified
106 spin-off companies employing over 2000 people by the
mid-1990s. Using a different definition that included the
transfer of intellectual resources, the PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ study of regional economic benefits identified over
250 spin-off companies from the university.6 This represented 22% of all spin-off companies in Canada identified
in the 1999 Statistics Canada Survey of Intellectual Property
Commercialization—far outperforming any other university in the country (PWC, 2001, p. 11). Relative to its size,

campaigns brand it as Waterloo to capitalize on the growing international
recognition of the university.
6
The varying counts of university spin-offs reflect the considerable disagreement in the literature over precisely what constitutes a university
spin-off. Many accounts include firms founded by university alumni or
students in this category regardless of the source of the core technology
or intellectual property.

1179

the university also attracts a significant share of research
funding. In 2004/2005 it received a total of $80.7 million in
research grants, of which $56.3 came from the federal government, $10.8 million from the provincial government and
$13.5 million from industry and other sources. In addition,
the university received a total of $24 million in research
contracts and nearly $5 million in license fees, royalties and
special research agreements.7 In fiscal year 2003, according to the annual Licensing Survey of the Association of
University Technology Managers, the University of Waterloo received nine invention disclosures, had 22 licenses
and options yielding income, had 6 U.S. patents issued and
formed 13 new start-up companies (AUTM, 2004, p. 9).
Our own research on the ICT cluster in Waterloo, however, suggests that this characterization goes only part way
in capturing the real contribution of the university to the
regional economy, and misses the full range and depth of
the intermediary function performed by the University of
Waterloo with local industry. The university’s broader role
in the innovation process has evolved considerably in the
past decade and a half. Whereas new firm formation played
the key role of knowledge generator in the 1980s, the results
of social network analysis indicate that the number of spinoffs and the degree of knowledge transfer within the region
through this form of commercialization of primary research
is on the decline (Xu, 2003). The findings from our interview
data on the impact of the university on local firm formation
echo this finding. While about half of the firms in the region
have formal and informal links with the university, many
others report that they have only tangential or non-existent
ones. For firms that do have linkages with the university,
there is a wide range in the depth and breadth of interaction. Some only hire students, while others may have some
small or informal research relationships, whereas only a
few, typically (though not exclusively), larger firms, are
closely connected and “have a very tight relationship with
the university” through research connections and hiring coop students. Regardless of the depth or breadth of linkages,
however, the university is still perceived by most respondents to be a critical source of knowledge generation and
transfer in the region, and to have exerted a profound and
enduring impact on the development of high-tech industry
and the shape of the regional economy.
Much of the University of Waterloo’s success at linking with both local and non-local industry is largely
attributable to four well-known characteristics: the ability to attract, retain, and train top calibre graduates
and researchers, and to link them with local and nonlocal employers; the provision of R&D support to local
firms; the interactive exchange of tacit knowledge at
both local and global levels; and the active facilitation
of entrepreneurial activities. In terms of human capital
creation and knowledge transfer, the university performs
a critical intermediary function through its Co-operative
Education Program that links students directly with firms.
Its top-ranked graduate training and research programs

generate and attract a large pool of highly qualified and
experienced scientists and researchers, who are attuned to
the research and technology needs of industry. In terms
of knowledge creation, the university provides technical
support for on-going firm-based R&D activities through
project-oriented consulting and joint research projects.
In terms of global linkages, the local knowledge transfers also draw upon the university’s linkages with ‘global
pipelines’ of new knowledge through the involvement of
faculty with international research networks. Finally, the
University of Waterloo acts as an engaged entrepreneurial
institution – or ‘good community player’ – that is embedded in the local economy and shapes and supports the
local networks and flows of knowledge that underpin a
highly successful ‘entrepreneurial’ culture (Bramwell et al.,
2008).

4.1. Generating, attracting and retaining talent: “The Best
Tech Transfer is a Pair of Shoes”
A key variable that links universities to local economic
development is its role as a provider of a large and deep
pool of highly qualified and talented people who not only
provide the skills and training but also the transfer of
tacit knowledge that drives the innovation process (Wolfe,
2005b). Many studies of the economic benefits of publicly
funded universities indicate that skilled graduates are one
of the most critical mechanisms of knowledge transfer from
universities, and the primary benefit that accrues to firms.
Because of their ability to participate in the conduct of basic
research, new graduates enter industry with high-levels of
research training and applied scientific knowledge, as well
as links to academic and professional networks, and are
thus equipped to perform research, develop ideas, and solve
complex problems. Senker (1995) suggests that graduates
bring into industry an “attitude of the mind” and a “tacit
ability” to acquire and use knowledge in a new and powerful way. Firms report that new graduates not only transfer
cutting edge knowledge to firms, they also bring enthusiasm and critical approaches – or ‘fresh eyes’ – to firm-based
research and development that stimulates other members
of the research team. Mike Lazaridis, founder, president,
and CEO of Waterloo-based Research in Motion (RIM), the
creator of the iconic Blackberry wireless device, stresses the
critical human capital dimension of basic research activities:
The number one reason to fund basic research . . . is
to attract the very best researchers from around the
world. Once here, they can prepare Canada’s next generations of graduates, masters, PhD’s and post-doctorates,
including the finest foreign students. All else flows from
this . . . If you really want to understand commercialization, all you have to do is attend convocation at your
local university (Lazaridis, 2004, p. 8).
While these benefits are difficult to quantify, the evidence suggests that students constitute a key transfer
mechanism to channel the benefits of government-funded
university research into industry for the broader purposes
of economic development.

In this sense, perhaps the University of Waterloo’s
most important contribution is its role in training a
significant proportion of the local labour force. It has
developed an international reputation for producing highly
trained, innovative and entrepreneurial individuals in
math, computer science and engineering, and graduates
make up a major proportion of the valuable high-tech
human capital in the region. Furthermore, many graduates are highly innovative and entrepreneurial, two
qualities emphasized in normal stream undergraduate
courses and specifically targeted through special limited
enrolment programs and departments designed to provide a business background and resources to potential
entrepreneurs, and evident in much of the spin-off activity discussed earlier. Data from our interviews with ICT
firms in the Waterloo region consistently indicate that
the primary locational factor for local firms is access to a
deep and highly skilled local talent pool (Bramwell et al.,
2008).
The availability of skilled, talented people, especially
the large number of ‘smart and competitively priced engineers’, is consistently cited by local firms as the basis of
their competitive advantage, because human capital is the
main input into software, or as one respondent put it:
“human capital is what software is made of”.1 Regardless of the degree of involvement with the university on
an R&D level, almost every firm cited its critical importance as a provider of highly skilled and specialized talent,
and that “the community has tremendous cultural assets
in the universities and that’s helped. It’s been able to
grow and attract a talent pool that is disproportionately
large for its size.”1 Although the University of Waterloo
is considered to be the primary educational and research
institution in the cluster, the three other post-secondary
educational institutions in the region are major contributors to the local pool of skilled talent.8 A majority of
local high-tech firms require university educated employees, and in many cases, most of the staff has at least a
B.Sc., many have a M.Sc., and a large number of firms
have several staff members with a Ph.D., many in software
engineering. Most firms indicated that it was a distinct
advantage to be located in Waterloo because it provided
a ready supply of “smart and competitively priced” engineers and because the University of Waterloo is “one of the
best universities in the world for computer engineering”.9
As one respondent stated: “it all has to do with the proximity to the university and the fact that a lot of our staff

8
While Waterloo is cited most often as the primary source of new hires,
especially out of the software engineering program, McMaster University
is also listed as an important source of engineering talent for certain types
of highly specialized engineering research. Wilfred Laurier University is
regularly mentioned as a source for junior marketing and management
people. Many firms, in both manufacturing and software, have a labour
pool that is a mix of university-educated engineers and college-educated
technicians, and report that they actively recruit from Conestoga College
for their technical staff. Leaving these institutions out of the analysis is
not meant to minimize their impact, but this research is focused on the
impact of the University of Waterloo.
9
In addition, the presence of large software and other technology intensive firms in the area, such as Open Text, RIM, and ATS serves as both a
magnet and an anchor for the highly specialized labour pool.

at this point, probably about 400 of our 2000 staff went to
Waterloo”.1
Of particular significance, however, is the finding that
the university performs a critical intermediary function
in facilitating the transfer of knowledge between students
and local and non-local industry through the Co-Operative
Education Program (Co-op). Smedlund (2006) argues that
the function of intermediaries operating at the local level
is primarily to support local firms by establishing contacts and networks, providing resources and information,
and making the region attractive to existing and future
entrepreneurs. The data from firms’ involvement with the
Waterloo Co-op Program indicate that intermediaries also
facilitate the transfer of codified and tacit knowledge, and
the Co-op Program consistently emerges as one of the key
contributors to the quality of the talent pool in the Waterloo
region.
Waterloo’s current factor advantage of a rich local labour
pool is largely a result of a strategic decision taken at
the institution’s inception. In recognition of an existing
shortage of technical manpower and the growing needs
of industry, the Waterloo Plan called for a new type of
education to be offered on a cooperative basis with industry, and formed the basis of the University of Waterloo’s
highly successful co-op education program. The rotation of students to industry and back to the classroom
solidified already tight relations with local industry. The
reflexive relationship allows the curriculum to keep up
with the ever-changing technological frontiers of industry
while industry support of the program funds the acquisition of technology to enhance classroom learning. It
was thus that Waterloo became one of the first universities in Canada to enable students to actively explore and
make use of innovations in the relatively new field of
computing. The exposure that students had to the early
days of computer technology laid the foundations for a
technological leap that shaped the industrial development of the region from the 1970s onward (Nelles et al.,
2005).10
Not only are graduates well trained within the university, they also come with practical experience gained
through co-op placements, both in local firms and in firms
all over North America. As a result, whether or not they have
other linkages with the university, a majority of firms regularly hire students from the co-op program, have hired
them in the past, and intend to start hiring again when
the economy improves, or in the future, as the firm grows.
The University of Waterloo has the largest co-operative

10
The first major ICT breakthrough at the university was the software
innovation, the WATFOR compiler, which sealed its role as the key regional
high tech institution. As soon as the university obtained its first computer,
engineers and mathematicians started developing software, and invented
the Waterloo FORTRAN compiler to speed up programming computations.
This technology, dubbed WATFOR, became the basis for one of the university’s first spin-off companies and the first software company in Waterloo
– WATCOM (1974), now parent company to several generations of subsequent spin-offs in ICT. Furthermore, the WATCOM spin-off established a
business model based on a relationship between the company and the university that allowed the company to retain ownership of its research and
intellectual property, which formed the basis for the university’s current
intellectual property policy.

education program in the world, with over 11,000 students (60% of the student body) and 3000 employers, 281
of them local, involved in the program each year. Coop program offerings are extensive and are available in
all faculties and departments, and in over 100 different
programs. The Centre for the Advancement of Co-op Education (WatCACE), was established in 2002 to provide a
research capacity to identify and disseminate best practices in co-op education.11 Many of the larger Waterloo
firms, as well as global ones, have deep and enduring
links with the co-op program. Mike Lazaridis of RIM is an
active and vocal proponent of tech transfer through the
Waterloo co-op program. At Sybase, an enterprise software
company that spun-off from the original WATCOM Corporation, with over 250 employees in its Waterloo campus
alone, 15% of its current employees is Waterloo co-op students, and more than half of their Waterloo staff is former
co-op students. Sybase also actively supports co-op activities at the high school level, and employees speak at local
high schools, colleges, and universities about co-op education.
Four key benefits of Waterloo’s co-op program were
reported in our interviews with local firms. First and foremost, it acts as a steady source of new hires, because firms
know that the students have work experience, and they get
an opportunity to evaluate their performance in the workplace before hiring them. The Co-op Program is attributed
with “putting knowledge on the streets”, and recent graduates provide ‘fresh eyes’: “new ideas, new minds, younger
talent in the company”, so firms “get to mold the person . . .
and see how they perform”.1 Second, co-op students act as
an important transfer mechanism for tacit knowledge and
‘know-how’; because they are exposed to new ideas in their
courses and bring these ideas to their work placements:
“a lot of the students are on the cutting edge of the products that we’re working on, so we definitely get the benefit
from that”.1 Somewhat surprisingly, we also discovered
that co-op students acts as a critical source of knowledge
circulation within the local high-tech cluster, effectively
transferring knowledge between different firms as they
move from placement to placement over the course of their
integrated work-study program. The presence of strong
anchor firms in critical areas, such as wireless communication or in collaborative enterprise management solutions
means that as many as 100 students are receiving training in
these specialized market niches during their work semester
every 4 months. These students subsequently move on to
other firms within the region, taking their specialized skills
with them and providing a highly effective method of tacit
knowledge transfer within the local cluster.1
Finally, Waterloo co-op students have an international
reputation for being of high quality, and as a result, local
firms have to compete with global ones to attract the best
students, though they retain the benefit of location. For
instance, in a recent speech at the university during his
Microsoft 2005 Tour, Bill Gates referred to Waterloo as “a
special relationship for us. Most years, we hire more stu-

dents out of Waterloo than any other university in the
world.” This in turn poses its own challenge for the local
firms in the Waterloo ICT cluster. As one interviewee told us,
We’re competing with Intel and Microsoft constantly for
those top students and I think Microsoft hires like 15 per
cent of the graduating class and 15 per cent of the coops there and who wouldn’t want to go and work for
Microsoft? So we’re generally paying top dollar because
we’re competing against US folks but we’re also competing for the best of the best. And I think we get way more
than our share here locally.1
Beyond these highly visible and tangible benefits of the
Co-op Program is its contribution to the virtuous cycle of
entrepreneurialism in the region. Co-op students also act
as an important conduit between local firms in the cluster
and the teaching faculty at the university. For example, one
interviewee cited IBM as reporting that Waterloo undergraduate co-op students were the principal instrument
that enabled most small- and medium-sized companies to
integrate computers into their operations.1 This aspect of
person- or more precisely, student-embodied knowledge
transfer is underscored as a critical part of the overall
innovation process. Conversely, students returning to class
from their placement terms are highly focused on applied
technical problems they have been working on, which
influences the way faculty present new material in their
classes. In this sense, the person-embodied element of
tech transfer through co-op students emerges clearly, as
does the importance of qualitative relationships between
people in the university and in industry, for which ‘the
students are often the instrument’. Larry Smith, an economics professor at the University of Waterloo and a vocal
proponent of the Co-op Program, underscores this reciprocal nature of student-embodied knowledge transfer, and
refers to his students as an “early warning system” that
keeps him abreast of major pending technical advances.
He cites computer animation as an example,
I heard about the incredibly advanced animation that
Pixar was doing 12 to 13 years ago, well before they hit
the masses. My students told me not just what animation could do at that time, but what it will do in the
future. Everything they told me, animation studios are
now doing. . . These students are not just cheap labour.
They know about what’s hot and what’s not. They talk
to the professors and they are really in the know.12
At the same time, student-driven tech transfer is also
critical specifically to the commercialization process. One
of our interviewees reported that: “students come off coop terms and co-opt entrepreneurial faculty to develop a
company . . . [They] play a big role in spin-offs and tech
transfer.”1 This awareness of the crucial link between commercialization and entrepreneurialism is underscored and
supported by the Enterprise Co-op Program, which enables
students to start their own venture in lieu of doing a co-op
placement with an established firm, and focuses on creating a local network of contacts and mentors to support it.

4.2. Beyond commercialization: “Little R, Big D” and
getting the first look
Beyond the ability to produce, attract and retain talent in the region, universities also provide critical research
support to local industry. The literature on the economic
impact of university licensing and spin-offs which emphasizes commercialization downplays the more difficult to
measure, but still important, mechanisms for transferring
knowledge to local industry. Betts and Lee (2005) identify
several other types of tech transfer that directly involve
partnerships between universities and industry. In sponsored research agreements, a firm subsidizes or wholly
funds university research in return for preferential, rather
than exclusive, access to research results, or ‘getting the first
look’. When firms want to invest in research and development for incremental innovation of an existing product or
process, or to act as ‘test beds’ to solve a particular problem which requires university expertise and/or research
facilities, they will often enter into limited term, projectfocused fee-for-service R&D agreements (Grossman et al.,
2001). Finally, and most difficult to measure, are a host
of other informal arrangements that include participating
in research consortia made up of university and private
sector representatives, faculty consulting with or working
in private firms, or firm-based personnel working in universities (Agrawal and Henderson, 2002; Lucas and Wolfe,
2001).
Consistent with the functions described above, the
two most discernible trends in the research activities of
high-tech firms in Waterloo are short-term R&D projects
to support incremental innovation and university-led or
joint primary research projects in order to get preferential access to the results. Though most firms are engaged
in R&D to some extent, they are typically much more
focused on product development than primary research.13
The current trend in the innovation process among local
firms is predominantly solutions-focused, incremental
innovations, rather than research-intensive, first generation innovations. Product and process improvements are
intended to make the product ‘faster, smaller, cheaper’ and
often involve development activities such as the modification of existing software platforms, product updates
and new releases, applying the core technology to different applications within the same factory, or making
existing software web accessible. This emphasis on performance improvement and fine-tuning reflects the trend
toward what one observer describes as ‘little R, big D’
projects. For many firms, both large and small, outsourcing problem-focused, short-term R&D projects is
financially and logistically beneficial because “it’s about
accessing very specific technical expertise that, given the

13
These research activities are highly correlated to firm size, and while
there is evidence of both types of activities across large and small
firms, not surprisingly, larger firms tend to have more robust partnering
relationships, often involving the funding of research chairs, long-term
collaborative research projects, university faculty working within the firm,
and full-time staff occupied with university and government interaction.
Smaller firms, in contrast, tend to engage in short-term, problem-focused
research projects.

<-----Page 9----->Author's personal copy

size of the company wouldn’t make sense to bring in
house”.1
Primarily, though not exclusively, large, global firms
with robust partnering mandates that collaborate with the
university on long-term, core research projects, report that
the primary benefit of their research collaboration is “getting the first look” at the research results. They want to keep
abreast of what is happening at the research level, even
though they know they will not have proprietary access to
the IP that results, as it quickly becomes part of the public
domain when the research results are published. Long-term
research is by nature exploratory and speculative, and if
firms foresee it to be directly relevant to their business
strategy, they prefer to keep the project within the company
to avoid a potential conflict over ownership of IP. A typical
example of the firm attitude toward jointly sponsored university research, is the comment that “at best you know, it’s
a research project, at best you’re going to get some idea of
feasibility and you may be getting some prototype out of it
and that’s really where my expectations stop.”1 Again, they
have access to cutting edge knowledge without having to
invest in the people and facilities to acquire it, yet the firm
also gets an inside eye on developing university graduates
they may want to hire.
While a few report close interaction with particular university labs as their prime reason for locating in Waterloo,
the majority of firms, both large and small, that report R&D
linkages with the university indicate that it is primarily
for short term research, usually of a couple months’ duration, on a “project by project basis as needed”. The primary
benefit of this collaboration is the ability to do problemfocused research and small co-development projects that
allow them access to university expertise and lab facilities. Knowledge exchanges tend to be more informal and
both firms and researchers appear to prefer it that way.
Informal relationships are quick and easy to access – “I
call my friends [at UW] if I have a problem” – whereas
more formal research relationships are often hindered by
differences between researchers and firms’ expectations
about the length of time to commercialization and conflicts over ownership of IP. This underscores the fluid
and iterative quality of informal networks between the
university and local industry. At the same time, it is critical to note that intentionally facilitating these informal
project-based relationships is an important element of the
institutional policy of the university. As one administrator
commented:
What we think is the most important part is the business that it brings here, the knowledge that flows back
and forward, the pilot projects that are done using our
premises, using our researchers. . . It’s so hard in Canada
to have the kind of critical mass to bring in the tech
researchers that we bring in who need equipment and
labs, and they want to work with colleagues that they
respect. If we’re doing it entirely through teaching and
the small amount of money that’s gone into research
over the years, we’re probably not going to bring in the
same kind of teams and retain them. So being able to
do that in the local community and have it be a win for
those businesses too is really a very positive thing.1

1183

4.3. Global linkages: universities as pipelines
Researchers go to global conferences as part of what
they do. . .When we work with a professor at UW, we
don’t just get that professor’s perspective, we don’t just
get the electrical and computing engineer perspective,
we get a global perspective that works with 500 professors at very great institutions world wide and get their
ideas so you know what’s happening.1
While locally generated and sustained knowledge flows
are a critical element that drives the innovation required
for regional economic growth, access to global knowledge
flows are crucial as well. Local ‘buzz’ results from physical
co-location, and is “the force that facilitates the circulation
of information in a local economy through interpersonal
face-to-face contact, and the mechanism that supports networking in the community” (Storper and Venables, 2004).
‘Pipelines’ refer to channels of information and communication used in non-local, often distant, interaction with
external sources of knowledge. Bathelt et al. (2004) argue
that important knowledge flows are generated through
global pipelines, which allow firms to access local pools of
knowledge that contributed to successful firms and regions
elsewhere. In the innovation process, firms need to access
knowledge flows from both local buzz and global pipelines,
and successful regions are effective at building and managing a variety of channels for accessing relevant knowledge
from both sources.
Universities play a crucial role in facilitating access to
these global flows of knowledge. Scientific knowledge flows
easily between researchers around the world in its codified form of published journals and academic conferences,
but additionally, new information and communications
technology has facilitated the development of international formal and informal research networks “ranging
from bilateral ties between individuals in related departments to complex multidisciplinary networks, twinning
arrangements and institutional consortia” (OECD, 1999,
p. 52). Consistent with the person-embodied nature of
many knowledge flows discussed above, links with global
sources of knowledge are facilitated through the attraction
and retention of foreign faculty, researchers and graduate
students, who bring knowledge and maintain personal linkages from their training or research in their home country
(Gertler and Vinodrai, 2005).
Although this is a less central and less often reported
mechanism of knowledge transfer in the Waterloo region,
this dynamic of international knowledge exchange is definitely present. Firms cite the ability to attract and retain
talent as a major issue for future innovation and economic
growth. While there is little evidence that UW attracts talent directly into the local labour pool for firms per se, it
does attract academics on a global basis who want to work
in internationally acclaimed mathematics and engineering departments.14 More importantly, however, through
both the exchange of codified knowledge at conferences,

14
The Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics was established with
private funding from Mike Lazaridis, CEO of RIM, specifically to attract
world-class theoretical researchers to Waterloo.

<-----Page 10----->Author's personal copy

as well as less formal networks, academic researchers
have access to cutting edge research on a global basis,
which they disseminate into the local industrial community through formal and informal research linkages. Firms
report the benefit of research collaboration with the university as increasing their global reach and perspective
because research professors are usually part of global networks of expertise in their particular research areas. Several
of the larger, global firms with robust research linkages
with both the university and government research labs,
reported that having access to globally connected academic
researchers was invaluable because “it’s a great magnifier
of our insight into the global research marketplace”, they
can “keep an eye on what’s current”, and they can work with
professors who “work with many people globally in areas of
expertise that we don’t have because they’re looking 5 to 10
years ahead”. Again, this underscores the person-embodied
nature of much knowledge transfer, and thus the critical
contribution of formal and informal networks of knowledge sharing among local and non-local actors that sustains
economic development in the region.
4.4. “Good Community Players”: the University of
Waterloo’s engaged entrepreneurial culture
One of the things that has happened. . .is that there has
been a self-selection, a culture developed at the University of Waterloo. I don’t think it was managed, nobody
set about to create this culture but it happened and
it is a culture of innovation, valuing entrepreneurship,
there is a very positive regard for professors who had
started their own companies. There was a president
who bragged about having a certain number of University professors who are millionaires and that wasn’t
regarded as a negative.1
Much of the learning that supports innovation is personembodied in the form of both new and experienced talent,
so the attraction of highly skilled and creative members of
the local labour force is one of the most valuable contributions that universities make to the process of knowledge
transfer and regional economic development. However, the
way in which these university-based assets are mobilized in
support of regional economic development activities varies
widely across communities. It is largely dependent on the
ability of local actors to collaborate across geographic and
social boundaries; to form an ‘economic community’ based
on durable, collaborative relationships between firms, local
institutions, and the community, and mediated by key people and organizations, that afford each of these actors a
sustained mutual advantage (Henton et al., 1997; Wolfe,
2005a). Civic capital is a critical component of dynamic
regional economies, and it can be created through the
establishment of collaborative networks between business,
civic and public institutions, including universities, and
spearheaded by committed and creative leadership from
key people and organizations (Wolfe and Nelles, 2008).
Some universities can, and do, provide engaged and
dynamic community leadership in building collaborative
networks and institutions at the local level (Wolfe, 2005a;
Walshok, 1995). Universities can act as facilitators of net-

works for innovation in local firms by creating a “meeting
ground in which seasoned professionals from the hightech industry can rub shoulders as well as mentor less
experienced scientists and entrepreneurs as they attempt
to create thriving start-ups of their own” (Betts and Lee,
2005, pp. 18–19). Much of this institutional behaviour
that involves providing boundary spanning structures with
other members of the local economic community is captured in the concept of the ‘entrepreneurial research
university’ (Tornatzky et al., 2002). The results of our
research indicate that the University of Waterloo emerges
as a salient example of this type of entrepreneurial research
university, with an institutional policy that explicitly supports innovation.
The University of Waterloo is singularly active in its
support of entrepreneurial education and activities. The
mandate of the recently established Centre for Business,
Entrepreneurship and Technology (CBET) is to co-ordinate,
develop, and support the several strands of the University’s
entrepreneurship activities, all of which are intended to
facilitate its development as an ‘Entrepreneurial University’. More specifically, CBET is intended to research issues
such as:
how an entrepreneurial culture is created within a university, how faculty members decide to commercialize
their technology, how they commercialize their technology, issues of the relationship between academic
researchers and the business community and issues
relating to the impediments of facilitating a transfer of
technology between those two communities.1
In terms of educational programs, it has recently
launched the Master of Business, Entrepreneurship & Technology (MBET), which attracts potential entrepreneurs
from around the world, and teaches business skills critical
to identifying, exploiting, and establishing new commercial opportunities, with an emphasis on innovative
technologies. A Bachelor (BBET) degree program is under
development. Undergraduate students can also participate
in the Enterprise Co-op program where they commercialize a business venture of their own rather than work for
an existing firm.15 Innovate Inc. is a department within
the university that provides resources and counseling to
faculty and student entrepreneurs, and aims to facilitate
the commercialization of knowledge created within the
institution. Finally, The Institute for Innovation Research,
affiliated with the Faculty of Engineering, is dedicated to the
generation and dissemination of applied interdisciplinary

15
According to a university official, in the Enterprise Co-op Program: “a
small number of students are encouraged to start their own companies
during co-op work terms” and “we take about 10% a year of those people
who think they have got it and we give them a very rough screening process where we explain to them that this will be the toughest co-op term
that they ever have had. We give them a small amount of funding, somewhere between $6000 and $8000, and then we mentor them.” Out of 35
students, 22–23 are profitable in their small firms and “some are making
three times what they would in the co-op term with another company . . .
One young man made $100,000 . . . On graduation day we shook his hands
and asked him how it was going and he says ‘fantastic. I just got one and a
half million dollars to take the next step’. So, this isn’t kid stuff, its serious
entrepreneurship.”

<-----Page 11----->Author's personal copy

research that advances understanding of entrepreneurship in technology-based enterprises, and to promoting
entrepreneurship within universities.
This underscores another critical function of
entrepreneurial universities as institutional enablers of a
culture that promote the values explicitly articulated in its
vision and goal statements. At the University of Waterloo,
faculty and students are not just informally encouraged
to commercialize new ventures or to establish links with
local technology firms by the absence of administrative or
policy impediments. Rather they are actively and explicitly
encouraged to do so through established policies such as
the ownership of IP, and entrepreneurship programs and
linkages such as those delivered through CBET, all of which
are sustained by an underlying, explicitly stated, and
widely shared culture of innovative entrepreneurialism.
This is manifested in a multitude of ways that ranges from
department heads and deans ‘preaching’ to faculty that
providing consulting and problem-solving to local firms is
a ‘duty’, to the spontaneous establishment of networking
groups – “an entrepreneur’s association which started as
half a dozen students sitting around in the summer 2000
and there are now 2000 members . . .” – to the formal
programs outlined above.
The University of Waterloo is credited with visionary
leadership and innovation in the policy and program design
that has contributed to the region’s economic success:
I gave a talk in Toronto about just how innovative UW
is – and it truly is – everything from intellectual property policy, to the co-op program, to this new Centre
for Business Entrepreneurship, the Masters in Business
Entrepreneurship. Those are things that are just not
done and certainly at the time the decisions were made
they weren’t done that way anywhere else in the world,
let alone Ontario. . . someone had the courage to stand
up to say, no, it’s not the way it’s done anywhere else,
but it’s the way it’s done here.1
Many respondents both within the university and in
local firms referred to the culture of entrepreneurialism in
the region, and the virtuous cycle of university–industry
linkages it perpetuates. For example, the Enterprise Co-op
Program also relies on – and is supported by – voluntary
mentoring from people in local industry to support the
fledgling entrepreneurial efforts of students. Thus, there is
a shared sense of a virtuous cycle existing between the local
entrepreneurial community and the research and teaching
activities of the university.
5. Conclusions
There are many variations on the theme of
entrepreneurial universities, of which the University
of Waterloo is but one manifestation. The potential for
universities to contribute to local and regional economic
development is being explored across the industrialized
countries. In the UK, an alliance between Cambridge
University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – the Cambridge-MIT Institute (CMI) –
is a joint government and industry-funded initiative,
intended to improve productivity, competitiveness and

1185

entrepreneurialism through the design and testing of
innovative mechanisms that promote university–industry
knowledge exchange. The primary knowledge exchange
mechanisms are Knowledge Integration Communities
(KICs) comprising academic researchers, industry participants, government policymakers and educators, who
collaborate on “multifaceted solutions” to address technological, economic, and social issues (Acworth, 2008). The
University of Twente, a new, poorly endowed university in
a peripheral region in the Netherlands, like the University
of Waterloo, also developed a “strong entrepreneurial
vision” and was able to facilitate entrepreneurial academic
spin-off activity and generate and employ talent on a local
level, as well as develop research excellence in several
emerging areas of science and engineering (Lazzeretti and
Tavoletti, 2005). In response to policy directions begun in
the 1990s, Sweden has experimented with different modes
of university–industry linkages, and Chalmers University
of Technology was transformed into an “entrepreneurial”
university. However, in this case, an emphasis on commercialization without the appropriate macro-institutional
supports and micro-institutional, or university level,
flexibility, has made the experience comparatively problematic and lackluster, substantiating the assertion that
the presence of a strong research university in itself is
no guarantee of regional economic growth (Jacob et al.,
2003).
In Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, regardless of whether or
not firms had formal or informal links to the university or
no links at all, most of them cited the presence of the University of Waterloo as a critical factor in the development
of the local high-tech entrepreneurial economy. In fact, a
number of firms reported limited involvement with university research activities, and some alluded to a disconnect
between the expectations of firms and the university, suggesting that Waterloo may get a larger share of the credit
than its total input into the local economy warrants. However, even firms with tangential or no ties to the university,
such as those who only hire co-op students, or those who
simply comment on the international cachet of the University of Waterloo, still cite the presence of the university as a
critical factor for the strength of the regional economy. On
the other hand, the large number of firms that report their
close involvement with the university depict the synergistic
relationship that has emerged as a result of the university
being located in Waterloo.
The University of Waterloo is consistently cited as an
important source of spin-off activity, R&D resources and
support, talented and educated people, and progressive
and innovative entrepreneurial activities, as well as formal
and informal local and global linkages. As a result of the
density of its interaction with local firms, the university
is an embedded actor in the regional economy, and plays
a critical intermediary function with the local high-tech
community: “companies like us . . .were fundamentally
there because we wanted to be close to the innovative and
active environment of the university, the source of students, co-op students. It was an exciting environment.”1 A
consistent theme that emerges from our interviews is the
perception of the University of Waterloo’s ‘entrepreneurial
spirit’ that is perpetuated through a virtuous cycle of deep

and interactive links with the local industrial community:
There is an entrepreneurial identification process where
students go back and forth to industry which gives individuals experience in industry. Faculty members will
go back and talk to their students, co-op students are
enthusiastic coming back from their terms. The University IP policy also attracts entrepreneurial researchers
interested in the IP dividend with strong commitments
to industry. Due to various programs such as the co-op
program, the University of Waterloo has had from the
outset very strong University – industry linkages. As a
result we’ve never had any major problems promoting
University industry linkages as it pays dividends in the
community.1
The intention of this research has been to shed light
on the distinctive dynamics at work when a university
not only develops academic excellence in disciplines with
direct research applications to industry, such as software
engineering, but also sets out explicitly to develop linkages with industry for the purposes of regional economic
development. To do this, we argue that knowledge transfer mechanisms from universities are far more robust than
the linear conception of commercialization implies. The
University of Waterloo stands out as a particularly successful instance of an ‘entrepreneurial research university’
that is deeply engaged in the local high-tech industrial
community. Despite obvious societal benefits to increased
university–industry interaction, however, this is not to
suggest that an entrepreneurial university is in any way
qualitatively superior to a traditional one. Universities generate and disseminate knowledge as a common good.
The central lesson that emerges from this study is the
inestimable benefit of combining a world-class academic
reputation for teaching and research with the nurturing
of an ‘entrepreneurial attitude of mind’ among faculty and
students. The University of Waterloo has been particularly
effective at both.
