INTRODUCTION
Almost

40 years ago, Ward Edwards ( 1 954) provided the first major review

for psychologists of research on decision behavior done by economists,
statisticians, and philosophers. He argued that work by economists and others
on both normative and predictive decision models should be important to
psychologists interested in judgment and choice. About the same time, Her­
bert Simon

( 1 955) argued that if economists were interested in understanding

actual decision behavior, then research would need to focus on the perceptual,
cognitive, and learning factors that cause human decision behavior to deviate
from that predicted by the normative "economic man" model. Simon empha­
sized that the limited computational capabilities of the decision-maker interact

with the complexity of task environments to produce bounded rationality­
i.e. decision behavior that reflects information processing bounds. As a
consequence, Simon suggested that actual decision behavior might not even
approximate the behavior predicted by normative models of decision tasks
(Simon

1 978) .

Nearly four decades later, a clear and separate area of inquiry has emerged,
which we refer to as Behavioral Decision Research (BDR). This area is
intensely interdisciplinary, employing concepts and models from economics,
social and cognitive psychology, statistics, and other fields. It is also nearly
unique among subdisciplines in psychology, because it often proceeds
by testing the descriptive adequacy of normative theories of judgment and
choice; in doing so, it makes substantial use of psychological concepts in
general, and cognitive mechanisms in particular.
This chapter reviews behavioral decision research for the period 1 9831 99 1 . We have noticed several trends in the course of our review. First,
behavioral decision research concepts and methods are being widely adopted.
A subs(antial amount of research in the area, for example, is conducted by
scholars with primary interests in many applied areas, including accounting,
environmental studies, finance, law, marketing, and medicine (Ashton et al

1 989; Froot & Thaler 1 990; Noll & Krier 1 990; Schwartz & Griffin 1 986;
1989). In addition, researchers are using behavioral decision con­

Simonson

cepts to gain insights into such complex, multiperson phenomena as negotia­
tions and the behavior of experimental markets (Carroll et al

1 988; Camerer

1992). Second, there is a growing focus on the problem structuring and
learning elements of decision behavior, although the amount of such research
is still small. Examples include research on alternative generation (Gettys et al
1 987; Keller & Ho 1 988) (lnd studies of how cues for inference are learned
from outcome feedback (Klayman 1988). Third, the richness of methods and
problem descriptions used in decision research continues to increase. For
example , process-tracing techniques, case methods, computer-game sim­
ulations, and even the presentation of data via radar screens are being used
(Ford et al 1 989; Eisenhardt 1 989; Brehmer 1 990; Lusk & Hammond 1 99 1 ) .
These trends can b e found in the thousand-plus articles and chapters that have
been written on behavioral decision topics during the past eight years.
However, given page constraints , our review is selective rather than ex­
haustive; we focus on a fourth major trend of much recent behavioral decision
research: a theoretical concern with the constructive nature of j udgment and
choice. See Abelson & Levi 1985, Siovic et a11988, and Stevenson et a1 1990
for reviews of behavioral decision research that cover a longer time span and
offer alternative perspectives .

THE CONSTRUCTIVE NATURE OF PREFERENCES
AND BELIEFS
An underlying theme of much recent decision research is that preferences for
and beliefs about objects or events of any complexity are often constructed­
not merely revealed-in the generation of a response to a judgment or choice
task (Slovic et al 1 990) . March ( 1 978) attributes the constructiveness of
preferences to the same limits on information processing capacity emphasized
by Simon. In his words, "Human beings have unstable, inconsistent, in­
completely evoked, and imprecise goals at least in part because human
abilities limit preference orderliness" (March 1 978:598). March 's argument
about preference applies to belief judgments as well, and the constructive
view is a major organizing theme of this review.
The idea of constructive preferences goes beyond a mere denial that
observed preferences result from reference to a master list in memory . The
notion of constructive preferences means as well that preferences are not
necessarily generated by some consistent and invariant algorithm such as
expected value calculation (Tversky et al 1 988). It appears that decision­
makers have a repertoire of methods for identifying their preferences and
developing their beliefs. These multiple methods or strategies result from both
experience and training (Fong et al 1 986; Kruglanski 1 989; Larrick et al
1 990) .
Descriptive research on decision-making processes has shown that the

<-----Page 3----->90

PAYNE ET AL

information and strategies used to construct preferences or beliefs appear to be
of task, context, and
individual-difference factors. Task factors are general characteristics of a

highly contingent upon and predictable from a variety

decision problem, such as response mode Uudgment or choice, for example),
which do not depend upon the particular values of the alternatives. Context

factors such as similarity of alternatives, on the other hand, are associated
with the particular values of the alternatives. Task and context factors cause

different aspects of the problem to be salient and evoke different processes for
combining information. Thus, characteristics of the decision problem, such as
the response mode or similarity, can evoke different strategies that at least
partially determine the preferences and beliefs we observe. Further, the
characteristics to which people are sensitive are from a normative perspective

& Kahneman 1 986;
1 988). Consequently, people sometimes ignore normatively
relevant information such as base-rates, and sometimes use" base-rate informa­

often, although certainly not always, irrelevant (Tversky
Tversky et al

tion in an appropriate fashion. Hence an important question in current deci­
sion research is the identification of the task conditions that determine when
normatively important information like base-rates will and will not be used

(Gigerenzer et al 1988; Ginossar & Trope 1 987)

.

Also related to the constructive nature of decision behavior are the multiple
and sometimes conflicting meta-goals adopted for the decision episode--e. g.
maximize accuracy or justifiability; or minimize effort, regret, or conflict
(Einhorn

& Hogarth 1 98 1 ; Tetlock 1 985) . Finally, how a solution to a

decision problem is constructed will also, of course, be a function of in­
dividual-difference factors such as processing capacities (Bettman et al
and prior knowledge or expertise (Shanteau

1 990)
1 988). Another important ongo­

ing issue is the extent to which individual differences in values and beliefs are
related across task and context changes (MacCrimmon
Schoemaker

& Wehrung 1 990;

1990).

Thus many current issues in behavioral decision research can be related to
the

notion of the constructive nature of human preferences and beliefs and the

contingent use of multiple approaches for solving decision problems. We use
this theme in organizing our review. We first consider two central elements of
decisions-preferences and beliefs about uncertain events-focusing on the
use of multiple strategies in such judgments and the factors that influence
which strategies are used. Then we consider decision-making under risk and
uncertainty, again focusing on contingent strategy use. This prevalence of
evidence for contingent strategy use leads us to consider possible frameworks
explaining such contingencies. Finally, we consider how the research and
concepts reviewed can be applied to improve assessments of preferences,
beliefs, and decisions.

PREFERENCES
Common sense suggests that good decisions are consistent decisions and that
small changes in how a question is asked or how options are presented should
not change what we prefer. In more formal terms, we would expect our
choices and judgments to possess procedural invariance: Normatively equiv­
alent procedures for assessing preferences should result in the same prefer­
ence order (Tversky et al 1988). Similarly, we would expect descriptive
invariance to hold: Different representations of the same choice problem
should yield the same preference (Tversky & Kahneman 1986). As discussed
below, a great deal of research demonstrates that both procedural and descrip­
tive invariance often fail to hold. In fact, Shafer (1986) has called the failure
of decisions to be invariant across procedures and descriptions "the most
fundamental result of three decades of empirical investigation" (p. 464) in
behavioral decision-making .
Why does invariance fail? A constructive view of decision-making suggests
at least three sources of such failures. First, decisions often involve conflict­
ing values, where we must decide how much we value one attribute relative to
another. In trying to deal with such conflicts, individuals often adopt different
strategies in different situations, potentially leading to variance in prefer­
ences. Second, decisions are often complex, containing many attributes or
alternatives. Since these problems are simplified by decision-makers in differ­
ent ways, failures of invariance might be related to task complexity . Finally,
although we may know what we get when we choose an option, we may not
know how we feel about it. A prestigious Ivy League school may offer a
competitive and high-pressure graduate program, but we might be uncertain
about how we would like that environment. Hence, invariance may fail
because of uncertainty in values, even when we know what we will receive .
Below, we consider the underlying theme of the constructive nature of
judgment and choice. We review investigations of how individuals respond to
decisions made difficult by conflicting values, decision complexity, and
uncertainty in values. In addition, we consider how individuals may restruc­
ture problems or construct arguments in assessing their preferences.

Conflicting Values
Conflict among values arises because decisions generally involve a choice
among options where no option best meets all of our objectives. Conflict has
long been recognized as a major source of decision difficulty (Shepard 1964).
The presence of conflict and the fact that a rule for resolving the conflict
cannot readily be drawn from memory are also reasons why decision-making,
even in the simplest laboratory tasks, is often characterized by tentativeness

and the use of relatively weak methods (heuristics). The use of such heuristics
is often associated with novice-like problem solving rather than the kind of
recognize-and-calculate processes associated with expertise (Chi et al 1988;
Langley et al 1987).
In cases where there is clearly a dominating option-Leo option A is at least
as good as option B on all valued attributes and strictly better on one or more
attributes-there is no conflict, and the choice of the dominating option is
easy. In fact, the idea that the dominant option should be chosen in such a
case is the most widely accepted principle of rational decision-making . When
the relation of dominance is highly transparent, people indeed choose the
dominating option; however, the principle of dominance can be violated if the
relation of dominance is masked by the way a decision is presented (Tversky
& Kahneman 1986) or by erroneous beliefs such as the fixed-pie assumption
in negotiations (Bazerman 1990).
How do people make decisions among multiattribute alternatives when no
alternative dominates , and hence conflict exists? People use a variety of
evaluation strategies, some of which can be thought of as conflict confronting
and others as conflict avoiding (Hogarth 1987). The most common assump­
tion is that such decisions are made by considering the extent to which one is
willing to trade off more of one valued attribute (e .g. economy) against less of
another valued attribute (e .g. safety) . That is, conflict among values is
confronted and resolved. A decision model often used to represent the trad­
ing-off process is the weighted additive value model, in which a measure of
the relative importance (weight) of the attribute is multiplied by the attribute
value for the particular alternative and the products are summed over all
attributes. The alternative with the highest overall evaluation is chosen.
Exactly how people think of "weights" in such decisions is the subject of
investigation. There is some evidence that weights are sometimes interpreted
in a local sense: The relative weights reflect the ranges of attribute values
across the alternatives in the choice set-i. e . the greater the range, the greater
the importance of the attribute (Goldstein 1990). At other times , subjects
interpret the weight given to an attribute more globally-e . g . safety might
always be viewed as much more important than costs , without much con­
sideration of local ranges of values (Beattie & B aron 1992).
To the extent that people make decisions consistent with an additive model,
the key research problems are to measure the weights and values a person
assigns to the attributes describing the decision alternatives. Unfortunately,
the tradeoffs people exhibit among conflicting attributes are highly contingent
on a host of task and context factors. Individuals also use strategies other than
weighted adding in many situations, depending upon task and context factors .
Many of the heuristics used are noncompensatory, meaning that a good value

<-----Page 6----->BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

93

on one attribute cannot compensate for a bad value on another. Hence,
tradeoffs may not be made explicitly in many cases .
One of the most important task variables demon­
strating procedural variance in preference assessments is the method by which
the decision-maker is asked to respond. Different response modes can lead to
differential weighting of attributes and different preference assessments . Re­
search on choice vs matching tasks and on preference reversals documents
such response mode effects .

PROCEDURAL VARIANCE

Choice vs Matching An excellent illustration of the contingent weighing of
attributes as a function of response mode is provided by the so-called "promi­
nence effect" investigated by Tversky et al ( 1 988). They show that the
predominant attribute (e. g . lives saved in comparison to the cost of a safety
program) is given even more weight when preferences are assessed using a
choice mode than when preferences are assessed using a matching task.
Let us illustrate the difference between a matching task and a choice task.
Imagine that you are asked to consider two programs for dealing with traffic
accidents . The programs are both described to you both in terms of yearly
dollar costs and in terms of the number of casualties per year each will result
in: Program A is expected to lead to 570 casualties and cost $ 1 2 million, while
Program B is expected to lead to 500 casualties and cost $X. In a matching
task you are asked to provide an estimate X for the cost for program B­
presumably an amount greater than $ 1 2 million-that will make Program B
equal in overall value to Program A.
In a choice task, on the other hand, values for the cost and casualties of
both programs are given (e.g. you know all the values in the example above,
and you know that Program B will cost $55 million). You are asked to choose
the program you prefer. Most people choose B over A in this situation,
implying that saving 70 lives is more important than saving $43 million. In a
matching task, on the other hand, people estimate X at less than $55 million,
implying that a cost difference of less than $43 million is equivalent to the
difference in casualties of 70. Hence, the tradeoffs when performing matching
tasks differ from those when performing choice tasks .
Tversky et al ( 1 988) suggest that different heuristics or computational
schemes are likely to be used in the two kinds of tasks. Of the two, choice is
thought to involve more qualitative reasoning, such as that involved in the
lexicographic choice strategy (i .e. select the option that is ordinally superior
on the most important attribute) . Lexicographic reasoning is viewed as both
cognitively easier than explicit tradeoffs and easier to justify to oneself and
others . A lexicographic strategy for choice also avoids rather than confronts

conflict. Matching, on the other hand, requires a more quantitative assess­
ment. In order to perform the matching task, one must consider the size of the
intervals for both attributes and the relative weights of the attributes.
More generally, Tversky et al suggest a principle of strategy compatibility
between the nature of the required response, ordinal or cardinal, and the types
of reasoning employed by a decision-maker. Choice, for example , requires an
ordinal response and is hypothesized to evoke arguments (processes) based on
the ordering of the attribute values.

Preference reversals As discussed by Fischer & Hawkins ( 1 989), an idea
related to, but distinct from , the concept of strategy compatibility is that of
"scale compatibility," which states that the weight of a stimulus attribute is
enhanced by its compatibility with the response scale. The idea of scale
compatibility has been in the literature for some time and has played a major
role in elucidating the classic preference reversal phenomenon (Lichtenstein
& Slovic 1 97 1 ) . In the standard preference-reversal paradigm, two bets of
comparable expected values are evaluated. One of the bets offers a high
probability of winning a small amount of money while the other bet offers a
low probability of winning a much larger amount of money . When asked to
choose between the two bets, most people prefer the bet with the higher
probability of winning. When asked to bid on (assign a cash equivalent to)
each bet separately, most people assign a higher value to the low-probability,
high-payoff bet. Tversky et al ( 1990) show that overpricing of the low­
probability , high-payoff bet, as suggested by the scale compatibility of payoff
amount with the bid response mode, is a major cause of preference reversals
(see also Bostic et al 1 990) . Schkade & Johnson ( 1989), using a computer­
based method for monitoring information-acquisition behavior, also found
support for the notion that scale compatibility is a factor underlying prefer­
ence reversals.
Scale compatibility clearly plays a role in preference reversals; however,
other mechanisms may also contribute to preference reversals. For example,
Goldstein & Einhorn (1987) assume that the evaluation process is the same for
all response modes. They locate the principal source of procedural variance in
the expression of the underlying internal evaluation on different response
scales.
Hershey & Schoemaker ( 1 985) suggest that preference reversals also may
be understood in terms of how individuals reframe decisions with certain
response modes. Suppose that a person is given a sure-thing option and a
gamble offering the possibility of either a specified greater-amount outcome
or a specified lesser-amount outcome, and that the person is asked to set
(match) a probability p of obtaining the greater amount in order to make the
sure-thing option and the gamble equal in value. Hershey & Schoemaker

suggest that the person uses the amount of the sure thing as a reference point,
with the two outcomes of the gamble then coded as a gain and as a loss. With
other response modes the framing of the problem is assumed to be different
(see Bell 1 985 for the suggestion that the expected value (EV) of a gamble
serves as a natural reference point in a bidding mode) . Casey ( 1 99 1 ) empha­
sizes the related idea of an aspiration level in his explanation of a new form of
preference reversal. Finally, Johnson & Schkade ( 1989) , using process­
tracing methods, show that the more an individual uses a reframing and an
anchoring and adjustment strategy, the greater the extent to which value
assessments differ across response modes. We have more to say about
framing effects and anchoring and adjustment below.
As suggested by the strategy-compatibility hypothesis discussed above,
preference reversals may also be due to changes in evaluation processes as a
function of response mode (e.g. Johnson et al 1988; Mellers et al 1 992;
Schkade & Johnson 1 989) . People may use different strategies to generate
each type of response, thus leading to reversals. In a series of experiments
pitting strategy compatibility and scale compatibility against one another,
Fischer & Hawkins ( 1989) found strategy compatibility effects to be stronger
as explanations of procedural variance.
To summarize, various preference-reversal explanations locate the cause of
the phenomenon at either the framing, strategy selection, weighting of in­
formation, or expression of preferences stage of decisions . However, as
suggested by several authors (e. g . Goldstein & Einhorn 1987), the prefer­
ence-reversal phenomenon may be so robust because there are multiple
underlying causes , each of which may be operative in some situations but not
others . In any event, it is now clear that the answer to how much you like a
decision option can depend greatly on how you ask the question.
Research conducted in the past eight years con­
firms that the manner in which problems are presented affects preferences ,
even when the descriptions or presentations are normatively equivalent
(Tversky & Kahneman 1 986) . Two major streams of research that demon­
strate descriptive variance are investigations of framing effects and effects of
information presentation.

DESCRIPTIVE VARIANCE

Framing effects Framing involves the determination of the effective acts,
contingencies, and outcomes of a decision . Framing is influenced by how the
decision problem is presented and by the norms, habits, and expectations of
the decision-maker (Tversky & Kahneman 1 986) . Tversky & Kahneman
( 1 98 1 ) illustrated the impact of presentation on framing by showing that
simple wording changes-e. g . from describing outcomes in terms of lives
saved to describing them in terms of lives lost--can lead to different pref-

<-----Page 9----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

PAYNE ET AL

erences . Numerous other researchers have demonstrated such wording effects
(Fagley & Miller 1 987; Huber et a1 1987; Kramer 1 989; Levin & Gaeth 1 988;
Puto 1 987). These studies most often distinguish between (a) framing that
leads one to code outcomes as gains and (b) frames that result in outcomes'
being coded as losses. It is clear that people treat negative consequences and
positive consequences differently. Tversky & Kahneman ( 1 992) have empha­
sized the importance of this difference in the concept of loss aversion, which
states that the impact of a difference on a dimension is greater when that
difference is seen as a loss than when it is seen as a gain. We believe that this
concept will prove important in understanding decision behavior.
More generally , however, a complete theory of framing has proven dif­
ficult to formalize, although progress has been made in identifying impor­
tant elements of framing . For instance , Thaler ( 1 985; Thaler & Johnson 1 990)
has suggested that framing may be an active process rather than simply a
passive response to the decision problem as given. He examined the hypoth­
esis that people prefer outcomes framed to make the options appear the most
pleasant or the least unpleasant. Using the prospect theory value function
(Kahneman & Tversky 1 979) as a starting point, Thaler ( 1985) argued
that people generally prefer to have gains kept separate (segregated) and
to have all negative outcomes integrated (packaged together) into one
total.
Thaler & Johnson ( 1990) term this view hedonic editing and asked whether
people actively edit options to a more pleasant frame . Their study examined
how prior gains and losses (e. g . sunk costs) influence subsequent choices
(Arkes & Blumer 1 985; Laughhunn & Payne 1 984; Staw 198 1 ) . Their results
suggest a more complex picture of hedonic editing; for example, people
apparently prefer to have financial losses separated temporally. They also
report a "break-even" effect, in which the impact of a prior loss on risk-taking
is influenced by whether the choice of a new gamble will or will not offer the
possibility of getting back to some original reference position or break-even
point.
Linville & Fischer ( 199 1 ) also provide evidence that the original hedonic­
framing hypothesis does not account for peoples ' preferences for temporally
separating or combining good and bad news. They find that people prefer to
segregate bad news but to combine a positive and negative event on the same
day. They suggest that frames are driven by the need to conserve the limited,
but renewable , physiological , cognitive, and social resources available to
people for dealing with emotional events. Like Thaler, they see framing as at
times a proactive process.
The concept of a reference point, target level, or aspiration level that
contributes to framing effects, and perhaps to procedural variance , is a
venerable one in theories of decision-making (Siegel 1 957; Simon 1 955).

Simon, for example , suggested that individuals can simplify choice problems
by coding an outcome as being one of two types: satisfactory if the outcome is
above the aspiration level or unsatisfactory if it is below. Substantial evidence
indicates that choice depends on the reference level used in the coding of
outcomes (Fischer et a1 1 986; Payne et a1 1 984; Tversky & Kahneman 1 990).
A particularly important form of reference-level effect is the status quo bias
(Samuelson & Zeckhauser 1 988; Kahneman et al 1990), in which the reten­
tion of the status quo option is favored over other options. Recently, Hogarth
& Einhorn ( 199 1 ) have emphasized the role of a reference point in the
encoding of evidence for the purpose of updating beliefs.
Framing effects are dramatic examples of descriptive variance . Hence,
understanding how frames are selected would be very important. Fischhoff
( 1983) found it hard to predict when certain frames would be used. However,
Puto ( 1 987) was able to relate the selection of reference points to expectations
and objectives in an industrial buying context. Given the crucial nature of
framing effects in decision behavior, much more research on this topic is
needed.

Information presentation effects Differences in modes of information pres­
entation also affect decision behavior. For example, Stone & Schkade ( 199 1 )
found that representing attribute values with words led to less compensatory
processing than representing the values numerically. Wallsten and his col­
leagues (Budescu et al 1 988; Erev & Cohen 1 990; Wallsten 1 990) have
carried out an important relatcd series of experiments testing differences
between numerical and verbal representations of probability information. In
general , people prefer to receive information about probabilities of events in
numerical form but prefer to express the probabilities of events to others in
words (e .g. doubtful, likely) .
The format or structure of information presentation also can influence how
information is processed. Jarvenpaa (1989 , 1990), extending an earlier result
by Bettman & Kakkar ( 1977), found that how information was processed
tended to be consistent with how graphic displays were organized-i .e. by
alternative or by attribute. MacGregor & Slovic ( 1986) also show that people
will use a less important cue in predictive judgments simply because it is more
salient in the display. While the finding that information acquisition proceeds
in a fashion consistent with display format is not surprising (see Slovic 1 972,
for an early statement of this idea) , it does have important implications both
for aiding decision behavior using relatively simple changes in information
presentation and for the design of graphics for computer-based decision
support systems.
Another series of experiments has dealt with a third aspect of information
presentation, the completeness of information displays (Dube-Rioux & Russo

<-----Page 11----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

98

PAYNE ET AL

1 988; Hirt & Castellan 1 988; Weber et al 1 988). Those studies show that the
apparent completeness of a display can blind a decision-maker to the possibil­
ity that important information is missing from a problem description (a result
earlier obtained by Fischhoff et al 1 978) . Individuals may respond differently
to the problem if they do not realize that information is missing.
Finally, Fischer et al ( 1 987) found that when a more fundamental attribute
(e.g, health effects) is represented by a proxy attribute (e .g. levels of pollut­
ants in the air) there was a strong bias toward overweighting the proxy
attribute (relative to an expectation model of the value of the proxy). Fischer
et al suggest that this bias is due to the inference processes people use to
construct values when they do not have well-articulated preferences for
tradeoffs among attributes.

Complexity of Decisions
Studies showing procedural and descriptive variance in how individuals deal with
conflicting values provide clear examples of constructive decision behavior;
however, other striking examples exist of multiple strategy use and contingent
judgment and choice. Many of these examples concern how people adapt their
decision processes to deal with decision complexity. The primary hypothesis
underlying most of this research is that the more complex the decision problem,
the more people will use simplifying decision heuristics. This hypothesis has been
supported by a number of studies conducted during the past eight years . Decision
complexity has been manipulated using the number of alternatives , number of
attributes, and time pressure, among other factors.
Perhaps the most well-established task-complexity effect is the impact of
changes in the number of alternatives available. When faced with two alterna­
tives , people use compensatory decision strategies like the weighted additive
model; these involve trading off a better value on one attribute against a
poorer value on another. However, when faced with multi-alternative deci­
sion tasks, people prefer noncompensatory choice strategies (Biggs et a1 1 985;
Billings & Marcus 1983; Johnson et al 1 989; Klayman 1985; Onken et al
1 985; Sundstrom 1 987).
V arying the amount of attribute information is another way to manipulate
decision complexity. A number of studies, though not all, indicate that
decision quality can decrease with increases in the number of attributes after a
certain level of complexity has been reached (Keller & Staelin 1 987; Shields
1 983; Sundstrom 1 987) . These studies of "information overload" effects have
been criticized on a variety of methodological grounds (e .g. Meyer & Johnson
1 98 9) . Nonetheless, it is clear that people use selective attention to deal with
increased task complexity . The crucial question is how people focus on the
most important information and avoid getting distracted by irrelevant in­
formation. Grether & Wilde (Grether & Wilde 1 983; Grether et a1 1 986) argue

<-----Page 12----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

that in "real" tasks people are able to ignore the less-relevant information, and
hence overload is not a serious issue. On the other hand, Gaeth & Shanteau
( 1984) found that judgments were adversely influenced by irrelevant factors,
although that influence could be reduced with training. Research on the
strategies people use for selectively attending to information would be valu­
able.
People also respond in several ways when faced with decision problems
varying in time pressure. These coping mechanisms include the acceleration
of processing, selectivity in processing, and shifts in decision strategies. As
time constraints are made more severe, the amount of time spent processing
an item of information decreases substantially (Ben Zur & Breznitz 1 98 1 ) .
Under time stress , processing i s focused on the more important and/or more
negative information about alternatives (Ben Zur & Breznitz 1 98 1 ; Svenson &
Edland 1 987; Walls ten & Barton 1 982; Payne et al 1 988) . There is also
evidence that decision strategies may shift as a function of increased time
pressure (Zakay 1 985; Payne et al 1 988). Finally, there may be a hierarchy of
responses to time pressure. Payne et al (1988) found that under moderate time
pressure subjects accelerated processing and to a lesser extent becamc more
selective in their processing. Under more severe time pressure , people
accelerated processing, focused on a subset of information, and changed
processing strategies.
Research on decision complexity, thcreforc, also documents the con­
structive nature of judgment and choice, since people respond to complex
decisions using different strategies depending upon the nature of the task.

Uncertainty in Values
Rational choice involves two kinds of guesses: "guesses about future con­
sequences of current actions and guesses about future preferences for those
consequences" (March 1 978:40). Decisions are difficult whenever either kind
of uncertainty (need to guess) is present. Below, we review research on how
people assess the probabilities of uncertain events that link future con­
sequences to actions . In the current section we examine research considering
the second kind of uncertainty. How well do people assess uncertainties about
their own future preferences , and how do people make choices when their
values are ambiguous?
Kahneman & Snell ( 1 990), for instance, have explored how people predict
future experiences of enjoyment or discomfort (i .e. future utility values).
They conclude that people have difficulty evaluating the utilities of future
consequences . People also have trouble estimating the utilities of con­
sequences that will result after a series of repetitive experiences with the same
outcome.
Choice among alternatives whose outcomes occur at different points in time

PAYNE ET AL

is related to prediction of utilities for consequences over time. The standard
approach to such choice problems is to assume a discount function that
permits an individual to make value comparisons between immediate and
delayed consumption. Stevenson ( 1986) and Benzion et al ( 1 989) provide
experimental studies of discounting.
Loewenstein ( 1 988) extends the discounting analysis by including the
concept of a reference point used by individuals in the evaluation of im­
mediate and delayed consumption options. For example , Loewenstein argues
that delay in consumption of a good assumed to have already been purchased
will be framed as a loss, and a high level of compensation for that loss will be
demanded . A speed-up in delivery of a consumption item, on the other hand,
will not be valued as much: the "speed-up cost" will be lower than the delay
premium demanded. Loewenstein shows that different methods of eliciting
intertemporal preferences yield different estimates of subjects' relative prefer­
ences for immediate and delayed consumption in ways consistent with the
concept of a reference-point effect and inconsistent with standard discounting
models . While the focus of Loewenstein's paper is on framing and in­
tertemporal preferences , his studies also provide an example of the more
general phenomenon of procedural variance in the e licitation of preferences.

Norm Theory also deals with uncertainty in preferences and the context­
dependent aspects of judgment. Kahneman & Miller ( 1 986) suggest that the
particular subjective value given to an attribute score--e.g. travel time to an
apartment from campus-will be constructed ad hoc on the basis of the recall
or generation in memory of a comparison class of objects or decision episodes
that seem relevant to the task at hand. The value assigned to an attribute score
of a particular stimulus will reflect the distribution of scores for that attribute
within the set of exemplars of that object evoked in memory. Kahneman &
Miller also suggest that the attributes that control judgments may often not be
the most central attributes, given that the generated set of exemplars may not
be seen as varying much on the most central attributes .
A n obvious hypothesis i s that the more uncertainty (ambiguity) i n one' s
preferences, the more one' s expressed preferences will be subject to pro­
cedural and descriptive effects. For example, preferences for events further
and further in the future may be more susceptible to framing effects . As
another example, Alba & Hutchinson ( 1 987) contend that consumers less
familiar or less expert in a product class are more likely than familiar buyers
to select information based on non-task related cues, such as display form (see
also Hoch & Ha 1 986; Levin & Gaeth 1 988). Conversely, people who have
more experience in making decisions within a particular domain may be less
susceptible to effects such as the prominence effect of choice vs matching. A
key research issue is whether the major determinant of susceptibility to
procedural and display variables is the number of facts, the knowledge

possessed about a domain, o r the number o f tradeoff decisions made within a
domain.

Restructuring Decision Problems
Researchers typically assume that a decision-maker takes the decision prob­
lem as initially presented and seeks to find the preferred alternative given that
structure-what Slovic ( 1 972) refers to as the concreteness principle . How­
ever, a decision-maker might restructure the problem. Restructuring might
involve transformations of information (e . g . rounding off, standardizing, or
performing calculations), rearranging information (e.g. the order of brands or
attributes) , or simplifying by eliminating information. The restructuring
might serve to reduce either the amount of perceived conflict in the decision
or the degree of complexity.
The restructuring phenomenon expresses our theme that preferences are
often constructed. Montgomery (1983), for example , has proposed that peo­
ple actively restructure decision problems until one alternative is seen to be
dominant, which provides a (relatively) conflict-free way to make the deci­
sion. The restructuring may involve such operations as collapsing two or more
attributes into a more comprehensive one, emphasizing an attribute, or adding
new attributes to the problem representation that will bolster one alternative.
Coupey ( 1990) suggests that various restructuring activities might also ease
the total cognitive effort of solving a given decision problem. She allowed
some of her subjects to take notes while solving decision problems and then
coded the restructuring operations evident in the notes. Individuals who>
received information sequentially, or information that was poorly structured,
used notes to generate alternative x attribute matrixes. Individuals who
restructured were more likely ultimately to utilize alternative-based strategies.
Hence, one interpretation of these data is that individuals put effort into
restructuring so that later they can use a more accurate heuristic with a
reasonable amount of effort.
Other researchers have also stressed restructuring in their accounts of
decision behavior (M. Johnson 1 984, 1989; Ranyard 1 989). Michael John­
son's work deserves special note for its innovative look at the problem of
preferences among more noncomparable alternatives. Most decision research
has examined choices among options easily defined on a common set of
attributes-e. g . alternative brands of television. In contrast, Johnson explored
how people choose among items from different product classes ( e . g . a new
television vs a vacation) that possess different attributes. He identified several
processes used by people to deal with such noncomparable choice options ,
including the generation of more abstract attributes, a form of restructuring.
B ettman & Sujan (1987) argue that the criteria individuals construct for such
choices are a function of how the problem is framed.

Argument-Based Decisions
A final concept related to the notion of constructive preferences is that
choice is based on arguments that are generated in support of one option over
another (Shafer 1 986; Slovic 1 975; Tversky 1 988). Simonson ( 1989), for
example, has shown that choice phenomena that are difficult to explain with
more traditional models can be explained in terms of a search for reasons
(arguments) to prefer one option over another. Specifically, he showed that
the size of the asymmetric dominance (attraction) effect, in which the addition
of an asymmetrically dominated alternative to a choice set (i. e . dominated by
one alternative but not another) increases the probability of choosing the
dominating alternative (Huber et al 1 982; Ratneshwar et al 1 987), was
increased by the need to justify one's decisions to others . Further, he showed
that the choice of the dominating alternative was felt by subjects to be less
likely to be criticized and to provide a better argument.
To summarize , there is ample evidence that preferences are often con­
structed in response to a judgment or choice task. Next we consider evidence
that people use multiple strategies to construct assessments of uncertainty.
Following that discussion, we consider choice involving both uncertainty and
values in more detail.

BELIEFS ABOUT UNCERTAIN EVENTS
The question of how people judge the probabilities or likelihoods of uncertain
events has been a major focus in behavioral decision research for a number of
years , and interest continued during the period under review . Efforts to
compare intuitive probability judgments to the rules of statistics continue to be
a major focus, as detailed below. The fact that such intuitive judgments often
deviate from the laws of probability is now widely accepted, although some
investigators question both the meaning and the relevance of errors in intuitive
j udgments (von Winterfeldt & Edwards 1 986) .
Much of the recent work on how people assess the probability of an event
has adopted many of the same concepts used to explain preferential choice.
That is, people are seen as having available several ways of assessing beliefs
about uncertain events , and individuals use different modes of probabilistic
reasoning in a highly contingent fashion. In addition, probability judgment
can be thought of as the construction of arguments (Shafer & Tversky 1 985 ) .
I n the following sections, w e consider different strategies for probabilistic
reasoning and then consider evidence for the contingent use of such strategies.

Strategies for Probabilistic Reasoning
Specific heuristics involved in probabilistic thinking (e . g . availability, repre­
sentativeness, and anchoring and adjustment) continue to be investigated. The

<-----Page 16----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

BEHA VIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

103

availability heuristic refers to the assessment of the probability of an event
based on the ease with which instances of that event come to mind. The
representativeness heuristic involves an assessment of the probability of an
event by judging the degree to which that event corresponds to an appropriate
mental model such as a sample and a population, an instance and a category,
or an act and an actor. Anchoring and adjustment is a general judgment
process in which an initially generated or given response serves as an anchor
and other information is used to adjust that response. It is generally assumed
that the adjustment is insufficient.
The availability heuristic has been investigated in relation to judgments of
political events (Levi & Pryor 1987) , perceptions of the risk of consumer
products (Folkes 1 988), the generation of hypotheses by accountants (Libby
1985), and judgments about others (Shedler & Manis 1 986) . More generally,
the relationship between memory access and judgment has been examined by
Lichtenstein & Srull ( 1 985) and Hastie & Park ( 1 986).
A detailed study of the representativeness heuristic is offered by Bar-Hillel
( 1 984). In an innovative study, Camerer ( 1 987) has shown that representa­
tiveness affects prices in experimental markets, although the effect is smaller
for subjects with greater experience in that market.
Finally, the anchoring and adjustment heuristic has been investigated in a
variety of domains, including accounting (Butler 1 986) , marketing (Davis et
aI1 986), the assessment of real estate values (Northcraft & Neale 1 987), and
as a general process by which belief-updating tasks are performed (Hogarth &
Einhorn 1991).

Contingent Usage of Strategies for Assessing Uncertainty
One characteristic of the use of heuristics is the neglect of potentially relevant
problem information. As discussed more fully below, the adaptive use of
heuristics , even though neglecting some information, can save substantial
cognitive effort and still produce good solutions to decision problems.
However, in many situations people do make systematic errors in forming
probability judgments. As illustrated below, the question is no longer whether
biases exist, but under what conditions relevant information will or will not be
used to construct a response to a probability judgment task. We examine this
issue for usage of base-rate information , the conjunction fallacy, and the
effects of expertise on uncertainty judgments.
THE USE/MISUSE O F BASE-RATE INFORMATION
Almost 20 years ago,
Kahneman & Tversky ( 1 973) reported a series of studies that involved
presenting subjects with a brief personality description of a person and a list of
different categories to which the person might belong. The task for the subject

<-----Page 17----->1 04

PAYNE ET AL

was to indicate the category to which the person was most likely to belong .
The striking finding was that subjects all but ignored the relative sizes of the
different categories-i.e. the base rates; instead , judgments were based
almost exclusively on the extent to which the given description matched the
various category stereotypes (representativeness). Since then, many research­
ers have investigated when and how base-rate information is utilized in
decision-making (see Bar-Hillel

1990 for an overview of base-rate studies).

Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org
by UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO on 01/09/10. For personal use only.

Base-rate information is often, but by no means always ignored. For example,
Medin

& Edelson ( 1 988) report that in one series of studies "participants use

base-rate information appropriately, ignore base-rate information, or use
base-rate information inappropriately (predict that the rare disease is more
likely to be present)" (p.

68).

Evidence that base-rate information is sometimes neglected and sometimes
used appropriately in assessing the probability of an event has led to the view
that probabilistic reasoning involves contingent processing. Two recent ex­
amples of contingent-processing approaches to base-rate use are provided by
Gigerenzer et al

( 1 988) and Ginossar & Trope ( 1 987). Both studies show that

the use of base-rate information is highly sensitive to a variety of task and
context variables. For example, Gigerenzer et al found that a change of
problem context from guessing the profession of a person to predicting the
outcome of a soccer game influenced the use of base-rate information, with
the use of base-rates greater in the soccer problem. They argued that "the
content of the problem strongly influenced both subjects' performance and
their

reported strategies" (p. 523, emphasis added).
& Trope ( 1 987) propose that people have a variety of rules for

Ginossar

making probabilistic judgments, including both statistical and nonstatistical
inference principles. Which rule is used to solve a particular judgment task is
contingent upon the recency and frequency of prior activation of the rules, the
relation of the rules to task goals, and their applicability to the givens of the
problem. More generally, Ginossar

& Trope view strategies for thinking

under uncertainty as sequences of production rules whose application depends
on the same general cognitive factors that determine production rule applica­
tion in other task domains (Anderson

1 982). They conclude that instead of

asking whether people are inherently good or bad statisticians, attention
should be directed to understanding the cognitive factors that determine when
different inferential rules, statistical or nonstatistical, will be applied. The
Ginossar

& Trope viewpoint is one we share completely and is consistent with

much of the research on preferences reported above.
THE CONJUNCTION FALLACY

The idea that the same person will use a

variety of approaches to solving probabilistic reasoning tasks also arises in
discussions of the conjunction fallacy. Tversky

& Kahneman ( 1 983) distin­

guish intuitive (holistic) reasoning about the probabilities of events from more

<-----Page 18----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

105

extensional (decomposed) reasoning, where events are analyzed into ex­
haustive lists of possibilities or compound probabilities are evaluated by
aggregating elementary ones . A fundamental law of probability derived from
extensional logic is the conjunction rule: The probability of a conjunction of
events, peA & B), cannot exceed the probability of any one of its constituents,
prAY and PCB). Intuitive reasoning, on the other hand, is seen by Tversky &
Kahneman as being based on "natural assessments" such as representativeness
and availability, which "are often neither deliberate nor conscious" (p. 295).
Consistent with the hypothesis that probabilistic reasoning is often intuitive,
Tversky & Kahneman demonstrate numerous instances where people state
that the probability of A & B is greater than the probability of B, violating the
conjunction rule. Additional evidence of violations of the conjunction rule can
be found in several studies (Crandall & Greenfield 1 986; Thuring & Junger­
mann 1 990; Wells 1 985; Yates & Carlson 1 986) . Einhorn & Hogarth ( 1 986b)
relate causal reasoning to the conjunction fallacy and suggest that there is a
link between the need for multiple causes of an event and the conjunction
fallacy.
Tversky & Kahneman argue that violations of the conjunction rule are both
systematic and sizable; however, they also note that "probability judgments
are not always dominated by nonextensional heuristics . . . [and] judgments of
probability vary in the degree to which they follow a decompositional or
holistic approach" (p. 3 10) . Thus , understanding when the decision-maker
will use one approach or another in solving problems under uncertainty is. of
the same crucial importance as understanding the use of different strategies in
the assessment of preferences . A related argument is offered by Beach et al
( 1 986) , who propose that a person has a repertoire of strategies for making
forecasts that includes both strategies utilizing aleatory reasoning (ex­
tensional) and explicit reasoning (unique characteristics). They suggest that
the selection of a forecasting strategy will depend on a variety of task factors.
Beach et al also make a useful distinction between task factors that determine
which strategy will be used and environmental factors that determine the vigor
with which a strategy will be applied. They suggest that a variable like the
extrinsic benefit of making an accurate forecast will be more likely to
determine how rigorously a strategy is applied than to determine which
strategy is applied.
EXPERTISE AND UNCERTAINTY JUDGMENTS The studies of base-rate use,
violations of the conjunction rule, and, more generally, intuitive vs statistical
reasoning in the solving of uncertainty problems illustrate constructive deci­
sion behavior. In discussing such contingent judgments and choices, we have
emphasized elements of the task as determinants of behavior; however, it is
clear that the processes used to construct a solution to a decision problem may
differ as a function of individual differences as well.

PAYNE ET AL

One question of current interest is the extent to which the strategies for
assessing uncertainties found in studies of novices doing laboratory tasks
generalize to the judgments of experts dealing with tasks relevant to their
areas of expertise. It is clear that experience does not necessarily improve
judgment. Garb ( 1 98 9) , for example, provides a review of the effects of
training and experience on the validity of clinical jUdgment in mental health
fields . He concludes that "the results on validity generally fail to support the
value of experience in mental health fields . However, the results do provide
limited support for the value of training" (p. 3 9 1 ) . Garb also argues that
experienced judges do seem better at knowing which of their judgments are
likely to be correct; that is, their judgments are better calibrated.
Other research demonstrates that expertise is not a panacea for making
assessments of uncertain events. Experts, too, use heuristics such as represen­
tativeness and show such biases as the misuse of base-rate information. Cox
& Summers ( 1 987) , for example, found that experienced retail buyers used
the same heuristics when making sales forecasts (Le. representativeness) and
displayed biases similar to those found with novice subjects . The extent to
which the heuristics and potential biases that have been observed in studies
using college students will also be observed in "real-world" settings using
experts continues to be a subject of much debate (see, for example Bunn &
Wright 1 9 9 1 ; Shanteau 1 988).
Why might expertise not lead to better assessments in some cases? The
prediction of future events often depends on learning from and understanding
past events . One factor that may cause people to learn less from experience
than they should is the hindsight bias (Fischhoff 1 975) or the "I knew it all
along" phenomenon. An excellent review of the research on hindsight is
offered by Hawkins & Hastie ( 1 990). They conclude that the hindsight
phenomenon extends to the judgments of experts in nonlaboratory settings .
For other reasons why expertise may not lead to better assessments , see
Camerer & Johnson ( 1 9 9 1 ) .
Next w e examine i n more detail an area o f research that draws upon and
combines findings from studies both of preferences and of judgments about
uncertain events, namely how people make decisions under risk and un­
certainty.

DECISIONS UNDER RISK AND UNCERTAINTY
The study of how people make decisions that involve tradeoffs between the
desirability of consequences and the likelihood of consequences--e. g. choice
among gambles-continues to be one of the most active areas of decision
research. Not only do responses to gambles provide insight into basic psycho­
logical processes of judgment and choice, but understanding decision-making

under uncertainty and risk has direct relevance for improving decisions in
business and public policy. Increasingly , as might be expected, decisions
under risk are seen as being sensitive to the same types of context and task
variables described above for preferences among multi-attribute alternatives
and for the assessment of uncertainties . In the following sections, we consider
research on generalizations of expected-utility models (how values depend
upon the specific set of available options and interactions between payoffs and
probabilities), on responses to repeated-play gambles, and on ambiguity and
risky choice.

Generalizations of Expected- Utility Models
Expected-utility (EU) theory (von Neuman & Morgenstern 1 947) has long
been the standard model for decisions under risk, although the descriptive
validity of the expected-utility model has also long been questioned. An
economist , Mark Machina, recently summarized risky-decision research by
noting that "choice under uncertainty is a field in flux" (Machina 1 987: 1 2 1 ) .
W e agree; evidence o f violations o f the standard E U model has accumulated
to the point that numerous theorists have offered alternatives to the standard
EU model. The goal has been to model risky decisions in ways that will allow
the tradeoffs between probabilities and values to reflect contextual factors .
One approach has been to develop generalizations of the expected-utility
model . Decision weights that may not be additive over outcomes, for ex­
ample, are used in place of linear probabilities. Another type of generalization
allows the value of an outcome of a gamble to differ depending on the specific
gamble of which it is a part (Becker & Sarin 1 987). A related idea is that the
value placed on the outcome of one gamble depends on the outcome that
would have been received if a second gamble had been chosen and the same
random event had occurred-i.e. the notion of regret (Bell 1 982; Loomes &
Sugden 1 987). Regret is a good example of a contextual factor that may effect
decisions.
Many of the proposed generalizations of EU also reflect a weakening of the
view that the disentanglement of belief and value is essential to rational
decision-making (Shafer 1 986). For example, one can weight the probabilities
(decision weights) of outcomes by the rank order of the attractiveness of the
outcomes. The lowest-ranked, least-attractive outcomes, for instance, might
be given relatively greater weight (Quiggin 1 982; Segal 1 989). One could also .
allow decision weights to differ for gain outcomes and loss outcomes
(Einhorn & Hogarth 1 986a). Weber et al ( 1 992) extend the idea of sign­
dependent decision weights to judgments of the riskiness of gambles as well
as to attractiveness judgments.
Another generalization of the expected-utility model allows the decision
weights assigned to the outcomes to vary as a function of both the rank and

the sign of the payoffs . Luce ( 1 990; Luce & Fishburn 1 99 1 ) and Tversky &
Kahneman ( 1 990) propose models with this property . In the Luce model , a
framing or "plausible accounting" assumption is that gambles that have a
mixture of gains and losses are decomposed into two subgambles, one

another con si sting of
outcomes and null consequences. Within the gain and loss subgambles,
respectively, the decision weights are rank dependent. The decision weights
consisting of gain outcomes and null consequences and

loss

for the gain and loss consequences are allowed to differ.
Recently,

Tversky & Kahneman ( 1 990) have offered a generalization of

prospect theory that also allows for different decision weights for gains and

losses . The decision weights are also rank dependent based upon the marginal
contributions of the events ordered by payoffs . The new theory, called

Cumulative Prospect Theory , is extended to cover both probabilistic and
uncertain (ambiguous probability) gambles. Cumulative Prospect Theory re­
tains the major features of the original

versions of prospect theory. In particu ­

lar, the prediction of reflection of risk attitudes for gains and losses is
pre served ;

risk aversion and risk seeking ate predicted , respectively , for gains
. 5 . However, for small
probabilities---e. g . p < . I-the prediction is for risk seeking for gains and
and losses of moderate or high probability--e . g . p >

risk aversion for losses. These risk attitude predictions are derived from the

principles of (a) diminishing sensitivity for both value functions (from a
reference point) and weighting functions (from certainty and impossible
events)

and (b) loss aversion.

The predictive power of rank- and sign-dependent models is impressive;

however, Tversky & Kahneman note that formal models of the valuation of
risky options are at best approximate and incomplete , arguing that "choice is a
constructive

and contingent process. When faced with a complex decision

problem, people employ a variety of heuristic procedures in order to simplify
the representation and the evaluation of prospects . The heuristics of choice do

not readily lend themselves to formal analysi s , because their application is
contingent on the method of elicitation, the formulation of the problem and
the context of choice" (p. 36). While we agree with their assessment that
judgment and choice are often con structive and characterized by contingent
usage of heuristics, we believe that the contingent use of heuristics is more

to formal analyses than implied above (e. g . see Payne et aI 1988).
EU much beyond those already
proposed represent the best direction for theory development in the attempt to
understand risky decision behavior (Camerer 1 989)? One suggestion, offered
by Shafir et al ( 1989), is to combine the absolute approach of expectation

To what extent do generalizations of

models , in which the attractiveness of a gamble is assumed to be independent
of other alternatives, with a comparative approach, in which the attractiveness
of a gamble depends on the alternatives to which it is compared . Another

suggestion, offered by Lopes ( 1 987; Schneider & Lopes 1 986) , is to move
away from expectation models of decisions to models that more directly
reflect the multiple and conflicting goals that people may have in solving risky
decision problems. Some suggested goals are maximizing security, maximiz­
ing potential gain, and maximizing the probability of coming out ahead . The
Lopes concept of multiple goals is similar in spirit to the early idea of
characterizing gambles by risk dimensions rather than moments (Slovic &
Lichtenstein 1 968; also see Aschenbrenner 1 984 for a test of dimensional vs
moment-based explanations of risky decisions).

Repeated-Play Gambles
Whether people respond differently to gambles involving a single play versus
repeated-play gambles may be related to the notion that multiple goals can
underlie risky choice. People may pay attention to different goals depending
on how often a gamble will be played (Lopes 1 98 1 ) or whether the decision
involves a single individual or a group of comparable individuals (Redelmeir
& Tversky 1 990) . Recent work provides substantial empirical support for the
need to distinguish between risky-choice behavior for unique and repeated
gambles (Keren & Wagenaar 1 987; Joag et al 1 990) . Wedell & Bockenholt
( 1 990), for example, show that the frequency of preference reversals is less
under repeated-play conditions . They offer an interpretation of the effects of
multiple plays that emphasizes the concept of an aspiration level in both
choice and pricing. An interesting connection exists between the repeated
play of gambles and the question of when people will reason statistically . As
suggested by Kahneman & Lovallo (1992), framing an apparently unique
risky decision as part of a much larger set of risky choices may lead to
behavior more in line with a considered tradeoff of beliefs and values.

Ambiguity and Risky Choice
In most discussions of decision-making under risk, it is assumed that the
probabilities representing the decision-maker' s uncertainties about events are
well specified. However, there is often ambiguity concerning the probabilities
of events . That is, a decision-maker might tell you that his or her best guess is
that the probability of an event is .4, but he or she may also tell you that the
estimate is shaky. While the standard theory of subjective expected utility
prescribes that an "expected probability" adequately represents the in­
dividual' s uncertainty about an event, it is clear that people respond dif­
ferently to decisions under uncertainty as a function of the uncertainty about
uncertainties, even when the expectations of the probabilities are the same.
Thus , the presence or absence of ambiguity about the probabilities may
represent an important context variable affecting risky decisions . As iIIus-

PAYNE ET AL

trated by the classic Ensberg paradox (Ensberg 1 96 1 ) and subsequent ex­
perimental results, individual choices often exhibit an aversion to ambiguity,
at least when the probabilities of the events are moderate (e.g . . 5) or larger.
Frisch & Baron ( 1 988) suggest a number of reasons why it may be reasonable
for an individual to show ambiguity aversion. Ambiguity seeking , however,
can occur for lower-probability events (Curley & Yates 1 989), a result
suggested by Ensberg .
A number of researchers have investigated ambiguity and risky decisions
during the period under review (Curley & Yates 1985, 1 989; Curley et al
1 986; Einhorn & Hogarth 1985; Frisch & Baron 1988; Gardenfors & Sahlin
1 983; Hogarth & Einhorn 1 990; Hogarth & Kunreuther 1 985; Kahn & Sarin
1 988). This interest reflects both a theoretical concern with the limits of the
standard expected-utility model and a recognition that ambiguity is a preva­
lent feature of real-world decision problems. Ritov & Baron ( 1 990), for
example, suggest that ambiguity lowers the willingness to vaccinate a child
against potentially deadly diseases.
Einhorn & Hogarth ( 1 985) offer a model of how people adjust probabilities
under ambiguity to reflect what might be imagined. Imagination is likened to
a mental s imulation process. The adjustment is from an anchor that

corre­

sponds to an initial estimate of the probability of an event. The size of the
adjustment depends on the amount of ambiguity as well as on the value of the
initial probability. Hogarth & Kunreuther ( 1 985, 1 989) use the ambiguity
model as a basis for understanding when , and at what prices , insurance
coverage for different uncertainties will be offered. Hogarth & Einhorn
( 1990) also propose a model of how people assess decision weights in
evaluating risky options which is based upon their model for ambiguous
probabilities. The adjustment of decision weights in the Hogarth & Einhorn
model is affected by the size as well as the sign of the payoffs, as is the case
for several of the generalizations of expected utility noted above .
Curley et al ( 1 986) provide evidence that concern about the evaluation of
one's decisions by others is at least a partial explanation for ambiguity
avoidance. In the standard Ellsberg task , where there is one urn containing 50
red balls and 50 black balls and another urn containing 1 00 red and black balls
in unknown proportions , the preference for a bet based on the known 50:50
urn is enhanced by the anticipation that the contents of the unknown urn will
be shown to others .
Heath & Tversky ( 1 99 1 ) have extended the study of ambiguity to domains
where the judged probabilities are based on knowledge rather than chance .
They argue that the willingness to bet on an uncertain event \depends on one' s
feelings of knowledge o r competence in a given context, a s well a s o n the
estimated likelihood of that event and the precision of that estimate. In
support of their idea, they report that subjects who felt knowledgeable about a

domain (e.g. politics) were more likely to prefer a bet based on a judged
probability event than on a matched lottery (chance) bet. The chance bet was
preferred over a matched judgmental bet in content domains in which one felt
less competent. Heath & Tversky conclude that the effect of knowledge or
competence far outweighs the contribution of ambiguity or vagueness in
understanding how beliefs and preferences interact in determining risky de­
cisions. In other words , factors beyond simple beliefs about the likelihoods of
events and values (e.g. feelings of competence) may determine risk-taking
behavior.
The research outlined above suggests a variety of methods individuals may
use to construct probability assessments or make decisions when confronting
ambiguity. How individuals use these methods in a contingent fashion has not
been investigated; however, given the prevalence of contingent-strategy usage
in the areas reviewed thus far, examining how individuals respond con­
tingently to ambiguity would be a fertile area for future research.

FRAMEWORKS FOR CONTINGENT-DECISION
BEHAVIOR
We have now reviewed research on preferences , judgments of beliefs about
uncertain events, and risky decision-making. In all cases, we have seen
substantial evidence for contingent use of multiple strategies for dealing with
such decision tasks. Awareness of the highly contingent nature of decision
behavior has led several researchers to propose frameworks within which
constructive decision behavior could be understood. Some of these frame­
works emphasize the cognitive costs and benefits of the various strategies
people might use in constructing preferences and beliefs . In that regard , such
frameworks are direct extensions of the bounded-rationality concept. Other
frameworks emphasize more perceptual processes of problem representation ,
formulation, or framing that determine which strategies, values , and beliefs
will be used to solve a particular problem.

Cost/Benefit Frameworks
The most frequently used approach to explaining contingent decision behavior
assumes that people have available or can generate a repertoire of strategies or
heuristics for solving decision problems. The available strategies or abilities
may have been acquired through formal training (Larrick et al 1 990) or natural
experience (Kruglanski 1 989), and their availability in any given situation
will be a function of the frequency and recency of prior use (Ginossar & Trope
1 987). It is also assumed that the strategies have differing expected advan­
tages (benefits) and disadvantages (costs) . The sdection of a strategy then

PAYNE ET AL

involves the consideration of the anticipated benefits and costs of each
strategy given the specific task environment.
Beach & Mitchell and their colleagues offer one version of a cost/benefit
framework (Beach & Mitchell 1 978; Beach et al 1 986; Waller & Mitchell
1 984). Beach & Mitchell identify three broad categories of strategies: 1 .
"aided-analytic", 2 . "unaided-analytic", and 3 . "nonanalytic . " Task factors
assumed to influence strategy selection include complexity, ambiguity of
goals (values), significance of outcomes, and accountability. Recently, Beach
& Mitchell have argued that their original model is too limited and have
proposed a new model called "Image Theory" that stresses the intuitive and
automatic aspects of decision-making (Beach 1 990; Mitchell & Beach 1 990).
The emphasis in Image Theory is on noncompensatory tests of the acceptabil­
ity or compatibility of a single alternative (candidate option) with the de­
cision-maker' s values or goals (images) . They stress that individuals make
j udgments about the compatibility of an option with one's image; this is seen
as a rapid, smooth process that can be called "intuitive" decision-making. The
more analytical processes specified in the original Beach & Mitchell model
are assumed to be evoked only if there is more than one acceptable alterna­
tive.
A comparison between analytical and intuitive decision-making is also
stressed by Hammond and his associates (Hammond et al 1 987) . They argue
that the cognitive processes (modes of thought) available to a decision-maker
can be seen as falling on a continuum from intuition (characterized by rapid
data processing , low cognitive control, and low awareness of processing) to
analysis (characterized by slow data processing, high cognitive control, and
high awareness of processing). Hammond et al claim that properties of the
decision task, such as whether information is presented pictorially or pre­
sented via bar graphs or numbers, lead to one mode of cognition versus
another. An important feature of their framework is the distinction they make
between the frequency and the size of judgmental errors assumed to result
from intuitive and analytical modes of thought. Analysis is viewed as leading
to fewer but larger errors than intuition. Hammond et al ( 1 987) provide a good
example of a computational error (execution of analysis) in decision-making
involving an engineer who wrote down a weight of . 8 for a cue instead of the
. 08 that he intended, thus reducing his judgmental accuracy to little better
than chance .
The Beach & Mitchell and the Hammond frameworks deal with contingent
decision processing at a fairly general level of analytic vs nonanalytic and
analytic vs intuitive modes of thought. Explaining contingent strategy selec­
tion at a more detailed information processing level has been the focus of a
series of studies by Payne et al (summarized in Payne et al 1 990a). They
investigate the costs and benefits of solving complex preferential choice

problems using specific decision strategies such as satisficing (Simon 1 955),
lexicographic choice (Tversky 1 969), elimination-by-aspects (Tversky 1 972) ,
equal weighting (Einhorn & Hogarth 1975), and more normative strategies
like additive utility. While Payne et al acknowledge the importance of factors
like decision accuracy, avoidance of conflict, and accountability in strategy
selection , they focus on the role played in strategy choice by the cognitive
effort (mental resources) required to execute a strategy in a specific task
environment (Simon 1 955 ; Russo & Dosher 1 983). Payne et al note that
different decision strategies require different amounts of computational effort
and that a measure of such cognitive effort in decision-making can be
obtained by decomposing strategies like elimination-by-aspects and weighted
adding into sets of elementary information processes (EIPs) (see O. Huber
1 989 for similar ideas). Examples of EIPs are reading an alternative' s value
on an attribute into working memory, comparing two alternatives on an
attribute, and adding the values of two attributes in working memory. BeU­
man et al ( 1 990) show that a weighted EIP model provides good predictions of
the response times and subjective effort reports associated with the use of
various decision strategies in different task environments .
By combining measures of strategy effort with measures of decision
accuracy, Johnson & Payne ( 1 985), Payne et al ( 1 988), and Payne et al
( 1990b) use simulation to show that adaptive choice of decision heuristics can
often provide reasonable effort/accuracy tradeoffs . Their studies of the
adaptiveness of actual decision behavior to changes in decision tasks , con­
texts, and goals show that people often adapt their behavior in ways that seem
reasonable given a concern for both decision effort and decision accuracy
(Payne et a1 1 988; Creyer et al 1 990) . However, Klayman & Ha ( 1 987) argue
that people may not always be as adaptive to task demands as they should be.
In the case of hypothesis testing, for instance, Klayman & Ha argue that
people generally rely on a "positive test strategy" that often works very well,
but can lead to systematic errors or inefficiencies. Overgeneralizing the
applicability of reasonable heuristics is perhaps a typical failure of adaptivity
(Baron 1 988). Klayman & Ha ( 1 987), like Tversky & Kahneman ( 1 986),
suggest that the use of more optimal strategies may require that the rela­
tionships between task variables and strategy performance be highly transpar­
ent.
Most current attempts to explain contingent or constructive decision be­
havior focus on goals and strategies that the decision-maker brings to the task,
which are assumed to interact with task structure and context in determining
strategy use. However, people can decide how to decide not only at the
beginning of a decision episode but also as they learn more about a problem in
the course of solving it. That is, people can be opportunistic (data driven) as
well as top-down (goal driven) (Hayes-Roth and Hayes-Roth 1 979). One

1 14

PAYNE ET AL

argument for a more opportunistic view of strategy use is that people may
store procedures for decision-making in terms of simple processing operations
such as comparison processes rather than in the form of more complete
strategies like elimination-by-aspects (Bettman & Park 1 980; B iehal & Chak­
ravarti 1 986) . It has been suggested that opportunistic or constructive pro­
cesses will be more likely to be used as deciSIon problems become more
complex or stressful (Klein & Yadav 1 989). Evidence that people scan
alternatives in a more nonsystematic fashion under stress, and therefore may
be more data driven, is provided by Keinan ( 1 987). Information display
factors may also impact the degree of bottom-up vs top-down processing
(Jarvenpaa 1 990) .

Perceptual Frameworks
As reviewed above , some of the most dramatic demonstrations of the lack of
invariance in human decision behavior have come from studies of framing
effects (Tversky & Kahneman 1 986) . Tversky & Kahneman acknowledge
that contingent processing in decision-making can sometimes be explained in
terms of mental effort; however, they prefer to trace contingent decision
behavior to more basic perceptual principles governing the formulation or
representation of decision problems. Examples of such principles include the
diminishing sensitivity of values and decision weights and the coding of
outcomes from a reference point discussed earlier. Tversky & Kahneman
stress that "in the persistence of their appeal , framing effects resemble visual
illusion more than computational errors" (Tversky & Kahneman 1 986:S260) .
Another approach to the issue of multiple decision strategy use which
blends cost/benefit and perceptual approaches has been offered by Montgom­
ery and his associates (Lindberg et a1 1 989; Montgomery 1983; Montgomery
& Svenson 1 983). As noted earlier, Montgomery sees decision-making as
series of structuring and restructuring activities. The various compensatory
and noncompensatory decision rules like elimination-by-aspects are seen as
operators used in the restructuring of the decision problem. Thus, like Tver­
sky & Kahneman , Montgomery emphasizes problem formulation or represen­
tation activities in his account of the constructive nature of decision behavior.
Montgomery also emphasizes the justifiability of the decision process as a
goal of the decision-maker.
A key distinction between the perceptual perspective and that offered by the
cost/benefit approach concerns the role of incentives in determining decision
behavior. If the only factors influencing decision behavior were a concern
with accuracy and a concern for decision effort, then one would expect that
violations of rational decision principles could be eliminated by proper in­
centives. For example , many economists continue to argue that the lack of
incentives may cause individuals to perform suboptimally (e.g. Harrison

<-----Page 28----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

1 989) . Further, as was found by Creyer et al ( 1 990) , the processes used in
decision-making should become more consistent with normative models as
incentives are increased. However, errors in preferential choice and probabi­
listic reasoning persist even in the presence of monetary payoffs (Grether &
Plott 1 979; Tversky & Kahneman 1 983) . Even a casual view of decision­
making in the real world suggests that reasoning errors sometimes occur in
important decisions. Consequently, much recent research has examined the
effects of incentives on decision behavior, leading to a view that incentives
can both help and hinder decision performance (Ashton 1 992; Berg & Dick­
haut 1 990; Hogarth et al 1 99 1 ).
As noted by Tversky & Kahneman ( 1 986), incentives do not work by
magic . Generally, what incentives do is prolong deliberation or attention to a
problem; people generally work harder on more important problems. More
effort is generally believed to lead to better performance. However, as
reported in Paese & Sniezek ( 199 1 ) , increased effort may lead to increased
confidence in judgment without accompanying increases in accuracy. Devot­
ing more effort to using a flawed decision strategy can lead to poorer
performance (Arkes et al 1 986).
For incentives to change decision strategies and increase performance,
several conditions seem necessary. First, one must believe that one's current
decision strategy is insufficient in terms of desired accuracy (i .e. if you don't
think it's broken , you won't fix it) . Failure to adapt may result from over­
confidence in assessing the likelihood that a current strategy will lead to a
successful outcome. In many decision environments feedback is often not
sufficient to sway such assessments (Einhorn 1 980). A related factor that may
cause people to overestimate the quality of their current judgments is the
hindsight bias. A failure to adapt can also result from difficulty in properly
assessing the task environment and the relationship between the environment
and the strategy. For example, the degree of intercorrelation among cues or
attributes affects the accuracy of heuristics, yet correlations are difficult to
estimate (Alloy & Tabachnik 1 984).
Second, for incentives to lead to a strategy shift, a better strategy must be
available . If one doesn't know what else to do, a belief that one is stuck with a
flawed strategy may lead to a panic response under high incentives (Janis
1 989) . There is evidence that better strategies are sometimes unavailable. For
example , several effective memory strategies for encoding and retrieval are
not possessed by young children (John & Cole 1 986) . Deficits in strategy
knowledge for solving certain classes of problems have recently been ex­
amined by Kaplan & Simon ( 1 990). Brehmer ( 1 990) makes the related point
that knowledge of suboptimality in the process of solving a complex and
dynamic decision problem is not a primary perceptual datum. Instead, "it is an
inference based on a normative model of the task, and, if the decision-maker

<-----Page 29----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

1 16

PAYNE ET AL

does not have a well-developed model of the task, the possibility of doing
better will not be detected" (Brehmer 1990:267). Thus, it is certainly possible
that better decision strategies for some situation are not known by most
decision-makers . On a more positive note , however, recent work by Nisbett
& Fong and their colleagues has shown that the teaching of statistical and
decision principles increases the likelihood of using statistical and decision
theoretic reasoning processes (Fong et al 1986; Larrick et al 1990).
Third, one must believe that one is capable of executing the new, hopefully
more optimal strategy. For complex problems there may be a constraint on
which strategies are believed to be feasible. In the words of Simon ( 198 1 ) ,
"what a person cannot d o h e will not do, n o matter how much he wants to do
it" (p . 36) . More generally, incentive effects can be seen as one more question
concerning the conflicting goals (i .e. accuracy, effort minimization, conflict
avoidance, and justifiability) that a decision-maker might have in constructing
a solution to a decision problem.

Integrating the Cost/Benefit and Perceptual Frameworks
The perceptual framework clearly complements the cost/benefit framework,
because it is difficult to see how simple wording changes alone (e . g . as seen
in "lives saved" versus "lives lost" in Tversky & Kahneman 1 98 1 ) change
either cognitive effort or the desire for accuracy . On the other hand , it is not
clear how the perceptual framework would handle contingent behavior due to
the number of alternatives, for example, yet that phenomenon fits nicely into
a cost/benefit framework. There are opportunities to integrate cost/benefit and
perceptual frameworks. For example, Tversky & Kahneman ( 1 990) suggest
that the framing process is governed by such rules of mental economy (effort
saving) as the general tendency to accept the problem as given and the
segregation of the decision problem at hand from its broader context. In
addition, during the course of constructing a heuristic, decision-makers may
cycle between noticing aspects or characteristics of the choice set (e . g .
extreme values across alternatives) and deciding how t o exploit those aspects .
Perceptual frameworks may be most relevant for the noticing process, where­
as cost/benefit notions may be more relevant for determining what to do to
take advantage of what has been noticed. A third opportunity for integrating
the two frameworks would be to consider that individuals' assessments of
costs and benefits for any heuristic may be greatly influenced by perceptual
concerns such as how information is presented or how the problem is framed.
The concepts of mUltiple strategies and constructive decision-making also
provide a point of integration between decision research and other areas of
psychology . For example, Weber et al ( 1 99 1 ) suggest that research on
memory processes can shed light on the possible decay, distortion , or confu­
sion of intermediate computations in the execution (implementation) of a

<-----Page 30----->BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

1 17

decision strategy. They also suggest that the idea of parallel processing in
memory may require a rethinking of our measures of decision effort. Another
area of integration is between the concept of decision strategies and mood or
affect (Isen 1 987; Mano 1 992) . Mano , for instance, shows that people employ
simpler strategies when under distress.

APPLICATIONS
Behavioral decision research is often motivated by the desire to improve the
decision-making process. Several approaches to improving decisions are
identifiable in the literature. Some stress changes in the task environment
facing the decision-maker. For example, the fact that decision behavior is
often descriptively variant (i.e. information presentation matters) suggests
that decisions might be improved through rather straightforward, inexpensive
changes to the information environments in which individuals make judg­
ments and choices.
Other approaches, such as decision analysis, stress changes in the capacity
of the decision-maker for dealing with decision tasks . The concept of in­
formation-processing limits on decision behavior, for instance , suggests that
tasks might be restructured (decomposed) to make required judgments and
choices easier for the decision-maker and hopefully more accurate . Decision
analysts also often try to improve directly the capacity of a decision-maker to
cope with complex decisions through the provision of decision aids such as
computer-based decision support systems and through training in statistical
and decision-theoretic reasoning. Of course, combinations of improvements
in information provision, decomposition of tasks , decision aids, and training
are possible.
The approaches to aiding decision mentioned above can be thought of as
methods for improving the match between task and person. An alternative
approach is to replace the computations or processing done in the head with an
automated decision procedure (a formula or model). Finally, when societal
decisions (e.g. whether to improve some aspect of the environment at some
cost to the public) affect, or depend upon, the preferences of others , providing
decision-makers with better information on the values and beliefs of other
people should also improve the decision process (see Lichtenstein et al 1 990,
for a discussion of some of the dilemmas facing a societal decision-maker) .

Changing Information Environments to Aid Decisions .
The great adaptability of human decision behavior makes it possible to
improve decisions by improving the information environments in which
decisions are made . For example, the processing of current information can
be made cognitively easier-without making more information available.

That is, the processability of currently available information can be improved
(Russo 1 977).
In a now classic study , Russo ( 1 977) showed that providing a rank-ordered
list of unit-price information at the point of purchase resulted in shifts in
purchasing patterns and increased cost savings for consumers . In a recent
extension of that study, Russo et al ( 1986) found that using an organized
display to provide nutritional information on proteins, minerals, and vitamins
had little impact on consumer behavior; but when the nutritional information
concerned negative attributes such as sodium, sugar, and calories , the orga­
nized information display had an impact. Russo et al offer a costlbenefit
explanation of this difference in results: Most consumers were not concerned
about deficiencies in vitamins , but they were concerned about getting too
much sodium, sugar, and calories. The importance of improved formats is
also borne out in studies of hazard-warning labels on household products
(Viscusi et al 1 986) and the provision of information on radon in homes
(Smith et al 1 988).
The processability of information depends on the congruence between (a)
the format and organization of information and (b) the type of processing
(judgment) to be done (Bettman et al 1986). There are two basic approaches
to congruence. The first, a reactive approach, is to attempt to determine how
decision-makers are currently processing information and to make that pro­
cessing easier. Typical displays of information in Consumer Reports illustrate
this approach. Consumers would generally like to compare information on
several attributes across several alternatives. By providing matrix displays of
such information and by using comparative rating scales, Consumer Reports
makes any comparison process easier. A second and more proactive approach
is to determine the types of processing one wishes to encourage and then
design formats that facilitate such processing. The Russo unit-price study is
an example of this approach if one wanted to encourage comparisons based
upon unit price, since the rank-ordered list contained only that information for
the various brands. This latter approach may be particularly relevant for
public policy decision-makers , although obvious issues arise concerning the
degree to which processing should be guided.

Decision Analysis
Decision analysis is a set of methods and procedures designed to help people
structure and simplify the task of making complex , confusing, and stressful
decisions. Decision analysis depends heavily on human assessments of beliefs
and/or preferences as inputs . Increasingly, decision analysis as a field of
research and practice is sensitive to the contingent nature of decision be­
havior. Behavioral research is causing decision theorists to revise both models
and procedures (Watson & Buede 1987; von Winterfeldt & Edwards 1986) .

BEHAVIORAL DECISION RESEARCH

Bell ( 1 985), for example, suggests that psychological factors such as the
possibility of disappointment or regret might well be included in formal
decision analyses. Instead of the alternative-focused thinking that is used in
most decision problems , Keeney ( 1 988) suggests that people would be better
served by a more value-focused approach, in which one asks whether one
could do better in achieving one's values than is suggested by the most readily
apparent alternatives. Keller & Ho ( 1 988) offer suggestions for how new
alternatives might be constructed.
As noted above, a key feature of decision analysis is the incorporation of
human beliefs and preferences into the analysis. The essential idea is to
provide a structure by means of which a complex decision problem may be
decomposed into a series of cognitively simpler judgments. Research con­
tinues on how decomposition of judgments might improve decisions (Henrion
et al 1 992; MacGregor et al 1 988; Ravinder et al 1 988); however, the
constructive nature of even the simplest tradeoff and belief judgments raises
questions regarding the validity of the subjective inputs into decision analy­
ses. Consequently, a variety of new methods have been proposed for eliciting
the beliefs and values necessary to operationalize decision models . These new
methods are designed to avoid some of the context factors influencing pro­
bability and preference assessments . For instance , the most common pro­
cedures for assessing von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions involve the
matching of a sure-thing option with a gamble. This procedure is subject to
the so-called certainty effect, in which outcomes that occur with certainty are
given more weight. McCord & de Neufville ( 1 986) have suggested a utility­
assessment method designed to reduce this effect that involves the comparison
of one gamble against a second gamble. Another approach commonly sug­
gested for dealing with contingent judgments is sensitivity analysis, in which
utility is measured in several ways and any discrepancies are explicitly
reconciled by the decision-maker (von Winterfeldt & Edwards 1 986) . One of
the major advantages of the new computer-based packages for decision
analysis is the ease with which such sensitivity analysis can be conducted.
Finally, Slovic et al ( 1 988) discuss how a deeper understanding of task and
context effects could help us deliberately to manage our own preferences
more effectively, a proactive approach to contingent decision behavior.

Formulas or Models Versus Heads
The focus of our review so far has been on understanding how a decision­
maker combines or processes information mentally . Alternatively , a decision­
maker could use a mathematical, statistical, or mechanical procedure to
combine the information when asked to make a judgment or choice. The
process of combining information in the head is often called clinical judg-

1 20

PAYNE ET AL

ment. The use of a formula or model to combine information may involve the
automation of a human judge' s decision rules, or it may reflect empirically
established relations between data and the outcomes of interest-i .e. an
actuarial approach (Dawes et al 1 989). Numerous studies have shown that
j udgments are generally better if made using a formula (Dawes et al 1 989;
K leinmuntz 1 990) , and organizations do use formulas instead of clinical
judgment for some decision problems. The use of statistical judgment in place
of clinical is more the exception than the rule, however. Consequently, recent
research has emphasized two questions . First, what factors influence the use
of an automated decision procedure? Second, how can models and humans
complement rather than compete with one another as decision systems?
Dawes et al ( 1 989) suggest several reasons why we still use our heads
instead of formulas: lack of familiarity with the evidence showing the benefits
of formulas , a belief that the evidence does not apply to case-by-case de­
cisions, and an inflated belief in the accuracy of clinical judgment. Klein­
muntz ( 1 990) offers several other reasons why formulas are not often used,
including the error possibilities in the execution of a formula (Hammond et al
1987) . Arkes et al ( 1 986) show empirically that a simple decision formula was
used less in solving a probabilistic judgment task when incentives for per­
formance existed, when outcome feedback was available , and when people
felt themselves to have more domain expertise . Under the conditions of
incentives, feedback , and felt expertise, people frequently shift strategies,
apparently in the hope that they will be able to beat the odds inherent in the
probabilistic nature of the judgment task.
Einhorn ( 1 986) suggests that people generally find it difficult to accept
some level of explicit error associated with the use of a decision rule, even
though the use of the statistical rule would lead to fewer overall errors in
prediction. Einhorn ( 1 986) also suggests that the degree to which one decides
to use a statistical formula depends on whether one believes the phenomenon
being predicted is inherently random (a formula is more likely) or systematic
in nature; and as Einhorn notes, people tend to believe even random events are
systematic (see also Gilovich et al 1 985; Lopes & Oden 1 987) . Similarly,
Kahneman & Tversky ( 1 982) hypothesize that the laws of probability are
more likely to be accepted (and used) when uncertainty is attributed to the
external world and a distributional mode of reasoning is adopted. Given the
contingent nature of probabilistic reasoning, one might be able to frame
problems as being more external and distributional and thus increase the
acceptability of formal statistical and decision models.
An old idea that has received much recent emphasis is to combine the use of
formulas and judgment in the head. One approach is to use experts to measure
the inputs to a model but to combine the subjective inputs mechanically (e . g .
Libby & Libby 1 989). A t a more aggregated level, a judgment from a model

and an intuitive judgment might b e integrated i n several ways. The model
might be used as one input to be combined with other information known to
the decision-maker (Peterson & Pitz 1 986). The model could also be used as a
baseline judgment, which should only be modified by the judge in special
cases. Finally, the judgment by formula and the judgment in the head might
be aggregated using another formula� .g. 50% human judgment and 50%
model (Blattberg & Hoch 1 990).

The Measurement of Values
The measurement of human values (preferences) has practical significance in
a number of different domains. Marketing, for example, has long been
concerned with understanding and predicting the preferences of consumers in
the hope that such understanding will lead to better managerial decisions
(Green & Srinivasan 1 990) . Sophisticated methods of measuring preferences
are also being used to guide decisions in a variety of nontraditional areas , such
as medicine, law , and public policy (Keeney et al 1 990). For example , the
method of contingent valuation (CVM) is being used to assess the value of
environmental goods (Cummings et a1 1 986; Fischhoff & Furby 1 988; Mitch­
ell & Carson 1 989) both to guide policy decisions about protection of the
environment and to establish liability in the case of damages to the environ­
ment. A contingent valuation (CY) study typically involves the assessment of
tradeoffs by a large sample of respondents . Essentially, CY studies assess
preferences by asking a respondent to match an option defined by an environ­
mental good (level of air quality) at a clearly specified level ( 1 ) and a wealth
level ( 1 ) against a second option defined by an environmental good at a
specified second (more preferred) level (2) and an alternative (less prefcrred)
wealth level (2) . In the typical willingness-to-pay (WTP) task, the respondent
is asked to specify an amount by which he/she would be willing to reduce
his/her current wealth level-i . e . move down from level I to level 2-in order
to gain an environmental improvement-a move up from level I to level 2. A
subject of much practical import is the extent to which the assessed value of a
public good (e. g . clean air) is contingent on a host of procedural variables
(such as the order in which questions are asked; whether one matches by
considering a potential gain or a potential loss in the level of a public good; or
whether the event to be assessed---environmental damage-may occur or has
already occurred) (Kahneman & Knetsch 1 992; Schulze & McClelland 1990) .
The constructive nature of human preferences , particularly in domains
where people do not commonly make tradeoff decisions, raises the question
of the extent to which any technique such as CY creates values as much as it
reveals them. Fischhoff & Furby ( 1 988) offer one response to the labile
(constructive) nature of values that emphasizes a careful provision of infor­
mation to the respondent. Gregory & McDaniels ( 1 987) suggest another

<-----Page 35----->Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1992.43:87-131. Downloaded from arjournals.annualreviews.org

PAYNE ET AL

approach that involves the explicit construction of values using multi-attribute
decision analysis. On the other hand, in the spirit of decision theory, one
should also ask whether there is an alternative to the measurement, however
flawed, of individual values as input to policy decisions. Using an un­
structured intuitive approach to judge the value of some environmental good
may be even more biased. Ignoring the value of an environmental good
because it is difficult to measure is a questionable response . We hope that
increased understanding of the details of procedural and descriptive variance
can lead to the development of better value assessment tools .

CONCLUSION
Behavioral decision research has made much progress between 1 983 and
1 99 1 . We now better understand and appreciate the constructive nature of
decision behavior. Behavioral decision research is also being used in­
creasingly to inform a variety of applied areas of study , including health ,
business, and public policy.
The highly contingent nature of decision behavior both poses problems
(costs) and creates opportunities (benefits) for decision researchers . At the
theoretical level, the fact that decision processes are not invariant across task
environments complicates the search for a small set of underlying principles
(models) that can describe behavior. In addition, as noted by Hogarth &
Einhorn ( 199 1 ) , the importance and pervasiveness of task and context effects
may create a view of decision research as a fragmented and chaotic field .
Nonetheless, as researchers ask questions about the conditions under which
different types of information and different decision processes are likely to be
used, generalizations about decision behavior seem to be emerging. Well
established, for example, are the effects of task complexity on decision
strategy use , the importance of the gain-vs-Ioss distinction in both risky and
riskless preference, and the prevalence of tne anchoring and adjustment
process in judgment. In addition , phenomena like loss aversion suggest that
general principles of value can be discovered . Thus, thc constructivist view
does not imply that there is no reflection of underlying beliefs and values in
generating a decision.
Also on the theoretical level, the need to predict and explain the con­
structive aspects of decision behavior should contribute to a greater integra­
tion of decision research with other areas of psychology . For example, Norm
Theory , which emphasizes context as a factor in making decisions (Kahne­
man & Miller 1986) , clearly depends on cognitive psychology and an un­
derstanding of how memory is structured and operates. Similarly, Ginossar &
Trope ( 1 987) stress that the strategies used for assessing beliefs will depend
on the same cognitive factors that influence use of procedural knowledge in

other task domains. Finally, the importance of accountability, justifiability,
and argument-based reasoning in decision-making helps reinforce the long­
standing connections between decision research and social/organizational
psychology.
The constructive and contingent nature of decision behavior has important
implications at the level of application as well . We have summarized some of
those implications for the design of information environments , the practice of
decision analysis, thc design of combined judgment/formula decision sys­
tems, and the measurement of values. Behavioral decision research continues
to reflect a rich interplay between basic and applied disciplines and between
descriptive and prescriptive concerns.
