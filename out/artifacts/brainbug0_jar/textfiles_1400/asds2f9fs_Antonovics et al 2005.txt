Abstract
The earnings of both women and blacks have consistently lagged behind those of
white men. Empirically determining whether these differences arise because of discrimination is extremely difficult, and distinguishing between the various theories of
discrimination is harder still. This paper builds on the emerging experimental literature on discrimination and explores the use of a high-stakes game environment to reveal
patterns of discrimination. To this end, we use data from the television game show,
The Weakest Link, to determine whether contestants discriminate on the basis of race
and gender and, if so, which theory of discrimination best explains their behavior. Our
results suggest no evidence of discriminatory voting patterns by males against females
or by whites against blacks. In contrast, we find that in the early rounds of the game
women appear to discriminate against men. We test three competing theories for the
voting behavior of women: preference-based discrimination, statistical discrimination
and strategic discrimination. We find only preference-based discrimination to be consistent with the observed voting patterns.

Introduction

The earnings of both women and blacks have consistently lagged behind those of white
men. Empirically determining whether these differences arise because of discrimination is
extremely difficult, and distinguishing between the various theories of discrimination is harder
still. As a result, researchers have begun to look outside of labor markets to develop a
better understanding of whether and why individuals discriminate. This paper builds on
the emerging experimental literature on discrimination and explores the use of a high-stakes
game environment to reveal patterns of discrimination. To this end, we use data from the
television game show The Weakest Link to determine whether contestants discriminate on
the basis of race and gender and, if so, which theory of discrimination best explains their
behavior.
A number of existing papers analyze contestant behavior on television game shows in order
to draw inferences about behavior in more policy-relevant settings.1 The benefit of this type
of analysis is twofold. First, in many situations, the strategic environment of game shows
generates data that can be used to answer questions that cannot be easily addressed with data
from more traditional settings. This is particularly relevant in the context of labor market
discrimination where economists have had only limited success at distinguishing between the
various theories of discrimination using standard data. Second, the stakes are much larger on
game shows than in laboratory experiments and these stakes may influence both the extent
and nature of discrimination. For example, Ball and Eckel (2003) find that favoritism towards
members of “high status” groups in ultimatum games is sensitive to the dollar value of the
prize being split.
The principle feature of The Weakest Link that enables us to study discrimination is the
fact that players have multiple opportunities to cast votes against their fellow contestants in
order to remove them from the game. As a result, we are able to examine whether race and
gender play a role in determining voting patters. In addition, we are aided by the fact that
the data from the show provide excellent controls for individual ability. This is important
since one of the principle difficulties in establishing the presence of discrimination is that it
is almost impossible to determine whether unequal outcomes arise because of discrimination
or because of unobservable race and gender differences in productivity. However, in The
Weakest Link we observe the same explicit measure of individual ability–the percentage of

<-----Page 2----->questions answered correctly2 – that is observed by the contestants. Our ability to observe
a large fraction of the information that the contestants have about one another limits the
extent of the omitted variables bias problem that plagues discrimination research. However,
even if there remain important unobserved characteristics, the structure of the game allows us
to control for these omitted factors by using information on the voting patterns of the other
contestants. In particular, if we are trying to examine the factors that determine whether
player A votes against player B, we can control for the proportion of other contestants who
vote against B. In this way, we can account for other factors that are not directly included
in our data but that are relevant to the players’ voting decisions. Additionally, because data
are collected from two slightly different versions of the show, a daily show and a weekly show,
the veracity of our results can be tested against two independent samples.
The structure of the game also allows us to examine why contestants discriminate. In
particular, we are able to distinguish preference-based discrimination (in which discrimination arises because people simply do not like members of certain groups) from statistical
discrimination (in which discrimination arises because people use group identity as a proxy
for unobserved ability). In a strategic environment such as The Weakest Link, we also need
to consider a third type of discrimination: what we term “strategic discrimination.” The notion here is that in a strategic setting race and gender may serve as focal points for collusive
behavior (see, for example, Holm (2000)). A major contribution of this paper is to highlight
various methods of distinguishing between these three theories of racial discrimination.
To look for evidence of discriminatory behavior, we evaluate the voting decisions of individual players using a series of conditional logit models. A major advantage of the conditional
logit model relative to analysis of the total votes cast against a particular group is that it
allows us to consider interactions between the characteristics of the individuals doing the
voting and the characteristics of those receiving the votes. Thus, for example, one can examine whether men are more likely to vote against women and whether women are more
likely to vote against men. The results reveal no evidence of discrimination against either
women or blacks. However, we consistently find that women are substantially more likely to
vote against men in the early rounds of the game, even after controlling for a broad set of
performance measures. That is, based on these findings, it appears that women discriminate
against men (and in favor of women) in their voting decisions. We are able to show that
neither statistical discrimination nor strategic discrimination explains this pattern. Instead,
2 As

discussed below, the game also involves individual players’ decisions about “banking” money currently

in the pot vs. accepting the risk of losing this money to facilitate a potentially larger reward. These decisions
provide an additional dimension of information regarding player performance.

<-----Page 3----->the evidence seems broadly consistent with women simply preferring to play the game with
other women.
At first glance, these results may seem surprising as we find no discrimination against
women or blacks. However, the data reveal no significant race and gender differences in
contestants’ ability to answer questions correctly. As a result, even if statistical discrimination is a feature of the labor market, we are able to rule it out as a possible source of
discrimination in our data.3 Thus, given that we find no evidence of preference-based discrimination or strategic discrimination against women or blacks, our results point towards
statistical discrimination as a possible explanation for the discriminatory patterns found in
other studies.4
Interestingly, the notion that women have discriminatory preferences in favor of other
women is reflected in a number of recent studies. For example, Dillingham et al. (1994)
examine the male and female voting behavior for officers in a professional association. Confirming our results, they find that men do not discriminate while women discriminate in favor
of female candidates.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant background literature and outlines the problems associated with distinguishing between different
types of discrimination. Section 3 describes the details of the game and the data that we
have collected. Section 4 shows how the game show data can be used to distinguish between
preference-based, statistical, and strategic discrimination. Section 5 shows that males and
whites do not discriminate, but that females discriminate against males in the early rounds.
Section 6 tests which of the theories of discrimination best explains female voting behavior.
Section 7 relates the game show results to the labor market and Section 8 concludes.

Previous Work on Racial Discrimination

2.1

Evidence From the Labor Market

It is not surprising that there exists an enormous literature on racial and gender discrimination in the labor market. Here we divide these studies into two groups: those that test for
evidence of discrimination and those that attempt to distinguish between different theories
of discrimination.
3A

possible exception would be the case where contestants have incorrect prior beliefs about one another’s

ability. We test for this possibility and find no evidence to support it.
4 In the labor market, statistical discrimination may arise due to group level differences in acquired skill
or labor force attachment.

4

<-----Page 4----->Although many studies look for evidence of discrimination by examining wage differences
using basic regression techniques,5 for the sake of brevity, we focus attention on audit studies
of hiring practices (i.e. Cross et al. (1990), Turner et. al (1991) and Neumark et al. (1996)).
The majority of these studies find substantial evidence of discrimination against women and
blacks in both the labor and housing markets. However, as Heckman and Siegelman (1992)
and Heckman (1998) point out, these studies may fail to overcome the omitted variables bias
that plagues standard regression techniques. In particular, the implicit assumption of audit
studies is that the auditors are identical apart from their race and gender. However, the
researcher who selects the auditors may not know or may not be able to observe all of the
characteristics that are relevant to employers. Thus, if there is any relationship between race
and gender and these unobserved components, then the differences in outcomes across these
groups may not truly represent discrimination.
Two studies which circumvent this problem are Goldin and Rouse (1997) and Bertrand
and Mullanaithan (2002). Goldin and Rouse examine whether the adoption of “screens” that
hide the identity of auditioning musicians from judges has been responsible for the increase
in the proportion of females hired at orchestras. Overall their evidence is consistent with
discrimination against female musicians, and indicates that the use of the screen has been
responsible for a large fraction of the increase in the number of women hired. Bertrand and
Mullanaithan (2002) conduct a field experiment in which they send out a series of resumes
to employers in the Boston and Chicago areas that are essentially identical apart from the
name at the top of the page.6 They find that the response rates on resumes with white
sounding names are 50 percent higher than those with African American names. While both
of these provocative studies find evidence of discrimination, they do not fully reveal why the
discrimination occurs.
Within the field of economics, the two leading theories of discrimination are preferencebased discrimination and statistical discrimination. In models of preference-based discrimination, employers act as if there is some cost associated with hiring workers from a particular
group, and, in equilibrium, workers from these groups are paid lower wages than workers from
other groups (Becker, 1957). In contrast, in models of statistical discrimination firms cannot
perfectly observe worker productivity, and base their assessment of worker productivity on
prior beliefs about the productivity of workers in different groups. Thus, discrimination can
arise either because of group differences in average productivity or in the quality of informa5 See

Altonji and Blank (1999) for a complete discussion of these techniques.
et al. also partially address this critique by emphasizing the use of resumes in the pre-interview

stage.

5

<-----Page 5----->tion that firms have about workers (See, for example, Phelps(1972), Arrow (1973), Aigner
and Cain (1977), Lundberg and Startz (1983), and Coate and Loury (1993)).
A handful of studies explicitly test for evidence of preference-based discrimination. Three
of these, Ashenfelter and Hannan (1986), Hellerstein et al. (2002), and Kahn and Sherer
(1988), find evidence consistent with preference-based discrimination. A smaller number of
studies test for evidence of statistical discrimination. For example, both Oettinger (1996) and
Altonji and Pierret (2001) build models of statistical discrimination in which employers slowly
learn about worker quality. Unfortunately, their models generate conflicting predictions about
what differences in black-white age-earnings profiles imply about statistical discrimination.7

2.2

Evidence From Experiments

Complementing the empirical work on labor markets are a number of papers by both psychologists and economists that look for evidence of discrimination in laboratory settings.
A common finding is that individuals display “in-group bias” in the sense that they favor
members of their own group (for example, Turner (1978), Turner and Brown (1978) and
Vaughn et al. (1981)). The evidence also suggests that group status plays a role in determining the outcome of bargaining games (Ball et al. (2001)). A number of papers also look
for evidence of statistical discrimination in laboratory settings (for example, Anderson and
Haupert (1999), Davis (1987) and Fryer et al. (2001)). These papers consistently show that
statistical discrimination tends to arise in the presence of incomplete information. Generally,
the groups defined in these settings are artificial (for example, the groups might be “green”
and “yellow”). One exception is Fershtman and Gneezy (2001) who analyze discrimination
among Ashkenazic and Eastern Jews. They find discrimination against Eastern Jews in
‘trust’ games by both Ashkenazic and Eastern Jews. Conducting a series of experiments,
Fershtman and Gneezy argue that this result is due to incorrect expectations regarding the
‘trustworthiness’ of Eastern Jews.
Simultaneous to our paper, Levitt (2003) also examines discrimination in The Weakest
Link.8 Our approaches are very different. Levitt focuses on aggregate discrimination (total
votes cast against a particular group) rather than whether discrimination against a given
group depends on the demographics of those doing the voting. For instance, we are interested
7 Oettinger

interprets the earnings gap between blacks and whites increasing over the life-cycle as evidence

for statistical discrimination while Altonji and Pierret interpret the same feature as evidence against statistical
discrimination.
8 Indeed, in late December of 2002, we both found out the other was close to completing their project.
The result was two January 2003 working papers: Levitt (2003) and Antonovics et al. (2003).

6

<-----Page 6----->in determining whether women vote against men and whether men vote against women, effects
which are not observable and may cancel each other out under Levitt’s approach.9 Levitt’s
results also differ from our own because of differences in our interpretation of the strategic
incentives in the game. In particular, Levitt’s methodology relies on two assumptions. First,
in Levitt’s paper the extent of taste-based discrimination must be the same across all rounds
of the game. However, since the implicit cost of taste-based discrimination rises as the
game progresses (because one’s probability of winning the game is higher in later rounds),
discriminatory outcomes due to taste discrimination should diminish over time. Second,
Levitt assumes that voting incentives switch as the game progresses, so that contestants first
want to vote off weak players and later want to vote off strong players. Given the structure of
the game, it is not clear that the voting incentives will truly reverse. We find that although
the incentives to vote off the weakest player diminish as the game progresses, at no point is
the strongest player ever more likely to be voted off than the weakest player.

10

An advantage

of Levitt’s work is that he has a larger sample of daily shows and analyzes discrimination
against the elderly and Hispanics.

Data and Rules of the Game

We focus on the version of The Weakest Link produced by NBC Enterprises and broadcast
in the United States. Our data come from our own video recordings of over 100 episodes.
There are two versions of The Weakest Link an hour long weekly show and a half-hour
daily show, with both versions following the same general structure. After excluding celebrity
episodes where the contestants play for charity, our data consist of 28 weekly shows and 75
daily shows.11 Each show is divided into a series of timed rounds, with the number of rounds
corresponding to the number of players: eight rounds in the weekly show and six rounds in
the daily show. Within each round, players are sequentially asked to answer general trivia
questions where correct answers translate to an increase in the prize money. The first correct
9 Additionally,

because we use a conditional logit, the characteristics of the other contestants affect the

probability of receiving a vote and the total number of predicted votes will always equal the number of votes
cast. By simply regressing the number of votes against on one’s characteristics, shows with weak contestants
will predict more votes than are actually available.
10 We also differ in the way that we treat the data. Levitt increases the precision of his estimates by pooling
data across the weekly and the daily shows and across rounds. However, given that there are substantial
differences in the amount of prize money available, the number of rounds per game, and the likely sample of
contestants in the weekly and daily shows, we chose not to pool the data in this manner.
11 The data are incomplete for some rounds due to broadcast interruptions.

<-----Page 7----->answer is worth $1,000 in the weekly show and $250 in the daily show. After a correct answer,
a player can choose to ‘bank’ the money for the team. If the player banks, the next correct
answer is again worth $1,000 in the weekly show and $250 in the daily show. Should the
player decide not to ‘bank’, the amount of money added to the pot following a correct answer
increases. However, failure to answer a question correctly leads to the loss of any unbanked
money for that round. A successive chain of eight (six) correct answers with no intermittent
‘banks’ leads to an $125,000 ($12,500) increase in the pot. Money banked from each round
is accumulated into a team bank.
After each round, each player votes independently as to which player he would like to
remove from the show, and the player who receives the most votes must leave the game.
In the event of a tie, the ‘strongest link’ chooses which player to remove from the subset
of players who received the most votes. The strongest link is the player who answers the
highest percentage of his or her questions correctly.12 Once the field of players is reduced to
two (this occurs in round 7 of the weekly show and round 5 of the daily show), these two
players first accumulate prize money in the same fashion as in the earlier rounds, after which
the two players compete directly against each other with the winner taking all the money in
the team bank.13
One drawback of our data is that the contestants on The Weakest Link are unlikely to be
representative of the U.S. population. Indeed, this problem plagues much of the experimental literature. We have investigated how contestants are selected to be on the The Weakest
Link. The show draws contestants from a diverse set of groups. Besides variation in gender
and race, contestants come from a broad range of ages, occupations and educational backgrounds. As with most television game shows, the most criterion for selection is whether or
not the contestant is telegenic. We have no a priori reason to believe this is correlated with
discriminatory behavior.

Why Discriminate on The Weakest Link?

The Weakest Link provides a unique environment in which to distinguish between various
theories of discrimination. Playing the game well not only involves answering questions
correctly, but also making astute inferences about the other players’ ability to play the game.
12 Should

the final round, five (three) questions are asked of each contestant in the weekly (daily) show with

the winner being determined by who answers the most questions correctly. All other contestants leave with
nothing.

8

<-----Page 8----->Since we observe players’ decisions about who to vote off, we can determine whether race
and gender are relevant factors in voting decisions even after controlling for each player’s
performance in the game.
Analysis of contestant behavior is complicated by the game’s evolving strategic environment. In the early stages of the game, when the contestants act cooperatively to build the pot
of prize money, there is a clear incentive to vote off weak players. However, voting incentives
may shift as the game progresses because of the structure of the final round. As discussed
above, in the final round, the two remaining players first build the pot of prize money as they
do in the earlier rounds of the game. However, they then face one another in a head-to-head
competition to determine the winner of the entire game. Thus, we would expect that concern
about the head-to-head competition would create an incentive to vote off strong contestants
in later rounds. However, it is unclear whether the incentive to vote off strong players in later
rounds will outweigh the incentive to vote off the weak players because even in the final round
the two remaining players cooperatively build the prize money.14 Due to this ambiguity in
voting incentives, we base the majority of our analysis on the early rounds of the game where
incentives are more clear-cut.
The following section presents a brief discussion of the expected voting behavior under
the assumptions of a) statistical discrimination, b) preference-based discrimination, and c)
strategic discrimination.

4.1

Statistical Discrimination

Contestants in this game may use race and gender as proxies for underlying ability. In this
setting, discriminatory voting patterns can arise either because of real group-level differences
in ability or because some contestants have better information about the ability level of
one group relative to another. These two sources of statistical discrimination (differences in
ability vs. differences in the quality of information) have different predictions about voting
patterns as the game progresses.
To see this, assume that there are two groups: group A and group B, and that contestants
from group A play the game better than contestants from group B. In this case, as long as the
incentives are such that players wish to remove weak players, contestants from both groups
should be more likely to vote against members of group B. One simple method for examining
whether this type of statistical discrimination accounts for observed voting patterns is to
14 Indeed,

we find that although the probability of voting off the weakest link diminishes as the game

progresses, players are always more likely to vote off the weakest link than the strongest link.

9

<-----Page 9----->look for group-level differences in the percentage of questions answered correctly during the
first round of the game.
Now, suppose instead that contestants from group A and group B are equally skilled, but
that contestants from group A have better information about the ability level of contestants
from their own group than about that of contestants from group B. In this case, contestants
from group A will place a relatively high weight on mean ability when assessing the ability
level of players from group B. Thus, a contestant from group B with a relatively low signal
will have a higher perceived ability than a contestant from group A with that same signal.
As a result, in the presence of informational asymmetries, contestants will be more likely to
cast votes against members of their own group, especially in the early rounds of the game.15
A final possibility is that the contestant’s prior beliefs about ability are simply inaccurate.
It is possible, for example, that members of group A begin the game with the erroneous belief
that members of group B are inferior at playing the game. In this case, we would expect
to see that members of group B are more likely to be voted off in the early rounds of the
game, and that this pattern would disappear as the incorrect prior is updated. Two types of
analysis allow us to examine the possibility that players have such erroneous expectations.
First, we examine data from episodes of the daily show for which all participants have the
same occupation. Presumably members of the same occupation have better information
about how particular groups will perform. If bad information is the reason that particular
groups are voted off, one would expect to see a weaker pattern of discriminatory voting in
shows where everyone has the same occupation. Second, if incorrect prior beliefs are driven
by a characteristic that is not common to all members of the discriminated group, then the
test for explicit collusion discussed below can also be used to rule out incorrect prior beliefs
as a source of discriminatory voting behavior.

4.2

Strategic Discrimination

In a strategic setting such as The Weakest Link, collusion may also play a role in discriminatory outcomes. Two types of collusion are possible here: explicit collusion (where agreements
are made between groups of contestants on their voting behavior) and implicit collusion
(where no agreements are discussed but individuals play strategies that yield focal points).
Contestants meet one another prior to the game and presumably there are opportuni15 The

exact opposite would occur in the labor market where high signals would be weighed more heavily

from one’s own group. The difference is that, in the labor market, the hired individual will be one with the
highest signal whereas in The Weakest Link the one with the lowest signal will be voted against.

10

<-----Page 10----->ties to discuss with one another various (quite possibly collusive) strategies for playing the
game. Whether and how players are able to commit to this strategy of collusion remains
an open question, however, assuming that players are able to successfully act cooperatively,
coalitions may be likely to form along racial or gender lines. To test for explicit collusion, we
examine whether the votes of the individual players are correlated with the votes of the same
group members after controlling for the votes of all the contestants. That is, there may be
unobservable characteristics which make particular individuals more likely to be voted off.
These will be captured by the total votes cast against a person by all the other players. If,
however, group coalitions are formed ahead of time, then the colluding group will not only
vote against members of the other group, but against the same member of the other group.
Discriminatory outcomes may also result from implicit collusion where individuals naturally play particular equilibria. For example, discriminating against members of group B
may be a best response for members of group A given that the other members of group A
are playing a discriminatory equilibrium. These focal point equilibria should be reenforcing.
Hence, if group A succeeds in removing a member of group B in round 1, then this should
make it more likely that they will vote off a member of group B in round 2. We can therefore
test for explicit collusion by examining how who is voted off affects voting behavior in the
next round.

4.3

Preference-Based Discrimination

In the prototypical model of preference-based discrimination, members of the majority group
simply dislike working with members of the minority group and act as if there is some nonmonetary cost associated with hiring them. As a result, in equilibrium, workers from minority
groups may earn lower wages on average.
In The Weakest Link, contestants from one group may dislike playing the game with
contestants from some other group. Thus, if we believe that members of group A dislike
members of group B, we would expect that members of group A would be consistently more
likely to vote off members of group B in every round. As the game progresses, however,
the probability that any single player will win the game increases. As a result, the implicit
cost of preference-based discrimination also increases. For this reason alone, even if the
contestants have discriminatory preferences, their propensity to discriminate will fade as the
game progresses. Therefore, if preference based discrimination exists, we would expect it to
diminish with each round of the show. These predictions are similar to what we would expect
to see with statistical discrimination and may make distinguishing between the two theories

Which Contestants Discriminate?

5.1

Descriptive Evidence

In order to understand the broad patterns in the data, we start by analyzing voting patterns
by gender and race. Table 1 summarizes the voting behavior by round for both the daily
and weekly shows. The table evaluates the voting behavior of three demographic groups:
men, women, and whites17 to determine if members of these groups discriminate against
players who are not group members. For example, do men discriminate against women in
their voting patterns? The task of discerning discrimination is complicated because even if
both men and women vote randomly, men will cast more votes against women and women
will cast more votes against men simply because a contestant will never vote against him
or her self. To account for this problem, and the fact that the distribution of demographic
types varies across episodes and rounds, we describe the voting behavior in terms of the mean
“group bias statistic”. For individual i voting in round r, the “group bias statistic” is given
by:
Group Bias Statistic = h

1ir
Gir −1
Nr −1

i.

(1)

where 1ir is an indicator variable that takes on a value of one if individual i votes for a
contestant from his or her group in round r. Gir is the number of contestant i’s type in round
r of his or her episode and Nr is the total number of contestants in round r of contestant
i’s episode.18 A mean value of one for the group bias statistic implies no discrimination, a
value less than one implies discrimination against the other group and, and a value greater
than one implies discrimination against one’s own group.
The descriptive evidence show some surprising results. First, there is virtually no evidence
of discrimination by whites against blacks; all of the values of our discrimination statistic are
indistinguishable from one. Second, there is no discrimination against women by men in the
early rounds, though in round 3 of both shows men are more likely to vote against women.
The most surprising result, however, is that in both the weekly and the daily show women
16 As

it turns out, we are able to distinguish between the two theories as there is no difference in observed

abilities across racial and gender lines, eliminating statistical discrimination from consideration.
17 The voting behavior of blacks is not considered due to small sample size.
18 Note that this statistic is only calculated for rounds in which contestant i has the option of voting for
both group members and non-group members.

off men continues in rounds 2 and 3 of the daily show, though at a diminishing rate.
Obviously, these patterns may reflect race and gender differences in the average ability
to play the game. In particular, if men are not as successful at playing the game well, then
this may explain why they are more likely than women to receive votes in the early stages of
the game. The analysis of the following section controls for these differences.

5.2

Evidence from Conditional Logits

In order to control for any possible race or gender differences in the contestants’ abilities
to play the game, we estimate conditional logits by show and by round of the probability
contestants cast votes against other players as a function of those players’ characteristics.
We model the utility of player i voting for contestant j in round r as:
Uijr = Xijr βr + ijr ,

(2)

where β is a vector of coefficients to be estimated and ijr is the unobserved preference
individual i has for voting for contestant j. Included in Xijr are controls for the percentage of
the questions the player answered correctly in that round, whether the player was statistically
the weakest link (answered the fewest questions correctly) in that round and also whether
the player was the strongest link in that round. In addition, we control for the gender and
races of the other contestants and whether the individual voting was of the same gender or
race. Due to small sample sizes, we restrict our analysis of race to the daily show.19 We
assume that the ijr ’s are distributed i.i.d. extreme value, implying that the probability of
voting for contestant j in round r is given by:
exp(Xijr βr )
Pijr = PNr
k=1 exp(Xijr βr )

(3)

where Nr is the number of contestants in round r.
The advantage of using a conditional logit here is threefold. First, consider the probability
that player i votes against player j. As the abilities of the other contestants increase, so
too will the probability of voting against player j. That is, the characteristics of the all
the contestants influence the probability of voting against any one contestant. Second, the
conditional logit allows us to examine interactions between the voting characteristics of the
individual and the other contestants. Hence, we allow men to treat women differently and
women to treat men differently. Third, the predicted number of votes cast by each contestant

of the qualitative results change if race is included in the weekly show.

14

<-----Page 14----->is constrained to be one and therefore the total number of votes cast in a round equals the
number of contestants in that round.
Results for each round are shown in the appendix, with the results for round 1 of both
the daily and the weekly show given in Table 2. We have the most confidence in the round
1 results for three reasons. First, sample sizes are much larger here than in the later rounds.
Second, strategies may change as the game progresses and may depend upon the history of
play. Finally, the pool of contestants in all but the initial round is endogenously determined
by the voting behavior.
The first set of rows examines the voting behavior of women. Consistent with the descriptive evidence, women appear to be more likely to cast votes against men than against other
women. As shown in the appendix, this effect disappears immediately after round 1 in the
weekly show while slowly diminishing in the daily show. This effect is quite large. Consider
a daily show with six white contestants, three men, and three women, all with identical performance. The probability of a given female voting for a particular male contestant is 23.3%
while the probability that she votes for a particular female contestant is 15.1%.
Also consistent with the descriptive evidence, the next two sets of rows show that there
is no indication of discrimination by men against women or by whites against blacks. This
holds true for all rounds of the game except for round 3 where in both the weekly and the
daily show men are more likely to vote against women, though the effect is not statistically
significant. However, this discriminatory behavior by men may be due to the discrimination
against men and the corresponding selection of men who make it to round 3. We discuss
these results in greater detail and relate them to other studies of labor market discrimination
in Section 7.
As one would expect, for all demographic groups in the early stages of the game, the
higher the percentage of the questions that the player answers correctly the less likely other
contestants are are to cast votes against that player. However, as the game progresses, the
percent correct becomes less and less important. This confirms the basic logic that players
have an incentive to vote against weak players in the early rounds of the game but in the
later rounds, this incentive is partially offset by the incentive to vote against stronger players.

6.1

The Case Against Statistical Discrimination

Recall that statistical discrimination with correct priors can take two forms. In the first,
the mean performance level is different across groups. For statistical discrimination of this
type to explain females discriminating against males, the performance by males must be on
average worse than the performance by females. Table 3 documents the average percent
correct for males and females by round and by show type. There is virtually no difference
in performance levels for males and females in either show in the early rounds, while in the
later rounds males actually perform better than their female counterparts.20 In addition, if
men are truly worse at playing the game, then both women and men should be more likely
to vote against men in the early rounds of the game. We find no evidence of this. Hence,
there is no evidence that statistical discrimination based upon mean group performance is
driving females to vote against males.
The second type of statistical discrimination, where the signals on ability are more informative for one group than another, is ruled out by the fact that women are discriminating
against men rather than against women. Recall that information-based statistical discrimination implies that within-group performance is more informative that out-of-group performance. Hence, poor performance is weighted more heavily when it is by a member of one’s
own group. Should this type of discrimination occur, women would be more likely to vote
against women than against men. We find the exact opposite result.
Next, we turn to the case of incorrect prior beliefs regarding group performance. It is
possible that in the early rounds of the game, women have not yet learned that men perform
as well as women in the game. Our data set contains 13 episodes of the daily show in which
all of the contestants have the same occupation. Should erroneous prior beliefs exist, it seems
reasonable to expect that workers in the same occupation would have more informative priors
on the abilities of their opposite-sex contestants than do contestants of differing occupations.
In Table 4 we interact a dummy variable for the shows in which all of the contestants have
the same occupation with the male indicator. Under the incorrect priors hypothesis, one
would expect a negative coefficient on this interaction term. However, the coefficient on this
term is positive, although insignificant, providing weak evidence that women in the same
occupation are more likely to vote against men than are women in different occupations. We
20 That

males preform better in later rounds may be a result of relatively low ability males being voted off

earlier than relatively low ability females due to the discrimination.

provide additional evidence against the hypothesis of incorrect prior beliefs in our discussion
of explicit collusion below.

6.2

The Case Against Strategic Discrimination

We now test whether women are acting cooperatively with one another. There are two basic
types of collusive behavior in which women might engage: implicit collusion and explicit
collusion. Under explicit collusion, the presumption is that the women are following some
agreed upon pattern of voting. Under implicit collusion, the presumption is that women
have a tacit agreement to vote against men. To test for explicit collusion, we include in
the female round 1 conditional logits the total votes cast for each contestant by the other
contestants as well as the total votes cast by the other female contestants.21 The first variable
captures the fact that there are unobservable characteristics that may lead individuals to vote
against particular contestants. In order for there to be explicit collusion among females, the
21 We

also performed this analysis for the male sub-sample and for round 2 of the daily show. Gender again

had no effect on the voting behavior of men while the results for round 2 are very similar to the results from
round 1; female votes are not correlated except through total votes.

coefficient on the latter variable, total votes cast by other women, must be positive. Results
for this specification are shown in Table 5. Importantly, the total votes cast by other women
has no more predictive power than the total votes cast by men. This can be seen because
once we control for the the total votes cast, the coefficient on votes cast by women is small
and insignificant. Hence, there is no evidence of explicit collusion.
That the coefficient on female votes is small and insignificant allows us to reject many
other explanations for the discriminatory behavior. In particular, it suggests that women
are not discriminating on some unobserved characteristic correlated with being male as this
too should have led to a positive coefficient on votes cast by women. If particular men are
arrogant or make poor (in the eyes of women) banking decisions, then the votes of the other
women should reflect this. Instead, the results suggest that whatever characteristics are
unappealing to women are equally unappealing to men. Note that this also helps to rule out
discrimination based upon bad expectations. In particular, the only bad expectations that
can exist involve women expecting all men to perform equally poorly–that is, there can be

20

<-----Page 20----->no correlation between these bad expectations and any observable (to the voter, not to the
researcher) characteristics.
We next test whether or not women are implicitly colluding to vote off men. The first
evidence that this is not the case comes from the diminishing coefficient on same sex as we
move to the later rounds. If implicit collusion is working, then there is no reason to stop
colluding against men in the later rounds. The second indication that implicit collusion is
not driving the results is that implicit collusion does not appear to be reenforcing. That is,
if implicit collusion were occurring successfully (a man was voted off), then implicit collusion
should be more likely to happen in the next round than if the implicit collusion did not
work. Table 6 reports conditional logits for rounds 2 and 3 of both the daily and weekly
shows with an indicator variable for whether a man was (two men were) voted off prior to
round 2 (3). Although not significant, three of the four interactions are negative, implying
that, if anything, removing males makes it less likely that women will vote off men in future
rounds. Hence, we find no evidence of strategic discrimination through either implicit or
explicit collusion.

6.3

The Case for Preference-Based Discrimination

The only remaining explanation is that women simply prefer playing with women. Consistent
with this explanation, the coefficient on male diminishes in later rounds as the price of
discriminating based upon preferences increases. Further, this coefficient falls faster in the
weekly show, disappearing after one round. This is consistent with the theory of preferencebased discrimination since the cost of discriminating is higher in the weekly show where the
total prize money is substantially larger.
We have attempted to further test this explanation by including controls for the amount
of money banked (the size of the pot) at the voting stage. If preference-based discrimination
exists, higher amounts of money banked should lead to less discrimination. Estimates of
models of this type were mixed, with evidence that at the lowest quartile of money banked
discrimination increases (consistent with the theory) but discrimination also increases at the
highest quartile of money banked (inconsistent with the theory). One possible explanation
for the latter is that, in order to bank a large sum of money, every contestant needs to
perform well, and if every player is similarly talented at playing the game, then there is no
extra cost associated with voting against men, regardless of the amount of money banked.
Unfortunately, the small sample sizes make it difficult to further test this hypothesis.

Discussion

Given that we are interested in learning about labor market discrimination, it is important to
confirm that our findings are consistent with what we observe in other contexts. A number of
recent audit studies (for example, Goldin and Rouse (1997) and Bertrand and Mullanaithan
(2003)) have documented evidence of discrimination against women and blacks. We find no
evidence of discrimination against these groups.
There are a number of explanations for this discrepancy. First, the contestants on the The
Weakest Link operate under the scrutiny of a much larger audience than employers in the
labor market. Thus, if there is a social stigma associated with discrimination (of any kind),
then individuals may not be willing to discriminate when their actions are publicly observable.
This suggests that open hiring policies may reduce discrimination. To our knowledge there
has been no previous research on the impact of audiences on discriminatory behavior.
Second, as Table 3 shows, there are no significant performance differences between men
and women or between blacks and whites in either the first or the second moment of the
ability distribution. As a result, even if statistical discrimination is an important feature of
the labor market, it would be unlikely to appear in our analysis. Thus, one interpretation of
the fact that we find no evidence of discrimination against either blacks or women in our data
is as support for the role of statistical discrimination in the discriminatory patterns found in
recent studies of the labor market.
Somewhat surprisingly, we also find evidence that women have discriminatory preferences
against men. There are a number of possible explanations for this type of behavior. First,
women may dislike certain aspects of how men play the game.22 Women may also feel more
compassionate towards women than towards men, and women may not like playing with men
because they fear that they will not compete as well against men in the later rounds of the
game. Gneezy, Niederle and Rustichini (2003), for example, find evidence in an experimental
setting that women perform worse when competing against men than against women.23
Evidence from other settings supports the notion that women might give preferential
22 Though

for this to be true, it would have to be how males in general play the game and not correlated

with any other feature (such as how certain males speak or how certain males look). If the discrimination
result was driven by females disliking the way males with particular features played the game, the test we
performed for explicit collusion would have shown that female votes were correlated beyond the correlation
with male votes.
23 If this were the case, we would expect discrimination to persist and even increase as the game progresses
which we do not see in the data. The selection of contestants into the later rounds, however, may be why we
do not see this in the conditional logit estimates.

23

<-----Page 23----->treatment to other women. As discussed previously, Dillingham et al. (1994) find that
women discriminate in favor of women in the voting for officers in a professional association.
There is also evidence that, all else equal, women are more likely to vote for women in political
contests. For example, in her analysis of voting behavior during the 1992 U.S. election, Dolan
(1998) finds that women were more likely than men to vote for women candidates, even after
controlling for a number of ideological, issue, and party concerns. Similar results are reported
by Smith and Fox (2001) for open seat house races between 1988 and 1992. Further, these
authors find candidate sex does not matter to male voters once controls for other factors are
included. Finally, Derose et al. (2001) examine the relationship between patient satisfaction
and the gender of emergency department physicians. They find that even after controlling
for the patient’s age, health status, literacy level and a number of other covariates, women
gave significantly higher performance ratings to female physicians. Men’s satisfaction, on the
other hand, was not associated with physician gender. While beyond the scope of this paper,
understanding more about the sources of women’s preferences towards women is clearly an
intriguing area for future research.

Conclusion

Understanding the nature of discrimination and it’s contribution to both racial and gender
earnings inequality involves tackling two questions. First, we would like to know whether
individuals discriminate. Second, we would like to know why individuals discriminate. In
this paper we attempt to address both of these questions by examining the voting behavior
of contestants in The Weakest Link. While the game show environment is clearly different
from that of the labor market, difficulties associated with evaluating discrimination directly
within the labor market motivate an analysis of behavior in more stylized settings. This
research builds on the emerging experimental literature on discrimination and provides an
opportunity to consider individual behavior in a high-stakes environment.
Interestingly, we find no evidence of either preference-based or strategic discrimination
against either blacks or women. Statistical discrimination was ruled out in The Weakest Link
in part because of the lack of performance differences across racial and gender lines. However,
this may not be the case in the labor market and points towards statistical discrimination
as a possible explanation for the discriminatory patterns against these groups found in a
number of recent studies. In addition, we find that women discriminate against men in
the early rounds of both the daily and weekly shows. The one theory consistent with the

24

<-----Page 24----->observed voting trends is preference-based discrimination. In other words, it appears that
women simply prefer playing with women rather than with men. Finally, our paper suggests
the need for future studies that examine the impact of audiences on discriminatory behavior.
