The Psychology of Financial Decision-Making: Applications to Trading,
Dealing, and Investment Analysis
Denis J. Hilton
This paper offers a whole range of areas in which the latest work on psychology, social
psychology and behavioral finance could offer competitive advantage both to financial markets as well as individual firms. The aim is to identify potential applications of
experimental and organizational psychology to improve the efficiency of financial institutions. The focus is on two major areas of application: trading and dealing in currencies, and investment decision-making.
The paper reviews the seven deadly sins in individual decision-making showing
how the financial decision-maker may fall prey to them. It also suggests how this
knowledge can be put to use in improving efficiency in financial strategy, marketing,
and human resource management (selection, training, decision-aiding, and control).
The paper concludes by identifying important questions for the financial markets to
consider if they are serious about improving managerial practices.

no-one complains about his judgment”

continually providing better services than their regional and international competitors.
There is currently another revolution taking place,
which is intellectual in nature. This is the new field of
behavioral finance (Lifson and Geist [1999]; Shefrin
[1999]; Statman [1995]; and Thaler [1993]), which
argues that people and markets have inherent tendencies toward irrationality. Unlike traditional economics, this new discipline does not assume that people
are perfectly rational, nor does it assume that market
irrationality is due to imperfections in market mechanisms. It assumes that markets are composed of imperfectly rational players in imperfect markets (de
Bondt [1998]).
Behavioral finance is the most visible application of
recent work in experimental psychology on irrationality in human decision-making to the financial markets
(Bazerman [1998]; Hogarth [1987]; Russo and Schoemaker [1991]). Experimental psychologists have built
a substantial body of knowledge demonstrating biases
and shortcomings in expert decision-making in general
(Camerer [1981]), and economic decision-making in
particular (Lopes [1994]). The implication for the financial markets of relevant research in psychology has
recently begun to be diffused in the financial markets
through books (e.g., Bernstein [1996]), articles in the
financial press, and professional conferences on behavioral finance.
However, I believe the potential implications go beyond behavioral finance, which, with its focus on predicting and understanding market behavior, does not
focus directly on the individual’s decision processes.
Behavioral finance tends to have more of an impact on
financial strategy, e.g., in the choice of a contrarian or a
momentum strategy in investing.

Background and Aims:
From Behavioral Finance
to Applied Psychology
The financial markets operate in a fast-changing
and increasingly competitive environment, with activity that is being revolutionized in at least two ways. The
first development is technological. Screen-based trading has replaced floor trading, and institutions such as
LIFFE in London that did not adapt fast enough lost
business to foreign competitors. A new wave of market
restructuring is being driven by Internet trading.
The second development is geopolitical. Globalization has affected financial centers in many ways, leading to the creation of three major time zones for trading
(U.S., Europe, and Asia), which has resulted in specialization. For example, the City of London has become
Europe’s leading financial center. Such positions of
preeminence are continually under threat, and major financial centers need to justify their preeminence by

I argue that psychology can also be applied to decision-training and decision-aiding, as well as financial
product marketing and the traditional human resource
management concerns of recruitment, training, compensation, and control. My aim here is to identify potential applications of experimental and organizational
psychology to improve the efficiency of financial institutions. I focus on two major areas of application: trading and dealing in currencies, and investment decision-making. What empirical work that does exist on
these activities encourages the belief that market participants are not impervious to the kinds of judgmental
biases (e.g., confirmation bias, loss aversion) demonstrated in other domains, such as managerial and medical decision-making (e.g., Bazerman [1998] and
Hilton [1997b]).
I focus on the unit of decision-making—the individual and the decision-making team—and describe research on the processes that drive financial decision-making. In the first section I review the seven
deadly sins in individual decision-making (there are
actually quite a few more), and then I show how the financial decision-maker may fall prey to them. Next I
briefly consider the sources of collective irrationality
that may further plague financial decision-making. I
then suggest how this knowledge can be put to use in
improving efficiency in financial strategy, marketing,
and human resource management (selection, training,
decision-aiding, and control). I distinguish the psychology of financial decision-making from behavioral
finance, and conclude by identifying important questions for the financial markets to consider if they are serious about improving managerial practices.

The Seven Deadly Sins in Financial
Decision-Making
I review seven well-known biases in human judgment and decision-making that collectively explain
why financial markets are likely to be less than rational. They also offer a basis for understanding the behavior of professionals (investment fund managers,
traders, and dealers) and individuals (whether private
investors or fund clients), which I then use to make
suggestions about the potential applications of psychology to financial markets.

Confirmation Bias in Hypothesis
Testing and an Experimental Market
A well-known bias in human decision-making is to
seek confirmation, rather than disconfirmation, for hypotheses. The danger of selectively searching for and
interpreting information in financial markets is real. As
the director of a U.K. investment fund pointed out to
38

me, “There is a lot of data out there. The data will support almost anything. You have to watch out for
confirmation bias in your thinking.”
One simple way of demonstrating the prevalence of
confirmation bias is through a simple card problem
(Wason and Johnson-Laird [1972]). You are told that a
pack of cards has letters on one side and numbers on
the other. Imagine that someone makes the following
statement: If there is a vowel on one side then there is
an even number on the other. There are four cards
drawn on the table in front of you, on which an E, a K, a
4, and a 7 are facing up. Which cards would you need
to turn over to decide whether the statement is true or
false?
Most people would turn over the E and the 4. In fact,
the correct cards to turn over are the E and the 7, because you can only disprove the rule by turning over
the E and the 7. However, most people more naturally
look for confirmations, so they turn over the cards with
the vowel (E) and the even number (4). The only exceptions I know of are French Grande Ecole students
from the ESSEC business school, who are highly
trained in mathematics. On the whole, people are not
natural Popperians, even when nothing appears to be at
stake as in this abstract card problem.
Work in experimental markets, such as Forsythe et
al. [1992], suggests that those best able to resist confirmation bias are the most likely to make money. In
Forsythe’s study, a team of economists and political
scientists created and tracked a political stock market
in which traders dealt in shares in Bush and Dukakis
through a computerized system prior to the 1988 U.S.
presidential election. Most profits went to a small minority of “marginal traders” who succeeded in buying
low and selling high. These traders seemed to be able
to resist confirmation bias by interpreting “news” dispassionately. For example, after each of the three televised debates, marginal traders adjusted their holdings
in the candidates appropriately, regardless of whether
they personally supported Bush or Dukakis. Other
traders were more likely to interpret these debates as
favoring their own candidate. In addition, the successful marginal traders were free of the false consensus
bias, a tendency to overestimate the number of other
people who share your preferences.
A final point is that this experimental market was
remarkably efficient, in that the prices of shares in
Bush and Dukakis predicted vote share on election day
better (through a simple conversion formula) than all
the major public opinion polls. This result was replicated in the 1992 U.S. election (Lopes [1994]), as well
as in seven out of eight other political stock markets. It
substantiates the Hayek hypothesis that a market can
be efficient even if most of its participants are not fully
rational. What this study adds, of course, is that the
profits of arbitrage go to those who are free of judgmental biases. It seems to illustrate Soros’s [1998, p.

<-----Page 2----->FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING

25] claim that a Popperian “disconfirmation bias” is 1)
rational, 2) rare, and 3) profitable.

Optimism Bias and the Illusion
of Control
Optimism bias refers to people’s tendency to believe that they are better than average, and that misfortunes are more likely to befall other people than themselves. 95% of British drivers believe that they are
better than average (Sutherland [1992]). American students believe that a wide range of illnesses is more
likely to happen to other students than themselves
(Weber and Hilton [1990]). Buyers and sellers in
zero-sum markets presumably believe that they have
the edge over the other party in the transaction; otherwise the market would not exist.
The closely related illusion of control refers to individuals’ tendency to overestimate the control they have
over outcomes. It can be induced by cues suggesting
that the individual’s skill and ability can make a difference to the outcome, even when they are actually irrelevant. A classic demonstration of this is provided by
Langer [1975]. Participants received lottery tickets either through drawing them themselves (illusion of control) or through being given them by the lottery proprietor (no illusion of control). When asked for selling
prices, those who had drawn the tickets themselves

wanted approximately twice as much, presumably reflecting their greater belief in the probability of
winning.
In some domains, optimism bias can lead to superior performance. Seligman reports that door-to-door
salesmen who attribute refusals to external factors (bad
luck, unsuitable client) rather than internal factors
(poor product, inaptitude for sales) are more likely to
be successful. This is presumably due to their greater
motivation to continue enthusiastically after repeated
failures and the need to exude confidence in order to
convince clients. However, this phenomenon does not
seem to generalize to the impersonal financial markets
conducted through screens in dealing rooms. Fenton
O’Creevy et al. [1998] find that overoptimistic traders
(by measuring the illusion of control via a series of
computer-based tasks) are less likely to show successful performance, based on both self-report and supervisor assessments of contribution to overall desk profits
(see Figure 1).
Further evidence that optimism bias hurts trading
performance comes from studies of individual investors. A corollary of optimism bias is that it will incite
people to trade more often because they believe they
have higher chances of success, perhaps because they
are reading the market better than other players. Consistent with this, Barber and Odean [2000a] find an average of 75% turnover per year in portfolios held at a
discount brokerage, which is highly suggestive of ex-

cessive optimism in trading. However, the problem
with this kind of self-belief is that it can lead people to
trade more often without a compensating increase in
earnings. Barber and Odean compared high- and
low-frequency traders in their sample, and found that
high-frequency traders did not make higher gross profits (see Figure 2), but incurred greater trading costs (the
average round-trip transaction costs of a trade due to
commission and bid–ask spread is about 6%).
Barber and Odean’s findings clearly run counter to
the predictions of a rational analysis of trading behavior, which would expect trades only to occur when expected profits outweigh transaction costs. But they fit a
model of trading behavior where traders are unrealistically overconfident about their abilities. The male investor seems particularly likely to be overconfident in
this way. Survey research indicates that, compared to
women, men spend more time and money on security
analysis, rely less on their brokers, trade more actively,
believe that returns are more highly predictable, and
anticipate higher returns than women. Consistent with
this argument, Barber and Odean’s [2000b] analysis of
discount brokerage accounts finds that men take riskier
positions than women. They also find that men trade
more often than women, and as a consequence incur
less net returns. This difference between the sexes is
40

especially marked when single men are contrasted with
single women!
Overconfidence in Predictions
Expert predictions about the behavior of financial
markets are generally quite inaccurate. An amusing
demonstration of this was given by The Economist
(“Garbage In: Garbage Out,” April 23, 1994, p. 86). In
1984, The Economist asked four groups of professionals to make ten-year predictions about economic prospects (four ex-finance ministers in OECD economies,
four chairmen of multinational firms, four Oxford University economics students, and four London dustmen). Four indices were used: the average growth rate
in the OECD during this period; average inflation; the
price of oil in 1994; and when Singapore’s GDP would
overtake Australia’s GDP. Joint winners were the businessmen and the dustmen; the finance ministers came
last.
Further illustration of the pervasive inaccuracy of
expert prediction comes from data collected by
Euromoney and the Record Treasury Management on
financial experts’ and corporate treasurers’ predictions
about £/U.S.$ and £/DM rates over the last two decades
(see Figures 3 and 4). Finally, Wilkie-Thompson et al.

[1998] find that a panel of financial experts actually did
worse than fourth-year students of mathematical finance at making predictions from a simulated series.
The overconfidence effect in expert predictions is
well known to psychologists (Russo and Schoemaker
[1991]), and can be assessed and corrected. A common
way of assessing faulty calibration of predictions is to
ask people to make a range prediction, so they are 90%
sure that the actual value will fall within the range
specified. For example, a money manager asked to
make a prediction about the £/Euro exchange rate in six
months could say that he is 90% sure that the exchange
rate will be between 0.64 and 0.74 pounds. This procedure can of course be repeated with any number of
other currency predictions, and if the manager is well
calibrated, nine out of ten currency values should fall
within the predicted range (“hits”). He should thus expect only one out of ten “misses” due to predictions
falling outside the predicted range.
Using this procedure with thirty-six foreign exchange traders in a globally operating bank, Stephan
[2000] finds strong evidence of faulty calibration, with
high miss rates not only on exchange rate predictions
(71.1%) but also on stock price questions (83.3%) and
general knowledge questions (78.6%). Such overconfidence may be costly. In a simulated experimental market, Biais et al. [2000] finds that overconfident subjects
are less likely to learn correct prices quickly and more
likely to lose money in trading.
In today’s markets, information is a double-edged
sword—its presence should help us make accurate predictions and rational decisions, but it can also make us
unduly overconfident in our predictions and decisions.
This is especially likely today because the human decision-maker may have more information than he can effectively handle.
This point is illustrated by an unpublished study on
horse race handicapping by Slovic and Corrigan, reported by Russo and Schoemaker [1991]. The eight
handicappers who participated in this study were allowed to select five, ten, twenty, and forty pieces of information from “past performance charts” that gave
nearly 100 pieces of information on each horse and its
history. At each point they were asked to make a prediction. Overall, accuracy did not increase (see Figure
5). This flat curve is due to three handicappers decreasing in accuracy, two improving, and three staying
about the same. However, the handicappers’ confidence in their predictions did increase with further information, so that they became even more overconfident with forty items of information than they were
with five.
Finally, note that in any sample of market traders
some will inevitably appear to be better than average
(for a while) simply through chance (the “star performer” phenomenon). However, if they are genuinely
skillful, they will show consistently superior perfor42

mance. Hartzmark [1991] tested this hypothesis
through an analysis of traders’ positions in U.S. futures
markets in commodities, T-bonds, and T-bills from
1977 to 1981. He found strong support for the view that
predictions in these markets were randomly generated.
“Stars” from the first two-year period showed regression to the mean in the second period, and initial
underperformers also showed a tendency to “improve.”
Hartzmark concluded that luck, rather than forecast
ability, is the best explanation for superior forecast performance.
The failure of financial decision-makers to learn
from feedback and calibrate predictions accurately is
especially intriguing given that markets are supposed
to correct inaccurate expectations. One would expect
people playing the market every day to get corrective
(and expensive) feedback—for “experience is a dear
teacher” (Benjamin Franklin).
But there seem to be several plausible reasons for
this. Humans have a horror of accepting randomness
and seek causal explanations even where behavior is
random (Heider and Simmel [1944]; Oatley and Yuill
[1984]). Hindsight bias (Fischhoff [1982]) means that
post-hoc explanations are always easy to invent after
the fact. Events such as the allied victory in the Gulf
War in 1991, the pound’s departure from the ERM in
1992, and LIFFE’s collapse in 1998 seem inevitable
with retrospect, thus making the world seem more predictable than it is. Financial markets seem especially
prone to rewriting history. As Fischhoff [1982b] puts it
when discussing examples of hindsight bias: “One of

<-----Page 6----->FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING

my favorite contrasts is that when the market rises following good economic news, it is said to be responding
to the news; if it falls, that is explained by saying that
the good news had already been discounted.”
Feedback in financial markets may be inherently
difficult to recognize due to the high level of noise in
markets. Failure to learn action outcome relations may
be accentuated by self-serving attributions for success
and failure (taking credit for successes and laying
blame on external factors). Feedback may be asymmetrical, in that corporate treasurers and pension fund
managers may invoke procedures to limit losses but not
gains. Hedge fund managers may be symmetrical in
terms of feedback, leading to a short half-life due to the
greater probability of having to leave one’s position if
the fund underperforms. However, those that survive
three years in a row and get good “reputations” for persistently performing “above average” may do so only
through chance. As we see below, Westerners in particular tend to commit the fundamental attribution error
of underestimating the role of situational factors (such
as chance) as causes of performance.

Mistaken Beliefs: Illusory and Invisible
Correlations
For the rational expectations theory to work as a
model of market behavior, market participants must be
able to form accurate beliefs about the correlations between characteristics: that higher price does indeed
correlate with better quality, spending money on advertising will increase market share, and so on. Otherwise,
rational agents pay unnecessarily high prices for products, or waste time and money on pointless advertising
campaigns. Likewise, a rational agent should not fail to
notice relationships that are predictive of product quality, market share, and so on.
However, research suggests that the business world
is rife with illusory correlations—beliefs that inaccurately suppose a relationship between a certain type of
action and an effect, such as the belief that unstructured
interviews enable accurate assessments of people’s
personalities (Dawes [1994]). The world of finance is
no exception. In a recent article in the Journal of Applied Corporate Finance, Alberic Braas and Charles N.
Bralver argue that managers typically overattribute
trader profits to speculative positioning and fail to take
into account “the value of the turn”—that is, profits
that accrue from being able to keep the bid–offer
spread. Their analysis suggests that players with a
stronger market-making capacity get to keep the lion’s
share of the spread, and these firms generate the majority of their profits this way. They cite a fixed-income
trader for a New York powerhouse who told them,
“Any trader I put in the five- to seven-year chair makes
a lot of money for us; each of them thinks he is making

the money with his smart calls. But it’s really the chair
that makes the money.” Failure to recognize this reality
is a classic example of a particular kind of illusory correlation known as the fundamental attribution error—
overattributing performance to the person and underattributing it to the situation.
Conversely, an invisible correlation may be said to
exist if a correlation that is “out there” is not spotted
by a relevant community of experts. An example is
the correlation between smoking and cancer, which
was not spotted by doctors for three centuries. Recent
research at the Max Planck Institute’s Center for
Adaptive Behavior and Cognition suggests that the finance community may have also failed to spot some
interesting correlations. As part of their research program on “simple but smart” heuristics, researchers at
the MPI used the fame of German companies to predict share performance. They asked German
laypeople whether they recognized a list of firms, and
invested only in firms that were recognized by over
90% of the respondents.
A similar procedure was used in the U.S. with
U.S. firms and American laypeople. Over six months,
the portfolios constructed this way had an overall
better performance than the market, and outperformed both the Dax30 and Dow30 indices as well as
the German Hypobank and Fidelity Growth funds
that were used as benchmarks. It seems that economics journals are reticent about publishing these results, however. Perhaps they are awaiting more evidence? Nevertheless, one of the Max Planck team
(Gerd Gigerenzer) was still smiling: He invested his
own money in these portfolios, which latest reports
confirm are still performing above average.

Risk Aversion, the “Disposition
Effect,” and the Framing
of Investment Choices
Imagine the following problem: Which choice
would you prefer?
a) a 25% chance of winning $30,000, with a 75%
chance of winning nothing; or
b) a 20% chance of winning $40,000
Most people choose (b) (Kahneman and Tversky
[1979]). Now imagine the following problem: You are
in a game with four players. Only one will move on to
the next round (the others will win nothing). Imagine
that you reach the second stage and you face the following choice:
a) a sure win of $30,000; or
b) an 80% chance of winning $40,000
43

<-----Page 7----->HILTON

Most people choose (a) (Kahneman and Tversky
[1979]). This reflects a bias called risk aversion, and
reflects a tendency to value certainty. However, the fact
that people show preference reversals when the same
problem is framed differently delivers a fatal blow to
expected utility theory as a descriptive model of human
decision-making. If people use expected utility theory,
they should have picked (b) in both cases.
Do financial decision-makers show irrational and/
or systematic risk aversion? Some recent research indicates that this may be the case. One does not have to
look far to see the importance of this principle for financial markets. It predicts the “disposition effect”
(Shefrin and Statman [1985])—the tendency to sell
winners too early and ride losers too long due to loss
aversion. For example, Odean’s [1998] study of individual investors’ accounts with a discount brokerage in
the U.S. shows that investors tend to buy the same
number of winners and losers but to sell more winners
than losers, except in December when there are tax incentives to sell losers. Investors also sell both winners
and losers too early—the securities they buy underperform the ones they sell over a one-year time period,
although losers tend to recover in the second year.
The disposition effect is also liable to affect professional traders and investors. Shapira and Venezia
[2000] report market data suggesting that Israeli fund
managers show the disposition effect. Although the
fund managers show a less strong disposition effect
than private investors, this effect could not be explained by tax incentives, because profits are not taxed
in Israel. In a study on corporate investors, Steil [1993]
finds that corporate treasurers show clear risk aversion
in their responses to a survey with problems involving
foreign exchange risk. He concludes that their behavior on these realistic problems could not be explained
by rational (Bayesian) models.
Finally, Kahneman and Tversky’s [1979] research
shows that people’s tendency to risk aversion can
change radically when they are faced with losses. Consider the following options:

would predict, even for professional traders, losses
loom larger than gains, and they are more likely to take
risks if they are losing with respect to their reference
point. Shapira tracked the trades of twenty government
bond traders, and was able to show that the greater the
profit or loss (P&L) account from the previous day, the
more traders bought and sold the following day. In addition, losses loomed larger than gains; this tendency
to previous activity was especially strong if the previous day had ended in a loss. Traders also took riskier
positions on the day after a loss. Finally, this tendency
to risk-seeking after losses also manifested itself
within the day’s trading: Traders showed a tendency to
take “long shots” in the last hour or two of trading at
the end of the day if they were down at 3:00pm. None
of this behavior can be predicted by rational models of
choice, and seems unlikely to contribute to the overall
efficiency of a trading desk’s performance.
Thus, professional traders, like private investors,
need to guard against the disposition effect through appropriate “mental accounting.” A recurring theme in
Patel’s [1997] series of interviews with leading professional traders is the importance of self-discipline, and
the ability to cut one’s losses. He posits that traders
should “reframe” their positions by asking themselves
whether they would buy the stock they are now holding
at its present price. If not, they should sell.
Others stress the importance of “wiping the slate
clean” every day, and forgetting about previous losses
(see insert below). Otherwise, traders may find themselves taking long shots to try to eradicate losses. This
is an all too real temptation, as the case of Barings
Bank and Nick Leeson shows, and it may be generalizable. Partnoy [1998] reports other cases, and suggests
that there may be more that have been covered up by
banks who were big enough to take the losses.

a) a sure loss of $30,000; or
b) a 20% chance of losing nothing, and an 80%
chance of losing $40,000

If most players in a market are conservative, owing to such factors as status quo bias (Samuelson and
Zeckhauser [1987]) and confirmation bias, they will
react insufficiently to information that disconfirms
prevailing market opinion (e.g., information about a
particular stock, sector, or market). This is the underreaction phase. Eventually, so much negative information will accumulate that the market will collectively revise its opinion and start selling. This
tendency is reinforced by the self-fulfilling nature of
market prophecies (Orléan [1998]) and will result in
herding behavior and a race to sell. This is the overreaction phase. As a director of a U.K. investment fund
put it to me: “Markets are a form of groupthink. Part
of what the markets do is self-reinforcing.”

Here, research indicates that most people would
choose (b), while they would choose (a) in the previous
problem concerning gains. Generally speaking, people
become extremely risk seeking when confronted with
losses.
In another in-depth study conducted on ten traders
at one of Wall Street’s ten largest investment banking
firms, Shapira [1999] found ample evidence that professional traders’ behavior is affected by framing, specifically whether they are showing a profit or a loss for
the day’s trading. As Kahneman and Tversky’s model
44

of Under- and Overreaction
in Financial Markets

<-----Page 8----->FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING

These phases of market underreaction and overreaction can present attractive opportunities for investors
(de Bondt [1998]; Vriesen and Tempelaar [1998]).
Specifically, momentum strategies (going with the
trend) are likely to be successful over short time periods (six to twelve months), while contrarian strategies
are likely to be successful over long time periods (three
to five years). This is because market participants who
share a positive sentiment about an asset will continue
to buy even when negative information is beginning to
accumulate. However, this negative information will
eventually result in an overenthusiastic price revision,
which does not take into account factors such as the
probability that firms with bad results will turn themselves around, and that very few actually go out of
business.
Even for those who are aware of these findings (and
who believe that the markets will continue to behave in
this slow seesaw fashion), there are still psychological
barriers to capitalizing on them. First, the contrarian
strategy almost inevitably leads to initial losses as an
undervalued stock continues to go down. People are
very averse to losses (Kahneman and Tversky [1979]),
and may be panicked by short-term losses into selling.
Second, those buying losers run the risk that some will
go through the floor and go out of business. Ahead of
time, people tend to find even very small probabilities
of losses to be highly aversive. Third, when such a loss
occurs, people may find this very aversive even if the
other “losers” in a portfolio are doing well enough to
compensate for the loss, an example of a mental accounting fallacy (Thaler [1992]). This may well be sufficient to deter fund managers from implementing such
strategies. Even if a fund manager believes in the worth
of such contrarian strategies, he may have problems
explaining to clients his philosophy of investing in
firms that go out of business.

Just as memories for events are not retrieved wholesale from memory, so it seems that we do not have “intrinsic values” that we retrieve from our deepest “real”
selves that determine our choices. This fact has considerable implications for marketing in general (Hilton
[1997a]) and for financial marketing in particular
(Shefrin and Statman [1993]). In one experiment,
Benartzi and Thaler [1998] conducted a survey of employees of the University of California about how they
would like to allocate their funds between two funds, A
and B. Both funds offered the option of diversifying
between stocks and bonds (up to 100% in stocks and
0% in bonds, or vice versa), but varied the way in
which they presented the options.
The kinds of options presented had substantial effects on participants’ preferences (Benartzi and Thaler [1998]). Thus, in the first experimental condition,
Fund A invested in stocks and Fund B invested in
bonds. In the second condition, Fund A was again a
stock fund, but Fund B was a “balanced fund” investing half its assets in stocks and half in bonds. In the
third condition, Fund A was the balanced fund and
Fund B was a bond fund. Participants allocated a total
of 54% of their wealth to stocks in condition 1
(stocks versus bonds), 46% to condition 2 (stocks
versus a balanced fund), and 61% to condition 3
(bonds versus a balanced fund). Benartzi and Thaler
found evidence for two strong behavioral tendencies:
dividing the assets fifty–fifty between the two options
proposed, and putting everything into the “balanced”
(fifty–fifty) fund.

Mental Accounting Biases:
The Construction of Values
and Preferences

Keynes compared markets to beauty contests, in
which judges not only had to take into account their
own preferences about the prettiest face but also the
preferences of other judges. Finance professionals
may see it as part of their job to talk to other players
in there. But they may be less aware of the potential
influence of other people’s opinions on their own
mood and behavior.
Consider the difference in the likely state of mind of
an investor in stable and unstable markets. Investors in a
long-term stable bull market, such as the U.S. stock market between 1949 and 1960, which rose almost continually by over 600%, are likely to feel self-confident. They
will feel that their investment strategies are working because they are making money. Investors in a long-term
unstable market, such as the U.S. stock market between
1966 and 1982, which went down an overall 9% after
wild fluctuations, are likely to feel unsure of them. So-

Mental accounting fallacies occur due to the effect
of context on people’s evaluation of the same items.
For example, one group of spectators was asked to
estimate the number of fouls committed during a
football match they were watching, and another
group was asked to estimate the number of fouls
committed 1) in the first half, and 2) in the second
half. Spectators’ estimates of the total number of
fouls committed in the two halves regularly exceeded
that of the single whole. People’s memories are, in an
important sense, constructed on the spot rather than
retrieved intact from a stable long-term memory, and
are thus susceptible to influence by irrelevant contextual factors at the time of judgment.

cial psychological research shows that people who feel
sure of themselves and their judgments are likely to pay
little attention to the opinions of others in forming their
judgments, unlike people who are unsure of them.
Following this reasoning, Schachter [1985] reasoned that investors in the stable bull market of 1949 to
1960 would be more independently minded than those
of the unstable market of 1966 to 1982. Independently
minded investors should be less likely to be shaken
from their strategies by “news” of external events impinging on the market.
Schachter and his colleagues obtained corroboration of this reasoning. For example, markets reacted
rather less to the results of U.S. presidential elections
during 1949–1960 than over 1966–1982. The volume
of post-election day trading went up an average of only
9.2% in 1949–1960, but by 47.3% in 1966–1982. In
another analysis, they showed that the 1949–1960 market reacted less than the 1966–1982 one to airline disasters: Trading in the shares of the airline and/or manufacturer affected went up 29.6% during 1949–1960
but 166.7% during 1966–1982. More focused analysis
of bull and bear runs within these time periods paint the
same picture: Investors react more to external news and
tips during bear runs than bull runs.
Schachter’s results are consistent with laboratory
research that shows individuals with low self-esteem
and confidence are more susceptible to influence by
others. It also throws light on the kinds of social processes that are likely to result in financial bubbles
(Mackay [1841/1932]). As we see next, such social influence processes can also explain irrational behavior
in organizations and work groups.
Groupthink and Risky Shift
The organizational theorist Henry Mintzberg estimated that the average manager spends over two-thirds
of his time talking to colleagues, workers, and anybody
else he chances to come across during the day. These
meetings and conversations, whether formal or informal, enable a manager to get an enormous number of
decisions made. Consequently, it behooves us to understand how decision-making is affected by our interaction with others.
One well-known phenomenon in group decision-making is groupthink—a process whereby a group
of individuals mutually reinforce each other into believing that their collective point of view is right. Research
on groupthink grew out of identification of the group polarization phenomenon, which began with the discovery
of the risky shift in group decision-making by Stoner
[1968]. When presented with risky choices to make, students at the School of Industrial Management at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology were often likely
to prefer riskier options after group discussion. Stoner
found that twelve of the thirteen groups he studied
46

showed a significant collective shift toward greater risk
after discussion compared to the average of each individual’s position before discussion. Indeed, subjects recorded their own opinion before and after the discussion, and appeared to have genuinely changed their
minds as a result of the discussion. The risky shift effect
has proven very robust, having been replicated in 100
studies conducted in over a dozen countries.
With certain kinds of topics, group discussion tends
to lead to greater caution, an effect known as cautious
shift. Cautious shift typically occurs, for example, after
discussion of risky decisions involving health or human life. Social psychologists prefer to talk about
group polarization—the intensification of shared attitude positions (to anything ranging from risky decisions to politicians) through group discussion. Explanations for this include information sharing (through
discussion each individual may hear of new reasons to
support his initial position, leading him or her to become more confident), and diffusion of responsibility
(the individual’s neck is no longer on the line if the
group takes a risky decision and it goes wrong).
In general, research shows that groups make better
decisions than individuals. The traditional explanations for this are that more information is likely to be
shared, different points of view examined, and so on.
However, research also shows that group discussion is
more likely to improve decision quality if it is conducted in ways that facilitate information pooling and
objective and complete analysis of options, and that
there are circumstances in which group discussion actually worsens decision-making performance, as in the
groupthink phenomenon. These cases may be more
frequent than people think. For example, research on
brainstorming suggests that it is a less productive
method of generating ideas than having the same people work individually on generating ideas. Given that
most management decisions are made in consultation
with others, there seems to be considerable scope for
research on whether certain kinds of group discussion
styles are likely to lead to better financial decisions (as
measured by some objective criterion).
Effects of Accountability
on Decision-Making
Another perspective on social processes in decision-making is obtained through examining how the
effect of having to explain or justify one’s position to
others affects people’s judgment and decision processes. Pilkington and Parker-Jones [1996] find that
trainee doctors who were asked to explain their reasoning to a non-expert showed evidence of better learning
and diagnostic performance. Similar improvement was
not observed when the medical students had to explain
their reasoning to another medical student. Giving explanations to others may force decision-makers to ar-

<-----Page 10----->FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING

ticulate assumptions and explore options more fully,
especially when their interlocutors are not familiar
with the domain.
People appear to make choices through weighing
the pros and cons of options and choosing the one with
the most reasons in its favor. For example, Simonson
[1989] found that when people are asked to explain
their preferences, they are more likely to make certain
choices than others. One part of Simonson’s research
concerned consumer decisions about six-packs of beer,
as shown below:
A. Quality rating: 50
B. Quality rating: 70
C. Quality rating: 40

Cost: $1.80
Cost: $2.60
Cost: $1.80

When presented with options A and B, people were
split 50/50 between the two. However, when presented
with options A, B, and C, people were more likely to
choose A. This effect can be predicted if one assumes
that when asked to justify their choice, people look for
reasons to prefer one option over the other. Option A
offers the most possible reasons, since it is better than
option B on price, better than C on quality, and worse
than B on quality, leading to two reasons for and one
against. Option B offers two reasons for (better than A
and C on quality) and two against (worse than both on
price). This effect goes against expected utility theory,
because the existence of the unattractive alternative C
should not alter the decision-maker’s relative preferences for A or B. Moreover, when asked to justify their
choice, people were even more likely to choose A than
when they were asked to choose without giving a justification. This is presumably because making people
accountable puts them under pressure to come up with
a good reason to justify their choice.
This last finding illustrates the point that making decision-makers accountable may make them less (not
more) rational. In social life, we are often required to explain and justify our decisions to others. Indeed, the very
aim of decision-making is often to produce a decision
that one can justify to others—for example, to one’s
desk manager in a trading room. This consideration has
been shown to affect risky choice. Thus, when people
know they will have to justify their decision, they may be
less concerned about maximizing expected utility in
their decision-making than about constructing the decision that is the most easily defended in public.
Tetlock and Boettger [1994] demonstrate this kind
of effect using a simulation of a healthcare policy problem in which they asked students whether they were for
or against the introduction of a new anticoagulant drug.
This drug was expected to save a certain number of
lives (300, 600, or 900) according to the experimental
condition, but with a cost due to deaths from hemorrhaging (0, 100, or 300, respectively). Accountable decision-makers, who expected to have to justify their de-

cisions, were much less likely to choose the drug if an
identifiable number of people would be killed. They
were also more likely to seek further research before
approving the drug, even if this meant the deaths of
many people in the meantime. This effect was even
stronger when judging a drug that was not already on
the market, presumably because the accountable decision-maker would feel even more responsible for the
consequences if his decision also allowed introduction
of the drug to the market.
Accountability pressures of this kind may make the
individual trader unduly risk averse and more likely to
forego attractive (but risky) opportunities, even though
their desk managers may prefer their traders to take attractive risks and thus maximize the desk’s overall
profits. Experimental research has shown that if people
know they will have to justify their decision before analyzing information about a defendant’s guilt in a
mock trial, they will use more information and be less
subject to confirmation bias. If they are made accountable only after they have analyzed the information,
they will become more dogmatic and selectively find
reasons to defend a decision based on an incomplete
analysis of the initial information. Given that many financial market managers are currently pondering what
kind of control to exert over people working in teams
under them to encourage maximum performance, research on the effects of accountability on financial decision-making would be very timely.
Potential Applications of Psychology
for Finance
I next review some potential applications of psychology to finance. There are three main areas: financial strategy, marketing of financial products, and human resource management. Of these three, I say the
most about the last, with specific reference to selection
and training of traders and dealers and to investment
decision-making.
The Psychology of Markets
and Financial Strategy
The identification of successful investment strategies is one of the major applications of behavioral
finance. Behavioral finance seeks to identify and explain anomalies in economic behavior, such as underreaction, overreaction, and calendar effects in security
prices (Thaler [1992]). These in turn suggest investment strategies of various kinds (de Bondt [1998];
Vriesen and Tempelaar [1998]), such as momentum
strategies (going with the trend) for short-term investments (six to twelve months) and contrarian strategies
(going against the trend) for longer-term investments
(three to five years).
47

<-----Page 11----->HILTON

The potential role of psychology. Psychologists
have little to contribute directly to applications here.
Their main influence is indirect, through providing insights and findings that researchers in economics and
finance can build on to construct their own theories in
behavioral finance, which can then be diffused to practitioners through the financial press, seminars, and consulting. For the continuing stimulation of economics by
psychology to continue, however, it is important for the
financial community that fundamental research in the
psychology of decision-making is adequately supported.

The Psychology of the Client and
Marketing of Financial Products
Psychology has a contribution to make in three
main areas:
The design of financial products. Portfolio managers must satisfy their clients, which means having to
take the client’s “psychology” into account. For most
investors, risk means the chance of a loss rather than the
swings in the value of an investment, although the latter
definition of risk corresponds to that found in classical
economics (Fortuna [1998]). Because clients think
about risk in this way, and are highly averse to losses, financial products such as “click funds” that reduce
downside risk are likely to prove very attractive (Smid
and Tempelaar [1997]).
The presentation of financial products.
Benartzi
and Thaler’s [1998] research shows that very minor
changes in the presentations of portfolios can lead to
substantial changes in client preferences. Their findings are consistent with a wide range of research on the
construction of preferences in psychology and marketing that has yet to be applied to financial products
(Hilton [1997a]). This seems an obvious area for further research.
Communication, client satisfaction, and loyalty.
Psychology has long contributed theories and methods to marketing research, and can therefore be used
in financial marketing. Psychological research can be
used to develop theories about how best to present
and explain complex financial products to clients,
thereby better matching the clients’ needs. Mental
framing strategies can be used to “teach” clients how
to think appropriately about risk, and to avoid nasty
surprises later on. Measures such as these should ensure greater client satisfaction and fidelity. At the
present stage of knowledge, more research on communication and framing strategies for financial products is needed.

The Psychology of Financial
Decision-Makers: Human Resource
Management
Trading and dealing. Initial research into this
area suggests that London-based traders and dealers do
show evidence of decision biases that affect their profitability. As noted earlier, Fenton O’Creevy et al. [1998]
find that the dealer tendency to suffer from the illusion
of control has led to worse earnings performance. The
data currently available are based on small samples,
however, and the findings need to be replicated. But
they are highly suggestive, as people who believe themselves to be “in control” may project the very personality characteristics that clients seek at the recruitment
stage.
Apart from the above research, there appears to
have been little done to establish which characteristics
predict good performance. Anecdotal evidence suggests that poor traders may differ from good traders because they have “long loss tails” due to letting losses
run (see the interviews with successful traders in Patel
[1997]). These conjectures, however, although well informed, remain just that for the moment.
Profiles of successful traders and dealers. Research needs to be done to identify the psychological
characteristics of successful traders and dealers. The
relevant psychological characteristics can be divided
into four types: cognitive, personality, ability and
knowledge, and sociometric. Establishment of these
profiles could be used to aid selection and training
through the establishment of standardized measures to
answer questions such as: Do cognitive biases such as
overconfidence and illusion of control lead to
suboptimal trading performance? Should traders have
aggressive Type A personalities or calmer Type B personalities? Which of the “Big Five” personality characteristics (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and intellect) correlate with
optimal performance? Is success simply predicted by
IQ, or is verbal and/or spatial/numerical ability most
important? Is the possession of rich, non-redundant social networks that get traders vital information before
others the key to success? These and other questions
(Hilton [1999]) seem eminently researchable, and have
clear implications for the bottom line.
Policy capturing of successful decision-makers.
Another research strategy would be to study successful
and less successful decision-makers to attempt to “capture” their judgmental policies. Slovic [1969] reports a
policy capturing study in which two stockbrokers were
presented with 128 hypothetical companies that varied
systematically in terms of eleven investment indices
such as yield, near-term prospects, earnings quarterly
trend, and so on. The results yield some surprises.

<-----Page 12----->FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING

Although the first judge had aided in the creation of
the investment scenarios and the definition of the
eleven dimensions of evaluation for stocks, an analysis
of his judgment patterns revealed that he was only influenced by eight of them. The second judge used
seven of these factors. Overall, only five of the eleven
factors were used by both judges, and even these five
were often weighted quite differently. This latter finding helps explain why there was only a 32% agreement
between the two experts, although it is interesting to
note that the second stockbroker was recruited because
it was believed he had a similar investment policy to
the first.
Finally, the two stockbrokers were asked to estimate
how much importance they accorded each factor. The
first judge had considerable insight into his own judgment policy, but the second judge had very little such
insight. A follow-up study on thirteen stockbrokers
found that the longer an investment broker has been in
the business, the less insight he has into his weighting
policy (Slovic [1972]).
Other financial decisions are also likely to be captured by simple decision policies. Cornelli and Goldreich [2000] report that an investment bank’s “decision
policy” for pricing initial public offerings can be modeled by two cues alone (average limit price of bids and
oversubscription).
Other studies suggest that one reason decision-makers may have little insight into the true
causes of their financial choices is that they are unduly influenced by feelings. For example, MacGregor
et al. [2000] show that business students are strongly
influenced by positive and negative associations of financial products that are not based on relevant market
information. They may have a positive “image” of a
market sector such as “major pharmaceuticals” because this sector is associated with “healing,” “beauty
products,” “cleanness,” and so on, while another sector like “railroads” may be associated with negative
features such as “dirty,” “old,” “used by poor people,”
and so on. Their judgments of how well these industry groupings had done in the past year and would do
in the next year, as well as their willingness to buy,
were predicted by how positive their images were of
these sectors. However, their judgments and willingness to buy were only weakly related to indicators of
actual performance.
Thus the policy capturing technique needs to be
used more widely to understand financial analysis. Is
successful decision-making correlated with the use of
a wide range of features, or the high weighting of a few
critical features? Is it correlated with insight into one’s
own decision policy? Is it influenced by subconscious
“feelings”? In addition, this technique could have considerable potential as a training device to help stockbrokers and investment analysts gain insight into their
own decision processes.

Decision training and debiasing. Research shows
that it is difficult to debias decision-makers (Fischhoff
[1982a]). Nevertheless, it can be successful. Russo and
Schoemaker report that Shell has used calibration techniques to debias its geologists’ forecasts of where to
drill for oil, with corresponding savings for the corporation. And Bolger and Onkal-Atay [1998] report that
calibration and feedback led to substantial improvement of management students’ predictions of equity
prices.
As one junior trader on the London markets put it:
“Overconfidence is the big problem—you get carried
away with success. You then have to go back over
your behavioral attitude.” Research should therefore
be conducted to see what techniques are most effective in reducing biases in decision-making. Calibration and feedback techniques should be the first to be
considered.
Decision-aiding. The technological revolution
has made the problem of information overload ever
more pressing for financial decision-makers. Current
research on screen design has tried to use psychological
research on perception and information processing to
present information in the most “user-friendly” way.
Nevertheless, it is not difficult to envisage how decision-making research could lead to the development of
screens that provide an active role in decision aiding.
This could be done through the development of “smart
screens” that offer decision-aiding facilities. For example, screens could be programmed to solicit explicit
probability judgments for predictions, to store them,
and then to retrieve them for calibration exercises.
These “automatic auditing” functions should aid financial decision-making performance.
Screens could also be “tailored” to offer decision
aiding where it is most needed. For example, prior
testing may identify individuals who are more subject
than others to “availability bias” (overweighting of
recent information). Others may be more subject to
pseudodiagnosticity effects (failure to recognize the
redundancy of information). Screens could therefore
be designed to either remind individuals of “old” information, or to point out redundancy between incoming items of information (or even suppress redundant information). These decision aids could be
tailored to address an individual’s known weak
points.
The development of such “smart screens” would
presuppose the completion of research programs on
how cognitive biases influence financial decision-making. For example, if the kind of profit and loss
(P&L) account on traders’ screens does indeed affect
their risk-taking behavior, then desk managers should
choose to show P&L information that is the most likely
to influence a trader’s behavior in the desired way (e.g.,
indexed to the last day versus the whole year). Smart
49

<-----Page 13----->HILTON

screens may also require some expert system inference
engines to endow them with the capacity to recognize
which information is relevant to which decision. Nevertheless, such systems could play an important role in
ensuring that decision-makers have the relevant information in mind (and only that information) when making a decision. These kinds of systems have been
shown to have considerable success in improving medical decision-making.

Financial expert systems. Research has shown
that experts are regularly outperformed by simple regression equations based on the experts’own “theories”
about the relationships between variables (Camerer
[1981]). This phenomenon—known as bootstrapping—explains why computers can even outperform
super-experts whose knowledge was used to create
them. For example, Christine Downton, chief investment officer of fund manager Pareto partners in London, contributed her knowledge of investment decision-making to the creation of an expert system that
manages bond portfolios in twelve major markets. The
program uses rules that relate investment decisions to
fundamental economic indicators. Backtesting suggests that the model has “a potential to outperform the
index by 4%–5%.” Although Downton checks the
model’s predictions, she never alters its recommendations. She explains that “we implement exactly what it
says, we don’t second-guess it. Usually, if I second-guess it, I’m wrong. And that’s probably because I
got out of bed on the wrong side.” Her philosophy of the
market is that the winners are those with consistent
long-term views, while the losers are those who have no
views and change their minds on the basis of recent
data. “Most research into cognitive bias” says Downton
“suggests that investors tend to overweight recent information.”

Management control systems and trading
desks. The introduction of screen-based trading has
made management control and record-keeping much
easier. Desk managers may use their own screens to examine what their traders and dealers are doing at any
moment. The new technology has made new forms of
management control and compensation possible.
However, there seems to be little consensus (and,
again, less research) on what the best control and compensation systems would be. For example, would the
knowledge used to justify one’s decisions to a superior,
or even to one’s colleagues, lead to different decision-making patterns? Research on the effects of accountability on decision-making indicates that this is
often the case. For example, it is easy to imagine that
accountability will lead each member of a team of individuals to take less risky decisions in order to avoid the
50

opprobrium associated with a loss, although the team
manager’s preference would be for each individual to
take the risky choices, thus maximizing the probability
of collective gains. Accountability could thus, depending on the context, lead to better or to worse decisions
from the collective point of view. Research should be
done to ascertain the conditions under which accountability is likely to improve or worsen financial decision-making. These findings should give managers insights on when and how to make their subordinates
accountable for their decisions.
More generally, there is considerable theory and research in organizational behavior on methods of team
management and compensation practices. Again, there
seems to be plenty of scope for applying this research
to the analysis of financial institutions. Should desk
managers be directive or democratic in managing their
teams? Should they give regular feedback to traders
and dealers on their performance? A harder question
is: Should compensation be individual, collective, or a
mixture of the two?

Investment decision-making and fund management. The kinds of skills required by investment decision-makers (fund managers, corporate treasurers,
etc.) may be substantially different from those required
by traders and dealers. While traders and dealers continually monitor market prices, investment decision-makers may be expected to take longer-term views
and to be more interested in fundamentals. The thought
processes involved may be qualitatively different, in
that more weight is given to scenario construction and
testing using causal theories about market behavior.
The fact that a few fund managers have persistently outperformed market indices over many years
suggests that some investment styles are winners.
Nevertheless, the persistent failure of many managed
funds to outperform the stock index (Bernstein
[1996]) suggests that there is scope to improve investment decision-making. This view is reinforced by the
frequent failure of financial experts (reviewed above)
to make accurate forecasts. It would therefore seem
worthwhile to investigate investment decision-making
in more detail.
For example, overconfidence in the accuracy of
one’s predictions seems to be such a robust and widespread phenomenon that it is probably multiply determined. Contributing causes probably include information overload, confirmation bias, failure to recognize
informational redundancy, poor cue-outcome weighting, belief in illusory correlations between outcomes
and cues, and failure to learn from feedback (Hilton
[1998]). Research could be conducted on investment
decision-makers with the aim of identifying the most
common sources of bias. Does increasing the amount
of information available to a decision-maker increase

<-----Page 14----->FINANCIAL DECISION-MAKING

his confidence without a corresponding increase in accuracy? If we limit the information available to a decision-maker, what kind of information is most likely to
improve his accuracy?
In addition, policy capturing research may help differentiate the strategies used by successful and less
successful managers. Teaching managers about the
sources of their decision errors may help them overcome them.

Psychology and the Financial Markets:
Research Perspectives
From Behavioral Economics
to the Psychology of Financial
Decision-Making
In reviewing this area I was struck by how little empirical work has actually been done on the psychological processes underlying trading, dealing, and investment decision-making. This observation is made all
the more striking when one reads Slovic’s [1972] review of the field, which makes innumerable suggestions for studies that remain to be carried out, such as
policy capturing, how information acquisition may
lead to overconfidence, and how market players may
learn illusory correlations.
What has happened since Slovic’s [1972] review is
that economics has rediscovered psychology (Lewin
[1996]), and this has spawned the new discipline of
behavioral economics (Thaler [1992]). Although inspired by laboratory experiments in psychology (usually done on psychology students), the typical level of
analysis of behavioral economics remains that of market behavior. Behavioral economists typically use psychological findings on judgmental heuristics such as
availability, or overconfidence in judgments, to infer
explanations for observed market behavior as indexed
by price movements or volume of trading. The continuing stream of publications in behavioral economics attests to the success of this strategy in explaining market
irrationalities that conventional economic models have
difficulty explaining.
There has, however, been very little in-depth study
of the decision processes of finance professionals
themselves. Psychology here has much to offer, for in
better understanding the psychological causes of irrationality, managers are better placed to remedy them.
This is something that behavioral economics, with its
focus on understanding and predicting market behavior, is less well placed to do. Elsewhere, I detail the
kinds of specific studies based on the research reviewed in this article that could yield important policy
recommendations for financial managers and decision-makers (Hilton [1999]).

What Does the Psychology of Finance
Have to Offer the Markets?
Why fund psychological research on financial decision-making? I conclude this article with a simple
thought, and for those for whom that is not enough, a
simple calculation. The simple thought is that the efficiency of a “knowledge society” depends on the effectiveness with which that knowledge is used. For
the past forty years, experimental psychological research has been making considerable advances in uncovering the “cognitive unconscious,” which explains
why smart, healthy, and sane people systematically
make errors of judgment. Ingrained judgment strategies that may have been very adaptive in evolutionary
history may be very inadaptive when confronted with
complex problems in domains such as finance, law,
and medicine. But people are generally unaware of
their deficiencies, partly because almost everyone
else shares them. All this illustrates the acuity of La
Rochefoucauld’s observation that “Everyone complains about his memory, and no-one complains about
his judgment.”
The simple calculation is the following: A conservative estimate of net revenues from the London
money markets is $15,000 billion per year. If better use
of psychology contributed only an 0.1% increase in efficiency to revenue earnings in the City of London, this
alone would amount to a revenue increase of $15 billion a year. At the level of an individual firm we might
imagine a typical trading desk that trades government
securities and reports a trading profit of $50 million per
year. If a targeted psychological intervention led to a
1% increase in trading profits, this would increase trading profits for this company alone by $500,000 per
year. Assuming that the effect of the intervention lasted
ten years, this would amount to a net gain of $5 million.
I hope this helps the reader to decide the value of investing in psychology for the financial markets.
