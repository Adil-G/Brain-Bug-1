Several recent studies have examined the causes of success and failure in
new ventures. From these a three-level analysis has evolved, which considers the management, the venture’s strategy, and its competitive environment. Empirical testing is still at an early stage, but results have
generally supported the three-level approach. However, the findings are
not very strong.
This study considers only high potential, technology based new ventures-the
companies on
which venture capitalists concentrate. It suggests that such $rms face unusual time pressures and
uncertainty, and that their responses to these forces are major determinants of success or failure. We
propose II easily measured qualities-describing
management, the @m’s strategy, and its environment-which
should influence how quickly the venture can act. These should predict a new venture’s
performance.
The I1 attributes are tested on 36 new ventures, representing essentially all of the startup
investments of a major venture capital firm between 1974 and 1982. The data are taken from the
firms’ original business plans. Performance is measured from the subsequent financial history, using
the compound rate of return to all shareholders (founders, employees, and investors).
The ventures in this sample are primarily based on electronic or information technologies. They
are highly successful as a group, with an average compound rate of return of 98% per year. They
are also very risky; the standard deviation of returns is 171% per year, and in I1 of 36 cases the
shareholders lost on their investments.
Results from a single sample must always be treated cautiously. However, several findings are
strong enough to merit further study and to be incorporated as a part of a process for evaluating new
ventures:

development time of 12 months and an optimum number of customers of approximately 60.
Three other measures-prior
shared experience of the founders, competitive conditions, and
projected market share-show
an influence when management, strategy, and environment
are examined one area at a time.
These relatively simple measures predict success well, probably at least as well as any other
study has done using more subtle measures.
The measures used in this study, though they have strong predictive power, apparently did
not influence the young capitalists. Otherwise the relationships should have been different
when the return to venture capital investors was used in place of the total return; in fact
they were the same. This suggests that the venture capital investors did not give sufticient
weight to the qualities that we consider, and could make better choices by giving greater
attention to those measures.
Prospective entrepreneurs and investors should benefit from using our model as part of their
screening processes. Specifically, they might calculate a predicted rate of return. If it is
low-say,
below 30% per year-they
should examine the reason for the low score and
consider whether circumstances exist which outweigh or invalidate that apparent weakness.
An “additive” model seems realistic. That is, one can combine dissimilar qualities (with
appropriate weighting for relative importance) to arrive at an overall figure of merit with
strong predictive power. The spectjicparameters imply that a company must have a complete
management team and score well on two of the remaining three measures in order to be an
attractive opportunity. More generally, the model allows a practitioner to make a rough
assessment of the tradeoffs among management, product, and industry. This is important
because few, if any, new companies have all the qualities an investor may desire.
Although individual qualities of the founders are no doubt important, this remains a dtjficult
matter to demonstrate statistically.
Firms exist in an ever changing competitive environment. To the extent that these jndings
are valid beyond this sample, they may have been recognized and incorporated in more
recent new ventures. If so this may change the nature of competition, and alter the key
determinants of success or failure.

INTRODUCTION
Several recent papers have examined the causes of success or failure of new ventures, using
a variety of approaches. Khan (1987), MacMillan et al. (1987), and Tyebjee and Bruno
(1984) examine the problem indirectly by considering how venture capitalists make investment decisions. Stuart and Abetti (1987) adapt studies of new product success to apply to
new ventures. Van de Ven et al. (1984) focus on management processes during the early
years of 12 software companies, looking for attributes that separate the successful firms
from the others. Sandberg and Hofer (1987) embody the viewpoint of strategic management.
Using the business plans of 17 new firms, they identify attributes of the business strategies,
and industry structures, which are related to subsequent success.
Although Sandberg and Hofer are the most explicit, all of the above studies employ
a “multi-level”
framework which considers the firm from the viewpoints of the managers,
the business idea, and the environment. Their implicit hypothesis is an extension of American
folklore: “being in the right place at the right time. ” That is, a successful firm exhibits
compatibility among its business environment,
its products, and its managers. Such a hypothesis is intuitively plausible, and the empirical results generally support it. But there are
important limitations and contradictions. For example, none of the studies can simultaneously
show the importance of management,
environment,
and business strategy.
This study builds on the work of Roure and Maidique (1986) to modify the analytical

framework discussed above. Rome and Maidique’s exploratory study proposed 10 predictors
of success and applied them to a sample of eight new ventures. This study extends their
work in several ways:
1. It augments their theoretical framework with concepts from organizational development
and from strategic management.
2. It develops scales for their qualitative variables and adds a new measure of product
strategy-projected
product development time.
3. It adds 28 companies to the original sample, making a total of 36 high potential, technology based companies. ’ This allows statistical analysis to replace the qualitative comparisons of their exploratory study.
4. It incorporates measures of performance that permit the use of multiple regression analysis. This facilitates assessment of the relative importance of each explanatory variable,
not just its statistical significance in a bivariate comparison.
Our sample includes several industries. In the next section we discuss why our newness
itself should produce a set of common influences on performance, which transcend industry
differences. The section on Methodology describes the selection of variables, the sample,
and the linear regression model used in the analysis. A section on Results presents our
findings, and the Conclusion suggestions why certain hypotheses were not confirmed and
summarizes the strongest findings.

A FRAMEWORK FOR PREDICTING SUCCESS
A new, high potential venture enters a market large enough to attract competition from firms
in related industries and from other startups. It must establish a position quickly in the face
uncertainty. This involves a series of challenges,2 including

“‘High potential” signifies an objective of achieving annual sales of well over $1O,OOO,OOOwithin a few
years. “Technology based” implies that the firms rely on a technological advantage as a key element of their initial
strategies.
None of the prior studies focuses on high potential, technology based venture-a
very important group in
our society. Two (Stuart and Abetti 1987; Van de Ven et al. 1984) study small, technology based ventures-sales
averaged $300,000 three years after formation. The others used samples with a mixture of technologies and potential
firm sizes.
2Ruhnka and Young (1987) survey 73 venture capital firms regarding the tasks confronting new firms.
Terminology and timing of activities varies among the respondents, but all of the tasks listed here are clearly
identified by them as being important during a firm’s early years.

Success is a matter of degree. The greater the number of tasks that are accomplished rapidly
and efficiently, the larger market share, profitability, and return on investment expected.
This implies that the three viewpoints---namely, the qualities of the founders, the environment, and the business strategy-should explain success or failure to the degree they reflect
how rapidly, efficiently, and effectively a firm accomplishes the above tasks. We believe
the three areas are “additive,” in the sense that strength on one attribute can compensate for
weakness on another. This creates an eclectic framework; we can not rely solely on social
psychology, industrial economics, or strategic management.3 Nonetheless, the idea of urgency in the face of high uncertainty provides a unifying theme-a theme that we expect
to override the influence of the particular industries (within the limited range of technology
based industries) of our new ventures.

The Founding Management
The founders may be analyzed as individuals and as a team. Regarding individual traits,
one would expect the fastest progress from ventures whose managers have all of the skills,
knowledge, and relationships needed to excel at their jobs. There would be minimal on-thejob training during the startup period. This expectation is supported by several studies,
although the results are tentative. MacMill~ et al. (1987) and Vesper (1980) state that
relevant experience is a characteristic of successful entrepreneurs. Cooper and Bruno (1977)
report that successful firms have founders with relevant experience more frequently than
unsuccessful ones, a finding that is supported by Van de Ven et al. (1984).
The value of relevant experience seems clear from theory and from empirical studies;
however, business plans vary widely regarding availability of biographical data. Thus we
must compromise between the information we would really prefer to have and what is
available. “Relevant experience” will be measured in two ways:
* By the percentage of founders who have held a position similar to the one being
assumed in the new company (with “similar” being defined as the same function
and within one level of that being assumed), and
l

By the percentage of founders who have worked in high growth (defined as sales
growth over 25% annually) organizations.

In addition to individual qualifications, the ability of the founders as a team should
influence performance. For example, if the founders have complementary expertise, they
are more likely to avoid errors in key choices such as selecting suppliers or distribution
channels. Additionally, smooth interaction among the members should enhance efficiency.
These views receive support from organization researchers. Hackman and Oldham (1980)
believe a group’s performance is influenced by its composition. Specifically, it must be large
enough to do its task, but not much larger. Its members must have at least a moderate level
of interpersonal skill in addition to their task-relevant skills. And there must be a balance
between the shared values and diversity of the members’ skills and knowledge.
In this study’s exploratory phase (Rome and Maidique 1986), two ch~cte~stics of
the team seem to distinguish between success and failure: (1) the degree of completeness,
or the percentage of essential functions in the new company that are filled by the founders’
team at the time of funding; and (2) the extent to which founders had previously worked in
the same org~i~ation.
3This is discussed by Roure (1986) in an extensive literahue review.

Completeness of the team fits Hackman and Oldham’s idea that a group must be large
enough to do its task. In addition the more complete the team the broader its set of contacts
with customers, suppliers, potential employees, consultants, and investors. As Aldrich and
Zimmer (1986) suggest, this should increase the efficiency and adaptability of a young firm.
The importance of prior shared experience receives support from theories of group
development. Tuckman (1965) suggests that a group evolves through four stages: forming,
storming, norming, and performing. That is, members of a newly formed group must initially
reach agreement about how they will proceed in developing a task. As Hackman and Oldham
(1980) suggest, group members already familiar with one another may not need to talk at
all about their roles, since all members know from previous experience how to proceed in
most situations. Katz (1982), in his study of R&D groups’ effectiveness, explains the upward
slope noticed in teams’ performance during the initial months of working together as positive
effects of learning and team building.
If the founders have previously worked in the same firm, they can hasten the integrating
and developing process described above, and move on to performance. There may be a
negative side as well. Common backgrounds may decrease the diversity of experience and
contacts. Thus some prior joint experience may be better than having all team members
come from a common employer. The same may be said of team completeness.
Hackman
and Oldham suggest that a team can be too large, becoming inefficient as well as expensive.
In our empirical work, we will examine whether both team variables have their maximum
intluence at less than 100%.

The Environment
The environment,
particularly the structure of the company’s industry, is widely recognized
as an influence on new organizations.
Theoretical treatments include population ecology,
resource dependency,
and industrial economics, with competition being perhaps the most
widely studied environmental
factor. Brittain and Freeman (1980), in their study of the
semiconductor industry, suggest that significant technological innovations or changes in the
social system create new niches, which provide opportunities
for the formation of new
organization.
Such situations are characterized by low competition. Under such conditions
the authors argue that new companies adopting a first mover approach (or r-strategist type
of organizational
form proposed by Hannan and Freeman 1977) will have a temporary
competitive advantage. Technological change may also create conditions of high “variability”
and the alteration of “selection criteria,” factors that Aldrich (1979) argues will promote the
emergence of new organizations.
Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) pursued a related argument. They suggest that organizations
enhance their odds of success if they can control external contingencies.
New companies
may try to control their destinies by locating market niches with low levels of competition,
markets in which they anticipate a major role in shaping standards and customer expectations.
In this study’s exploratory stage (Roure and Maidique 1986), three successful firms
entered markets that had no dominant competitor. The fourth entered a market with two
strong competitors, but did not challenge them directly. Instead, it would be a “second
source” for their products. In contrast, two unsuccessful ventures tried to compete head-on
with a strong leader. The two other failures entered markets with several existing competitors
and other major firms clearly planning to enter.
The exploratory research also found that the successful companies targeted higher
market shares than the unsuccessful
ones. This is consistent with Pfeffer and Salancik’s

<-----Page 5----->206

J.B. ROURE AND R.H. KEELEY

theory that firms try to influence customer expectations. A high market share may also reflect
competitive conditions-the
higher the market share, the less important the competition. On
the other hand, it may imply excessive ambition in a firm where time and funds are limited,
suggesting that a moderate share may be better than a very large or a very small one. In
addition, market share is subject to measurement problems in segmented markets-which
most of ours are.
We view the level of competition and the projected market share as overlapping, but
not identical, indicators of how attractive a firm’s environment is. Competition should be
monotonically
related to success; market share may not be.
A third environmental
factor is the level of buyer concentration.
Very low buyer
concentration means that the new venture will serve a large number of potential customers
of limited individual buying capacity. Very high concentration
implies the opposite. All
four successful companies in the exploratory research (Roure and Maidique 1986), but only
one of four failures, have high levels of buyer concentration.
This result is consistent with
two arguments of Pfeffer and Salancik’s (1978) resource dependency theory. First, in the
face of high uncertainty an organization attempts to control its fate through close linkages
with its environment (e.g., customers). Second, the broader the demands on a firm the more
difficult it is to manage.
This suggests that successful startups will establish close links with their potential
customers, which is not possible with large numbers of customers. On the other side, as
Porter (1980) notes, to depend on a very small number of buyers will increase their bargaining
power, and may lower the probability of success for the new company. Thus we expect the
success of a new venture to have an inverted U-shaped relationship to the number of potential
buyers.
The resource dependency theory of Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) suggests another
environmental linkage: ownership. Companies with high growth potential require substantial
funding, which they secure through venture capital. Venture capitalists, in addition to providing funds, act as links with the business community,
providing access to customers,
suppliers, financial institutions, and key people who could collaborate with the venture. The
proportion of equity owned by the external investors may influence their eagerness to provide
such access. A competing need is that the founders’ incentives may be similarly influenced.
Interviews with venture capitalists during the exploratory research indicate that external
investors and entrepreneurs must both be highly motivated in order for a venture to succeed.
This implies the equity should be structured such that both benefit significantly from the
venture’s success--a
hypothesis that was not supported in the exploratory study of eight
companies (Roure and Maidique 1986). This study provides a further opportunity to test
whether the share of equity owned by the founders will have an inverted U-shaped relationship
to the success of the venture, as the resource dependency theory and the preliminary interviews suggest.

The Fii: Strategic Choices
Of the firm’s strategic choices, product policy is often the most important for technology
based ventures, and is the main subject of this section. The technological advantage of a
product can be estimated from its projected performance and cost vis a vis its competitors.
Studies (e.g., Cooper 1979) find that products that are unique or superior in the eyes of the
customer tend to be successful. Maidique and Zirger (1984) support the value of technical
superiority as well as finding an advantage for lower cost. The exploratory phase of this

<-----Page 6----->PREDICTORS

OF TECHNOLOGY

BASED VENTURE

SUCCESS

207

study (Roure and Maidique 1986) finds that expected performance improvement differentiates
successful companies from unsuccessful ones, but cost reduction does not. We speculate
that performance improvements (usually based on technological changes in the design) are
less easily matched by established firms than are cost reductions, and are less likely to meet
an effective competitive response. Thus we expect the success of a new venture to be
positively related to its product’s projected level of performance improvement.
Related to technological superiority is the question of how much time to spend on
product development.
Given the emphasis on urgency, a short development time seems
desirable; however, this may be overdone. If the development time is very short, the product
may be easily imitated. Therefore, we expect the estimated development time for the first
product to have an inverted U-shaped relationship to the success of the venture.
A third aspect of a new firm’s strategy, which has been important in other studies, is
the way it plans. Van de Ven (1980) finds that the conditions of the planning process during
the creation of new organizations affect their startup performance. His study highlights the
importance of a systematic planning process. Furthermore, Bourgeois and Eisenhardt (1985)
also find that in rapidly changing environments the more successful technological firms use
a rational, analytic planning process. New, high potential ventures may have a particular
need for a well stated plan, because their organizations expand rapidly and they need to
communicate their mission effectively to new employees, potential suppliers, investors, and
others.
The value of a plan may be difficult to demonstrate, because there is little variation
among plans in our sample. Even so, the preliminary phase of this research shows a qualitative
difference between the plans of successful and unsuccessful firms (Roure and Maidique
1986). Successful technological ventures seem to plan product development in greater detail.
This finding coincides with a major conclusion of the Stanford Innovation Project (SINPRO)
on new product success and failure (Maidique and Zirger 1984). Therefore, we expect that
the level of detail in planning the development of the technology will be positively related
to the success of the venture.

METHODOLOGY
Having suggested why a set of common influences should exist and what they should be,
we turn to empirical testing. Two prominent venture capital firms (who requested anonymity)
provided business plans and investment documents on 36 new, technology-based
companies,
in which they had invested.4 From these we recorded the necessary data.
Only firms that received financing are included in the study. This may produce certain
limitations in our findings. For example, if these two venture capitalists invest only in
management teams with adequate experience, experience may not explain performance in
this sample, even though it would have a powerful effect in a more diverse population. This
limitation works only in one direction. If one of our measures affects performance, we can
say that it is important. But the absence of an effect does not imply irrelevance of a measure
for values beyond the range of our sample.
We will use a multivariate linear regression because it fits the theory that perfor%vo business plans were obtained from one fund in a preliminary stage of the study. The other 34 were
obtained from the second, which was closer and therefore easier to work with. The 34 represent all but four (whose
business plans were missing) of the startup investments of this fund between 1974 and 1982. Performance of the
four with missing plans was available and seemed typical of the others. One was a highly successful public
company, one had failed, and two were doing moderately well.

mance is an additive result of many influences. Such a model implies that the performance of every company in the population is a single additive function of the independent variables plus a normally distributed error term. An obvious concern is whether a
cross sectional sample from several industries can be described by a single function. We
have tried to control this a priori by using a single venture capital firm as the source of
virtually all of our data (each venture capitalist we interviewed invested in a limited range
of industries, technologies, and risks). Another concern is whether the ordinal measures
we use in some cases (e.g., product superiority) will have a linear relationship with performance. Such concerns are best addressed empirically, and we perform several tests:
(1) the residuals are tested for normality and for heteroskedasticity; (2) the independent
variables are tested for interactions (non-additivity~, for non-line~ty~xcept
where we
expect it, and for high intercorrelations; (3) possible influence based on industry or holding period is tested using additional variables.
Three separate regressions, one each for management, environment, and strategy, are
used to examine the relative influence of variables within each point of view. Additionally,
a regression combining variables from all points of view examines the extent to which some
may dominate others.

Description of the. Sampie
All 36 companies studied were started after 1974, 30 between 1978 and 1982. Usually, they
existed for some time before receiving their first major funding ($300,000 or more). Twenty
eight companies make electronic or electromechanical products, including five semiconductor
companies and 14 makers of computer equipment. Three firms produce computer software.
Four are in biotechnology or medical equipment.
All were started in the United States in regions with a supportive local infrastructure.
Twenty five were in California. They received an average of four rounds of venture capital
funding from an average of six venture capital investors. Altogether 119 venture capital
firms invested in these companies. Unsuccessful companies average more rounds of financing
from venture capitalists (5.7 rounds) than successful ones (3.7 rounds), and remain in the
venture capitalists’ portfolios longer (59 months versus 44 months).

A principal purpose of a new venture is to create value, which we measure by the internal
rate of return realized by shareholders (i.e., founders, subsequent employees, and investors).
We consider two rates of return: that realized by the venture capital investors, and that
realized by the shareholders as a whole. In principle, the explanatory variables may inffuence
these quite differently. For example, if the effect of team completeness were well known
and the venture capital market were highly competitive, investors would attach higher values
to ventures with complete teams and would receive (on the average) a return which is just
enough to compensate for their risks. The founders and employees would capture all of the
excess value. In such a case team completeness might predict the internal rate of return for
the firm as a whole, but not for the investors.
We view a measure based on a company’s market value as superior to the more
common subjective assessments of success or to accounting measures such as sales or market
share. The shortcomings of accounting measures are well summarized by Benston (1985)

<-----Page 8----->PREDICTORS OF TECHNOLOGY BASED VJZNTURE SUCCESS

209

and Beaver (1981). Beaver also reviews the major advantages of market value measures.
Market values are themselves subjective assessments, but they may be viewed as “best
subjective assessments” in the sense that they represent a pooling of expert judgments, take
account of varying circumstances, incorporate info~ation from all sources, and embody
strong economic incentives.
The rate of return is calculated by considering the funds invested in each financing
round as negative cash flows. A single positive cash flow is assigned to the time when
the company holds an initial public offering, is sold, or is written off-using the price at
which the event occurs. Companies still in the venture capital firms’ po~folios in June
1988 are assigned a value at the time of their last investment equal to the price per share
of that round multiplied by the number of shares existing prior to the round. Of the 36
firms 12 were public, nine had been acquired, three had been written off, and 12 were
still in the portfolios.

Independent Variables
Our earlier discussion of management, environment, and strategy identified 11 independent
variables that we expect to influence the success of new ventures. They are shown in Table
1. They are designed to be easily measured and, hence, replicated in other samples. Summ~
statistics for each variable are shown in Table 2.

involved two technologies-such as electronic and mechanical design).
Team completeness

This reflects the extent to which founders* had previousfy worked in the same
organization for at least six months. Several measures were tested; the one used here considers the leader
(usually the CEO) and the three other founders with the greatest joint experience. For each common employer
between the leader and another founder a value of 20 is given. For each common employer among the three
other founders a value of 10 is given. The combination produces a range of 90 points which is arbitrarily set
from 10 to 100.

of the firm, (2) to become employees of the company within the tint year after the initial funding date, and (3) to share in the
ownership of the company in a significant manner.

The measures are taken directly from the business plans. Any inaccuracies in the plans
will carry over to the data. With four possible exceptions discussed below, we believe such
inaccuracies are not common, because the venture capitalists’ notes show extensive verification of the plans and corrections are rare.
Two variables, projected market share and projected time of product development, are
inherently subject to error (compared to the plan writer’s true belief or compared to the
actual outcome). This may diminish their predictive ability. Two other variables, competition
and product superiority, are the researcher’s assessment from evidence in the plan. To
minimize possible biases a set of guidelines are followed (which are summarized in Table
I), and these variables were assessed prior to collection of financial results. Nonetheless,
some of the ventures are very well known, and possible bias from knowledge of actual
performance remains a possibility. We will return to this during the discussion of results.

Five multiple regression analyses, shown in Tables 3 to 7, test the model. Table 3 deals

variance). The third indicates the I statistics and significance levels of the coefficients. All
variables are identified by the symbols shown in Tables 1 and 2.
Each table presents at least three relationships.
The first regresses the explanatory
variables on rate of return to all owners (IRR .&. The second incorporates a time variable
(the inverse of the holding period, l/T), because the rates of return (and their variation)
tend to fall as the holding period increases. This helps eliminate any spurious effects caused
by a correlation between an explanatory variable and time. The third equation multiplies
the holding period by the IRR to all owners .5 It corrects effectively for heteroskedasticity
of the residuals, which creates a possibility that significance levels are misstated in other
equations. The significance levels and standardized coefficients of the corrected equation
are very similar to the others, which indicates that the coefficients and significance levels
are probably reasonable in all equations.
In Tables 3 and 7 a fourth equation shows the regression on the IRR to investors only
(it is omitted in the other tables because these examples sufficiently illustrate the result). As
noted earlier these results could be quite different from the regression on IRR to all shareholders, but they are not. Standardized coefficients are very similar, and no variable that
explains overall returns fails to explain investor returns at about the same significance level.
Apparently the explanatory variables do not have much effect on an investment’s price (i.e.,
the relative ownership of founders and investors).
Except for heteroskedasticity,
the models seem reasonably well specified. Residuals
are probably not normal-in
most regressions normality is rejected at about 0.15 level. But
they do not exhibit the “fat tails” that tend to invalidate significance tests. Some explanatory
variables have intercorrelations
as high as 0.6, but tests of multicollinearity
do not show
this to be unduly high. Possible nonlinear relationships
are considered by including the

squared values of the explanatory variables. None added significant explanatory power in
any question (except with development time and buyer concen~ation where it was expected).
In some cases the second power alone was as good as the linear term alone. Dummy variables
for each industry were not significantly different from zero, which supports the view that
the sample is homogeneous.

Relatio~~p

Between Managers’ Characteristics and Success

Table 3 provides no support for the importance of individual characteristics on the firm’s
success. The measures of high growth experience (HIGROW) and similar functional experience (SIMEXP) have very low I statistics in all equations. This should be interpreted
cautiously. The high mean values and low standard deviations of the explanatory variables,
as shown in Table 2, suggest that most of the firms in the sample may be amply qualified
on both measures, and that above some threshold additional qualifications add no value.
Informally supporting this interpretation is the founders’ average experience of 11 years in
their industries, in positions similar to the ones they assumed in their new companies. Only
19 of 144 founders had not served previously in a similar position, and those 19 became
general managers for the first time.
In contrast to individual traits the team measures, completeness (COMPL), and prior
joint experience (JTEXP), are related to success. These relations appear to be linear.

Relatio~~p

Between the En~o~ent

and Success

Table 4 indicates that environmental characteristics are effective predictors of success. Three
of the four influences that we proposed are significant. Competition in the targeted market
segment (COMPETE) is negatively related to success, and projected market share (MKTSHR)
has a positive relationship. As noted earlier, competition is assessed by the researcher and
is subject to bias based on ex post facto,~owl~ge.
The standardized coefficient of competition is about the same as that of projected market share, which suggests any bias is
modest-otherwise competition should have the stronger explanatory power.
Table 4 also shows that the number of potential buyers (CONC) targeted by the new
company has an inverted U-shaped relationship to the success of the venture (p < .05). By
taking the derivative of performance with respect to buyer concentration we find the optimal
concentration to be about three, implying a customer group numbering 30 to 99.
The postulated relationship between the share of equity owned by the founders (PDRSH)
and the new company’s success is apparently not true. None of the coefficients of founders’
equity are significant. As with the measures of individual qualifications, our finding may
occur because all firms in the sample arranged a division of equity with adequate incentives
for both founder and investors. More extreme divisions might influence performance.

Relationship Between Strategic Choices and Success
Table 5 suggests that of the variables describing the firm-planning of the technology
development, projected time of product development, and product su~~o~ty~nly
product
superiority is a good predictor of success. Development time has the expected behavior in
Equations 8 and 10, but it is not significant in combination with product superiority.
Product superiority is a judgmental measure, and we would like to have a nonjudgmental measure of product strategy to support it. Accordingly, we analyzed development

time alone. The results, shown in Table 6 are significant (p < .Ol in Equations 11 and 13
and p < .10 in Equation 12) and show the inverted U-shaped relationship.
Setting the
derivative of performance equal to 0 indicates an optimal development time of 12.2 to 12.4
months in the three equations.6 A comparison of R2 in Tables 6 and 7 suggests that development time is roughly as strong a predictor as product superiority. Product superiority is
subject to the researcher’s judgment and is therefore potentially biased. Its parity with the
more objective development time suggests that any bias is minor.
The quality of the technical development plan does not influence success according
to Table 5. This should be interpreted cautiously, it could mean that technical planning is
important, but that business plans do not accurately reflect technical planning.

Combining the Team, Firm, and Environmental

Viewpoints

The significant variables of Tables 3 through 6 are combined in a single regression in Table
7, showing only the variables that generally remain significant at a 10% level or better.
They include measures from each area-the
team, the firm’s strategic choices, and the
environment-indicating
that all three contribute to success. In Equation 14, four predictive
variables (team completeness, product superiority, buyer concentration,
and development
time-the
latter two as quadratic functions) explain 57% of the variance, a considerable
improvement over the regressions with only one viewpoint. Equation 15, which incorporates
time as a variable, and Equation 16, which uses the product of return and time as a measure
of success, are similar to Equation 14. Equation 17 illustrates again that the IRR to investors
behaves similarly to the IRR for all shareholders-the
explanatory variables apparently do
not measurably influence pricing, even though they can predict results.
Three variables-prior
joint experience, industry competitiveness,
and projected market share-no
longer show any explanatory power. Given our limited sample, these should
not be discarded as influences on success; further tests on other samples are needed.
Table 7 shows the advantages of simultaneously
considering management, strategy,
6We also examined an interactive form in which product superiority and a quadratic function of development
time are multiplied. This had stronger explanatory power than the forms shown in Tables 5 and 6. The implication
is that superiority has enhanced value if obtained in the optimum amount of time (probably this also corrects as
well for erroneous overestimates of product superiority combined with a short development time).

dimensions. Explanatory power jumps substantially.
A comparison of
variables from different areas is possible. ‘Ihe relative importance of variables can be assessed, which is much stronger than just knowing their effects are non-zero; and the multivariate approach strengthens some findings (development time) while suggesting others
may be spurious (market share, prior joint experience, and competition).

CONCLUSION
The study of new venture performance is still at an early stage, and our findings must be
viewed as tentative. In addition, the nature of the competition implies that successful approaches will be imitated and that such imitation will tend to change the relationships reported
here. While acknowledging the need for caution, we are encouraged by the results:
1. Success in new ventures is explainable using theories developed for other purposesorganizational behavior, industrial organization, and strategic management. By selecting
among them for attributes that allow an organization to move quickly, we obtained a
preliminary
set of 11 qualities. Our sample confirms that seven of them behave as
expected. Three others show no influence, perhaps because of a lack of sufficient variation
in this sample. Only one, technical planning, seems conclusively to have no influence,
possibly because business plans do not reflect the underlying amount of technical planning.
2. Success requires appropriate choices of management, industry, and strategy. Weakness
in one can be offset by strength in another.
3. A multi-industry
sample, united by a common investor (who has relatively uniform
selection criteria), appears to be reasonably homogeneous.
This is fortunate because
single industry samples of new ventures are possible in only a few industries (e.g., disk
memories and some types of software). The apparent absence of industry-specific results
suggests that common elements, such as urgency and uncertainty, may determine the
performance of many new ventures.
4. If our model extends to multiple funds-which
we are testing with a follow-up studyit would be transferrable across industries and investors, at least within the family of
high potential, technology-based
new ventures. This would strengthen the results of multiinvestor studies (such as MacMillan et al. 1987; or Sandberg and Hofer 1987), which
are necessary in many cases to obtain adequate sample sizes.
5. Success may be predictable to some extent with simple variables that do not require
expert assessment. This allows easy replication across time and across samples, permitting
the detection of trends, changes in the relative importance of variables, and so forth.
Detection of variations across funds, industries, and time has special value in a field such
as new ventures where many studies are questionnaire-based
and not easily replicated.
It helps calibrate the range over which other studies may be applied.
6. An unambiguous
measure of success-the
internal rate of return on investment-has
been shown to perform well as a dependent variable. It produces a well specified linear
regression model and transcends the industry-specific
variations one finds in accounting
measures.
We believe the study can be extended in several directions, some of which are indicated
above. We also plan to study these firms over time to verify the ways in which the explanatory
variables exert their influence.
