a b s t r a c t
Entrepreneurs’, college students’ and criminals’ risk-taking were compared in hypothetical
bet situations. The level of uncertainty and the amount staked were varied in gain and loss
situations. Potential proﬁt motivates entrepreneurs to choose higher stakes, expected loss
will prompt the avoidance of risk. In proﬁt-making situations, college students’ strategies
are different: Students’ decisions are more inﬂuenced by probability factors than by the
amount staked. Risk-taking tendency of criminals is higher than that of the other two groups,
without applying a consistent strategy in taking risk.

Our stereotyped image of various groups is typically linked to their inclination to take risks. We expect increased risktaking in certain age groups (adolescents), discover it in people’s favorite activities (e.g. hang gliding), in lifestyles (alcohol and
drug use), in occupations (entrepreneurs, car racers), and in deﬁance to social norms (convicts). Risk-taking has positive and
negative meaning as well. Entrepreneurs’ behavior when taking risk is considered adaptive, thus has positive meaning, while
committing criminal act is considered as a maladaptive behavior, thus negative. In the present study we try to distinguish
adaptive and non-adaptive risk-taking by concentrating not only on the amount of risk taken by different groups of people,
but on the strategy of the risk-taking behavior. With this aim in mind we focus the attention on the risk-taking of two groups,
namely, that of entrepreneurs and convicts, and compare them to a control group, students.
Risk-taking was studied from a normative point of view in the decision-making framework. It is a well-documented
knowledge that people are not consistent in their risky choices. The inconsistency toward risk was demonstrated by Tversky
and Kahneman (1981); Tversky et al. (1990). In the same situation formulated in a different way, people preferred different
alternatives because of different framing, and proved to be risk avoidant in gain, and risk seekers in loss situations. People
often choose certain alternatives even if their expected usefulness is smaller than that of the risky alternative. Taking the
example of lottery: It is deﬁnitely not worth playing in the lottery, since the probability of the return of the invested money is
negligible, but the hope for a big prize and the small amount of the investment clouds rationality. Yet people playing on the

lottery are not risk takers, and many of them strive for high levels of certainty in other areas of life. The example of the lottery
also proves that decision makers in everyday life do not think along the lines of normatives. Sometimes the expected amount
of proﬁt attracts them, disregarding probabilities, while at other times the desire for certainty is their decisive motive, and
they do not plunge into situations of great opportunities.
The decision maker may choose along a criterion, which is in harmony with his/her personal strivings. Game theory has
identiﬁed several such strategies: e.g. persons following the maximax strategy optimistically chooses the alternative in which
the chances of winning are the highest, regardless of losses and probabilities; maximin is a pessimistic choice, where the
person examines how s/he can get the most out of the bad outcomes; while minimax starts from the regret s/he would feel if
s/he missed a proﬁt by not choosing the alternative. This analysis assumes consistency of choice on the part of the decision
maker, and the strategies may be translated into the terms of risk-taking (maximax) and risk avoidance (maximin).
Risk-taking is always in the fore when characterizing entrepreneurs. This is not surprising, since due to the incalculable
behavior of consumers and competitors, entrepreneurs unavoidably face risks when making decisions (e.g. about entering a
new market, or manufacturing a new product). Although different aspects of the behavior of entrepreneurs are emphasized
by various authors (e.g. readiness for innovation by Schumpeter, 1934; recognition of opportunities by Kirzner, 1973; selfconﬁdent and independent decision-making in uncertain situations by Knight, 1921), all of the views include the opinion
that entrepreneurs do not shrink from risky solutions if they hope for great proﬁt or success. Stewart et al. (1998) propose
that individual personality features, like risk-taking propensity, innovativeness and achievement motivation are the most
important characteristics of entrepreneurship. According to Sitkin and Pablo (1992) risk propensity is the determinant of
risk behavior in organizations.
Instead of personality characteristics, a number of researches have focused on the process of risky decision-making of
entrepreneurs.
The studies conducted by Palich and Bagby (1995) set out from the observation that entrepreneurs may behave in various
ways: Some grab opportunities, others get frightened at risks; some carry ﬂourishing businesses, others become bankrupt.
The authors recommend taking a cognitive approach instead of the supposedly futile search for personality characteristics.
In their studies, entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs had to form opinions about various business scenarios. The authors
found a difference between the groups in the categorization of the situations: The entrepreneurs found the situations more
positive, noticed the strengths more than the weaknesses, saw more opportunities than threats, and discovered more progress
than failure in these situations. However, no difference between the tendencies of risk-taking was found between the groups.
Forlani and Mullins (2000) complain that despite the importance of risk-taking, there are relatively few studies regarding
how behavior is inﬂuenced by the various components of risky behavior, i.e., by risk perception (how dangerous the subject
perceives the situation to be), by expected outcome (extent of proﬁt and loss), by probability (the chances of an event taking
place), and by willingness of taking risks. In their study, entrepreneurs evaluated hypothetical businesses. It was found that
the respondents were willing to take greater risks if the situation promised great enough proﬁt (they could choose from
four possible investments: Business risking a smaller or greater amount of money, associated with a smaller or greater
probability of success). Great risk-taking, however, was present only in cases of large amounts of money. The respondents
avoided highly uncertain situations. It was not only risk itself, but also its different perception and the individuals’ risk-taking
tendency also inﬂuenced the respondents’ behavior. Risk-taking tendency had no effect on perception, but did on choice. In
a ﬁeld experiment where the impact of the available resources, the aspiration level, and the risk-taking propensity of the
individual was studied Faragó (2005) found that students took much smaller risk in real situations where they had to face
real consequences, compared to a control laboratory group. Risk-taking tendency diminished in the loss, compared to gain
condition.
Shapira (1995) investigated manager’s risk-taking and found that managers focuses their attention on the amount of gain
or losses and tend to disregard probability.
Much research and several related theories have identiﬁed risk-taking as an important component of criminal behavior.
Gottfredson and Hirschi (1990) demonstrated the connection between criminal behavior and poor self-control in their theory,
considering risk-taking an important component of self-control. Grasmick et al. (1993) and Romero et al. (2003) considered
self-control as a multidimensional construct whose leading factor was impulsive risk-taking. One of the key momentums
of Farrington’s (1995) theory based on a 24-year longitudinal study is decision-making prior to the criminal act, which is
based on the cost-beneﬁt analysis well known from economics, i.e., if the expected beneﬁt is greater than the cost (being
caught), the criminal act will be very likely to take place. Naturally, the evaluation of both cost and that of beneﬁt are highly
subjective, they greatly depend on the personality, values, attitude and previous experiences of the person and on the given
situation. Thus, the criminal perpetrator always takes a great risk when making a positive decision.
Violent criminals are doubly risk takers: On the one hand, the criminal act itself involves a risk (counter-attack by the
attacked person or attack by the arriving authorities), and on the other hand, the person risks imprisonment if got caught.
In his phenomenological approach, Lyng (1993) proposes that there are important instances of similarity between risktaking and criminal behavior with respect to the experience. In his view, the experience of the extension of control and
the bombardment of boundaries add important plus to the actor, thus, risk-taking is a strong reinforcer of self-image. The
experience and the motivation are similar, but the difference is that well-socialized persons direct their risk-taking behavior
to socially accepted areas, while poorly socialized persons act on their similar tendencies in socially unaccepted ﬁelds.
Studying the relationship between personality and criminal behavior, and based on the personality test (MPQ) of 800
young people, Krueger et al. (1994) found no difference between criminals and non-criminals along the dimension of risk-

taking. Lane and Cherek (2000) asked their adolescent subjects to choose between risky and non-risky alternatives in a
risk-taking task. The tasks called for big proﬁts with low probability and small losses with high probability. The potentially
criminal youngsters chose risky solutions more often, gained smaller proﬁts by the end of the experiment, and if taking a
risk proved to be a lucky choice, they stuck to it for a prolonged period. Stewart and Hemsley (1984) studied the expectation
of winning in criminals, and found that this group expects greater proﬁts in hypothetical criminal situations, because they
estimate the level of risk to be lower.
If we investigate risk-taking of entrepreneurs and convicts, it can be assumed that the level of risk-taking tendency is
higher in both entrepreneurs and criminals, than in other subjects. We can assume that entrepreneurs are experienced and
“professional” risk takers, since risk-taking plays such an important role in their life. It can be expected, that they have a more
rational or at least more consistent strategy of risk-taking than convicts, the latter having a disregard for conditions. Since
it is vital for entrepreneurs to successfully avoid big losses, and convicts tend to underevaluate risk and act in an impulsive
way we expect criminals to be even more risk seekers than others.

1. Hypotheses

H1. As entrepreneurship include risk-taking, we expect the level of risk-taking to be higher in the entrepreneur group than
in the control group (college students).
H2.

Risk-taking of convicts will be higher than in the other two groups.

H3.

We expect people to take bigger risk in the loss situation than in the gain situation.

H4.

Convicts do not strive for security; therefore, they will take big risk in both situations.

H5. The size of stakes will inﬂuence risk-taking more than the differences of probabilities in all groups, since people in
general tend to disregard probabilities.
H6. It will be possible to identify a consistent strategy in the case of entrepreneurs and students – we assume, maximin
for the former, minimax for the latter group. Convicts will not have a consistent strategy, they will not differentiate between
different situations.

As can be seen the respondents were small business entrepreneurs. This distribution does not reﬂect the intention of the
investigators, only that these were the persons who were available for the study. The majority of the questionnaires were
distributed by university students by the so called snowball technique. Due to the difﬁculties of availability, the criterion for
selection was having risked their own property in their business.

The questionnaires were distributed by two psychologists in the prison.
2.3. Materials
In the present study, we used the bidding paradigm. We offered gain and loss situations to the subjects. The two alternatives had equal expected value. In such case, no normative prescriptions are violated either by always choosing the certain
alternatives (these persons are called risk-avoiders) or by always choosing uncertain alternatives that promise greater proﬁts
(risk takers). The size of the bid, and the degree of uncertainty (we offered different probability situations) was manipulated.
The strategies of entrepreneurs were compared with those of convicts, and the responses of college students were used as
controls to be compared with them.
The respondents had to reply 10 questions in the questionnaire, 5 of them related to winning situations, 5 related to
losing situations2 . In each question a certain and a risky alternative was offered. The value of the certain alternative (extent
of certain proﬁt or loss), and the magnitude of stake and the probability of occurrence in the uncertain alternative were
varied from question to question.
Let us see one example of the questions
(a) You certainly get 300,000− Forints.
(b) There is a 20% chance that you get 1,500,000− Forints and a 80% chance that you get nothing.
The characterization of the situations can be seen in Table 1.

3. Results
First, we compared the risk-taking of the male and female participants. This is important because the group of convicts
consisted of males only, the students group consisted mainly of women (71 vs. 15) and the entrepreneurs were mainly males
(68 vs. 27) The difference between the genders were signiﬁcant (males 4.78; females 3.88; p = 0.001). For winning situations,
the signiﬁcant difference disappear, and the remaining difference for the loosing block is explained by the only signiﬁcant
difference of question 10.
We did not ﬁnd useful to compare risk-taking for age. Our student group were clearly the group of young people compared
to the others. According to the results of almost all studies, young people are bolder risk takers than older people. According
to our hypothesis, we expect the other two groups to take bigger risk, not the students. If we will not ﬁnd the expected
results, than we can attribute the negative results to the effect of age and blame the unmatched sample for the lack of results.
The responses to the questions were coded dichotomically: Risky choices scored 1 certain choices scored 0. First the
average scores of the responses are shown in the three groups for all questions, for the average total win, for the average
total lose, and for the combined average total risk-taking.
As it can be seen in Table 2, the highest values were given by the convicts not only for the wins and losses, but for the
global risk-taking indicator as well, while the entrepreneurs scored higher than college students, i.e., they are more risk
takers than the students.
The differences among the three groups were statistically signiﬁcant in the global indicator (ANOVA: F = 7.706, p < 0.001)
and in the total loss indicator (F = 3.135, p < 0.05).
In winning situations risk-taking did not differ signiﬁcantly among the three groups, there was only a tendency of difference
between the college students and the entrepreneurs (t = −1.806, p = .0.072). In losing situations, however, college students
and convicts differed from each other signiﬁcantly (t = −2.38, p < 0.01).
It was analyzed whether risk-taking of winning and losing situations differed from each other, as prospect theory suggests
(Fig. 1).
The differences in all cases are statistically signiﬁcant (total sample: t = −9.698, p < 0.001; entrepreneurs t = −6.745,
p < 0.001, college students t = −5.151, p < 0.001, convicts t = −4.803, p < 0.001), i.e., everybody took much greater risks in losing
situations.

Let us examine the questions in which the respondents were the most risk takers. Remember, score 1 was given for risktaking, and zero score was given for choosing the certain alternative. For any question, group average over 0.5 means more
risky choices than risk avoidance in the group.
The level of risk-taking in the three groups is demonstrated in Figs. 2–4.

Fig. 4. Risk-taking of convicts in winning and losing situations.

Every group proved to be risk takers in situations 6 and 8. People want to take risk in losing situations, where the stakes
are not high. The value of the certain alternative is great in one case and low in the other. Thus, this variable has no effect on
choice. In both situations, the chances of loosing some more is high, indicating that probability does not deter from risk-taking.
Thus, if the stakes are not high, people are ready to take big risks in order to avoid losses.
Group average was 0.5 or higher in Situations 6, 8, and 10 in the entrepreneur group, Situations 3, 6, and 8 in the college
student group, and Situations 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in the convict group.
Convicts are risk takers in all losing situations.
There is only one case in the gain situation which involved more risk-taking than risk avoidance: College students (as
opposed to the other two groups) were risking a proﬁt in situation 3 where the initial value is small and a little more money
could be won with great probability (i.e. if stakes are low).
Now let us examine the situations with great uncertainty, 50%, and moderate outcome (5 for gain and 10 for loss). College
students took no risks in situation 10, entrepreneurs and convicts, however, took risks in order to avoid loss, even when
there was great uncertainty. Convicts, as opposed to the other two groups, are more likely to accept great uncertainty even in
winning situations (situation 5). The differences in response tendencies were further studied by comparing the three groups.
These general differences were analyzed in a pair wise comparison by t-test.
3.1. Comparison of entrepreneurs and college students
Only tendencies of differences were found in the total risk indicator (t = −1.688, p = 0.093) and in the total win situations
(t = −1.806, p = 0.072) in favor of the entrepreneurs.
On the basis of the responses to the individual questions, it can be stated that entrepreneurs make greater risks than college
students in:
Situation 2 (small certain proﬁt, high stakes, great risk3 ; t = –3.283, p < 0.001).
Situation 4 (small certain proﬁt, high stakes, great risk, t = −3.434, p < 0.001).
Situation 8 (small certain loss, low stakes, great risk t = −2.401, p < 0.01).
Situation 10 (moderate certain loss, moderate stakes, moderate chance––great uncertainty, t = 2.000, p < 0.05).
The signiﬁcance of stakes in entrepreneurs is striking. In cases of winning they make greater risks if the stakes are high,
while in cases of losing they make greater risks if the stakes are low. Probability does not seem to inﬂuence their choice.
College students make greater risks than entrepreneurs in:
Situation 3 (small certain proﬁt, low stakes, small risk, t = 2.337, p < 0.05).
Thus, college students take greater risks than entrepreneurs in situations where the starting value, the stakes, and
probability of the worst outcome are all low, thus, they are careful.
3.2. Comparison of convicts and college students
Convicts make greater risks than college students in all questions. The difference is signiﬁcant in:
Total risk-taking (t = −3.560, p < 0.001).
Total loss indicator (t = −2.387, p < 0.01).
Situation 4 (small certain proﬁt, high stakes, great risk, t = −2.338, p < 0.05).

Here great risk means: high probability of the worst alternative.

Situation 10 (moderate certain loss, moderate stakes, great uncertainty, t = −2.328, p < 0.05).
There is a great difference between convicts and college students in risk-taking, and this is true primarily in situations of
loss and in those of great uncertainty.
3.3. Comparison of entrepreneurs and convicts
There is no difference between the two groups in the total indicators.
Convicts take greater risks in:
Situation 9 (small certain loss, high stakes, low probability, t = −2.509, p < 0.01).
This is a situation of loss where the stakes are high and the probability of a good outcome is low.
In the next analysis, we attempted to separate the effects of the starting position, i.e., those of the initial values, stakes
and probabilities.
3.4. Effects of starting position, stakes and uncertainty in the different groups
The effects of starting positions in the different groups can be seen in Table 3.
All three groups avoid risks in winning positions if the value of the certain alternative is high as opposed to low. Thus,
they do not give up a high certain proﬁt for an uncertain gain. On the other hand, they take risks in cases of small certain proﬁts.
In cases of losses all three groups make greater risks if the stakes are low. Except for the convicts, who do not differentiate
high or low certain losses, the two other groups take risks mainly in high certain losses. Stakes show consistent reversal of
preference only in the entrepreneur group: They are more willing to take risks in cases of high stakes in winning situations and
in cases of low stakes in losing situations. Situations 7 and 9 (great loss with low probability) are so repulsive for entrepreneurs
that they not only give up their strategy of risk-taking used in winning situations, but they take outright smaller risks in
these losing situations than in similar winning situations (averages scores: Situation 2 = 0.43, Situation 7 = 0.39, Situation
4 = 0.44, Situation 9 = 0.41).
If we want to highlight the differential features of the different groups, we can say that
- Entrepreneurs are motivated to take risk by the possibility of large gain, while students prefer high probability.
- Convicts are less afraid of big losses when taking risk than the other two groups.
To demonstrate the variability of responses to the different risk-taking situations, we compared the standard variations
of the means separately to win and lose situations for each groups. Table 4 presents the variability of responses in these two
situations.
The means differ signiﬁcantly both within the gain and within the loss situations in the entrepreneurs’ (p < 0.001) and
students’ group (p < 0.001), but not in the convicts’ group (for gain: p = 0.201) (for loss: p = 0.512). We can conclude that while
the former two groups differentiate between situations having different characteristics when taking risk, convicts use similar
strategies regardless of the situation.
4. Discussion
The results analyzed by several methods point in the same direction. On the one hand, some deﬁnite general tendencies
appear that show the typical reactions manifested in experimentally studied bet situations, independently of the groupmembership of the respondents (entrepreneurs, convicts or college students).

One of the robust relationships was the willingness to take risk in loss and avoid risk in the win situation. In situations
where the respondents had to choose between keeping a certain proﬁt and taking the chance of losing it in hope of an even
greater proﬁt: People generally choose certain proﬁt (“A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush”), i.e., they do not like to
take risks. This is all the more so when the certain proﬁt is great enough and the further gain achievable with further risk is
not substantial. If the frame is loss, where the choice is between suffering certain loss and taking the risky alternative where
one could get rid of the loss, but if unlucky, could meet an even greater loss, people take signiﬁcantly greater risks than in
the case of proﬁt-frame.
This general tendency proves that keeping the proﬁt is an important motive in situations that are considered as winning,
while in losing situations, people are more willing to take the chance of an even greater loss for the sake of avoiding the loss.
As we have pointed it out, the expected value of risky and certain alternatives were the same in the same situation.
Theoretically it could be expected that even if people do differentiate between positively and negatively introduced situations,
they would consistently choose between the strategies of striving for safety and taking risks. If this is not so, it means that the
magnitude of stakes, the probability, or the initial value plays a greater role than the others when taking a risk is considered.
No group risked certain big proﬁt (winning situation) in the cases of low stakes. Risk-taking proved to be the most
conspicuous in losing situations where the probability of further loss was rather high, but its level was low (low stakes). In
risky situations, however, where the level of further loss was threateningly high, people were less willing to take risks, in spite
of the high probability of getting rid of the loss completely. Thus, it can be concluded that risk-taking in loss is inﬂuenced
by the level of stakes: if the stakes are high, we tend to take less risks than if the stakes are low. Less attention is devoted to
probability (the chances for the occurrence of a good or a bad event) that is also important in the evaluation of risks; it does
not inﬂuence taking risks. In losing situations convicts differ from the other two groups: They are less diverted from risktaking by the possible loss inherent in risk-taking than the others, and they seem to weigh risky situations less––we found
smaller differences in their reactions to the different situations of risk-taking than in the other groups. They differentiate
losing situations even less so either by the level of stakes or by the extent of certain alternative.
In addition to the general tendencies, let us turn our attention to the differences among the groups in their risk-taking,
and ﬁnd the characteristics of the entrepreneurs and the convicts.
As we have mentioned, nobody risks certain great proﬁt in case of low stakes, but entrepreneurs are willing to risk certain
great proﬁts in case of high stakes (despite the low probability of a favorable outcome) in winning situations. As opposed
to this, college students choose the uncertain, but greater proﬁt-promising alternative if the value of the certain proﬁt is
small, if the stakes are low and the probability is high. Thus, in winning situations entrepreneurs are motivated by grabbing
opportunities even if it is unsafe. Low stakes, however, motivated the risk-taking behavior of only college students, not
entrepreneurs. In the preferences of convicts, it was uncertain situations (50% of probability) that ranked ﬁrst.
In losing situations entrepreneurs deﬁnitely wanted to avoid great loss (even if its probability was low): These situations
ranked among the more cautious solutions for them. College students and convicts were relatively more daring here (as
compared to the other situations).
It can be concluded that the level of stakes bears greater signiﬁcance for the entrepreneurs in both situations, and the
role of probability deﬁnitely falls back. It is another important difference among the groups, that it is convicts who accept
uncertainty the most, situations with 50% probability rank higher in the rank order of risks for them than in the other
two groups, and entrepreneurs tolerate uncertainty more than college students do, the difference between them reaching
statistical signiﬁcance in the case of loss.
What conclusions can be drawn from all this with respect to the risk-taking of entrepreneurs? The outstanding role of
the level of stakes and the deﬁnite loss of importance of probabilities produces a somewhat paradoxical situation. If we
look at it from the aspect of how much the respondents strived at improving their situation, i.e., instead of concentrating
on the dimension of proﬁt–loss we focus on the dimension of improving or worsening the starting position, we will ﬁnd
that in positively framed situations they strongly strive at improving the situation even if the probabilities are low, while
in negatively framed situations they are reluctant to take great risks (perceived as great probably because of the stakes)
even if the probability of improvement is high. If the stakes are low (low perceived risk), however, the direction is reversed:
In a winning frame they are not motivated for improvement, while in a losing situation they are. Our results concerning
the importance of stakes for entrepreneurs were conﬁrmed by a recently published article (Kamalanabhan et al., 2006)
they collected data on two measures of risk-taking from entrepreneurs, prospective entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs.
The groups differed signiﬁcantly only on the Magnitude of Loss Questionnaire, but not on the Choice Dilemma Questionnaire. Their results also highlight the signiﬁcance of loss. The authors concluded that the riskiness in business ventures
is not the low probability of success but the high stakes involved in entrepreneurship. Translating this into business life
we will see that a proﬁt-making entrepreneur is more willing to take risks, while a losing colleague will be more cautious. It is also interesting how our results modulate the process of decision made known as endowment effect by Thaler
(1980). Thus, the desire to justify former decisions makes entrepreneurs not to accept the loss of bad investments. Therefore,
they invest more and more money into the business; try to save what cannot really be saved. This effect could be seen
in our study only if the prospect of further loss was not perceived as threatening by the respondents. If the stakes were
threateningly high, they would rather accept the loss. If they calculated with probabilities as well, their reactions would,
perhaps be just the opposite: Instead of enduring further small losses repeatedly, they could make the most of a good
opportunity. It works against them, however, that in case of failure they could not justify their decisions that brought big
losses.

Our results also support those of Forlani and Mullins (2000), according to which members of the entrepreneur group
are willing to take greater risks if the situation promises a big enough proﬁt. As opposed to the Forlani and Mullins study,
however, in highly uncertain situations our respondents did not avoid risk-taking; in fact, in highly uncertain loss situations
– not studied by Forlani and Mullins – they proved to be deﬁnitely risk takers, rather than risk-avoiders. Thus, entrepreneurs
could well tolerate a high degree of uncertainty in our bet situation.
As to the characterization of the risk-taking of convicts, it can be highlighted in the results that convicts’ general level of
risk-taking is higher than that of the other groups, and that they take greater risks in uncertain situations than the other two
groups. They took greater risks in all of the losing situations than in the winning situations. It can be concluded from this that
the differentiation of the situations is very rough. Contrary to the other two groups, convicts are not threatened by enduring
the (small) possibility of very big losses. Thus, our research has also conﬁrmed the higher risk-taking tendency of criminals.
This seems to be a part of their life strategy, which is not surprising, as they spend a great part of their lives in dangerous
places like the outskirts of cities, residential areas and pleasure grounds of slums, prisons: the places of crime. It is impossible
to live in these territories “non-dangerously”; they must take risks 24 h a day in order to survive. Socialization seems to be
different in this milieu that forms risk-taking strategy. They are motivated by the smaller, but more certain proﬁt; they do
wait for “striking oil” at any price. Yet at the same time, the possibility of failure is inherent this lifestyle, often becoming a
reality indeed, like being beaten in a ﬁght, or being caught in a burglary. They do not want to avoid this loss; they accept if
they lose, a prison-sentence does not mean a tragic situation for them; it belongs to their everyday life, accepted by both
their environment and their relatives.
If we compare our results with those of Slovic et al. (2002), we had to count on the outcome that – since we offered only
a hypothetical situation, and, thus we actually asked for preference judgments and the respondents did not have to make
real bets in real money – in winning situations the respondents would choose the alternative in which they could win a
small amount of money with great probability. The reason is, that affects heuristics, as we have pointed out, accentuates
probabilities more in these situations when making judgments. This was really true for college students and convicts, but
not for entrepreneurs. If we assume after Lopez (1993) that entrepreneurs are motivated by the perception of opportunities
and the motive for success, then – as a result of the operation of affect heuristics – the emotional value of the stakes will be so
high that their attention is turned toward that, and its appeal will not be diminished by the relatively low level of probability.
The signiﬁcance of the stakes can be observed in losing situations as well: Failure has a negative emotional value, and the
possibility of a great loss pushes the role of probabilities into the background again. The effect of individual differences in
affective reactions on risk-taking was demonstrated by Peters and Slovic (2001) in an experiment. They compared persons
who described themselves as reacting more sensitively to either negative or positive events. Persons belonging to the ﬁrst
group did not chose from the deck of cards that included the possibility of losing a lot, while the other group chose the deck
that promised the great hit. Thus, the individual differences in affective reactions have an effect on the learned patterns
of risk-taking and its behavioral manifestation. Similar differences can be assumed between groups of similar people. This
possible explanation supports the emotion-based interpretation of the differences found among the different groups.
Our investigation may justly be criticized on the ground that comparisons were not made on matched samples; unfortunately, however, we could not create the conditions for this. This is why it came at the just right moment that despite the
younger sample, level of risk-taking was biased toward the entrepreneur group; since the age differences would predict an
opposite relationship; this circumstance only reinforces our results. A shift in gender in favor of women, however, slightly
decreases the power of the differences found, especially for the difference between the students and the other two groups
mainly for situation 10.
Finally, it must be mentioned that the conclusions are based on the investigation of artiﬁcial, hypothetical, and laboratory
decisions and bet situations. Asking about different types of risks, and conducting the study in real situations would probably
produce different reactions and a number of other inﬂuences that were not studied here.
