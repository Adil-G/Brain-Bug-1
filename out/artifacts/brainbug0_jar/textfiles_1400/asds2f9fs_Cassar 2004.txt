Abstract
This article investigates the determinants of capital structure and types of financing used around
business start-ups utilizing a survey that reduces the confounding effects of survivorship bias. In
particular, the influence of start-up size, asset structure, organization type, growth orientation, and
owners’ characteristics are examined both in the choice and in the magnitude of finance use. The
results are consistent with the theoretical models incorporating issues, such as information
asymmetries, agency theory, and transaction costs. The results also demonstrate linkages among
providers of finance, maturity of assets, and the capital structure of start-ups. While the results provide
insights into business finances near the time of creation, some recommendations for future research are
discussed.

1. Executive summary
How business start-ups are financed is one of the most fundamental questions of enterprise
research. Financial capital is one of the necessary resources required for enterprises to form
and subsequently operate. Capital decisions and the use of debt and equity at start-up have
been shown to have important implications for the operations of the business, risk of failure,
firm performance, and the potential of the business to expand.

This article investigates the determinants of capital structure and the use of financing
around business start-up. In doing so, this research addresses some deficiencies of existing
empirical research examining start-up financing by reducing the potential for survivorship
bias, providing testable implications developed from financial theory, and using a nationwide
survey in multiple industries, thereby overcoming generalization problems associated with
samples of limited geographic or industry scope.
Consistent with the theoretical arguments, the larger the start-up, the greater the proportion
of debt, long-term debt, and outside and bank financing in the firm. The influence of size is
strongly observed in the decision of whether to utilize these particular types of finance. This
relationship highlights the importance that scale and market access have upon the capital
structure of start-ups. Organization type generally provided no explanatory power in regard to
the proportion of leverage in the firm. However, both outside and bank finances appeared to
increase as a result of the firm’s incorporation. This suggests that the signaling effects
associated with incorporation may provide a nontrivial benefit for these firms. In addition,
start-ups with the intent to grow appear to be more likely to use bank financing, a result
consistent with the increased incentives in establishing credit relationships as early as possible
for these type of firms.
While bank financing and long-term leverage were positively related to the proportion of
noncurrent assets, consistent with our existing understanding, leverage and outside financing
were actually negatively related to this proportion. This suggests that different outside
financiers potentially use different contracting mechanisms or have different motives for
financing. Another possible explanation is the deliberate matching of maturities of firm debt
and assets; however, further research is required to distinguish between these alternative
explanations. The role of asset structure upon the start-up firms’ finances demonstrates the
importance of tangibility of assets and its impact upon financing opportunities. Firms with a
relative lack of tangible assets appear to be financed through less formal means, where
nonbank financing, such as loans from individuals unrelated to business, plays a more
important role in the capital structure of start-ups. This highlights the importance of network
resources in these types of ventures.
The major decision maker’s characteristics were not found to have a significant influence
upon start-up financing. Such a result is consistent with entrepreneurs with different education,
experience, and gender not differing on financing preferences, after taking other firm characteristics into consideration. This may also suggest that financiers weigh the characteristics of the
firm, such as size and noncurrent assets, more highly than those of the major decision maker
examined by this study. Overall, the influence of firm characteristics on the type of financing
plays an important role both in the demand and supply sides of financing for new ventures.

2. Introduction
How business start-ups are financed is one of the most fundamental questions of enterprise
research. Financial capital is one of the necessary resources required for enterprises to form
and subsequently operate. The importance of the financing decision of new businesses

263

consequentially has important implications for the economy, given the role that new
enterprise plays in employment growth, competition, innovation, and export potential.
Additionally, capital decisions and the use of debt and equity at start-up have been shown
to have important implications for the operations of the business, risk of failure, firm
performance, and the potential of business expansion in the future. While research examining
the financing of start-ups has been increasing, we still have limited understanding of this area,
particularly in comparison to our understanding of financing choice for large and existing
firms. A likely cause of the paucity of research for new firms is the relative lack of available
data sets and access to respondents willing to disclose their financial information.
This article investigates the determinants of capital structure and the use of financing
around business start-up. In doing so, this study addresses three deficiencies of existing
empirical research examining start-up financing. First, due to the reduced time between startup and surveying, the potential for survivorship bias confounding the study’s findings is
lowered. Second, this study goes beyond merely being descriptive in nature by providing
testable implications developed from financial theory, including the rarely tested impact of
asset structure upon capital structure. Third, by using a nationwide survey in multiple
industries this study overcomes generalization problems associated with samples of limited
geographic or industry scope.
To empirically investigate aspects of start-up financing, four different but related financing
and capital structure measures are utilized: leverage, long-term leverage, outside financing,
and bank financing. By using multiple measures, insight into the financing behaviors of
different capital providers can be achieved. In addition, the use of multiple measures
overcomes problems associated with classifying quasi-equity. The start-up setting also has
the advantage of representing the benchmark case for problems of lending or investing under
asymmetric information, given these firms lack of a track record (Cressy, 1996).
Section 3 provides a review of the relevant theoretical explanations for financing and
capital structure choice and a critique of existing empirical evidence investigating new firm
financing. Section 4 provides the rationale underlying the empirical tests. Section 5 details the
data and variables employed for the study. Section 6 discusses the results of the empirical
analysis. Section 7 discusses the implications of the research. Section 8 reviews the
limitations of the study and provides some recommendations for future research.

3. Literature
3.1. Theories of capital structure and debt finance of start-ups
The theoretical principles underlying the capital structure and financing choices can be
generally described either in terms of a static trade-off choice or pecking-order framework.
Both frameworks predict differences in explicit and implicit financing costs, and consequently, the use of financing for different firms. Static trade-off choice encompasses several
aspects including the exposure of the firm to bankruptcy and agency costs against the tax
benefits associated with debt use.

<-----Page 3----->264

G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

Bankruptcy costs are the costs incurred when the perceived probability that the firm will
default on financing is greater than zero. These bankruptcy costs can be direct, affecting
liquidation returns (Harris and Raviv, 1991), or indirect, in the form of stakeholders losing
confidence in the business’ survival or through less discretion on operating decisions (Titman
and Wessels, 1988). Agency costs arise when firms utilize debt and other external financing
(Myers, 1977). One commonly cited example of agency costs within firms is the incentive to
benefit the equity holders at the expense of the debtholders. Consequently, debtholders
incorporate costly monitoring devices or contractual covenants into debt agreements to
restrict and monitor the firms’ behavior. All these contracting mechanisms effectively
increase the cost of capital offered to the firm. Contrary to bankruptcy and agency costs,
many tax regimes provide an incentive for debt use due to the tax deductibility of interest and
nondeductibility of dividends. More debt increases the after tax proceeds to the owners
(DeAngelo and Masulis, 1980).
Myers and Majluf (1984) provide a pecking-order theory of capital structure choice created
by the presence of information asymmetries between the firm and its potential financiers. For
example, given the presence of information asymmetries about the firms’ current operations
and future prospects, new equity holders will require a higher rate of return on capital
invested than using existing internal funds. The greater the exposure to the risk associated
with the information asymmetries due to duration of the financing and the seniority of
contractual rights to the assets of the firm, the higher the return of capital demanded by each
financing source. These exposures will lead to the firm preferring inside finance to debt,
short-term debt over long-term debt, and any debt over outside equity.
However, there are also several aspects of financing that are unique to new venture
financing choice. Start-ups can be affected by market access, in that their newness and scale
make some financing options unavailable. New firms are also more likely to be subject to
idiosyncratic forces, in particular, the influence of the entrepreneur upon the financing and
capital structure choice. Such influences can include the entrepreneur’s traits that can be used
as signals associated with firm viability, the entrepreneur’s preferences towards risk and
control desire, and the entrepreneur’s potential exposure to finance discrimination or network
resources (Bates, 1991, 1997; Haynes and Haynes, 1999; Coleman, 2000). These individual
or context-specific issues are not considered when examining large, public firms as the
influence of one individual on the preferences and outcomes of the capital structure is
substantially reduced.
Given their limited operating history, start-ups are arguably the most informationally
opaque firms in the economy. Consequently, it is generally believed that start-ups, due to
potential difficulties in obtaining intermediated external finance, are heavily dependent on
initial insider finance (Berger and Udell, 1998; Huyghebaert, 2001). These arguments are
consistent with the financing life cycle, which suggests that type of financing alternatives
available to firms varies throughout the life of the business as a result of information
asymmetries, scale, demand for finance, and asset structure. Unique characteristics of new
firms, such as low-scale potential and early reliance on internal capital, may lead to limited
venture capital use. Conversely, these circumstances potentially create a greater role for bank
financing within the firm (Berger and Udell, 1998; Scholtens, 1999).

<-----Page 4----->G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

Both entrepreneurs and their potential outside financiers have to enact methods to reduce
the information asymmetries and agency costs. However, many of the mechanisms available
to both parties for existing firms are not available to new firms. For example, financiers
cannot observe the firms’ track record as a signal of quality, and the ability to forecast the
future performance of the firm is also reduced. However, potential options available to
lenders include adjusting interest rates, requiring collateral, including covenants, or using
signals, such as the ownership held by the entrepreneur and reputation of the entrepreneur
(Coleman, 1998; Scholtens, 1999).
3.2. Critique of empirical research examining start-up financing
There are three deficiencies that are associated with the majority of research specifically
examining start-up financing: (1) survivorship bias, (2) lack of empirical testing of finance
theories, and (3) limited geographic or industry focus. Survivorship bias is the bias caused by
sample firms not being representative of the population of firms at the time of start-up. The
surviving firms may have different characteristics including financing to the firms that have
since ‘‘died,’’ that may have influenced firm survival and failure between the period of startup and the point of survey. For example, Manigart and Struyf (1997, p. 127) in their survey of
18 high-technology Belgian start-ups selected firms ‘‘who were founded at most 10 years
ago,’’ and consequently, ‘‘only surviving companies are represented in the sample.’’ This
limitation has been noted by several researchers, with all examining new venture finance
suffering from this bias. The longer the temporal period between surveying respondents and
the actual start-up, the greater the influence of this bias on results. In addition, there are recall
problems associated with a longer time frame, reducing the reliability of results. This study,
by sampling firms closer to the period of formation, reduces the problems associated with this
potentially sampling-bias issue.
While not true for every study in this field, the majority of studies that have empirically
investigated start-up financing have tended to be descriptive and shied away from testable
implications.1 This is not a criticism of previous research, given the limited understanding of
new venture financing such descriptive studies aided in developing a knowledge of new firm
capital structure. However, finance has provided several theoretical explanations for the
capital structure of the firm. It is important to test these theories, particularly in settings
outside their more rigorously investigated settings to determine their generalizability across
all firms. For example, there is scant research that has examined the direct influence of asset
structure upon the capital structure of the firm at start-up, although theoretical arguments for
such a relationship have been developed and tests rigorously performed for existing firms.
The majority of empirical investigations into financing and capital structure of new firms
have been of limited geographic or industry focus. For example, several published studies are
based upon samples from individual Midwest U.S. states (Shaffer and Pulver, 1985; Van
1

Given the information asymmetries, risk, and access to finance, these descriptive studies basically show that
personal savings and ‘‘inside’’ finance are important sources of capital for new ventures (e.g., Shaffer and Pulver,
1985; Van Auken and Carter, 1989; Carter and Van Auken, 1990).

<-----Page 5----->266

G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

Auken and Carter, 1989; Carter and Van Auken, 1990; Van Auken and Neeley, 1996).
Therefore, whether these results found are unique to this region and its financing system is
unclear. In addition, several studies have focused specifically on the financing of high-tech
firms. The general conclusion from this research is that personal savings remain the most
important source of start-up funding, with venture capital playing a greater role in the early
growth phase rather than start-up phase (Bruno and Tyebjee, 1985; Freear and Wetzel, 1990;
Manigart and Struyf, 1997).
Research that has considered broader issues and sample frames in regard to new firm
financing include Scherr et al.’s (1993) work, which examined the influence of owner’s
risk–return preferences, costs of financing, and the firms’ business characteristics on the
proportion of debt used by the firms. Using the 41,000 firms from the 1982 Characteristics
of Business Owners (CBO) survey that were founded after 1980 (surveying was undertaken
in 1986), they found capital structure to be related to owners’ characteristics, industry, and
the profitability and size of the firm as of 1986. The independent variables examined in that
study tended to focus on a wider range of variables associated with the owners’
characteristics than the present study, however, their analysis did not consider several
firm-specific variables, such as size around start-up, asset structure, and legal organization
of the firm.

4. Firm characteristics and financing
4.1. Size
Theoretical reasons why firm size would be related to the capital structure of the firm
include economies of scale in lowering information asymmetries, scale in transaction costs,
market access, and risk exposure. First, smaller firms may find it relatively more costly to
resolve informational asymmetries with lenders and financiers. This will lead to smaller firms
being offered less capital or offered capital at higher rates to larger firms, consequently
discouraging the use of outside financing. Such effects should be more prevalent around startup as new firms are more informationally opaque than existing firms (Berger and Udell,
1998).
Financing choices may also be affected by the transaction costs associated with financing.
This is because transaction costs are most likely a function of scale, with smaller scale
financing resulting in relatively higher transaction costs (Titman and Wessels, 1988; Wald,
1999). In addition, relatively high transaction costs can effectively put some financing options
outside the available set of financing choices of the firm. More directly, barriers to market
access exist where some financing options are not within the relevant range that financiers
would consider to be issuable finance. For example, the scale required to issue equity funds
publicly effectively excludes smaller firms from this type of finance.
Bankruptcy costs can influence the relationship between size and the level of outside
financing if the relative costs of bankruptcy are an inverse function of firm size. This should
predispose smaller firms to having less outside financing or lower debt. Finally, if operating

<-----Page 6----->G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

267

risk is inversely related to firm size, this should also result in smaller firms using relatively
less debt and outside financing (Cosh and Hughes, 1994).
The empirical evidence for similar scaled firms to those examined in this study generally
supports a positive relationship between firm size and leverage, long-term leverage, outside
financing, and bank financing. There is also evidence suggesting a negative relationship
between firm size and short-term liabilities (Osteryoung et al., 1992; Scherr et al., 1993;
Chittenden et al., 1996; Coleman, 1998; Michaelas et al., 1999; Fluck et al., 2000).
Hypothesis 1: Firm start-up size is positively related to leverage, long-term leverage, outside
financing, and bank financing.
4.2. Asset structure
Asset structure should also be related to capital structure, particularly for new firms. The
more tangible and generic the firms’ assets are, the greater the firms’ liquidation value,
thereby reducing the financial loss incurred by financiers should the company default and the
firms’ assets realized (Harris and Raviv, 1991; Titman and Wessels, 1988). Firms can also
reduce adverse selection and moral hazard costs by pledging their assets as collateral or
contracting for fixed charges to be placed on particular tangible assets. This will result in
firms with assets of greater liquidation value getting easier access to finance, and lower costs
of financing, leading in turn to these firms acquiring a higher level of debt or outside
financing in their capital structure. Due to preferred contracting mechanisms of banks, several
authors suggest that bank financing will depend upon whether the lending can be secured by
tangible assets (Storey, 1994; Berger and Udell, 1998). Given the increased information
opaqueness in the initial stages of the venture and the lack of other available options for
financiers to reduce financial risk through examining current and future profitability and the
use of relationship financing, asset structure should be a significant effect on firm financing in
the early stages of the business.
Consistent with theoretical arguments, the empirical evidence suggests a positive relationship between asset structure and leverage for large firms. The limited empirical research
investigating smaller firms shows some evidence of a positive relationship between asset
structure and leverage, long-term debt, and possibly a negative relationship with short-term
debt (Van der Wijst and Thurik, 1993; Chittenden et al., 1996; Jordan et al., 1998; Michaelas
et al., 1999). As previously mentioned, there has been sparse research examining start-up
financing and asset structure relationships directly.2
Hypothesis 2: Start-up asset structure is positively related to leverage, long-term leverage,
outside financing, and bank financing.
2

Van Auken and Neeley (1996) examined the use of ‘‘bootstrap’’ financing in new small ventures. In
particular, they argued that manufacturing and construction firms use less bootstrap financing due to the high cost
of asset acquisition and the strong collateral base to obtain debt financing. However, they did not test or control for
size or asset structure effects directly.

<-----Page 7----->268

4.3. Legal organization
The hypothesized effect of legal organization on financing is related to the extent that it
affects the availability of particular forms of financing. Storey (1994) argues that while some
may consider the benefits of limited liability the critical factor in the choice of legal form for
the business, the limited liability gain is fictional in actuality. Alternatively, the choice of legal
form involves weighing up credibility and taxation variation versus statutory audit costs and
public information. Given the above, banks may perceive incorporation as a good signal that
portrays credibility and formality of operations or represent an indicator of future growth or
growth potential. For example, Coleman and Cohn (2000) found evidence suggesting a
positive relationship between leverage and incorporation but not between incorporation and
the level of external loans, while Storey (1994) and Freedman and Godwin (1994) suggest
that incorporation leads to a greater use (or supply) of bank financing.
Hypothesis 3: Start-up incorporation is positively related to outside and bank financing.
4.4. Intention to grow and growth opportunities
Growth opportunities and intention to grow should influence the agency costs associated
with financing. Myers (1977) argues that conflicts between debt and equity holders are
exacerbated for assets that provide the firm with the option to undertake growth opportunities
in the future. Additionally, if some start-ups are more likely to experience future growth due
to opportunity or intention, this should increase the potential for conflict between outside
financiers and the entrepreneur. However, Michaelas et al. (1999) argue that the agency
problem and consequentially the costs of financing are reduced if the firm issues short- rather
than long-term debt, leading to a positive relationship between future growth opportunities
and short-term leverage. In addition, the use of outside or bank financing may be related to
intended growth as the business may choose financing based on their beliefs for future use of
financing. In particular, if the firm is more likely to need capital in the future, it has greater
incentives to establish credit relationships with outside financiers, such as banks. By
establishing these relationships as early as possible, there is greater potential benefit for
the firm both in terms of access and cost of future outside financing.
The empirical evidence investigating growth and financing linkages is inconclusive with
Michaelas et al. (1999) who found future growth to be positively related to leverage and longterm debt while Chittenden et al. (1996) and Jordan et al. (1998) found mixed evidence. All
these studies used measures of growth ex-post rather than obtaining growth intentions from
the major decision maker as in this study.
Hypothesis 4a: Start-up growth intentions significantly influence the leverage and long-term
leverage of firm start-ups.
Hypothesis 4b: Start-up growth intentions are positively related to outside and bank
financing.

269

4.5. Owners’ characteristics
Owners’ characteristics may provide some additional predictive power in explaining the
capital structure and financing characteristics of new firms. In fact, given the relative
importance of the major decision maker during the early operations of a new business, one
would suspect that detection of significant effects on financing decisions would be most
likely near start-up. To test for this influence, variables representing experience, education,
and gender were examined and are briefly discussed below.
Experience and education level obtained may provide signals of better human capital. The
better the human capital, the greater the firm viability of the start-up; consequentially, access
to debt capital should be greater for these firms (Storey, 1994; Bates, 1997). Gender of the
major decision maker may influence capital structure and financing due to differences in
credit discrimination, risk aversion, or the fact that the enterprises undertaken by a particular
gender may require different levels of capital (Coleman and Cohn, 2000). Scherr et al. (1993)
found leverage was negatively related to owners’ age and experience and positively related to
ownership experience. Leverage was also found to be influenced by gender. Coleman and
Cohn (2000) examining education, gender, and years of experience found no support for
significant effect upon leverage, but did find some evidence of education being positively
related to external loans. Storey (1994), Coleman (1998), and Verheul and Thurik (2001)
found no evidence of gender influencing the likelihood of getting type of loan. For this study,
major decision makers’ characteristics for gender and the obtaining of a tertiary education are
represented by dichotomous variables, while experience is measured by the number of years
experience within the same industry.
Hypothesis 5: The major decision maker’s characteristics significantly influence the capital
structure and financing of firm start-ups.

5. Method
5.1. Sample
The initial sample for this study is obtained from the Business Longitudinal Survey (BLS)
developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).3 While monitoring businesses over
time was the main objective of the survey, each year new businesses were added to the BLS
(in 1996, 1997, and 1998). These new businesses were obtained through a random sample of
all new registrants for employer tax during the year. For firms under 200 employees, this
3
The Australian financial environment consists of similar institutions to most developed economies. Firms
have potential access to finance from banks and other financial institutions, venture capital, and public equity, in
addition to trade credit from other firms and investments from informal investors. Consequently, empirical
evidence from an Australian setting is most likely transferable across other developed economies with similar
sources of finance.

<-----Page 9----->270

G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

sample constituted approximately 1 in every 300 firms added to the register.4 Instead of
surveying founders about the types and amounts of finances used at start-up retrospectively as
in the majority of previous studies, this study required information about the composition of
the debt and equity in the balance sheet at a point in time during the start-up phase (within
months after appearing on tax registers). The surveying of the businesses took place in the
November after the fiscal year (from July to June) that the company appeared on the tax
register. Therefore, the time between tax registration and survey completion for the sample
firms is anywhere between 5 and 18 months. However, the point at which the financial
position and finances are reported relates to the end of June in the respective surveyed year.
Consequently, between 0 and 12 months had passed between the start-up and response.
Simplistically, it might be assumed that such firms are new firms, however, inclusion to the
register can be initiated by several methods, such as a change of legal form, which has little to
do with whether a new venture has been initiated. Therefore, as a further specification test to
ensure that only new businesses were obtained, the age of the business was examined, all
businesses not in the youngest age bracket available (under 2 years) when surveyed were
eliminated.
As the focus of this study is examining new venture start-ups financed independently
rather than examining businesses that were spin-offs of existing corporations, all firms that
had any financing from ‘‘parent companies’’ were excluded. All firms with financing from
‘‘shareholders’’ were also excluded, as the ambiguous nature of the shareholders classification in the BLS creates the potential for noise if these firms are included in the final analyses.
The exclusion of these firms also avoids problems associated with the classification of inside
and outside financing.5 In addition, all mining firms (12) were deleted due to their unusual
operating nature. Finally, all firms with over 100% leverage were eliminated, to avoid
problems with negative values and negative-equity firms.6 After the selection criterions were
employed, a final sample of 292 firms was available for analysis.
5.2. Variables
Four different dependent variables were used to represent the study’s capital structure and
financing measures: leverage, long-term leverage, outside financing, and bank financing.
4

All firms with over 200 employees were included in the BLS sample, although financial details relating to
these firms were not included. Hence, these firms are excluded from the analysis.
5
The shareholders classification in the BLS does not necessarily mean that these firms obtained outside equity
publicly, and potentially shareholders equity can represent several types of capital. The omission of firms with
shareholders as a component of their capital structure resulted in 28 firms being excluded from the analysis. The
majority of these firms had less than 25% of their capital structure comprised of shareholders equity. All tests were
rerun without the exclusion of these firms; none of the findings were significantly affected.
6
Eliminating firms with over 100% leverage is consistent with previous capital structure related research, and
allows for another filter to control for data entry errors from the survey and ensures a few outlying firms are not
driving the results obtained. The main analysis was performed after increasing the threshold of firm leverage to
150%. This resulted in over two-thirds of the firms excluded being reintroduced into the sample. The results are
robust to increasing this threshold.

<-----Page 10----->G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

271

These dependent variables were either created using the sum of different financing options
listed in the study or taken directly from the survey. Appendix A provides a summary of the
different financing choices available on the survey and the variables developed from them.
Consistent with the literature, leverage is calculated as the total debt of the firm divided by
the total assets. Total debt encompasses all debt components on the firms’ balance sheet.
Previous studies have been able to incorporate market values of debt or equity into their
capital structure measures, however, given the scale of the firms in the sample and the
financial information available, such values could not be considered. In recognition that not
all components of leverage are homogenous, long-term leverage is also included. Apart from
the obvious maturity and duration differences, long-term leverage is arguably more deliberate
as it requires greater contractual obligations and screening processes. For this study, longterm leverage was operationalised as all debt that had a duration longer than 12 months. The
proportion of leverage that had a duration longer than 12 months was explicitly requested in
the survey.
An outside financing variable was applied to provide an alternative dependent financing
measure from an agency perspective and is consistent with recent research examining small
firm financing (Fluck et al., 2000; Ayers et al., 2001). For example, the two leverage measures
do not distinguish between the leverage holders who may be insiders and outsiders of the firm.
Yet, both these holders have considerably different agency implications. In particular, insiders
may have substantial knowledge of the firm or have strong ties to the entrepreneur,
consequently making them less likely to be subject to the entrepreneurs’ opportunistic
behavior. Therefore, the use of outside finance captures these differences and allows for a
clearer investigation of issues relating to moral hazard and information asymmetry. For this
study, outside financing was operationalised by including all finance sourced from unrelated
individuals and businesses, trade credit, venture capitalists, and banks.
Several studies have looked specifically at the issuance and level of bank financing at both
start-up and relatively small firm stages (Freedman and Godwin, 1994; Storey, 1994; Cressy,
1996; Huyghebaert, 2001). Potential differences that might be found between banks and other
outside financiers include the issuance of more financing for firms that are incorporated, and
potentially greater reliance of assets in place for securing debt. Under both the outside and bank
financing measures adopted by this study, whether capital is provided as a loan or as equity is
not considered relevant. Thereby, these variables overcome potential problems associated with
the identification of debt and equity or the use of quasi-equity by new firms (Ang, 1992).
For this study, size is measured as the log of total assets. Asset structure is represented as
noncurrent assets divided by total assets.7 Legal organization is represented by a dichotomous
variable: ‘‘1’’ if the firm is incorporated and ‘‘0’’ otherwise. This study dichotomously
classifies a firm as having growth intentions if the firm answered ‘‘yes’’ to either of the
7

Information concerning the tangibility of fixed assets was only available for around 50% of the sample firms.
Given this, all tests were redone with an adjusted asset structure variable where tangibility of fixed assets was used
if it was known, otherwise, the proportion of fixed assets to total assets was used. In addition, only firms that had
tangibility data available were used in separate regressions. All of these tests produced results similar to those
reported. The mean, and median proportions of fixed tangible assets to total fixed assets for the sample of firms
where tangibility was known were 73.2% and 97.6%, respectively.

following: During the next 3 years, does the business intend to (1) significantly increase
production levels, (2) open new locations, and (3) introduce new goods or services?8 For
industry controls, six broad industry groupings based on two-digit ANZSIC (Australian and
New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification) codes were created, and these were
manufacturing; construction; wholesale, retail, accommodation, cafes, and restaurants;
transportation and storage; financial and property services; cultural, personal and other
services.9
Tests for the continuous variables, represented by the proportion of the dependent variables
to total assets, were undertaken using tobit regression. The tobit specification was utilized
because the dependent financing variables examined were censored, with the observations
being either continuous or equal to zero. Such a model simultaneously incorporates the
effects of both the decision to use a particular type of finance and the proportion of finance
used. Consequentially, the tobit model forces the independent variables to have the same sign
with respect to both the use and proportion of finance, given the decision to make use of the
finance. Whether this is a valid assumption is an empirical question. To address this
simultaneity issue and to provide a thorough understanding of the determinants of business
start-up financing, a series of logit and OLS regressions were also undertaken.10 Whereby the
logit model determines the influence of the independent variables upon the choice to use a
particular type of financing, while the OLS model explains the proportion of financing, given
the firms’ decision to use a particular type of finance.

6.1. Descriptive statistics
The descriptive statistics of the dependent and independent variables are provided in Table

For growth intention, an alternative measure that could have been used was actual growth, however, there
were three problems with this measure: (1) the relationship between growth intention and actual growth is not
clear for the sample; (2) the growth measure could be capturing many other effects that are unrelated to intentional
growth, such as whether inclusion on the tax register was undertaken before sales had taken place or it may be
capturing the variability in lag times before the firms were completely operational; and (3) there are limited data
available tracking the growth of these firms over time. In fact, the longest period available is a 2-year period for
the firms that were included in the BLS in 1996, with no data available for the firms appearing for the first time in
the BLS in 1998.
9
All analyses were repeated using alternative industry categories with no difference in the findings.
10
An alternative to undertaking logit and OLS regressions is to use a sample selection approach, such as a
Heckman estimation procedure. This approach requires the development of two separate and independent models
to explain (1) the decision to use a type of finance and (2) how much of that type of finance is utilized. However,
in the analyses undertaken in this study it is unclear ex ante which independent variables should be excluded, if
any, from either of the two models. In addition, logit and OLS regressions are more commonly applied allowing
greater comparability of results with previous research. Given these arguments, simple logit and OLS regressions
were considered more appropriate.

important when examining these descriptive statistics to recognize that these means and
medians are calculated after the exclusion of firms beyond the bounds of ‘‘technical’’
solvency. Inclusion of such firms would increase the magnitude of the dependent variables.
Long-term leverage appears to constitute around 20% of the capital of new firms; however,
this distribution is positively skewed. The relatively low long-term leverage observed is
consistent with evidence that entrepreneurs use short-term financing and personal savings for
start-up.
Table 1 also shows that outsider financing represents 40.2% of the capital of new firms.
This level is constant with empirical evidence of outsider financing use in the early years of
operation (Fluck et al., 2000), however, it is inconsistent with the conclusions made by
Berger and Udell (1998) when they examined data from a nationwide U.S. sample. Applying
a self-constructed insider finance measure suggests that insider sources comprise 50.9% of
the capital of the sample start-up firms, with the remaining proportion (8.9%) being
represented through provisions for liabilities, deposits, and outstanding claims. These
provisions and other items were classified as neither outside or inside financing. Insider
financing was a larger component of the capital of firms for 55% of the sample (161 out of
292).
For the sample, 16.9% of the financing of new firms is provided through bank financing.
Generally, most firms had some form of debt financing (90.1%), however, as Table 1 shows,
only roughly half the sample were currently using some form of long-term and bank financing.
The mean (median) total assets of the firms was AUS$1,140,000 (AUS$157,000), with 25% of
the firms having under AUS$40,000 in total assets, while the mean (median) asset structure of
the sample firms was .4787 (.4922).
6.2. Multivariate analysis
Table 2 provides the results of the tobit regressions between the four dependent variables
and firm characteristics without industry controls. The use of industry controls had no
effect on the inferences and was not found to be incrementally useful in explaining capital
structure and financing level in start-up firms and are consequently not reported. Focusing
upon the statistical significance of the coefficients, three principal observations can be
made. First, size appears to have a significant influence upon the capital structure and
financing of start-ups, with all four variables being positively related to size, consistent
with Hypothesis 1. Second, asset structure is also a significant influence upon business
start-up financing. However, the direction of influence is dependent upon the financing

variables investigated, with leverage and outside financing both being positively related to
the proportion of noncurrent assets of the firm, while long-term leverage and bank
financing were found to be negatively related. Third, it appears that both legal organization
and intent for growth appear to have little effect upon debt use, however, both these
variables do appear to positively influence the use of bank financing. This suggests that
there may be unique differences between bank financing and other outside financing
sources.11
Table 3 provides the results of the logit and OLS analyses that separate the use and
magnitude of financing for start-ups. For all the four financing options, the influence of size
upon the decision to use a particular type of financing is strong, with all logit coefficients
significant at P<.001. For example, a 10-fold increase in firm size around the mean increases
the likelihood of using bank finance from 30.7% to 41.9%. In addition, the OLS coefficients
are all positive for the financing variables except for long-term leverage. For example, a 10fold increase in the size of the firm corresponds with an 8.8% increase in the outside finance
of the firm, while it also corresponds with a 5.9% decrease in long-term leverage for firms
that utilize that type of financing. Overall, the influence of size upon start-up financing
appears to be more influential for the decision to use a particular type of financing rather than
explaining the magnitude of use.
The effects of asset structure generally appear to be stable across both the decision to use
and the proportion of use of financing choices, consistent with the tobit specification. For

Previous research has shown differing relationships between capital structure and the other characteristics of
the firm when the sample is based on large listed firms and relatively smaller firms, respectively. To test for
potential-size interaction effects, the sample was partitioned into two equal groups: above and below the sample
median for total assets. Comparisons between the restricted and unrestricted models suggested that the
unrestricted-size interaction models do not significantly provide incremental information beyond the simple
models. Consequentially, they are not reported in the article.

example, the influence of asset structure upon the use of bank financing suggests at the mean
that a 10% increase in the noncurrent to total assets ratio leads to an increase in the
probability of bank finance use from 32.2% to 34.9%. Of the firms that utilized bank
financing, a 10% increase in the proportion of fixed assets leads to an increase of bank
finance of 1.8%.
The coefficients for legal organization suggest that whether a firm is incorporated has little
effect on the use or magnitude of debt utilized by start-ups. Examining the results for
financing and legal organization, they show that incorporation of the firm is associated with
an 8.4% increase in the proportion of outside and bank financing in the firm, respectively,
although only outside financing has an observed relationship at conventional levels of
significance. Interestingly, the observed significant effect of incorporation upon bank
financing is not reflected significantly upon the decision to use bank financing or its
magnitude, although both coefficients are positive.
Intent for growth arguments receives little support from the separate regressions, aside
from strong effect upon the use of bank financing. For example, at the mean, intention for
expansion increases the likelihood of using bank financing from 23.2% to 42.1%. However,
this effect does not hold in explaining the proportion of financing: The coefficient of bank
financing for firms that utilize this type of finance is not significant and is actually negative.

This suggests that the relationship between growth intention and the use of bank financing
appears to be driving the overall positive relationship between bank financing and growth
intention found in the tobit regression. All the logit and OLS regressions are significant,
however, their predictive abilities are modest, with the logit models being able to predict
between 8.4% and 21.5% of the variance in the financing of the sample firms, and the OLS
models being able to predict between 3.8% and 14.9% of the variance in the financing of the
sample firms.
6.3. Owners’ characteristics and start-up financing
As discussed earlier, owners’ characteristics may provide some additional predictive power
in explaining the capital structure and financing characteristics of new firms. To test for this
influence, three owners’ characteristic variables were included in the regression models
above.
Table 4 provides the tobit regression results of including the major decision maker
with the other explanatory variables. Due to the extra data requirements and the optional
nature of the question within the survey, the sample available for analysis of the
influence of owners’ characteristics is reduced to 193 firms. Importantly, in the
regressions undertaken, industry is not excluded from any of these tests, as the major

decision maker may also influence the industry sector of the new venture (Coleman,
2000). Examining the coefficients, two main points are noted. First, all the independent
variables exhibit similar relationships with the financing and capital structure variables,
aside from the decreased magnitude and significance of incorporation and growth
intention upon bank financing. Second, the major decision maker’s characteristics do
not appear to affect the financing of the firm after firm characteristics are considered.
This is demonstrated by both the lack of significance of the owners’ characteristics and
the insignificance of the likelihood ratio between the models with and without owner’s
characteristics. A variable that may have some potential for providing financing
information is the years-of-experience variable that is always negatively related with
the financing variables, although at no time is this relationship significant at conventional
levels. The negative relationship between bank financing and years of experience can
potentially be explained if years of experience is positively correlated with entrepreneur
wealth or risk aversion.

7. Implications
This section reviews the implications in light of the variables investigated. Size
appears to be an important factor in the financing of new businesses. Consistent with
the theoretical arguments developed earlier, the larger the start-up, the greater the
proportion of debt, long-term debt, outside financing, and bank financing. Distinguishing
between the decision to use and the proportion of financing use revealed that size was
consistently an important explanation in the decision to use debt and bank financing by
start-ups. This highlights the importance that scale and market access have upon the
capital structure of start-ups. Given the empirical evidence, the interaction between
outside/inside finance and size is important and should be controlled when examining
such financing relationships.
The role of asset structure upon the start-up firms’ finances demonstrates the importance of
tangibility of assets and its impact upon financing opportunities. Firms with a relative lack of
tangible assets appear to be financed through less formal means, where nonbank financing,
such as loans from individuals unrelated to business, plays a more important role in the capital
structure of start-ups. This highlights the importance of network resources in these types of
ventures. The positive relationship observed between bank financing (and long-term
financing) and asset structure reconciles with the matching of long-term debt (for which
bank financing is a significant component) against the fixed assets that can be used as
collateral. Therefore, these findings are consistent with agency cost arguments and suggest
that banks rely upon these contracting mechanisms (fixed assets of the firm) in their financing
of start-up firms to minimize such costs. However, this raises interesting questions: Why do
not other ‘‘lenders’’ outside the scope of the banks appear to use such mechanisms? Are these
debt amounts more like equity? Such an argument is consistent with the classic definition
problem of debt versus equity in unlisted business. Alternatively, are these lenders less
interested in the commercial or ‘‘arms-length’’ transactions and have an interest in the

<-----Page 17----->278

G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

entrepreneur undertaking their business? Such an explanation is consistent with the use of
network resources.
Another explanation is the matching of maturities of the start-up firms’ finances with the
firms’ assets. This risk-management practice may lead to short-term components of debt
confounding the relationship between asset structure and leverage. Given that short-term debt
generally constitutes a larger component of financing than long-term debt, firms matching the
maturity of their debt with their assets may cause an inverse relationship between leverage
and asset structure. Further research is needed to distinguish between these explanations
underlying the relationship observed. Finally, given the observed effect of asset structure,
studies that fail to include asset structure effects, suffer from an omitted variable problem,
potentially biasing their results.
Organization type provided no explanatory power with regard to the proportion of
leverage in the firm. However, both outside and bank finances appeared to increase as a
result of the firm being incorporated. This suggests that the signaling effects associated
with incorporation may provide a nontrivial benefit for these firms. However, whether
incorporation actually results in less risk or better performance cannot be addressed by this
study.
The only significant influence of the intention of growth for start-ups and their choice
of financing was upon bank financing. In particular, start-ups with the intent to grow
appear to be more likely to use bank financing, a result consistent with the increased
incentives in establishing credit relationships as early as possible for these type of firms.
The failure of intention for growth to influence other capital structure or financing choices
is inconsistent with the agency arguments that predict a lower use of outside and long-debt
finance. How these agency conflicts interact with start-up strategic choices is an area for
future inquiry.
The failure for the major decision makers characteristics being significant with start-up
financing is consistent with (1) entrepreneurs with different education, experience, and gender
not differing on financing preferences after taking other firm characteristics into consideration
(demand side) and/or (2) suggestions that financiers weigh the characteristics of the firm,
such as size and noncurrent assets, more highly than those of the major decision maker
(supply side). Obviously, there are many other ways financiers can evaluate financing,
unfortunately many of these potential characteristics that have been documented by other
studies cannot be tested due to data constraints. However, given the above results, it appears
that basic demographic variables do not impact upon the financing decision after considering
firm characteristics.

8. Limitations and future research
This section discusses some of the limitations of the study and offers suggestions for
improvement as well as other ideas for future research examining capital structure
choices for start-ups. First, there are several factors that are unable to be controlled
due to data constraints. For example, the potential influence of ethic background upon

<-----Page 18----->G. Cassar / Journal of Business Venturing 19 (2004) 261–283

279

start-up finance through both resource and motivation issues has been noted by several
researchers (Ando, 1988; Chen and Cole, 1988; Bates, 1991,1997; Bond and Townsend,
1996). Additionally, financing choices have been argued to be influenced by earnings
profiles, growth potential, and the personal wealth of the entrepreneur (Cosh and Hughes,
1994; Chaganti et al., 1995; Cressy and Olofsson, 1997; Avery et al., 1998; Berger and
Udell, 1998). This study also cannot consider the role of personal collateral, varying
interest rates, or the owners’ previous relationships with financiers. All of these factors
influence the demand and supply of outside financing (Storey, 1994; Cressy, 1996;
Coleman, 1998). Unfortunately, the data set does not provide the detail necessary to
undertake such investigations. However, investigations of this nature would be fruitful
given the potential dominance of the major decision maker to influence the behaviors of
the firm, particularly during start-up. Obviously, the extent to which the influences do
bias the coefficients is consequently a limitation of the study.
Another limitation is the possibility that operations or events that have occurred since startup could be potentially confounding to the findings of the study. For example, the equity
claims will be a greater (lower) proportion of total capital when the firm has returned positive
(negative) earnings over the period between start-up and the point in time to which the survey
information relates. For firms with positive earnings, this would result in lower leverage due
to increased equity, or as a follow-on effect, it could lead to further debt financing
opportunities due to good profitability. The potential to improve upon the timing of survey
may be more difficult than probably initially assumed, given that the time when the business
actually starts can be arbitrary.12 However, the heterogeneity of the start-up stages of the
sample firms is a limitation of the study.
The ideal sample would consist of entrepreneurs in the process of starting a venture and
tracking these entrepreneurs through the initial stages of business formation. However, it is
acknowledged that such longitudinal opportunities may be relatively limited when compared
to larger, more established firms due to their longevity and more demanding reporting
requirements. The second best option available to researchers is obtaining actual financial
information of new firms or surveying entrepreneurs who have started business ventures,
with the time between start-up and the collection of information as small as sample
availability allows. Whether the researcher wants to inquire about the current capital
structure or the initial capital structure of the firm is a compromise between the event bias
mentioned above and potential reliability problems due to recall and the arbitrary definition
of start-up.
Following firms in more detail, through interviews and surveys, may increase understanding of the motivations for searching for different types of finance and the nature of

12

Studies that have examined business start-ups define several points that could constitute business start-up
(Reynolds and Miller, 1992; Gatewood et al., 1995; Carter et al., 1996; Alsos and Kolvereid, 1998). The literature
also suggests that start-up should be considered more as a process over time rather than occurring at a distinct
point of time.

<-----Page 19----->280

such searches. A related issue is the refusal of credit and the notion of credit rationing.
Given this study’s research design, which focuses on final outcomes, it is unable to
determine the structure of the search for capital, the process by which the finances were
obtained, and the degree to which the firms were credit rationed. However, all these
questions are important in providing further insight on how financial intermediaries allocate
funds to firms. Interviews and surveying techniques may provide an alternative approach to
determine the role of finance matching within new and small firms. Competing explanations for the presence of matching include firms deliberately matching to reduce exposure
to duration risks or a consequence of financiers only providing capital backed by securable
assets or alternatively a natural function of the firms operating characteristics.
There is still potential for examining specific industries with unique characteristics or
specific funding arrangements to provide a more complete picture of financing and
capital structure. For example, the high-tech sector has been a focus for several empirical
investigations. These investigations provided the opportunity to explore a set of firms that
can be characterized by limited tangible assets, high risk, and high growth potential,
consequentially, it provided contrasting evidence beyond the ‘‘average’’ new venture that
most likely consists of more tangible assets, lower risk, and limited probability of
substantial growth. What other contextual circumstances offer unique opportunities to
validate finance theories on capital structure? How do joint venture or angel investors
overcome information asymmetries and moral hazard and how do these mechanisms
change according to context? Understanding how particular sectors are funded and
whether such sectors suffer or gain from unique funding arrangements, such as unique
information asymmetries or increased discretion or environmental volatility, will assist in
improving our understanding and provide guidance for other potential financiers and
entrepreneurs forming new ventures.
Studying the funding of new innovative firms is also a fertile area of research given the
apparent benefits of funding innovation within an economy. Targeting the small percentage of
start-ups that are created with the potential to provide substantial employment growth may
also be a fruitful exercise, similar to the approach adopted by some authors, such as Bhide
(2000). However, careful consideration of how sampling bias problems can be avoided will
need to take place to ensure that results inferred are not just from ‘‘the winners’’ but ‘‘the
losers’’ as well.
