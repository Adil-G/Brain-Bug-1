What Is Strategy?

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

The myriad activities that go into creating,
producing, selling, and delivering a product
or service are the basic units of competitive
advantage. Operational effectiveness
means performing these activities better—
that is, faster, or with fewer inputs and
defects—than rivals. Companies can reap
enormous advantages from operational effectiveness, as Japanese firms demonstrated in the 1970s and 1980s with such
practices as total quality management and
continuous improvement. But from a competitive standpoint, the problem with operational effectiveness is that best practices
are easily emulated. As all competitors in an
industry adopt them, the productivity
frontier—the maximum value a company
can deliver at a given cost, given the best
available technology, skills, and management techniques—shifts outward, lowering
costs and improving value at the same
time. Such competition produces absolute
improvement in operational effectiveness,
but relative improvement for no one. And
the more benchmarking that companies
do, the more competitive convergence
you have—that is, the more indistinguishable companies are from one another.

Three key principles underlie strategic positioning.

Strategic positioning attempts to achieve
sustainable competitive advantage by
preserving what is distinctive about a company. It means performing different activities from rivals, or performing similar activities in different ways.

1. Strategy is the creation of a unique and
valuable position, involving a different set
of activities. Strategic position emerges from
three distinct sources:
• serving few needs of many customers (Jiffy
Lube provides only auto lubricants)
• serving broad needs of few customers
(Bessemer Trust targets only very highwealth clients)
• serving broad needs of many customers
in a narrow market (Carmike Cinemas operates only in cities with a population
under 200,000)
2. Strategy requires you to make trade-offs
in competing—to choose what not to do.
Some competitive activities are incompatible;
thus, gains in one area can be achieved only
at the expense of another area. For example,
Neutrogena soap is positioned more as a medicinal product than as a cleansing agent. The
company says “no” to sales based on deodorizing, gives up large volume, and sacrifices
manufacturing efficiencies. By contrast, Maytag’s
decision to extend its product line and acquire other brands represented a failure to
make difficult trade-offs: the boost in revenues came at the expense of return on sales.

3. Strategy involves creating “fit” among a
company’s activities. Fit has to do with the
ways a company’s activities interact and reinforce one another. For example, Vanguard
Group aligns all of its activities with a low-cost
strategy; it distributes funds directly to consumers and minimizes portfolio turnover. Fit
drives both competitive advantage and sustainability: when activities mutually reinforce
each other, competitors can’t easily imitate
them. When Continental Lite tried to match a
few of Southwest Airlines’ activities, but not
the whole interlocking system, the results
were disastrous.
Employees need guidance about how to
deepen a strategic position rather than
broaden or compromise it. About how to extend the company’s uniqueness while
strengthening the fit among its activities. This
work of deciding which target group of customers and needs to serve requires discipline,
the ability to set limits, and forthright communication. Clearly, strategy and leadership are
inextricably linked.

I. Operational Effectiveness Is Not
Strategy
For almost two decades, managers have been
learning to play by a new set of rules. Companies must be ﬂexible to respond rapidly to
competitive and market changes. They must
benchmark continuously to achieve best practice. They must outsource aggressively to gain
efﬁciencies. And they must nurture a few core
competencies in race to stay ahead of rivals.
Positioning—once the heart of strategy—is
rejected as too static for today’s dynamic markets and changing technologies. According to
the new dogma, rivals can quickly copy any
market position, and competitive advantage is,
at best, temporary.
But those beliefs are dangerous half-truths,
and they are leading more and more companies
down the path of mutually destructive competition. True, some barriers to competition are
falling as regulation eases and markets become
global. True, companies have properly invested
energy in becoming leaner and more nimble.
In many industries, however, what some call

harvard business review • november–december 1996

hypercompetition is a self-inﬂicted wound, not
the inevitable outcome of a changing paradigm
of competition.
The root of the problem is the failure to distinguish between operational effectiveness and
strategy. The quest for productivity, quality, and
speed has spawned a remarkable number of
management tools and techniques: total quality
management, benchmarking, time-based competition, outsourcing, partnering, reengineering,
change management. Although the resulting
operational improvements have often been
dramatic, many companies have been frustrated
by their inability to translate those gains into
sustainable proﬁtability. And bit by bit, almost
imperceptibly, management tools have taken
the place of strategy. As managers push to improve on all fronts, they move farther away
from viable competitive positions.
Operational Effectiveness: Necessary but Not
Sufﬁcient. Operational effectiveness and strategy
are both essential to superior performance,
which, after all, is the primary goal of any enterprise. But they work in very different ways.

Michael E. Porter is the C. Roland
Christensen Professor of Business
Administration at the Harvard Business
School in Boston, Massachusetts.
This article has benefited greatly
from the assistance of many individuals
and companies. The author gives special thanks to Jan Rivkin, the coauthor
of a related paper. Substantial research
contributions have been made by
Nicolaj Siggelkow, Dawn Sylvester, and
Lucia Marshall. Tarun Khanna, Roger
Martin, and Anita McGahan have provided especially extensive comments.

A company can outperform rivals only if it can
establish a difference that it can preserve. It must
deliver greater value to customers or create
comparable value at a lower cost, or do both.
The arithmetic of superior proﬁtability then follows: delivering greater value allows a company
to charge higher average unit prices; greater
efficiency results in lower average unit costs.
Ultimately, all differences between companies
in cost or price derive from the hundreds of activities required to create, produce, sell, and deliver their products or services, such as calling
on customers, assembling ﬁnal products, and
training employees. Cost is generated by performing activities, and cost advantage arises
from performing particular activities more efﬁciently than competitors. Similarly, differentiation arises from both the choice of activities and
how they are performed. Activities, then are the
basic units of competitive advantage. Overall advantage or disadvantage results from all a company’s activities, not only a few.1
Operational effectiveness (OE) means performing similar activities better than rivals perform them. Operational effectiveness includes
but is not limited to efﬁciency. It refers to any
number of practices that allow a company to better utilize its inputs by, for example, reducing defects in products or developing better products
faster. In contrast, strategic positioning means
performing different activities from rivals’ or performing similar activities in different ways.
Differences in operational effectiveness among
companies are pervasive. Some companies
are able to get more out of their inputs than
others because they eliminate wasted effort,
employ more advanced technology, motivate
employees better, or have greater insight into
managing particular activities or sets of activities. Such differences in operational effectiveness are an important source of differences in
proﬁtability among competitors because they
directly affect relative cost positions and
levels of differentiation.
Differences in operational effectiveness
were at the heart of the Japanese challenge to
Western companies in the 1980s. The Japanese were so far ahead of rivals in operational
effectiveness that they could offer lower cost
and superior quality at the same time. It is
worth dwelling on this point, because so much
recent thinking about competition depends
on it. Imagine for a moment a productivity
frontier that constitutes the sum of all existing

harvard business review • november–december 1996

best practices at any given time. Think of it as
the maximum value that a company delivering a particular product or service can create
at a given cost, using the best available technologies, skills, management techniques, and
purchased inputs. The productivity frontier
can apply to individual activities, to groups
of linked activities such as order processing
and manufacturing, and to an entire company’s activities. When a company improves
its operational effectiveness, it moves toward
the frontier. Doing so may require capital investment, different personnel, or simply new
ways of managing.
The productivity frontier is constantly shifting outward as new technologies and management approaches are developed and as
new inputs become available. Laptop computers, mobile communications, the Internet,
and software such as Lotus Notes, for example, have redeﬁned the productivity frontier
for sales-force operations and created rich
possibilities for linking sales with such activities as order processing and after-sales support. Similarly, lean production, which involves a
family of activities, has allowed substantial
improvements in manufacturing productivity
and asset utilization.
For at least the past decade, managers have
been preoccupied with improving operational
effectiveness. Through programs such as TQM,
time-based competition, and benchmarking,
they have changed how they perform activities
in order to eliminate inefﬁciencies, improve
customer satisfaction, and achieve best practice.
Hoping to keep up with shifts in the productivity frontier, managers have embraced continuous improvement, empowerment, change
management, and the so-called learning organization. The popularity of outsourcing and
the virtual corporation reﬂect the growing
recognition that it is difﬁcult to perform all
activities as productively as specialists.
As companies move to the frontier, they can
often improve on multiple dimensions of performance at the same time. For example, manufacturers that adopted the Japanese practice of
rapid changeovers in the 1980s were able to
lower cost and improve differentiation simultaneously. What were once believed to be
real trade-offs—between defects and costs, for
example—turned out to be illusions created by
poor operational effectiveness. Managers have
learned to reject such false trade-offs.

<-----Page 5----->What Is Strategy?

Constant improvement in operational effectiveness is necessary to achieve superior
proﬁtability. However, it is not usually sufﬁcient. Few companies have competed successfully on the basis of operational effectiveness
over an extended period, and staying ahead of
rivals gets harder every day. The most obvious
reason for that is the rapid diffusion of best
practices. Competitors can quickly imitate
management techniques, new technologies,
input improvements, and superior ways of
meeting customers’ needs. The most generic
solutions—those that can be used in multiple
settings—diffuse the fastest. Witness the proliferation of OE techniques accelerated by
support from consultants.
OE competition shifts the productivity frontier outward, effectively raising the bar for
everyone. But although such competition produces absolute improvement in operational effectiveness, it leads to relative improvement
for no one. Consider the $5 billion-plus U.S.
commercial-printing industry. The major players—
R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company, Quebecor,
World Color Press, and Big Flower Press—are
competing head to head, serving all types of
customers, offering the same array of printing
technologies (gravure and web offset), investing heavily in the same new equipment,
running their presses faster, and reducing crew
sizes. But the resulting major productivity

(state of best practice)

gains are being captured by customers and
equipment suppliers, not retained in superior
proﬁtability. Even industry-leader Donnelley’s
proﬁt margin, consistently higher than 7% in
the 1980s, fell to less than 4.6% in 1995. This
pattern is playing itself out in industry after
industry. Even the Japanese, pioneers of the
new competition, suffer from persistently low
proﬁts. (See the insert “Japanese Companies
Rarely Have Strategies.”)
The second reason that improved operational effectiveness is insufﬁcient—competitive
convergence—is more subtle and insidious. The
more benchmarking companies do, the more
they look alike. The more that rivals outsource activities to efﬁcient third parties,
often the same ones, the more generic those
activities become. As rivals imitate one another’s improvements in quality, cycle times,
or supplier partnerships, strategies converge
and competition becomes a series of races
down identical paths that no one can win.
Competition based on operational effectiveness alone is mutually destructive, leading
to wars of attrition that can be arrested only
by limiting competition.
The recent wave of industry consolidation
through mergers makes sense in the context of
OE competition. Driven by performance pressures but lacking strategic vision, company
after company has had no better idea than to
buy up its rivals. The competitors left standing
are often those that outlasted others, not companies with real advantage.
After a decade of impressive gains in operational effectiveness, many companies are facing
diminishing returns. Continuous improvement
has been etched on managers’ brains. But its
tools unwittingly draw companies toward imitation and homogeneity. Gradually, managers
have let operational effectiveness supplant strategy. The result is zero-sum competition, static or
declining prices, and pressures on costs that
compromise companies’ ability to invest in the
business for the long term.

Competitive strategy is about being different.
It means deliberately choosing a different set
of activities to deliver a unique mix of value.
Southwest Airlines Company, for example,
offers short-haul, low-cost, point-to-point service
between midsize cities and secondary airports

<-----Page 6----->What Is Strategy?

in large cities. Southwest avoids large airports
and does not ﬂy great distances. Its customers
include business travelers, families, and students. Southwest’s frequent departures and
low fares attract price-sensitive customers who
otherwise would travel by bus or car, and
convenience-oriented travelers who would
choose a full-service airline on other routes.
Most managers describe strategic positioning in terms of their customers: “Southwest
Airlines serves price- and convenience-sensitive
travelers,” for example. But the essence of strategy is in the activities—choosing to perform
activities differently or to perform different activities than rivals. Otherwise, a strategy is
nothing more than a marketing slogan that
will not withstand competition.
A full-service airline is conﬁgured to get
passengers from almost any point A to any point
B. To reach a large number of destinations and
serve passengers with connecting ﬂights, full-

Japanese Companies Rarely Have Strategies
The Japanese triggered a global revolution in operational effectiveness in the
1970s and 1980s, pioneering practices
such as total quality management and
continuous improvement. As a result,
Japanese manufacturers enjoyed substantial cost and quality advantages for
many years.
But Japanese companies rarely developed distinct strategic positions of
the kind discussed in this article.
Those that did—Sony, Canon, and Sega,
for example—were the exception rather
than the rule. Most Japanese companies imitate and emulate one another.
All rivals offer most if not all product
varieties, features, and services; they
employ all channels and match one
anothers’ plant conﬁgurations.
The dangers of Japanese-style competition are now becoming easier to recognize. In the 1980s, with rivals operating far from the productivity frontier, it
seemed possible to win on both cost
and quality indeﬁnitely. Japanese companies were all able to grow in an expanding domestic economy and by
penetrating global markets. They ap-

peared unstoppable. But as the gap in
operational effectiveness narrows, Japanese companies are increasingly
caught in a trap of their own making. If
they are to escape the mutually destructive battles now ravaging their performance, Japanese companies will have
to learn strategy.
To do so, they may have to overcome
strong cultural barriers. Japan is notoriously consensus oriented, and companies have a strong tendency to mediate differences among individuals
rather than accentuate them. Strategy,
on the other hand, requires hard
choices. The Japanese also have a
deeply ingrained service tradition that
predisposes them to go to great
lengths to satisfy any need a customer
expresses. Companies that compete in
that way end up blurring their distinct
positioning, becoming all things to
all customers.

This discussion of Japan is drawn from
the author’s research with Hirotaka
Takeuchi, with help from Mariko
Sakakibara.

harvard business review • november–december 1996

service airlines employ a hub-and-spoke system
centered on major airports. To attract passengers
who desire more comfort, they offer ﬁrst-class
or business-class service. To accommodate
passengers who must change planes, they coordinate schedules and check and transfer
baggage. Because some passengers will be
traveling for many hours, full-service airlines
serve meals.
Southwest, in contrast, tailors all its activities
to deliver low-cost, convenient service on its particular type of route. Through fast turnarounds at
the gate of only 15 minutes, Southwest is able to
keep planes ﬂying longer hours than rivals and
provide frequent departures with fewer aircraft.
Southwest does not offer meals, assigned seats,
interline baggage checking, or premium classes
of service. Automated ticketing at the gate
encourages customers to bypass travel agents, allowing Southwest to avoid their commissions.
A standardized ﬂeet of 737 aircraft boosts the
efﬁciency of maintenance.
Southwest has staked out a unique and valuable strategic position based on a tailored set
of activities. On the routes served by Southwest, a full-service airline could never be as
convenient or as low cost.
Ikea, the global furniture retailer based in
Sweden, also has a clear strategic positioning.
Ikea targets young furniture buyers who want
style at low cost. What turns this marketing
concept into a strategic positioning is the tailored set of activities that make it work. Like
Southwest, Ikea has chosen to perform activities differently from its rivals.
Consider the typical furniture store. Showrooms display samples of the merchandise.
One area might contain 25 sofas; another will
display ﬁve dining tables. But those items represent only a fraction of the choices available
to customers. Dozens of books displaying fabric
swatches or wood samples or alternate styles
offer customers thousands of product varieties
to choose from. Salespeople often escort customers through the store, answering questions
and helping them navigate this maze of choices.
Once a customer makes a selection, the order
is relayed to a third-party manufacturer. With
luck, the furniture will be delivered to the customer’s home within six to eight weeks. This is
a value chain that maximizes customization
and service but does so at high cost.
In contrast, Ikea serves customers who are
happy to trade off service for cost. Instead of

page 7

<-----Page 7----->What Is Strategy?

having a sales associate trail customers around
the store, Ikea uses a self-service model based
on clear, in-store displays. Rather than rely
solely on third-party manufacturers, Ikea designs
its own low-cost, modular, ready-to-assemble
furniture to ﬁt its positioning. In huge stores,
Ikea displays every product it sells in room-like
settings, so customers don’t need a decorator
to help them imagine how to put the pieces together. Adjacent to the furnished showrooms
is a warehouse section with the products in
boxes on pallets. Customers are expected to do
their own pickup and delivery, and Ikea will
even sell you a roof rack for your car that you
can return for a refund on your next visit.
Although much of its low-cost position comes
from having customers “do it themselves,” Ikea
offers a number of extra services that its competitors do not. In-store child care is one. Extended hours are another. Those services are
uniquely aligned with the needs of its customers, who are young, not wealthy, likely to
have children (but no nanny), and, because
they work for a living, have a need to shop
at odd hours.
The Origins of Strategic Positions. Strategic
positions emerge from three distinct sources,
which are not mutually exclusive and often
overlap. First, positioning can be based on producing a subset of an industry’s products or
services. I call this variety-based positioning
because it is based on the choice of product

or service varieties rather than customer
segments. Variety-based positioning makes
economic sense when a company can best
produce particular products or services using
distinctive sets of activities.
Jiffy Lube International, for instance, specializes in automotive lubricants and does not
offer other car repair or maintenance services.
Its value chain produces faster service at a
lower cost than broader line repair shops, a
combination so attractive that many customers
subdivide their purchases, buying oil changes
from the focused competitor, Jiffy Lube, and
going to rivals for other services.
The Vanguard Group, a leader in the mutual
fund industry, is another example of varietybased positioning. Vanguard provides an
array of common stock, bond, and money
market funds that offer predictable performance and rock-bottom expenses. The company’s investment approach deliberately
sacriﬁces the possibility of extraordinary performance in any one year for good relative
performance in every year. Vanguard is known,
for example, for its index funds. It avoids making bets on interest rates and steers clear of
narrow stock groups. Fund managers keep
trading levels low, which holds expenses
down; in addition, the company discourages
customers from rapid buying and selling because doing so drives up costs and can force a
fund manager to trade in order to deploy new

Finding New Positions: The Entrepreneurial Edge
Strategic competition can be thought of as
the process of perceiving new positions that
woo customers from established positions or
draw new customers into the market. For example, superstores offering depth of merchandise in a single product category take
market share from broad-line department
stores offering a more limited selection in
many categories. Mail-order catalogs pick off
customers who crave convenience. In principle, incumbents and entrepreneurs face the
same challenges in ﬁnding new strategic positions. In practice, new entrants often have
the edge.
Strategic positionings are often not obvious, and ﬁnding them requires creativity and
insight. New entrants often discover unique

positions that have been available but simply
overlooked by established competitors. Ikea,
for example, recognized a customer group
that had been ignored or served poorly. Circuit City Stores’ entry into used cars, CarMax,
is based on a new way of performing activities—
extensive refurbishing of cars, product guarantees, no-haggle pricing, sophisticated use of inhouse customer ﬁnancing—that has long
been open to incumbents.
New entrants can prosper by occupying a
position that a competitor once held but has
ceded through years of imitation and straddling. And entrants coming from other industries can create new positions because of distinctive activities drawn from their other
businesses. CarMax borrows heavily from

harvard business review • november–december 1996

Circuit City’s expertise in inventory management, credit, and other activities in consumer
electronics retailing.
Most commonly, however, new positions
open up because of change. New customer
groups or purchase occasions arise; new
needs emerge as societies evolve; new distribution channels appear; new technologies
are developed; new machinery or information systems become available. When such
changes happen, new entrants, unencumbered by a long history in the industry, can
often more easily perceive the potential
for a new way of competing. Unlike incumbents, newcomers can be more ﬂexible because they face no trade-offs with their
existing activities.

capital and raise cash for redemptions.
Vanguard also takes a consistent low-cost approach to managing distribution, customer
service, and marketing. Many investors include one or more Vanguard funds in their
portfolio, while buying aggressively managed
or specialized funds from competitors.
The people who use Vanguard or Jiffy
Lube are responding to a superior value chain
for a particular type of service. A variety-based
positioning can serve a wide array of customers, but for most it will meet only a subset of
their needs.
A second basis for positioning is that of serving most or all the needs of a particular group
of customers. I call this needs-based positioning,
which comes closer to traditional thinking
about targeting a segment of customers. It arises
when there are groups of customers with differing needs, and when a tailored set of activities can serve those needs best. Some groups of
customers are more price sensitive than others,
demand different product features, and need
varying amounts of information, support, and
services. Ikea’s customers are a good example
of such a group. Ikea seeks to meet all the
home furnishing needs of its target customers,
not just a subset of them.
A variant of needs-based positioning arises
when the same customer has different needs
on different occasions or for different types of
transactions. The same person, for example,
may have different needs when traveling on
business than when traveling for pleasure with
the family. Buyers of cans—beverage companies, for example—will likely have different
needs from their primary supplier than from
their secondary source.
It is intuitive for most managers to conceive
of their business in terms of the customers’
needs they are meeting. But a critical element
of needs-based positioning is not at all intuitive
and is often overlooked. Differences in needs
will not translate into meaningful positions
unless the best set of activities to satisfy them
also differs. If that were not the case, every
competitor could meet those same needs, and
there would be nothing unique or valuable
about the positioning.
In private banking, for example, Bessemer
Trust Company targets families with a minimum of $5 million in investable assets who
want capital preservation combined with
wealth accumulation. By assigning one sophis-

harvard business review • november–december 1996

ticated account ofﬁcer for every 14 families,
Bessemer has conﬁgured its activities for personalized service. Meetings, for example, are
more likely to be held at a client’s ranch or
yacht than in the ofﬁce. Bessemer offers a wide
array of customized services, including investment management and estate administration,
oversight of oil and gas investments, and accounting for racehorses and aircraft. Loans, a
staple of most private banks, are rarely needed
by Bessemer’s clients and make up a tiny fraction of its client balances and income. Despite
the most generous compensation of account
ofﬁcers and the highest personnel cost as a percentage of operating expenses, Bessemer’s differentiation with its target families produces a
return on equity estimated to be the highest of
any private banking competitor.
Citibank’s private bank, on the other hand,
serves clients with minimum assets of about
$250,000 who, in contrast to Bessemer’s clients,
want convenient access to loans—from jumbo
mortgages to deal ﬁnancing. Citibank’s account
managers are primarily lenders. When clients
need other services, their account manager refers them to other Citibank specialists, each of
whom handles prepackaged products. Citibank’s
system is less customized than Bessemer’s and
allows it to have a lower manager-to-client
ratio of 1:125. Biannual ofﬁce meetings are offered only for the largest clients. Both Bessemer
and Citibank have tailored their activities to
meet the needs of a different group of private
banking customers. The same value chain cannot proﬁtably meet the needs of both groups.
The third basis for positioning is that of segmenting customers who are accessible in different ways. Although their needs are similar
to those of other customers, the best conﬁguration of activities to reach them is different. I
call this access-based positioning. Access can be
a function of customer geography or customer scale—or of anything that requires a
different set of activities to reach customers
in the best way.
Segmenting by access is less common and
less well understood than the other two bases.
Carmike Cinemas, for example, operates movie
theaters exclusively in cities and towns with
populations under 200,000. How does Carmike make money in markets that are not only
small but also won’t support big-city ticket
prices? It does so through a set of activities
that result in a lean cost structure. Carmike’s

page 9

<-----Page 9----->What Is Strategy?

small-town customers can be served through
standardized, low-cost theater complexes requiring fewer screens and less sophisticated
projection technology than big-city theaters.
The company’s proprietary information system
and management process eliminate the need
for local administrative staff beyond a single
theater manager. Carmike also reaps advantages from centralized purchasing, lower rent
and payroll costs (because of its locations), and
rock-bottom corporate overhead of 2% (the industry average is 5%). Operating in small communities also allows Carmike to practice a
highly personal form of marketing in which
the theater manager knows patrons and promotes attendance through personal contacts.
By being the dominant if not the only theater
in its markets—the main competition is often
the high school football team—Carmike is also
able to get its pick of ﬁlms and negotiate better
terms with distributors.
Rural versus urban-based customers are
one example of access driving differences in
activities. Serving small rather than large customers or densely rather than sparsely situated customers are other examples in which
the best way to conﬁgure marketing, order
processing, logistics, and after-sale service activities to meet the similar needs of distinct
groups will often differ.
Positioning is not only about carving out a
niche. A position emerging from any of the
sources can be broad or narrow. A focused

The Connection with Generic Strategies
In Competitive Strategy (The Free Press,
1985), I introduced the concept of generic strategies—cost leadership, differentiation, and focus—to represent the
alternative strategic positions in an industry. The generic strategies remain
useful to characterize strategic positions
at the simplest and broadest level. Vanguard, for instance, is an example of a
cost leadership strategy, whereas Ikea,
with its narrow customer group, is an example of cost-based focus. Neutrogena
is a focused differentiator. The bases for
positioning—varieties, needs, and access—
carry the understanding of those generic
strategies to a greater level of speciﬁcity.

Ikea and Southwest are both cost-based
focusers, for example, but Ikea’s focus is
based on the needs of a customer group,
and Southwest’s is based on offering a
particular service variety.
The generic strategies framework introduced the need to choose in order
to avoid becoming caught between
what I then described as the inherent
contradictions of different strategies.
Trade-offs between the activities of incompatible positions explain those
contradictions. Witness Continental
Lite, which tried and failed to compete
in two ways at once.

harvard business review • november–december 1996

competitor, such as Ikea, targets the special
needs of a subset of customers and designs its
activities accordingly. Focused competitors
thrive on groups of customers who are overserved (and hence overpriced) by more broadly
targeted competitors, or underserved (and
hence underpriced). A broadly targeted competitor—for example, Vanguard or Delta Air
Lines—serves a wide array of customers, performing a set of activities designed to meet
their common needs. It ignores or meets only
partially the more idiosyncratic needs of particular customer customer groups.
Whatever the basis—variety, needs, access,
or some combination of the three—positioning
requires a tailored set of activities because it is
always a function of differences on the supply
side; that is, of differences in activities. However, positioning is not always a function of
differences on the demand, or customer,
side. Variety and access positionings, in particular, do not rely on any customer differences.
In practice, however, variety or access differences often accompany needs differences. The
tastes—that is, the needs—of Carmike’s smalltown customers, for instance, run more toward
comedies, Westerns, action ﬁlms, and family
entertainment. Carmike does not run any ﬁlms
rated NC-17.
Having deﬁned positioning, we can now
begin to answer the question, “What is strategy?”
Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of activities. If there were only one ideal position,
there would be no need for strategy. Companies would face a simple imperative—win the
race to discover and preempt it. The essence of
strategic positioning is to choose activities that
are different from rivals’. If the same set of activities were best to produce all varieties, meet
all needs, and access all customers, companies
could easily shift among them and operational
effectiveness would determine performance.

III. A Sustainable Strategic Position
Requires Trade-offs
Choosing a unique position, however, is not
enough to guarantee a sustainable advantage.
A valuable position will attract imitation by incumbents, who are likely to copy it in one of
two ways.
First, a competitor can reposition itself to
match the superior performer. J.C. Penney,
for instance, has been repositioning itself

<-----Page 10----->What Is Strategy?

The essence of strategy is
choosing to perform
activities differently than
rivals do.

from a Sears clone to a more upscale, fashionoriented, soft-goods retailer. A second and
far more common type of imitation is straddling. The straddler seeks to match the benefits
of a successful position while maintaining its
existing position. It grafts new features, services, or technologies onto the activities it
already performs.
For those who argue that competitors can
copy any market position, the airline industry
is a perfect test case. It would seem that nearly
any competitor could imitate any other airline’s activities. Any airline can buy the same
planes, lease the gates, and match the menus
and ticketing and baggage handling services
offered by other airlines.
Continental Airlines saw how well Southwest was doing and decided to straddle. While
maintaining its position as a full-service airline, Continental also set out to match Southwest on a number of point-to-point routes.
The airline dubbed the new service Continental Lite. It eliminated meals and ﬁrstclass service, increased departure frequency,
lowered fares, and shortened turnaround
time at the gate. Because Continental remained
a full-service airline on other routes, it continued to use travel agents and its mixed ﬂeet
of planes and to provide baggage checking
and seat assignments.
But a strategic position is not sustainable
unless there are trade-offs with other positions.
Trade-offs occur when activities are incompatible. Simply put, a trade-off means that
more of one thing necessitates less of another.
An airline can choose to serve meals—adding
cost and slowing turnaround time at the gate—
or it can choose not to, but it cannot do both
without bearing major inefﬁciencies.
Trade-offs create the need for choice and
protect against repositioners and straddlers.
Consider Neutrogena soap. Neutrogena Corporation’s variety-based positioning is built on
a “kind to the skin,” residue-free soap formulated for pH balance. With a large detail force
calling on dermatologists, Neutrogena’s marketing strategy looks more like a drug company’s than a soap maker’s. It advertises in
medical journals, sends direct mail to doctors,
attends medical conferences, and performs research at its own Skincare Institute. To reinforce its positioning, Neutrogena originally
focused its distribution on drugstores and
avoided price promotions. Neutrogena uses a

harvard business review • november–december 1996

slow, more expensive manufacturing process
to mold its fragile soap.
In choosing this position, Neutrogena said
no to the deodorants and skin softeners that
many customers desire in their soap. It gave up
the large-volume potential of selling through
supermarkets and using price promotions. It
sacriﬁced manufacturing efﬁciencies to achieve
the soap’s desired attributes. In its original positioning, Neutrogena made a whole raft of
trade-offs like those, trade-offs that protected
the company from imitators.
Trade-offs arise for three reasons. The ﬁrst is
inconsistencies in image or reputation. A company known for delivering one kind of value
may lack credibility and confuse customers—or
even undermine its reputation—if it delivers another kind of value or attempts to deliver two
inconsistent things at the same time. For example, Ivory soap, with its position as a basic, inexpensive everyday soap, would have a hard time
reshaping its image to match Neutrogena’s premium “medical” reputation. Efforts to create a
new image typically cost tens or even hundreds
of millions of dollars in a major industry—a
powerful barrier to imitation.
Second, and more important, trade-offs arise
from activities themselves. Different positions
(with their tailored activities) require different
product conﬁgurations, different equipment,
different employee behavior, different skills,
and different management systems. Many
trade-offs reﬂect inﬂexibilities in machinery,
people, or systems. The more Ikea has conﬁgured its activities to lower costs by having its
customers do their own assembly and delivery,
the less able it is to satisfy customers who require higher levels of service.
However, trade-offs can be even more basic.
In general, value is destroyed if an activity is
overdesigned or underdesigned for its use. For
example, even if a given salesperson were capable of providing a high level of assistance to
one customer and none to another, the salesperson’s talent (and some of his or her cost)
would be wasted on the second customer.
Moreover, productivity can improve when variation of an activity is limited. By providing a
high level of assistance all the time, the salesperson and the entire sales activity can often
achieve efﬁciencies of learning and scale.
Finally, trade-offs arise from limits on internal coordination and control. By clearly choosing to compete in one way and not another,

page 11

<-----Page 11----->What Is Strategy?

Strategic positions can be
based on customers’
needs, customers’
accessibility, or the
variety of a company’s
products or services.

senior management makes organizational
priorities clear. Companies that try to be all
things to all customers, in contrast, risk confusion in the trenches as employees attempt to
make day-to-day operating decisions without a
clear framework.
Positioning trade-offs are pervasive in
competition and essential to strategy. They
create the need for choice and purposefully
limit what a company offers. They deter
straddling or repositioning, because competitors that engage in those approaches undermine their strategies and degrade the value
of their existing activities.
Trade-offs ultimately grounded Continental
Lite. The airline lost hundreds of millions of
dollars, and the CEO lost his job. Its planes
were delayed leaving congested hub cities or
slowed at the gate by baggage transfers. Late
ﬂights and cancellations generated a thousand
complaints a day. Continental Lite could not
afford to compete on price and still pay standard travel-agent commissions, but neither
could it do without agents for its full-service
business. The airline compromised by cutting
commissions for all Continental ﬂights across
the board. Similarly, it could not afford to offer
the same frequent-ﬂier beneﬁts to travelers
paying the much lower ticket prices for Lite
service. It compromised again by lowering the
rewards of Continental’s entire frequent-ﬂier
program. The results: angry travel agents and
full-service customers.
Continental tried to compete in two ways at
once. In trying to be low cost on some routes
and full service on others, Continental paid an
enormous straddling penalty. If there were no
trade-offs between the two positions, Continental could have succeeded. But the absence
of trade-offs is a dangerous half-truth that
managers must unlearn. Quality is not always
free. Southwest’s convenience, one kind of
high quality, happens to be consistent with low
costs because its frequent departures are facilitated by a number of low-cost practices—fast
gate turnarounds and automated ticketing, for
example. However, other dimensions of airline quality—an assigned seat, a meal, or baggage transfer—require costs to provide.
In general, false trade-offs between cost and
quality occur primarily when there is redundant or wasted effort, poor control or accuracy,
or weak coordination. Simultaneous improvement of cost and differentiation is possible

harvard business review • november–december 1996

only when a company begins far behind the
productivity frontier or when the frontier
shifts outward. At the frontier, where companies have achieved current best practice, the
trade-off between cost and differentiation is
very real indeed.
After a decade of enjoying productivity advantages, Honda Motor Company and Toyota
Motor Corporation recently bumped up
against the frontier. In 1995, faced with increasing customer resistance to higher automobile prices, Honda found that the only way
to produce a less-expensive car was to skimp
on features. In the United States, it replaced
the rear disk brakes on the Civic with lowercost drum brakes and used cheaper fabric for
the back seat, hoping customers would not
notice. Toyota tried to sell a version of its bestselling Corolla in Japan with unpainted
bumpers and cheaper seats. In Toyota’s case,
customers rebelled, and the company quickly
dropped the new model.
For the past decade, as managers have improved operational effectiveness greatly, they
have internalized the idea that eliminating
trade-offs is a good thing. But if there are no
trade-offs companies will never achieve a sustainable advantage. They will have to run
faster and faster just to stay in place.
As we return to the question, What is
strategy? we see that trade-offs add a new dimension to the answer. Strategy is making
trade-offs in competing. The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do. Without tradeoffs, there would be no need for choice and
thus no need for strategy. Any good idea
could and would be quickly imitated. Again,
performance would once again depend
wholly on operational effectiveness.

IV. Fit Drives Both Competitive
Advantage and Sustainability
Positioning choices determine not only which
activities a company will perform and how it
will conﬁgure individual activities but also
how activities relate to one another. While operational effectiveness is about achieving excellence in individual activities, or functions,
strategy is about combining activities.
Southwest’s rapid gate turnaround, which
allows frequent departures and greater use of
aircraft, is essential to its high-convenience,
low-cost positioning. But how does Southwest
achieve it? Part of the answer lies in the com-

page 12

<-----Page 12----->What Is Strategy?

Trade-offs are essential
to strategy. They create
the need for choice and
purposefully limit what a
company offers.

pany’s well-paid gate and ground crews, whose
productivity in turnarounds is enhanced by
ﬂexible union rules. But the bigger part of the
answer lies in how Southwest performs other
activities. With no meals, no seat assignment,
and no interline baggage transfers, Southwest
avoids having to perform activities that slow
down other airlines. It selects airports and
routes to avoid congestion that introduces delays. Southwest’s strict limits on the type and
length of routes make standardized aircraft
possible: every aircraft Southwest turns is a
Boeing 737.
What is Southwest’s core competence? Its
key success factors? The correct answer is that
everything matters. Southwest’s strategy involves a whole system of activities, not a collection of parts. Its competitive advantage
comes from the way its activities ﬁt and reinforce one another.
Fit locks out imitators by creating a chain
that is as strong as its strongest link. As in most
companies with good strategies, Southwest’s
activities complement one another in ways
that create real economic value. One activity’s
cost, for example, is lowered because of the
way other activities are performed. Similarly,
one activity’s value to customers can be enhanced by a company’s other activities. That is
the way strategic ﬁt creates competitive advantage and superior proﬁtability.
Types of Fit. The importance of ﬁt among
functional policies is one of the oldest ideas in
strategy. Gradually, however, it has been supplanted on the management agenda. Rather
than seeing the company as a whole, managers have turned to “core” competencies, “critical” resources, and “key” success factors. In
fact, ﬁt is a far more central component of
competitive advantage than most realize.
Fit is important because discrete activities
often affect one another. A sophisticated sales
force, for example, confers a greater advantage when the company’s product embodies
premium technology and its marketing approach emphasizes customer assistance and
support. A production line with high levels of
model variety is more valuable when combined with an inventory and order processing
system that minimizes the need for stocking
ﬁnished goods, a sales process equipped to explain and encourage customization, and an
advertising theme that stresses the beneﬁts of
product variations that meet a customer’s

harvard business review • november–december 1996

special needs. Such complementarities are
pervasive in strategy. Although some ﬁt
among activities is generic and applies to
many companies, the most valuable ﬁt is
strategy-speciﬁc because it enhances a position’s uniqueness and ampliﬁes trade-offs.2
There are three types of ﬁt, although they
are not mutually exclusive. First-order ﬁt is
simple consistency between each activity (function) and the overall strategy. Vanguard, for
example, aligns all activities with its low-cost
strategy. It minimizes portfolio turnover and
does not need highly compensated money
managers. The company distributes its funds
directly, avoiding commissions to brokers. It
also limits advertising, relying instead on public relations and word-of-mouth recommendations. Vanguard ties its employees’ bonuses to
cost savings.
Consistency ensures that the competitive advantages of activities cumulate and do not
erode or cancel themselves out. It makes the
strategy easier to communicate to customers,
employees, and shareholders, and improves
implementation through single-mindedness in
the corporation.
Second-order ﬁt occurs when activities are
reinforcing. Neutrogena, for example, markets to upscale hotels eager to offer their
guests a soap recommended by dermatologists. Hotels grant Neutrogena the privilege
of using its customary packaging while requiring other soaps to feature the hotel’s name.
Once guests have tried Neutrogena in a luxury hotel, they are more likely to purchase it
at the drugstore or ask their doctor about it.
Thus Neutrogena’s medical and hotel marketing activities reinforce one another, lowering
total marketing costs.
In another example, Bic Corporation sells a
narrow line of standard, low-priced pens to virtually all major customer markets (retail, commercial, promotional, and giveaway) through
virtually all available channels. As with any
variety-based positioning serving a broad
group of customers, Bic emphasizes a common
need (low price for an acceptable pen) and
uses marketing approaches with a broad reach
(a large sales force and heavy television advertising). Bic gains the beneﬁts of consistency
across nearly all activities, including product
design that emphasizes ease of manufacturing,
plants conﬁgured for low cost, aggressive
purchasing to minimize material costs, and

page 13

<-----Page 13----->What Is Strategy?

in-house parts production whenever the
economics dictate.
Yet Bic goes beyond simple consistency because its activities are reinforcing. For example,
the company uses point-of-sale displays and
frequent packaging changes to stimulate impulse buying. To handle point-of-sale tasks, a
company needs a large sales force. Bic’s is the
largest in its industry, and it handles point-ofsale activities better than its rivals do. Moreover, the combination of point-of-sale activity,
heavy television advertising, and packaging
changes yields far more impulse buying than
any activity in isolation could.
Third-order ﬁt goes beyond activity reinforcement to what I call optimization of effort.
The Gap, a retailer of casual clothes, considers
product availability in its stores a critical element of its strategy. The Gap could keep prod-

ucts either by holding store inventory or by restocking from warehouses. The Gap has
optimized its effort across these activities by
restocking its selection of basic clothing almost
daily out of three warehouses, thereby minimizing the need to carry large in-store inventories. The emphasis is on restocking because the
Gap’s merchandising strategy sticks to basic
items in relatively few colors. While comparable retailers achieve turns of three to four
times per year, the Gap turns its inventory
seven and a half times per year. Rapid restocking, moreover, reduces the cost of implementing the Gap’s short model cycle, which is six to
eight weeks long.3
Coordination and information exchange
across activities to eliminate redundancy and
minimize wasted effort are the most basic
types of effort optimization. But there are

higher levels as well. Product design choices,
for example, can eliminate the need for aftersale service or make it possible for customers
to perform service activities themselves. Similarly, coordination with suppliers or distribution channels can eliminate the need for some
in-house activities, such as end-user training.
In all three types of ﬁt, the whole matters
more than any individual part. Competitive advantage grows out of the entire system of activities. The ﬁt among activities substantially reduces cost or increases differentiation. Beyond
that, the competitive value of individual activities—or the associated skills, competencies, or
resources—cannot be decoupled from the system or the strategy. Thus in competitive companies it can be misleading to explain success
by specifying individual strengths, core competencies, or critical resources. The list of

strengths cuts across many functions, and one
strength blends into others. It is more useful to
think in terms of themes that pervade many
activities, such as low cost, a particular notion
of customer service, or a particular conception
of the value delivered. These themes are embodied in nests of tightly linked activities.
Fit and sustainability. Strategic ﬁt among
many activities is fundamental not only to
competitive advantage but also to the sustainability of that advantage. It is harder for
a rival to match an array of interlocked activities than it is merely to imitate a particular sales-force approach, match a process
technology, or replicate a set of product features. Positions built on systems of activities
are far more sustainable than those built on
individual activities.
Consider this simple exercise. The probabil-

ity that competitors can match any activity is
often less than one. The probabilities then
quickly compound to make matching the entire system highly unlikely (.9 x .9 = .81; .9 x .9 x
.9 x .9 = .66, and so on). Existing companies
that try to reposition or straddle will be forced
to reconﬁgure many activities. And even new
entrants, though they do not confront the
trade-offs facing established rivals, still face formidable barriers to imitation.
The more a company’s positioning rests on
activity systems with second- and third-order
ﬁt, the more sustainable its advantage will be.
Such systems, by their very nature, are usually
difﬁcult to untangle from outside the company and therefore hard to imitate. And even
if rivals can identify the relevant interconnections, they will have difﬁculty replicating
them. Achieving ﬁt is difﬁcult because it re-

quires the integration of decisions and actions
across many independent subunits.
A competitor seeking to match an activity
system gains little by imitating only some
activities and not matching the whole. Performance does not improve; it can decline.
Recall Continental Lite’s disastrous attempt
to imitate Southwest.
Finally, ﬁt among a company’s activities creates pressures and incentives to improve operational effectiveness, which makes imitation
even harder. Fit means that poor performance
in one activity will degrade the performance in
others, so that weaknesses are exposed and
more prone to get attention. Conversely, improvements in one activity will pay dividends
in others. Companies with strong ﬁt among
their activities are rarely inviting targets. Their
superiority in strategy and in execution only

compounds their advantages and raises the
hurdle for imitators.
When activities complement one another, rivals will get little beneﬁt from imitation unless
they successfully match the whole system.
Such situations tend to promote winner-takeall competition. The company that builds the
best activity system—Toys R Us, for instance—
wins, while rivals with similar strategies—
Child World and Lionel Leisure—fall behind.
Thus ﬁnding a new strategic position is often
preferable to being the second or third imitator of an occupied position.
The most viable positions are those whose
activity systems are incompatible because of
tradeoffs. Strategic positioning sets the tradeoff rules that deﬁne how individual activities
will be conﬁgured and integrated. Seeing strategy in terms of activity systems only makes it
clearer why organizational structure, systems,
and processes need to be strategy-speciﬁc.
Tailoring organization to strategy, in turn,
makes complementarities more achievable and
contributes to sustainability.
One implication is that strategic positions
should have a horizon of a decade or more,
not of a single planning cycle. Continuity fosters improvements in individual activities
and the ﬁt across activities, allowing an organization to build unique capabilities and
skills tailored to its strategy. Continuity also
reinforces a company’s identity.
Conversely, frequent shifts in positioning
are costly. Not only must a company reconﬁgure individual activities, but it must also realign entire systems. Some activities may

never catch up to the vacillating strategy. The
inevitable result of frequent shifts in strategy,
or of failure to choose a distinct position in
the ﬁrst place, is “me-too” or hedged activity
conﬁgurations, inconsistencies across functions, and organizational dissonance.
What is strategy? We can now complete the
answer to this question. Strategy is creating ﬁt
among a company’s activities. The success of a
strategy depends on doing many things well—
not just a few—and integrating among them.
If there is no ﬁt among activities, there is no
distinctive strategy and little sustainability.
Management reverts to the simpler task of
overseeing independent functions, and operational effectiveness determines an organization’s relative performance.

V. Rediscovering Strategy
The Failure to Choose. Why do so many companies fail to have a strategy? Why do managers avoid making strategic choices? Or, having
made them in the past, why do managers so
often let strategies decay and blur?
Commonly, the threats to strategy are seen
to emanate from outside a company because
of changes in technology or the behavior of
competitors. Although external changes can be
the problem, the greater threat to strategy
often comes from within. A sound strategy is
undermined by a misguided view of competition, by organizational failures, and, especially,
by the desire to grow.
Managers have become confused about the
necessity of making choices. When many companies operate far from the productivity frontier, trade-offs appear unnecessary. It can seem
that a well-run company should be able to beat
its ineffective rivals on all dimensions simultaneously. Taught by popular management
thinkers that they do not have to make tradeoffs, managers have acquired a macho sense
that to do so is a sign of weakness.
Unnerved by forecasts of hypercompetition,
managers increase its likelihood by imitating
everything about their competitors. Exhorted
to think in terms of revolution, managers
chase every new technology for its own sake.
The pursuit of operational effectiveness is
seductive because it is concrete and actionable.
Over the past decade, managers have been
under increasing pressure to deliver tangible,
measurable performance improvements. Programs in operational effectiveness produce re-

page 17

<-----Page 17----->What Is Strategy?

assuring progress, although superior proﬁtability may remain elusive. Business publications
and consultants ﬂood the market with information about what other companies are doing,
reinforcing the best-practice mentality. Caught
up in the race for operational effectiveness,
many managers simply do not understand the
need to have a strategy.
Companies avoid or blur strategic choices for
other reasons as well. Conventional wisdom
within an industry is often strong, homogenizing competition. Some managers mistake “customer focus” to mean they must serve all customer needs or respond to every request from
distribution channels. Others cite the desire to
preserve ﬂexibility.
Organizational realities also work against
strategy. Trade-offs are frightening, and making no choice is sometimes preferred to risking blame for a bad choice. Companies imitate
one another in a type of herd behavior, each
assuming rivals know something they do not.
Newly empowered employees, who are urged
to seek every possible source of improvement, often lack a vision of the whole and
the perspective to recognize trade-offs. The
failure to choose sometimes comes down to

the reluctance to disappoint valued managers
or employees.
The Growth Trap. Among all other inﬂuences, the desire to grow has perhaps the
most perverse effect on strategy. Trade-offs
and limits appear to constrain growth. Serving one group of customers and excluding
others, for instance, places a real or imagined limit on revenue growth. Broadly targeted strategies emphasizing low price result
in lost sales with customers sensitive to features or service. Differentiators lose sales to
price-sensitive customers.
Managers are constantly tempted to take incremental steps that surpass those limits but
blur a company’s strategic position. Eventually,
pressures to grow or apparent saturation of the
target market lead managers to broaden the
position by extending product lines, adding
new features, imitating competitors’ popular
services, matching processes, and even making
acquisitions. For years, Maytag Corporation’s
success was based on its focus on reliable, durable washers and dryers, later extended to include
dishwashers. However, conventional wisdom
emerging within the industry supported the
notion of selling a full line of products. Con-

Reconnecting with Strategy
Most companies owe their initial success to
a unique strategic position involving clear
trade-offs. Activities once were aligned with
that position. The passage of time and the
pressures of growth, however, led to compromises that were, at ﬁrst, almost imperceptible. Through a succession of incremental changes that each seemed sensible at the
time, many established companies have
compromised their way to homogeneity
with their rivals.
The issue here is not with the companies
whose historical position is no longer viable;
their challenge is to start over, just as a
new entrant would. At issue is a far more
common phenomenon: the established
company achieving mediocre returns and
lacking a clear strategy. Through incremental additions of product varieties, incremental efforts to serve new customer groups,
and emulation of rivals’ activities, the existing company loses its clear competitive
position. Typically, the company has

matched many of its competitors’ offerings
and practices and attempts to sell to most
customer groups.
A number of approaches can help a company reconnect with strategy. The ﬁrst is a
careful look at what it already does. Within
most well-established companies is a core of
uniqueness. It is identiﬁed by answering
questions such as the following:
• Which of our product or service varieties are the most distinctive?
• Which of our product or service varieties are the most proﬁtable?
• Which of our customers are the most
satisﬁed?
• Which customers, channels, or purchase
occasions are the most proﬁtable?
• Which of the activities in our value chain
are the most different and effective?
Around this core of uniqueness are encrustations added incrementally over time.
Like barnacles, they must be removed to reveal the underlying strategic positioning. A

harvard business review • november–december 1996

small percentage of varieties or customers
may well account for most of a company’s
sales and especially its proﬁts. The challenge, then, is to refocus on the unique
core and realign the company’s activities
with it. Customers and product varieties at
the periphery can be sold or allowed
through inattention or price increases to
fade away.
A company’s history can also be instructive. What was the vision of the founder?
What were the products and customers that
made the company? Looking backward, one
can reexamine the original strategy to see if
it is still valid. Can the historical positioning
be implemented in a modern way, one consistent with today’s technologies and practices? This sort of thinking may lead to a
commitment to renew the strategy and may
challenge the organization to recover its distinctiveness. Such a challenge can be galvanizing and can instill the conﬁdence to
make the needed trade-offs.

cerned with slow industry growth and competition from broad-line appliance makers, Maytag
was pressured by dealers and encouraged by
customers to extend its line. Maytag expanded

the Maytag brand and acquired other brands—

Maytag has grown substantially from $684 million in 1985 to a peak of $3.4 billion in 1994,
but return on sales has declined from 8% to
12% in the 1970s and 1980s to an average of
less than 1% between 1989 and 1995. Cost
cutting will improve this performance, but
laundry and dishwasher products still anchor
Maytag’s proﬁtability.
Neutrogena may have fallen into the same
trap. In the early 1990s, its U.S. distribution
broadened to include mass merchandisers
such as Wal-Mart Stores. Under the Neutrogena name, the company expanded into a wide
variety of products—eye-makeup remover and
shampoo, for example—in which it was not

Emerging Industries and Technologies
Developing a strategy in a newly
emerging industry or in a business undergoing revolutionary technological
changes is a daunting proposition. In
such cases, managers face a high level
of uncertainty about the needs of customers, the products and services that
will prove to be the most desired, and
the best conﬁguration of activities and
technologies to deliver them. Because
of all this uncertainty, imitation and
hedging are rampant: unable to risk
being wrong or left behind, companies
match all features, offer all new services, and explore all technologies.
During such periods in an industry’s
development, its basic productivity frontier is being established or reestablished.
Explosive growth can make such times
proﬁtable for many companies, but profits will be temporary because imitation
and strategic convergence will ultimately
destroy industry proﬁtability. The companies that are enduringly successful will be
those that begin as early as possible to
deﬁne and embody in their activities a

unique competitive position. A period of
imitation may be inevitable in emerging
industries, but that period reﬂects the
level of uncertainty rather than a desired
state of affairs.
In high-tech industries, this imitation
phase often continues much longer
than it should. Enraptured by technological change itself, companies pack
more features—most of which are
never used—into their products while
slashing prices across the board. Rarely
are trade-offs even considered. The
drive for growth to satisfy market pressures leads companies into every product area. Although a few companies
with fundamental advantages prosper,
the majority are doomed to a rat race
no one can win.
Ironically, the popular business
press, focused on hot, emerging industries, is prone to presenting these special cases as proof that we have entered
a new era of competition in which
none of the old rules are valid. In fact,
the opposite is true.

harvard business review • november–december 1996

unique and which diluted its image, and it
began turning to price promotions.
Compromises and inconsistencies in the pursuit of growth will erode the competitive advantage a company had with its original varieties
or target customers. Attempts to compete in
several ways at once create confusion and undermine organizational motivation and focus.
Proﬁts fall, but more revenue is seen as the answer. Managers are unable to make choices, so
the company embarks on a new round of broadening and compromises. Often, rivals continue
to match each other until desperation breaks
the cycle, resulting in a merger or downsizing
to the original positioning.
Proﬁtable Growth. Many companies, after a
decade of restructuring and cost-cutting, are
turning their attention to growth. Too often,
efforts to grow blur uniqueness, create compromises, reduce ﬁt, and ultimately undermine
competitive advantage. In fact, the growth imperative is hazardous to strategy.
What approaches to growth preserve and reinforce strategy? Broadly, the prescription is to
concentrate on deepening a strategic position
rather than broadening and compromising it.
One approach is to look for extensions of the
strategy that leverage the existing activity system by offering features or services that rivals
would ﬁnd impossible or costly to match on a
stand-alone basis. In other words, managers
can ask themselves which activities, features,
or forms of competition are feasible or less
costly to them because of complementary activities that their company performs.
Deepening a position involves making the
company’s activities more distinctive, strengthening ﬁt, and communicating the strategy better
to those customers who should value it. But
many companies succumb to the temptation to
chase “easy” growth by adding hot features,
products, or services without screening them or
adapting them to their strategy. Or they target
new customers or markets in which the company has little special to offer. A company can
often grow faster—and far more proﬁtably—by
better penetrating needs and varieties where it is
distinctive than by slugging it out in potentially
higher growth arenas in which the company
lacks uniqueness. Carmike, now the largest theater chain in the United States, owes its rapid
growth to its disciplined concentration on small
markets. The company quickly sells any big-city
theaters that come to it as part of an acquisition.

page 19

<-----Page 19----->What Is Strategy?

Globalization often allows growth that is
consistent with strategy, opening up larger
markets for a focused strategy. Unlike broadening domestically, expanding globally is
likely to leverage and reinforce a company’s
unique position and identity.
Companies seeking growth through broadening within their industry can best contain
the risks to strategy by creating stand-alone
units, each with its own brand name and tailored activities. Maytag has clearly struggled
with this issue. On the one hand, it has organized its premium and value brands into separate units with different strategic positions. On
the other, it has created an umbrella appliance
company for all its brands to gain critical mass.
With shared design, manufacturing, distribution, and customer service, it will be hard to
avoid homogenization. If a given business unit
attempts to compete with different positions
for different products or customers, avoiding
compromise is nearly impossible.
The Role of Leadership. The challenge of developing or reestablishing a clear strategy is
often primarily an organizational one and depends on leadership. With so many forces at
work against making choices and tradeoffs in
organizations, a clear intellectual framework
to guide strategy is a necessary counterweight.
Moreover, strong leaders willing to make
choices are essential.
In many companies, leadership has degenerated into orchestrating operational improvements and making deals. But the leader’s role
is broader and far more important. General
management is more than the stewardship of
individual functions. Its core is strategy: deﬁning
and communicating the company’s unique
position, making trade-offs, and forging ﬁt
among activities. The leader must provide the
discipline to decide which industry changes
and customer needs the company will respond to, while avoiding organizational distractions and maintaining the company’s
distinctiveness. Managers at lower levels lack
the perspective and the conﬁdence to maintain a strategy. There will be constant pressures to compromise, relax trade-offs, and
emulate rivals. One of the leader’s jobs is to
teach others in the organization about
strategy—and to say no.
Strategy renders choices about what not to
do as important as choices about what to do.
Indeed, setting limits is another function of

harvard business review • november–december 1996

leadership. Deciding which target group of customers, varieties, and needs the company
should serve is fundamental to developing a
strategy. But so is deciding not to serve other
customers or needs and not to offer certain
features or services. Thus strategy requires
constant discipline and clear communication.
Indeed, one of the most important functions
of an explicit, communicated strategy is to
guide employees in making choices that arise
because of trade-offs in their individual activities and in day-to-day decisions.
Improving operational effectiveness is a necessary part of management, but it is not strategy.
In confusing the two, managers have unintentionally backed into a way of thinking about
competition that is driving many industries toward competitive convergence, which is in no
one’s best interest and is not inevitable.
Managers must clearly distinguish operational effectiveness from strategy. Both are essential, but the two agendas are different.
The operational agenda involves continual
improvement everywhere there are no tradeoffs. Failure to do this creates vulnerability
even for companies with a good strategy. The
operational agenda is the proper place for constant change, ﬂexibility, and relentless efforts
to achieve best practice. In contrast, the strategic agenda is the right place for deﬁning a
unique position, making clear trade-offs, and
tightening ﬁt. It involves the continual search
for ways to reinforce and extend the company’s position. The strategic agenda demands
discipline and continuity; its enemies are
distraction and compromise.
Strategic continuity does not imply a static
view of competition. A company must continually improve its operational effectiveness and
actively try to shift the productivity frontier; at
the same time, there needs to be ongoing effort to extend its uniqueness while strengthening the ﬁt among its activities. Strategic continuity, in fact, should make an organization’s
continual improvement more effective.
A company may have to change its strategy
if there are major structural changes in its industry. In fact, new strategic positions often
arise because of industry changes, and new
entrants unencumbered by history often can
exploit them more easily. However, a company’s choice of a new position must be
driven by the ability to ﬁnd new trade-offs
and leverage a new system of complemen-

This article focuses on operational effectiveness and the conditions that create it. In theory, location should no longer be a source of
competitive advantage. Open global markets,
rapid transportation, and high-speed communications should allow any company to
source any thing from any place at any time.
In practice, location remains central to competition. This is true because companies in a
particular field, along with suppliers and other
related businesses, cluster in geographic concentrations where virtually all the important
information and technology in the field is
readily available.

In this McKinsey Award–winning article, Porter
discusses factors that determine the nature of
competition. Among them: rivals, the economics of particular industries, new entrants,
the bargaining power of customers and suppliers, and the threat of substitute services or
products. A strategic plan of action based on
such factors might include: positioning the
company so that its capabilities provide the
best defense against competitive forces, influencing the balance of forces through strategic
moves, and anticipating shifts in the factors
underlying the competitive forces. Strategic
positioning requires looking both within the
company and at external factors when making these decisions; in some cases, it means
choosing what not to do.

Despite some startling success stories,
diversification—whether through acquisition, joint venture, or start-up—has not typically brought the competitive advantages
or the profitability sought by executives.
Successful diversification strategies rely on
transferring skills and sharing activities to
capture the benefits of existing relationships among business units. Therefore, corporate leaders must examine closely any
acquisition candidate’s “fit” with the parent
company’s existing businesses.

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

You know that to sustain long-term profitability you must respond strategically to
competition. And you naturally keep tabs
on your established rivals. But as you scan
the competitive arena, are you also looking
beyond your direct competitors? As Porter
explains in this update of his revolutionary
1979 HBR article, four additional competitive forces can hurt your prospective profits:

By understanding how the five competitive forces influence profitability in your industry, you can
develop a strategy for enhancing your company’s long-term profits. Porter suggests the following:

• Savvy customers can force down prices
by playing you and your rivals against
one another.
• Powerful suppliers may constrain your
profits if they charge higher prices.
• Aspiring entrants, armed with new capacity and hungry for market share, can
ratchet up the investment required for
you to stay in the game.

• Substitute offerings can lure customers
away.
Consider commercial aviation: It’s one of
the least profitable industries because all
five forces are strong. Established rivals
compete intensely on price. Customers are
fickle, searching for the best deal regardless
of carrier. Suppliers—plane and engine
manufacturers, along with unionized labor
forces—bargain away the lion’s share of airlines’ profits. New players enter the industry in a constant stream. And substitutes
are readily available—such as train or car
travel.
By analyzing all five competitive forces, you
gain a complete picture of what’s influencing profitability in your industry. You identify game-changing trends early, so you can
swiftly exploit them. And you spot ways to
work around constraints on profitability—
or even reshape the forces in your favor.

POSITION YOUR COMPANY W HERE THE
FORCES ARE WEAKEST
Example:
In the heavy-truck industry, many buyers
operate large fleets and are highly motivated to drive down truck prices. Trucks are
built to regulated standards and offer similar features, so price competition is stiff;
unions exercise considerable supplier
power; and buyers can use substitutes such
as cargo delivery by rail.
To create and sustain long-term profitability
within this industry, heavy-truck maker Paccar chose to focus on one customer group
where competitive forces are weakest: individual drivers who own their trucks and
contract directly with suppliers. These operators have limited clout as buyers and are
less price sensitive because of their emotional ties to and economic dependence
on their own trucks.
For these customers, Paccar has developed
such features as luxurious sleeper cabins,
plush leather seats, and sleek exterior styling. Buyers can select from thousands of
options to put their personal signature on
these built-to-order trucks.
Customers pay Paccar a 10% premium, and
the company has been profitable for 68
straight years and earned a long-run return
on equity above 20%.

EXPLOIT CHANGES IN THE FORCES
Example:
With the advent of the Internet and digital
distribution of music, unauthorized downloading created an illegal but potent substitute for record companies’ services. The
record companies tried to develop technical
platforms for digital distribution themselves,
but major labels didn’t want to sell their
music through a platform owned by a rival.
Into this vacuum stepped Apple, with its
iTunes music store supporting its iPod music
player. The birth of this powerful new gatekeeper has whittled down the number of
major labels from six in 1997 to four today.
RESHAPE THE FORCES IN YOUR FAVOR
Use tactics designed specifically to reduce
the share of profits leaking to other players.
For example:
• To neutralize supplier power, standardize
specifications for parts so your company
can switch more easily among vendors.
• To counter customer power, expand your
services so it’s harder for customers to leave
you for a rival.
• To temper price wars initiated by established rivals, invest more heavily in products that differ significantly from competitors’ offerings.
• To scare off new entrants, elevate the fixed
costs of competing; for instance, by escalating your R&D expenditures.
• To limit the threat of substitutes, offer better value through wider product accessibility. Soft-drink producers did this by introducing vending machines and
convenience store channels, which dramatically improved the availability of soft drinks
relative to other beverages.

Forces That Shape
Strategy
by Michael E. Porter

Editor’s Note: In 1979, Harvard Business Review
published “How Competitive Forces Shape Strategy” by a young economist and associate professor, Michael E. Porter. It was his ﬁrst HBR article,
and it started a revolution in the strategy ﬁeld. In
subsequent decades, Porter has brought his signature economic rigor to the study of competitive strategy for corporations, regions, nations,
and, more recently, health care and philanthropy.
“Porter’s ﬁve forces” have shaped a generation of
academic research and business practice. With
prodding and assistance from Harvard Business
School Professor Jan Rivkin and longtime colleague Joan Magretta, Porter here reafﬁrms, updates, and extends the classic work. He also addresses common misunderstandings, provides
practical guidance for users of the framework,
and offers a deeper view of its implications for
strategy today.
In essence, the job of the strategist is to understand and cope with competition. Often, however, managers deﬁne competition too narrowly, as if it occurred only among today’s

harvard business review • january 2008

direct competitors. Yet competition for proﬁts
goes beyond established industry rivals to include four other competitive forces as well:
customers, suppliers, potential entrants, and
substitute products. The extended rivalry that
results from all ﬁve forces deﬁnes an industry’s
structure and shapes the nature of competitive interaction within an industry.
As different from one another as industries
might appear on the surface, the underlying
drivers of proﬁtability are the same. The global auto industry, for instance, appears to
have nothing in common with the worldwide
market for art masterpieces or the heavily
regulated health-care delivery industry in Europe. But to understand industry competition
and proﬁtability in each of those three cases,
one must analyze the industry’s underlying
structure in terms of the ﬁve forces. (See the
exhibit “The Five Forces That Shape Industry
Competition.”)
If the forces are intense, as they are in such
industries as airlines, textiles, and hotels, almost no company earns attractive returns on

page 25

<-----Page 25----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

investment. If the forces are benign, as they are
in industries such as software, soft drinks, and
toiletries, many companies are proﬁtable. Industry structure drives competition and proﬁtability, not whether an industry produces a
product or service, is emerging or mature, high
tech or low tech, regulated or unregulated.
While a myriad of factors can affect industry
proﬁtability in the short run—including the
weather and the business cycle—industry
structure, manifested in the competitive forces,
sets industry proﬁtability in the medium and
long run. (See the exhibit “Differences in Industry Proﬁtability.”)
Understanding the competitive forces, and
their underlying causes, reveals the roots of an
industry’s current proﬁtability while providing
a framework for anticipating and inﬂuencing
competition (and proﬁtability) over time. A
healthy industry structure should be as much a
competitive concern to strategists as their company’s own position. Understanding industry
structure is also essential to effective strategic
positioning. As we will see, defending against
the competitive forces and shaping them in a
company’s favor are crucial to strategy.

Forces That Shape Competition

Michael E. Porter is the Bishop William Lawrence University Professor at
Harvard University, based at Harvard
Business School in Boston. He is a sixtime McKinsey Award winner, including for his most recent HBR article,
“Strategy and Society,” coauthored
with Mark R. Kramer (December 2006).

harvard business review • january 2008

The conﬁguration of the ﬁve forces differs by
industry. In the market for commercial aircraft, ﬁerce rivalry between dominant producers Airbus and Boeing and the bargaining
power of the airlines that place huge orders
for aircraft are strong, while the threat of entry, the threat of substitutes, and the power of
suppliers are more benign. In the movie theater industry, the proliferation of substitute
forms of entertainment and the power of the
movie producers and distributors who supply
movies, the critical input, are important.
The strongest competitive force or forces determine the proﬁtability of an industry and become the most important to strategy formulation. The most salient force, however, is not
always obvious.
For example, even though rivalry is often
ﬁerce in commodity industries, it may not be
the factor limiting proﬁtability. Low returns in
the photographic ﬁlm industry, for instance,
are the result of a superior substitute product—as Kodak and Fuji, the world’s leading
producers of photographic ﬁlm, learned with
the advent of digital photography. In such a situation, coping with the substitute product be-

comes the number one strategic priority.
Industry structure grows out of a set of economic and technical characteristics that determine the strength of each competitive force.
We will examine these drivers in the pages that
follow, taking the perspective of an incumbent,
or a company already present in the industry.
The analysis can be readily extended to understand the challenges facing a potential entrant.
Threat of entry. New entrants to an industry bring new capacity and a desire to gain
market share that puts pressure on prices,
costs, and the rate of investment necessary to
compete. Particularly when new entrants are
diversifying from other markets, they can leverage existing capabilities and cash ﬂows to
shake up competition, as Pepsi did when it entered the bottled water industry, Microsoft did
when it began to offer internet browsers, and
Apple did when it entered the music distribution business.
The threat of entry, therefore, puts a cap on
the proﬁt potential of an industry. When the
threat is high, incumbents must hold down
their prices or boost investment to deter new
competitors. In specialty coffee retailing, for
example, relatively low entry barriers mean
that Starbucks must invest aggressively in
modernizing stores and menus.
The threat of entry in an industry depends
on the height of entry barriers that are present
and on the reaction entrants can expect from
incumbents. If entry barriers are low and newcomers expect little retaliation from the entrenched competitors, the threat of entry is
high and industry proﬁtability is moderated. It
is the threat of entry, not whether entry actually occurs, that holds down proﬁtability.
Barriers to entry. Entry barriers are advantages that incumbents have relative to new entrants. There are seven major sources:
1. Supply-side economies of scale. These economies arise when ﬁrms that produce at larger
volumes enjoy lower costs per unit because
they can spread ﬁxed costs over more units,
employ more efﬁcient technology, or command better terms from suppliers. Supplyside scale economies deter entry by forcing
the aspiring entrant either to come into the
industry on a large scale, which requires dislodging entrenched competitors, or to accept
a cost disadvantage.
Scale economies can be found in virtually
every activity in the value chain; which ones

page 26

<-----Page 26----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

are most important varies by industry.1 In microprocessors, incumbents such as Intel are
protected by scale economies in research, chip
fabrication, and consumer marketing. For lawn
care companies like Scotts Miracle-Gro, the
most important scale economies are found in
the supply chain and media advertising. In
small-package delivery, economies of scale
arise in national logistical systems and information technology.
2. Demand-side beneﬁts of scale. These beneﬁts, also known as network effects, arise in industries where a buyer’s willingness to pay for
a company’s product increases with the number of other buyers who also patronize the
company. Buyers may trust larger companies
more for a crucial product: Recall the old
adage that no one ever got ﬁred for buying
from IBM (when it was the dominant computer maker). Buyers may also value being in a
“network” with a larger number of fellow customers. For instance, online auction participants are attracted to eBay because it offers
the most potential trading partners. Demandside beneﬁts of scale discourage entry by limiting the willingness of customers to buy from a
newcomer and by reducing the price the newcomer can command until it builds up a large
base of customers.
3. Customer switching costs. Switching costs
are ﬁxed costs that buyers face when they

change suppliers. Such costs may arise because
a buyer who switches vendors must, for example, alter product speciﬁcations, retrain employees to use a new product, or modify processes or information systems. The larger the
switching costs, the harder it will be for an entrant to gain customers. Enterprise resource
planning (ERP) software is an example of a
product with very high switching costs. Once a
company has installed SAP’s ERP system, for
example, the costs of moving to a new vendor
are astronomical because of embedded data,
the fact that internal processes have been
adapted to SAP, major retraining needs, and
the mission-critical nature of the applications.
4. Capital requirements. The need to invest
large ﬁnancial resources in order to compete
can deter new entrants. Capital may be necessary not only for ﬁxed facilities but also to extend customer credit, build inventories, and
fund start-up losses. The barrier is particularly
great if the capital is required for unrecoverable and therefore harder-to-ﬁnance expenditures, such as up-front advertising or research
and development. While major corporations
have the ﬁnancial resources to invade almost
any industry, the huge capital requirements in
certain ﬁelds limit the pool of likely entrants.
Conversely, in such ﬁelds as tax preparation
services or short-haul trucking, capital requirements are minimal and potential entrants
plentiful.
It is important not to overstate the degree to
which capital requirements alone deter entry.
If industry returns are attractive and are expected to remain so, and if capital markets are
efﬁcient, investors will provide entrants with
the funds they need. For aspiring air carriers,
for instance, ﬁnancing is available to purchase
expensive aircraft because of their high resale
value, one reason why there have been numerous new airlines in almost every region.
5. Incumbency advantages independent of
size. No matter what their size, incumbents
may have cost or quality advantages not available to potential rivals. These advantages can
stem from such sources as proprietary technology, preferential access to the best raw material sources, preemption of the most favorable
geographic locations, established brand identities, or cumulative experience that has allowed
incumbents to learn how to produce more efﬁciently. Entrants try to bypass such advantages.
Upstart discounters such as Target and Wal-

page 27

<-----Page 27----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

Mart, for example, have located stores in freestanding sites rather than regional shopping
centers where established department stores
were well entrenched.
6. Unequal access to distribution channels.
The new entrant must, of course, secure distribution of its product or service. A new food
item, for example, must displace others from
the supermarket shelf via price breaks, promotions, intense selling efforts, or some other
means. The more limited the wholesale or retail channels are and the more that existing
competitors have tied them up, the tougher
entry into an industry will be. Sometimes access to distribution is so high a barrier that new
entrants must bypass distribution channels altogether or create their own. Thus, upstart
low-cost airlines have avoided distribution
through travel agents (who tend to favor estab-

lished higher-fare carriers) and have encouraged passengers to book their own ﬂights on
the internet.
7. Restrictive government policy. Government
policy can hinder or aid new entry directly, as
well as amplify (or nullify) the other entry barriers. Government directly limits or even forecloses entry into industries through, for instance, licensing requirements and restrictions
on foreign investment. Regulated industries
like liquor retailing, taxi services, and airlines
are visible examples. Government policy can
heighten other entry barriers through such
means as expansive patenting rules that protect proprietary technology from imitation or
environmental or safety regulations that raise
scale economies facing newcomers. Of course,
government policies may also make entry easier—directly through subsidies, for instance, or

Differences in Industry Profitability
The average return on invested capital varies markedly from industry to industry. Between 1992 and 2006, for example, average return on invested capital in U.S. industries ranged as low as zero or even negative to more than 50%. At the high end are industries like soft drinks and prepackaged software, which have been almost six times more proﬁtable than the airline industry over the period.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is the appropriate measure
of profitability for strategy formulation, not to mention for equity
investors. Return on sales or the growth rate of profits fail to
account for the capital required to compete in the industry. Here,
we utilize earnings before interest and taxes divided by average
invested capital less excess cash as the measure of ROIC. This
measure controls for idiosyncratic differences in capital structure
and tax rates across companies and industries.

indirectly by funding basic research and making it available to all ﬁrms, new and old, reducing scale economies.
Entry barriers should be assessed relative to
the capabilities of potential entrants, which
may be start-ups, foreign ﬁrms, or companies
in related industries. And, as some of our examples illustrate, the strategist must be mindful of the creative ways newcomers might ﬁnd
to circumvent apparent barriers.
Expected retaliation. How potential entrants
believe incumbents may react will also inﬂuence their decision to enter or stay out of an

Industry Analysis in Practice
Good industry analysis looks rigorously at the structural underpinnings
of proﬁtability. A ﬁrst step is to understand the appropriate time horizon.
One of the essential tasks in industry
analysis is to distinguish temporary or
cyclical changes from structural
changes. A good guideline for the appropriate time horizon is the full business
cycle for the particular industry. For
most industries, a three-to-ﬁve-year horizon is appropriate, although in some industries with long lead times, such as
mining, the appropriate horizon might
be a decade or more. It is average proﬁtability over this period, not proﬁtability
in any particular year, that should be the
focus of analysis.
The point of industry analysis is not
to declare the industry attractive or unattractive but to understand the underpinnings of competition and the root
causes of proﬁtability. As much as possible, analysts should look at industry
structure quantitatively, rather than be
satisﬁed with lists of qualitative factors.
Many elements of the ﬁve forces can be
quantiﬁed: the percentage of the buyer’s
total cost accounted for by the industry’s
product (to understand buyer price sensitivity); the percentage of industry sales
required to ﬁll a plant or operate a logistical network of efﬁcient scale (to help assess barriers to entry); the buyer’s switching cost (determining the inducement an
entrant or rival must offer customers).

harvard business review • january 2008

The strength of the competitive
forces affects prices, costs, and the investment required to compete; thus
the forces are directly tied to the income statements and balance sheets of
industry participants. Industry structure deﬁnes the gap between revenues
and costs. For example, intense rivalry
drives down prices or elevates the costs of
marketing, R&D, or customer service, reducing margins. How much? Strong suppliers drive up input costs. How much?
Buyer power lowers prices or elevates the
costs of meeting buyers’ demands, such
as the requirement to hold more inventory or provide ﬁnancing. How much?
Low barriers to entry or close substitutes
limit the level of sustainable prices. How
much? It is these economic relationships
that sharpen the strategist’s understanding of industry competition.
Finally, good industry analysis does
not just list pluses and minuses but
sees an industry in overall, systemic
terms. Which forces are underpinning
(or constraining) today’s proﬁtability?
How might shifts in one competitive
force trigger reactions in others? Answering such questions is often the source of
true strategic insights.

industry. If reaction is vigorous and protracted
enough, the proﬁt potential of participating in
the industry can fall below the cost of capital.
Incumbents often use public statements and
responses to one entrant to send a message to
other prospective entrants about their commitment to defending market share.
Newcomers are likely to fear expected retaliation if:
• Incumbents have previously responded
vigorously to new entrants.
• Incumbents possess substantial resources
to ﬁght back, including excess cash and unused
borrowing power, available productive capacity, or clout with distribution channels and customers.
• Incumbents seem likely to cut prices because they are committed to retaining market
share at all costs or because the industry has
high ﬁxed costs, which create a strong motivation to drop prices to ﬁll excess capacity.
• Industry growth is slow so newcomers can
gain volume only by taking it from incumbents.
An analysis of barriers to entry and expected
retaliation is obviously crucial for any company contemplating entry into a new industry.
The challenge is to ﬁnd ways to surmount the
entry barriers without nullifying, through
heavy investment, the proﬁtability of participating in the industry.
The power of suppliers. Powerful suppliers
capture more of the value for themselves by
charging higher prices, limiting quality or services, or shifting costs to industry participants.
Powerful suppliers, including suppliers of labor, can squeeze proﬁtability out of an industry that is unable to pass on cost increases in
its own prices. Microsoft, for instance, has contributed to the erosion of proﬁtability among
personal computer makers by raising prices on
operating systems. PC makers, competing
ﬁercely for customers who can easily switch
among them, have limited freedom to raise
their prices accordingly.
Companies depend on a wide range of different supplier groups for inputs. A supplier
group is powerful if:
• It is more concentrated than the industry it
sells to. Microsoft’s near monopoly in operating
systems, coupled with the fragmentation of PC
assemblers, exempliﬁes this situation.
• The supplier group does not depend
heavily on the industry for its revenues. Suppliers serving many industries will not hesitate to

page 29

Industry structure drives
competition and
profitability, not whether
an industry is emerging
or mature, high tech or
low tech, regulated or
unregulated.

harvard business review • january 2008

extract maximum proﬁts from each one. If a
particular industry accounts for a large portion
of a supplier group’s volume or proﬁt, however,
suppliers will want to protect the industry
through reasonable pricing and assist in activities such as R&D and lobbying.
• Industry participants face switching costs
in changing suppliers. For example, shifting
suppliers is difﬁcult if companies have invested
heavily in specialized ancillary equipment or in
learning how to operate a supplier’s equipment
(as with Bloomberg terminals used by ﬁnancial
professionals). Or ﬁrms may have located their
production lines adjacent to a supplier’s manufacturing facilities (as in the case of some beverage companies and container manufacturers).
When switching costs are high, industry participants ﬁnd it hard to play suppliers off against
one another. (Note that suppliers may have
switching costs as well. This limits their power.)
• Suppliers offer products that are differentiated. Pharmaceutical companies that offer
patented drugs with distinctive medical beneﬁts have more power over hospitals, health
maintenance organizations, and other drug
buyers, for example, than drug companies offering me-too or generic products.
• There is no substitute for what the supplier group provides. Pilots’ unions, for example, exercise considerable supplier power over
airlines partly because there is no good alternative to a well-trained pilot in the cockpit.
• The supplier group can credibly threaten
to integrate forward into the industry. In that
case, if industry participants make too much
money relative to suppliers, they will induce
suppliers to enter the market.
The power of buyers. Powerful customers—
the ﬂip side of powerful suppliers—can capture more value by forcing down prices, demanding better quality or more service (thereby
driving up costs), and generally playing industry
participants off against one another, all at the expense of industry proﬁtability. Buyers are powerful if they have negotiating leverage relative to
industry participants, especially if they are price
sensitive, using their clout primarily to pressure
price reductions.
As with suppliers, there may be distinct
groups of customers who differ in bargaining
power. A customer group has negotiating leverage if:
• There are few buyers, or each one purchases in volumes that are large relative to the

size of a single vendor. Large-volume buyers are
particularly powerful in industries with high
ﬁxed costs, such as telecommunications equipment, offshore drilling, and bulk chemicals.
High ﬁxed costs and low marginal costs amplify
the pressure on rivals to keep capacity ﬁlled
through discounting.
• The industry’s products are standardized
or undifferentiated. If buyers believe they can
always ﬁnd an equivalent product, they tend to
play one vendor against another.
• Buyers face few switching costs in changing vendors.
• Buyers can credibly threaten to integrate
backward and produce the industry’s product
themselves if vendors are too proﬁtable. Producers of soft drinks and beer have long controlled the power of packaging manufacturers
by threatening to make, and at times actually
making, packaging materials themselves.
A buyer group is price sensitive if:
• The product it purchases from the industry represents a signiﬁcant fraction of its cost
structure or procurement budget. Here buyers
are likely to shop around and bargain hard, as
consumers do for home mortgages. Where the
product sold by an industry is a small fraction
of buyers’ costs or expenditures, buyers are usually less price sensitive.
• The buyer group earns low proﬁts, is
strapped for cash, or is otherwise under pressure to trim its purchasing costs. Highly proﬁtable or cash-rich customers, in contrast, are
generally less price sensitive (that is, of course,
if the item does not represent a large fraction of
their costs).
• The quality of buyers’ products or services
is little affected by the industry’s product.
Where quality is very much affected by the industry’s product, buyers are generally less price
sensitive. When purchasing or renting production quality cameras, for instance, makers of
major motion pictures opt for highly reliable
equipment with the latest features. They pay
limited attention to price.
• The industry’s product has little effect on
the buyer’s other costs. Here, buyers focus on
price. Conversely, where an industry’s product
or service can pay for itself many times over by
improving performance or reducing labor, material, or other costs, buyers are usually more
interested in quality than in price. Examples include products and services like tax accounting
or well logging (which measures below-ground

page 30

<-----Page 30----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

conditions of oil wells) that can save or even
make the buyer money. Similarly, buyers tend
not to be price sensitive in services such as investment banking, where poor performance
can be costly and embarrassing.
Most sources of buyer power apply equally
to consumers and to business-to-business customers. Like industrial customers, consumers
tend to be more price sensitive if they are purchasing products that are undifferentiated, expensive relative to their incomes, and of a sort
where product performance has limited consequences. The major difference with consumers is that their needs can be more intangible
and harder to quantify.
Intermediate customers, or customers who
purchase the product but are not the end user
(such as assemblers or distribution channels),
can be analyzed the same way as other buyers,
with one important addition. Intermediate
customers gain signiﬁcant bargaining power
when they can inﬂuence the purchasing decisions of customers downstream. Consumer
electronics retailers, jewelry retailers, and agricultural-equipment distributors are examples
of distribution channels that exert a strong inﬂuence on end customers.
Producers often attempt to diminish channel clout through exclusive arrangements with
particular distributors or retailers or by marketing directly to end users. Component manufacturers seek to develop power over assemblers by creating preferences for their
components with downstream customers.
Such is the case with bicycle parts and with
sweeteners. DuPont has created enormous
clout by advertising its Stainmaster brand of
carpet ﬁbers not only to the carpet manufacturers that actually buy them but also to downstream consumers. Many consumers request
Stainmaster carpet even though DuPont is not
a carpet manufacturer.
The threat of substitutes. A substitute performs the same or a similar function as an industry’s product by a different means. Videoconferencing is a substitute for travel. Plastic is
a substitute for aluminum. E-mail is a substitute for express mail. Sometimes, the threat of
substitution is downstream or indirect, when a
substitute replaces a buyer industry’s product.
For example, lawn-care products and services
are threatened when multifamily homes in
urban areas substitute for single-family homes
in the suburbs. Software sold to agents is

harvard business review • january 2008

threatened when airline and travel websites
substitute for travel agents.
Substitutes are always present, but they are
easy to overlook because they may appear to
be very different from the industry’s product:
To someone searching for a Father’s Day gift,
neckties and power tools may be substitutes. It
is a substitute to do without, to purchase a
used product rather than a new one, or to do it
yourself (bring the service or product inhouse).
When the threat of substitutes is high, industry proﬁtability suffers. Substitute products or
services limit an industry’s proﬁt potential by
placing a ceiling on prices. If an industry does
not distance itself from substitutes through
product performance, marketing, or other
means, it will suffer in terms of proﬁtability—
and often growth potential.
Substitutes not only limit proﬁts in normal
times, they also reduce the bonanza an industry can reap in good times. In emerging economies, for example, the surge in demand for
wired telephone lines has been capped as
many consumers opt to make a mobile telephone their ﬁrst and only phone line.
The threat of a substitute is high if:
• It offers an attractive price-performance
trade-off to the industry’s product. The better
the relative value of the substitute, the tighter
is the lid on an industry’s proﬁt potential. For
example, conventional providers of long-distance telephone service have suffered from the
advent of inexpensive internet-based phone
services such as Vonage and Skype. Similarly,
video rental outlets are struggling with the
emergence of cable and satellite video-on-demand services, online video rental services such
as Netﬂix, and the rise of internet video sites
like Google’s YouTube.
• The buyer’s cost of switching to the substitute is low. Switching from a proprietary,
branded drug to a generic drug usually involves
minimal costs, for example, which is why the
shift to generics (and the fall in prices) is so substantial and rapid.
Strategists should be particularly alert to
changes in other industries that may make
them attractive substitutes when they were not
before. Improvements in plastic materials, for
example, allowed them to substitute for steel
in many automobile components. In this way,
technological changes or competitive discontinuities in seemingly unrelated businesses can

have major impacts on industry proﬁtability.
Of course the substitution threat can also shift
in favor of an industry, which bodes well for its
future proﬁtability and growth potential.
Rivalry among existing competitors. Rivalry
among existing competitors takes many familiar forms, including price discounting, new
product introductions, advertising campaigns,
and service improvements. High rivalry limits
the proﬁtability of an industry. The degree to
which rivalry drives down an industry’s proﬁt
potential depends, ﬁrst, on the intensity with
which companies compete and, second, on the
basis on which they compete.
The intensity of rivalry is greatest if:
• Competitors are numerous or are roughly
equal in size and power. In such situations, rivals ﬁnd it hard to avoid poaching business.
Without an industry leader, practices desirable
for the industry as a whole go unenforced.
• Industry growth is slow. Slow growth precipitates ﬁghts for market share.
• Exit barriers are high. Exit barriers, the ﬂip
side of entry barriers, arise because of such
things as highly specialized assets or management’s devotion to a particular business. These
barriers keep companies in the market even
though they may be earning low or negative returns. Excess capacity remains in use, and the
proﬁtability of healthy competitors suffers as
the sick ones hang on.
• Rivals are highly committed to the business and have aspirations for leadership, especially if they have goals that go beyond economic performance in the particular industry.
High commitment to a business arises for a variety of reasons. For example, state-owned competitors may have goals that include employment or prestige. Units of larger companies
may participate in an industry for image reasons or to offer a full line. Clashes of personality
and ego have sometimes exaggerated rivalry to
the detriment of proﬁtability in ﬁelds such as
the media and high technology.
• Firms cannot read each other’s signals well
because of lack of familiarity with one another,
diverse approaches to competing, or differing
goals.
The strength of rivalry reﬂects not just the
intensity of competition but also the basis of
competition. The dimensions on which competition takes place, and whether rivals converge
to compete on the same dimensions, have a
major inﬂuence on proﬁtability.

Rivalry is especially destructive to proﬁtability if it gravitates solely to price because price
competition transfers proﬁts directly from an
industry to its customers. Price cuts are usually
easy for competitors to see and match, making
successive rounds of retaliation likely. Sustained price competition also trains customers
to pay less attention to product features and
service.
Price competition is most liable to occur if:
• Products or services of rivals are nearly
identical and there are few switching costs for
buyers. This encourages competitors to cut
prices to win new customers. Years of airline
price wars reﬂect these circumstances in that
industry.
• Fixed costs are high and marginal costs are
low. This creates intense pressure for competitors to cut prices below their average costs,
even close to their marginal costs, to steal incremental customers while still making some contribution to covering ﬁxed costs. Many basicmaterials businesses, such as paper and aluminum, suffer from this problem, especially if demand is not growing. So do delivery companies
with ﬁxed networks of routes that must be
served regardless of volume.
• Capacity must be expanded in large increments to be efﬁcient. The need for large capacity expansions, as in the polyvinyl chloride business, disrupts the industry’s supply-demand
balance and often leads to long and recurring
periods of overcapacity and price cutting.
• The product is perishable. Perishability
creates a strong temptation to cut prices and
sell a product while it still has value. More products and services are perishable than is commonly thought. Just as tomatoes are perishable
because they rot, models of computers are perishable because they soon become obsolete,
and information may be perishable if it diffuses
rapidly or becomes outdated, thereby losing its
value. Services such as hotel accommodations
are perishable in the sense that unused capacity
can never be recovered.
Competition on dimensions other than
price—on product features, support services,
delivery time, or brand image, for instance—is
less likely to erode proﬁtability because it improves customer value and can support higher
prices. Also, rivalry focused on such dimensions can improve value relative to substitutes
or raise the barriers facing new entrants. While
nonprice rivalry sometimes escalates to levels

page 32

<-----Page 32----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

that undermine industry proﬁtability, this is
less likely to occur than it is with price rivalry.
As important as the dimensions of rivalry is
whether rivals compete on the same dimensions. When all or many competitors aim to
meet the same needs or compete on the same
attributes, the result is zero-sum competition.
Here, one ﬁrm’s gain is often another’s loss,
driving down proﬁtability. While price competition runs a stronger risk than nonprice competition of becoming zero sum, this may not
happen if companies take care to segment
their markets, targeting their low-price offerings to different customers.
Rivalry can be positive sum, or actually increase the average proﬁtability of an industry,
when each competitor aims to serve the needs
of different customer segments, with different
mixes of price, products, services, features, or
brand identities. Such competition can not
only support higher average proﬁtability but
also expand the industry, as the needs of more
customer groups are better met. The opportunity for positive-sum competition will be
greater in industries serving diverse customer
groups. With a clear understanding of the
structural underpinnings of rivalry, strategists
can sometimes take steps to shift the nature of
competition in a more positive direction.

Factors, Not Forces
Industry structure, as manifested in the
strength of the ﬁve competitive forces, determines the industry’s long-run proﬁt potential
because it determines how the economic
value created by the industry is divided—how
much is retained by companies in the industry
versus bargained away by customers and suppliers, limited by substitutes, or constrained by
potential new entrants. By considering all ﬁve
forces, a strategist keeps overall structure in
mind instead of gravitating to any one element. In addition, the strategist’s attention remains focused on structural conditions rather
than on ﬂeeting factors.
It is especially important to avoid the common pitfall of mistaking certain visible attributes of an industry for its underlying structure. Consider the following:
Industry growth rate. A common mistake is
to assume that fast-growing industries are always attractive. Growth does tend to mute rivalry, because an expanding pie offers opportunities for all competitors. But fast growth

harvard business review • january 2008

can put suppliers in a powerful position, and
high growth with low entry barriers will draw
in entrants. Even without new entrants, a high
growth rate will not guarantee proﬁtability if
customers are powerful or substitutes are attractive. Indeed, some fast-growth businesses,
such as personal computers, have been among
the least proﬁtable industries in recent years.
A narrow focus on growth is one of the major
causes of bad strategy decisions.
Technology and innovation. Advanced technology or innovations are not by themselves
enough to make an industry structurally attractive (or unattractive). Mundane, low-technology industries with price-insensitive buyers, high switching costs, or high entry barriers
arising from scale economies are often far
more proﬁtable than sexy industries, such as
software and internet technologies, that attract competitors.2
Government. Government is not best understood as a sixth force because government
involvement is neither inherently good nor
bad for industry proﬁtability. The best way to
understand the inﬂuence of government on
competition is to analyze how speciﬁc government policies affect the ﬁve competitive
forces. For instance, patents raise barriers to
entry, boosting industry proﬁt potential. Conversely, government policies favoring unions
may raise supplier power and diminish proﬁt
potential. Bankruptcy rules that allow failing
companies to reorganize rather than exit can
lead to excess capacity and intense rivalry.
Government operates at multiple levels and
through many different policies, each of
which will affect structure in different ways.
Complementary products and services.
Complements are products or services used together with an industry’s product. Complements arise when the customer beneﬁt of two
products combined is greater than the sum of
each product’s value in isolation. Computer
hardware and software, for instance, are valuable together and worthless when separated.
In recent years, strategy researchers have
highlighted the role of complements, especially in high-technology industries where they
are most obvious.3 By no means, however, do
complements appear only there. The value of a
car, for example, is greater when the driver also
has access to gasoline stations, roadside assistance, and auto insurance.
Complements can be important when they

page 33

<-----Page 33----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

affect the overall demand for an industry’s
product. However, like government policy,
complements are not a sixth force determining
industry proﬁtability since the presence of
strong complements is not necessarily bad (or
good) for industry proﬁtability. Complements
affect proﬁtability through the way they inﬂuence the ﬁve forces.
The strategist must trace the positive or negative inﬂuence of complements on all ﬁve
forces to ascertain their impact on proﬁtability.
The presence of complements can raise or
lower barriers to entry. In application software,
for example, barriers to entry were lowered
when producers of complementary operating
system software, notably Microsoft, provided
tool sets making it easier to write applications.
Conversely, the need to attract producers of
complements can raise barriers to entry, as it
does in video game hardware.
The presence of complements can also affect
the threat of substitutes. For instance, the need
for appropriate fueling stations makes it difﬁcult for cars using alternative fuels to substitute for conventional vehicles. But complements can also make substitution easier. For
example, Apple’s iTunes hastened the substitution from CDs to digital music.
Complements can factor into industry rivalry either positively (as when they raise
switching costs) or negatively (as when they
neutralize product differentiation). Similar
analyses can be done for buyer and supplier
power. Sometimes companies compete by altering conditions in complementary industries
in their favor, such as when videocassette-recorder producer JVC persuaded movie studios
to favor its standard in issuing prerecorded
tapes even though rival Sony’s standard was
probably superior from a technical standpoint.
Identifying complements is part of the analyst’s work. As with government policies or important technologies, the strategic signiﬁcance
of complements will be best understood
through the lens of the ﬁve forces.

Changes in Industry Structure
So far, we have discussed the competitive
forces at a single point in time. Industry structure proves to be relatively stable, and industry proﬁtability differences are remarkably
persistent over time in practice. However, industry structure is constantly undergoing
modest adjustment—and occasionally it can

harvard business review • january 2008

change abruptly.
Shifts in structure may emanate from outside an industry or from within. They can
boost the industry’s proﬁt potential or reduce
it. They may be caused by changes in technology, changes in customer needs, or other
events. The ﬁve competitive forces provide a
framework for identifying the most important
industry developments and for anticipating
their impact on industry attractiveness.
Shifting threat of new entry. Changes to any
of the seven barriers described above can raise
or lower the threat of new entry. The expiration of a patent, for instance, may unleash new
entrants. On the day that Merck’s patents for
the cholesterol reducer Zocor expired, three
pharmaceutical makers entered the market
for the drug. Conversely, the proliferation of
products in the ice cream industry has gradually ﬁlled up the limited freezer space in grocery stores, making it harder for new ice cream
makers to gain access to distribution in North
America and Europe.
Strategic decisions of leading competitors
often have a major impact on the threat of entry. Starting in the 1970s, for example, retailers
such as Wal-Mart, Kmart, and Toys “R” Us
began to adopt new procurement, distribution,
and inventory control technologies with large
ﬁxed costs, including automated distribution
centers, bar coding, and point-of-sale terminals. These investments increased the economies of scale and made it more difﬁcult for
small retailers to enter the business (and for existing small players to survive).
Changing supplier or buyer power. As the
factors underlying the power of suppliers and
buyers change with time, their clout rises or
declines. In the global appliance industry, for
instance, competitors including Electrolux,
General Electric, and Whirlpool have been
squeezed by the consolidation of retail channels (the decline of appliance specialty stores,
for instance, and the rise of big-box retailers
like Best Buy and Home Depot in the United
States). Another example is travel agents, who
depend on airlines as a key supplier. When the
internet allowed airlines to sell tickets directly
to customers, this signiﬁcantly increased their
power to bargain down agents’ commissions.
Shifting threat of substitution. The most common reason substitutes become more or less
threatening over time is that advances in technology create new substitutes or shift price-

page 34

<-----Page 34----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

Eliminating rivals is a
risky strategy. A profit
windfall from removing
today’s competitors often
attracts new competitors
and backlash from
customers and suppliers.

harvard business review • january 2008

performance comparisons in one direction or
the other. The earliest microwave ovens, for
example, were large and priced above $2,000,
making them poor substitutes for conventional ovens. With technological advances,
they became serious substitutes. Flash computer memory has improved enough recently
to become a meaningful substitute for low-capacity hard-disk drives. Trends in the availability or performance of complementary producers also shift the threat of substitutes.
New bases of rivalry. Rivalry often intensiﬁes naturally over time. As an industry matures, growth slows. Competitors become
more alike as industry conventions emerge,
technology diffuses, and consumer tastes converge. Industry proﬁtability falls, and weaker
competitors are driven from the business. This
story has played out in industry after industry;
televisions, snowmobiles, and telecommunications equipment are just a few examples.
A trend toward intensifying price competition and other forms of rivalry, however, is by
no means inevitable. For example, there has
been enormous competitive activity in the U.S.
casino industry in recent decades, but most of
it has been positive-sum competition directed
toward new niches and geographic segments
(such as riverboats, trophy properties, Native
American reservations, international expansion, and novel customer groups like families).
Head-to-head rivalry that lowers prices or
boosts the payouts to winners has been limited.
The nature of rivalry in an industry is altered by mergers and acquisitions that introduce new capabilities and ways of competing.
Or, technological innovation can reshape rivalry. In the retail brokerage industry, the advent of the internet lowered marginal costs
and reduced differentiation, triggering far
more intense competition on commissions and
fees than in the past.
In some industries, companies turn to mergers and consolidation not to improve cost and
quality but to attempt to stop intense competition. Eliminating rivals is a risky strategy, however. The ﬁve competitive forces tell us that a
proﬁt windfall from removing today’s competitors often attracts new competitors and backlash from customers and suppliers. In New
York banking, for example, the 1980s and 1990s
saw escalating consolidations of commercial
and savings banks, including Manufacturers

Hanover, Chemical, Chase, and Dime Savings.
But today the retail-banking landscape of Manhattan is as diverse as ever, as new entrants
such as Wachovia, Bank of America, and Washington Mutual have entered the market.

Implications for Strategy
Understanding the forces that shape industry
competition is the starting point for developing strategy. Every company should already
know what the average proﬁtability of its industry is and how that has been changing over
time. The ﬁve forces reveal why industry profitability is what it is. Only then can a company
incorporate industry conditions into strategy.
The forces reveal the most signiﬁcant aspects
of the competitive environment. They also provide a baseline for sizing up a company’s
strengths and weaknesses: Where does the
company stand versus buyers, suppliers, entrants, rivals, and substitutes? Most importantly, an understanding of industry structure
guides managers toward fruitful possibilities
for strategic action, which may include any or
all of the following: positioning the company
to better cope with the current competitive
forces; anticipating and exploiting shifts in the
forces; and shaping the balance of forces to create a new industry structure that is more favorable to the company. The best strategies exploit more than one of these possibilities.
Positioning the company. Strategy can be
viewed as building defenses against the competitive forces or ﬁnding a position in the industry where the forces are weakest. Consider,
for instance, the position of Paccar in the market for heavy trucks. The heavy-truck industry
is structurally challenging. Many buyers operate large ﬂeets or are large leasing companies,
with both the leverage and the motivation to
drive down the price of one of their largest
purchases. Most trucks are built to regulated
standards and offer similar features, so price
competition is rampant. Capital intensity
causes rivalry to be ﬁerce, especially during
the recurring cyclical downturns. Unions exercise considerable supplier power. Though
there are few direct substitutes for an 18wheeler, truck buyers face important substitutes for their services, such as cargo delivery
by rail.
In this setting, Paccar, a Bellevue, Washington–based company with about 20% of the
North American heavy-truck market, has cho-

sen to focus on one group of customers: owneroperators—drivers who own their trucks and
contract directly with shippers or serve as subcontractors to larger trucking companies. Such
small operators have limited clout as truck
buyers. They are also less price sensitive because of their strong emotional ties to and economic dependence on the product. They take
great pride in their trucks, in which they spend
most of their time.
Paccar has invested heavily to develop an
array of features with owner-operators in
mind: luxurious sleeper cabins, plush leather
seats, noise-insulated cabins, sleek exterior styling, and so on. At the company’s extensive network of dealers, prospective buyers use software to select among thousands of options to
put their personal signature on their trucks.
These customized trucks are built to order, not
to stock, and delivered in six to eight weeks.
Paccar’s trucks also have aerodynamic designs
that reduce fuel consumption, and they maintain their resale value better than other trucks.
Paccar’s roadside assistance program and ITsupported system for distributing spare parts
reduce the time a truck is out of service. All
these are crucial considerations for an owneroperator. Customers pay Paccar a 10% premium, and its Kenworth and Peterbilt brands
are considered status symbols at truck stops.
Paccar illustrates the principles of positioning a company within a given industry structure. The ﬁrm has found a portion of its industry where the competitive forces are weaker—
where it can avoid buyer power and pricebased rivalry. And it has tailored every single
part of the value chain to cope well with the
forces in its segment. As a result, Paccar has
been proﬁtable for 68 years straight and has
earned a long-run return on equity above 20%.
In addition to revealing positioning opportunities within an existing industry, the ﬁve
forces framework allows companies to rigorously analyze entry and exit. Both depend on
answering the difﬁcult question: “What is the
potential of this business?” Exit is indicated
when industry structure is poor or declining
and the company has no prospect of a superior
positioning. In considering entry into a new industry, creative strategists can use the framework to spot an industry with a good future
before this good future is reﬂected in the
prices of acquisition candidates. Five forces
analysis may also reveal industries that are not

necessarily attractive for the average entrant
but in which a company has good reason to believe it can surmount entry barriers at lower
cost than most ﬁrms or has a unique ability to
cope with the industry’s competitive forces.
Exploiting industry change. Industry changes
bring the opportunity to spot and claim promising new strategic positions if the strategist
has a sophisticated understanding of the competitive forces and their underpinnings. Consider, for instance, the evolution of the music
industry during the past decade. With the advent of the internet and the digital distribution of music, some analysts predicted the
birth of thousands of music labels (that is,
record companies that develop artists and
bring their music to market). This, the analysts
argued, would break a pattern that had held
since Edison invented the phonograph: Between three and six major record companies
had always dominated the industry. The internet would, they predicted, remove distribution as a barrier to entry, unleashing a ﬂood of
new players into the music industry.
A careful analysis, however, would have revealed that physical distribution was not the
crucial barrier to entry. Rather, entry was
barred by other beneﬁts that large music labels
enjoyed. Large labels could pool the risks of developing new artists over many bets, cushioning the impact of inevitable failures. Even
more important, they had advantages in breaking through the clutter and getting their new
artists heard. To do so, they could promise
radio stations and record stores access to wellknown artists in exchange for promotion of
new artists. New labels would ﬁnd this nearly
impossible to match. The major labels stayed
the course, and new music labels have been
rare.
This is not to say that the music industry is
structurally unchanged by digital distribution.
Unauthorized downloading created an illegal
but potent substitute. The labels tried for years
to develop technical platforms for digital distribution themselves, but major companies hesitated to sell their music through a platform
owned by a rival. Into this vacuum stepped
Apple with its iTunes music store, launched in
2003 to support its iPod music player. By permitting the creation of a powerful new gatekeeper, the major labels allowed industry
structure to shift against them. The number of
major record companies has actually de-

page 36

<-----Page 36----->The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy

clined—from six in 1997 to four today—as
companies struggled to cope with the digital
phenomenon.
When industry structure is in ﬂux, new and
promising competitive positions may appear.
Structural changes open up new needs and
new ways to serve existing needs. Established
leaders may overlook these or be constrained
by past strategies from pursuing them. Smaller
competitors in the industry can capitalize on
such changes, or the void may well be ﬁlled by
new entrants.
Shaping industry structure. When a company exploits structural change, it is recognizing, and reacting to, the inevitable. However,
companies also have the ability to shape industry structure. A ﬁrm can lead its industry
toward new ways of competing that alter the
ﬁve forces for the better. In reshaping struc-

ture, a company wants its competitors to follow so that the entire industry will be transformed. While many industry participants
may beneﬁt in the process, the innovator can
beneﬁt most if it can shift competition in directions where it can excel.
An industry’s structure can be reshaped in
two ways: by redividing proﬁtability in favor of
incumbents or by expanding the overall proﬁt
pool. Redividing the industry pie aims to increase the share of proﬁts to industry competitors instead of to suppliers, buyers, substitutes,
and keeping out potential entrants. Expanding
the proﬁt pool involves increasing the overall
pool of economic value generated by the industry in which rivals, buyers, and suppliers
can all share.
Redividing proﬁtability. To capture more proﬁts for industry rivals, the starting point is to

Defining the Relevant Industry
Deﬁning the industry in which competition
actually takes place is important for good industry analysis, not to mention for developing strategy and setting business unit boundaries. Many strategy errors emanate from
mistaking the relevant industry, deﬁning it
too broadly or too narrowly. Deﬁning the industry too broadly obscures differences
among products, customers, or geographic
regions that are important to competition,
strategic positioning, and proﬁtability. Deﬁning the industry too narrowly overlooks commonalities and linkages across related products or geographic markets that are crucial to
competitive advantage. Also, strategists must
be sensitive to the possibility that industry
boundaries can shift.
The boundaries of an industry consist of
two primary dimensions. First is the scope of
products or services. For example, is motor oil
used in cars part of the same industry as
motor oil used in heavy trucks and stationary
engines, or are these different industries? The
second dimension is geographic scope. Most
industries are present in many parts of the
world. However, is competition contained
within each state, or is it national? Does competition take place within regions such as Europe or North America, or is there a single global industry?
The ﬁve forces are the basic tool to resolve

harvard business review • january 2008

these questions. If industry structure for two
products is the same or very similar (that is, if
they have the same buyers, suppliers, barriers
to entry, and so forth), then the products are
best treated as being part of the same industry. If industry structure differs markedly, however, the two products may be best understood as separate industries.
In lubricants, the oil used in cars is similar
or even identical to the oil used in trucks, but
the similarity largely ends there. Automotive
motor oil is sold to fragmented, generally unsophisticated customers through numerous
and often powerful channels, using extensive
advertising. Products are packaged in small
containers and logistical costs are high, necessitating local production. Truck and power
generation lubricants are sold to entirely different buyers in entirely different ways using a
separate supply chain. Industry structure
(buyer power, barriers to entry, and so forth) is
substantially different. Automotive oil is thus a
distinct industry from oil for truck and stationary engine uses. Industry proﬁtability will differ in these two cases, and a lubricant company will need a separate strategy for
competing in each area.
Differences in the ﬁve competitive forces
also reveal the geographic scope of competition. If an industry has a similar structure in
every country (rivals, buyers, and so on), the

presumption is that competition is global, and
the ﬁve forces analyzed from a global perspective will set average proﬁtability. A single global strategy is needed. If an industry has quite
different structures in different geographic regions, however, each region may well be a distinct industry. Otherwise, competition would
have leveled the differences. The ﬁve forces analyzed for each region will set proﬁtability
there.
The extent of differences in the ﬁve forces
for related products or across geographic
areas is a matter of degree, making industry
deﬁnition often a matter of judgment. A rule
of thumb is that where the differences in any
one force are large, and where the differences
involve more than one force, distinct industries may well be present.
Fortunately, however, even if industry
boundaries are drawn incorrectly, careful ﬁve
forces analysis should reveal important competitive threats. A closely related product
omitted from the industry deﬁnition will show
up as a substitute, for example, or competitors
overlooked as rivals will be recognized as potential entrants. At the same time, the ﬁve
forces analysis should reveal major differences
within overly broad industries that will indicate the need to adjust industry boundaries or
strategies.

determine which force or forces are currently
constraining industry proﬁtability and address
them. A company can potentially inﬂuence all
of the competitive forces. The strategist’s goal
here is to reduce the share of proﬁts that leak
to suppliers, buyers, and substitutes or are sacriﬁced to deter entrants.
To neutralize supplier power, for example, a
ﬁrm can standardize speciﬁcations for parts to
make it easier to switch among suppliers. It
can cultivate additional vendors, or alter technology to avoid a powerful supplier group altogether. To counter customer power, companies
may expand services that raise buyers’ switching costs or ﬁnd alternative means of reaching
customers to neutralize powerful channels. To
temper proﬁt-eroding price rivalry, companies
can invest more heavily in unique products, as
pharmaceutical ﬁrms have done, or expand
support services to customers. To scare off entrants, incumbents can elevate the ﬁxed cost of
competing—for instance, by escalating their
R&D or marketing expenditures. To limit the
threat of substitutes, companies can offer better value through new features or wider product accessibility. When soft-drink producers introduced vending machines and convenience
store channels, for example, they dramatically
improved the availability of soft drinks relative

Typical Steps in Industry Analysis
Deﬁne the relevant industry:
• What products are in it? Which ones
are part of another distinct industry?
• What is the geographic scope of
competition?
Identify the participants and segment
them into groups, if appropriate:
Who are
• the buyers and buyer groups?
• the suppliers and supplier groups?
• the competitors?
• the substitutes?
• the potential entrants?
Assess the underlying drivers of each
competitive force to determine which
forces are strong and which are weak
and why.

harvard business review • january 2008

Determine overall industry structure,
and test the analysis for consistency:
• Why is the level of proﬁtability what
it is?
• Which are the controlling forces for
proﬁtability?
• Is the industry analysis consistent
with actual long-run proﬁtability?
• Are more-proﬁtable players better
positioned in relation to the ﬁve
forces?
Analyze recent and likely future
changes in each force, both positive
and negative.
Identify aspects of industry structure that
might be inﬂuenced by competitors, by
new entrants, or by your company.

to other beverages.
Sysco, the largest food-service distributor in
North America, offers a revealing example of
how an industry leader can change the structure of an industry for the better. Food-service
distributors purchase food and related items
from farmers and food processors. They then
warehouse and deliver these items to restaurants, hospitals, employer cafeterias, schools,
and other food-service institutions. Given low
barriers to entry, the food-service distribution
industry has historically been highly fragmented, with numerous local competitors.
While rivals try to cultivate customer relationships, buyers are price sensitive because food
represents a large share of their costs. Buyers
can also choose the substitute approaches of
purchasing directly from manufacturers or
using retail sources, avoiding distributors altogether. Suppliers wield bargaining power:
They are often large companies with strong
brand names that food preparers and consumers recognize. Average proﬁtability in the industry has been modest.
Sysco recognized that, given its size and national reach, it might change this state of affairs. It led the move to introduce private-label
distributor brands with speciﬁcations tailored
to the food-service market, moderating supplier power. Sysco emphasized value-added
services to buyers such as credit, menu planning, and inventory management to shift the
basis of competition away from just price.
These moves, together with stepped-up investments in information technology and regional
distribution centers, substantially raised the
bar for new entrants while making the substitutes less attractive. Not surprisingly, the industry has been consolidating, and industry
proﬁtability appears to be rising.
Industry leaders have a special responsibility
for improving industry structure. Doing so
often requires resources that only large players
possess. Moreover, an improved industry structure is a public good because it beneﬁts every
ﬁrm in the industry, not just the company that
initiated the improvement. Often, it is more in
the interests of an industry leader than any
other participant to invest for the common
good because leaders will usually beneﬁt the
most. Indeed, improving the industry may be a
leader’s most proﬁtable strategic opportunity,
in part because attempts to gain further market share can trigger strong reactions from ri-

Common Pitfalls
In conducting the analysis avoid
the following common mistakes:
• Deﬁning the industry too
broadly or too narrowly.
• Making lists instead of engaging
in rigorous analysis.
• Paying equal attention to all of
the forces rather than digging
deeply into the most important
ones.
• Confusing effect (price sensitivity) with cause (buyer economics).
• Using static analysis that ignores
industry trends.
• Confusing cyclical or transient
changes with true structural
changes.
• Using the framework to declare
an industry attractive or unattractive rather than using it to
guide strategic choices.

harvard business review • january 2008

vals, customers, and even suppliers.
There is a dark side to shaping industry
structure that is equally important to understand. Ill-advised changes in competitive positioning and operating practices can undermine
industry structure. Faced with pressures to
gain market share or enamored with innovation for its own sake, managers may trigger
new kinds of competition that no incumbent
can win. When taking actions to improve their
own company’s competitive advantage, then,
strategists should ask whether they are setting
in motion dynamics that will undermine industry structure in the long run. In the early days
of the personal computer industry, for instance, IBM tried to make up for its late entry
by offering an open architecture that would set
industry standards and attract complementary
makers of application software and peripherals. In the process, it ceded ownership of the
critical components of the PC—the operating
system and the microprocessor—to Microsoft
and Intel. By standardizing PCs, it encouraged
price-based rivalry and shifted power to suppliers. Consequently, IBM became the temporarily dominant ﬁrm in an industry with an enduringly unattractive structure.
Expanding the proﬁt pool. When overall demand grows, the industry’s quality level rises,
intrinsic costs are reduced, or waste is eliminated, the pie expands. The total pool of value
available to competitors, suppliers, and buyers
grows. The total proﬁt pool expands, for example, when channels become more competitive
or when an industry discovers latent buyers
for its product that are not currently being
served. When soft-drink producers rationalized their independent bottler networks to
make them more efﬁcient and effective, both
the soft-drink companies and the bottlers beneﬁted. Overall value can also expand when
ﬁrms work collaboratively with suppliers to
improve coordination and limit unnecessary
costs incurred in the supply chain. This lowers
the inherent cost structure of the industry, allowing higher proﬁt, greater demand through
lower prices, or both. Or, agreeing on quality
standards can bring up industrywide quality
and service levels, and hence prices, beneﬁting
rivals, suppliers, and customers.
Expanding the overall proﬁt pool creates
win-win opportunities for multiple industry
participants. It can also reduce the risk of destructive rivalry that arises when incumbents

attempt to shift bargaining power or capture
more market share. However, expanding the
pie does not reduce the importance of industry
structure. How the expanded pie is divided will
ultimately be determined by the ﬁve forces.
The most successful companies are those that
expand the industry proﬁt pool in ways that
allow them to share disproportionately in the
beneﬁts.
Deﬁning the industry. The ﬁve competitive
forces also hold the key to deﬁning the relevant industry (or industries) in which a company competes. Drawing industry boundaries
correctly, around the arena in which competition actually takes place, will clarify the causes
of proﬁtability and the appropriate unit for
setting strategy. A company needs a separate
strategy for each distinct industry. Mistakes in
industry deﬁnition made by competitors
present opportunities for staking out superior
strategic positions. (See the sidebar “Deﬁning
the Relevant Industry.”)

Competition and Value
The competitive forces reveal the drivers of industry competition. A company strategist who
understands that competition extends well beyond existing rivals will detect wider competitive threats and be better equipped to address
them. At the same time, thinking comprehensively about an industry’s structure can uncover opportunities: differences in customers,
suppliers, substitutes, potential entrants, and
rivals that can become the basis for distinct
strategies yielding superior performance. In a
world of more open competition and relentless change, it is more important than ever to
think structurally about competition.
Understanding industry structure is equally
important for investors as for managers. The
ﬁve competitive forces reveal whether an industry is truly attractive, and they help investors anticipate positive or negative shifts in industry structure before they are obvious. The
ﬁve forces distinguish short-term blips from
structural changes and allow investors to take
advantage of undue pessimism or optimism.
Those companies whose strategies have industry-transforming potential become far clearer.
This deeper thinking about competition is a
more powerful way to achieve genuine investment success than the ﬁnancial projections
and trend extrapolation that dominate today’s
investment analysis.

If both executives and investors looked at
competition this way, capital markets would be
a far more effective force for company success
and economic prosperity. Executives and investors would both be focused on the same fundamentals that drive sustained proﬁtability. The
conversation between investors and executives would focus on the structural, not the
transient. Imagine the improvement in company performance—and in the economy as a
whole—if all the energy expended in “pleasing
the Street” were redirected toward the factors
that create true economic value.

What Is Strategy?
by Michael E. Porter
Harvard Business Review
February 2000
Product no. 4134
By analyzing the five competitive forces, you
uncover opportunities to position your company strategically; that is, to gain a sustainable
advantage over rivals by preserving what’s
distinctive about your company. Your strategic
position hinges on performing different activities from competitors or performing similar
activities, but in different ways. It emerges
from three sources: 1) serving few needs of
many customers (for example, Jiffy Lube provides only auto lubricants), 2) serving broad
needs of few customers (Bessemer Trust targets only very high-wealth clients), or 3) serving broad needs of many customers in a narrow market (Carmike Cinemas operates only
in cities with a population under 200,000).

On Competition
by Michael E. Porter
Harvard Business School Press
September 1998
Product no. 7951
Porter’s work, which began with his original
formulation of the five forces, has defined our
fundamental understanding of competition
and competitive strategy. This book is a compilation of a dozen Porter articles: two new articles and ten of his articles from Harvard Business Review. Together, these essays provide a
complete picture of Porter’s perspective on
modern competition. Organized around three
primary categories: Competition and Strategy:
Core Concepts, The Competitiveness of Location, and Competitive Solutions to Societal
Problems, these articles develop the building
blocks that define competitive strategy.

In this book Porter and Teisberg analyze the
competitive forces responsible for the current
crisis in U.S. health care. The authors argue
that participants in the health care system
have competed to shift costs, accumulate bargaining power, and restrict services rather
than create value for patients. This zero-sum
competition takes place at the wrong level—
among health plans, networks, and hospitals—rather than where it matters most: in the
diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions. Redefining Health Care
lays out a breakthrough framework for redefining health care competition based on patient value. With specific recommendations

Building Your Company’s Vision

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

Hewlett-Packard. 3M. Sony. Companies
with exceptionally durable visions that are
“built to last.” What distinguishes their visions from most others, those empty muddles that get revised with every passing
business fad, but never prompt anything
more than a yawn? Enduring companies
have clear plans for how they will advance
into an uncertain future. But they are
equally clear about how they will remain
steadfast, about the values and purposes
they will always stand for. This Harvard Business Review article describes the two components of any lasting vision: core ideology
and an envisioned future.

A company’s practices and strategies should
change continually; its core ideology should
not. Core ideology defines a company’s timeless character. It’s the glue that holds the
enterprise together even when everything
else is up for grabs. Core ideology is something you discover—by looking inside. It’s not
something you can invent, much less fake.
A core ideology has two parts:
1. Core values are the handful of guiding
principles by which a company navigates.
They require no external justification. For example, Disney’s core values of imagination
and wholesomeness stem from the founder’s
belief that these should be nurtured for their
own sake, not merely to capitalize on a business opportunity. Instead of changing its
core values, a great company will change its
markets—seek out different customers—in
order to remain true to its core values.

name will be as well known as any in the
world . . . and will signify innovation and
quality. . . .‘Made in Japan’ will mean something fine, not something shoddy.”
Don’t confuse your company’s core ideology
with its envisioned future—in particular, don’t
confuse a BHAG with a core purpose. A BHAG
is a clearly articulated goal that is reachable
within 10 to 30 years. But your core purpose
can never be completed.

2. Core purpose is an organization’s most
fundamental reason for being. It should not
be confused with the company’s current
product lines or customer segments. Rather, it
reflects people’s idealistic motivations for
doing the company’s work. Disney’s core purpose is to make people happy—not to build
theme parks and make cartoons.
An envisioned future, the second component
of an effective vision, has two elements:
1. Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAGs) are
ambitious plans that rev up the entire organization. They typically require 10 to 30 years’
work to complete.
2. Vivid descriptions paint a picture of what
it will be like to achieve the BHAGs. They
make the goals vibrant, engaging—and tangible.
Example:
In the 1950s, Sony’s goal was to “become
the company most known for changing
the worldwide poor-quality image of Japanese products.” It made this BHAG vivid by
adding, “Fifty years from now, our brand

Building Your
Company’s Vision
by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras

We shall not cease from exploration / And
the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive
where we started / And know the place for
the ﬁrst time.
T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets
Companies that enjoy enduring success have
core values and a core purpose that remain
ﬁxed while their business strategies and practices endlessly adapt to a changing world. The
dynamic of preserving the core while stimulating progress is the reason that companies such
as Hewlett-Packard, 3M, Johnson & Johnson,
Procter & Gamble, Merck, Sony, Motorola,
and Nordstrom became elite institutions able
to renew themselves and achieve superior
long-term performance. Hewlett-Packard employees have long known that radical change
in operating practices, cultural norms, and
business strategies does not mean losing the
spirit of the HP Way—the company’s core
principles. Johnson & Johnson continually
questions its structure and revamps its processes while preserving the ideals embodied in
its credo. In 1996, 3M sold off several of its

harvard business review • september–october 1996

large mature businesses—a dramatic move
that surprised the business press—to refocus
on its enduring core purpose of solving unsolved problems innovatively. We studied
companies such as these in our research for
Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies and found that they have outperformed
the general stock market by a factor of 12
since 1925.
Truly great companies understand the difference between what should never change
and what should be open for change, between
what is genuinely sacred and what is not.
This rare ability to manage continuity and
change—requiring a consciously practiced
discipline—is closely linked to the ability to
develop a vision. Vision provides guidance
about what core to preserve and what future
to stimulate progress toward. But vision has
become one of the most overused and least
understood words in the language, conjuring
up different images for different people: of
deeply held values, outstanding achievement,
societal bonds, exhilarating goals, motivating

forces, or raisons d’être. We recommend a
conceptual framework to deﬁne vision, add
clarity and rigor to the vague and fuzzy concepts swirling around that trendy term, and
give practical guidance for articulating a coherent vision within an organization. It is a
prescriptive framework rooted in six years of
research and reﬁned and tested by our ongoing work with executives from a great variety
of organizations around the world.
A well-conceived vision consists of two
major components: core ideology and envisioned future. (See the exhibit “Articulating a
Vision.”) Core ideology, the yin in our scheme,
deﬁnes what we stand for and why we exist.
Yin is unchanging and complements yang, the
envisioned future. The envisioned future is
what we aspire to become, to achieve, to create—something that will require signiﬁcant
change and progress to attain.

Core Ideology

James C. Collins is a management educator and writer based in Boulder,
Colorado, where he operates a management learning laboratory for conducting research and working with
executives. He is also a visiting professor of business administration at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
Jerry I. Porras is the Lane Professor of
Organizational Behavior and Change at
Stanford University’s Graduate School
of Business in Stanford, California,
where he is also the director of the Executive Program in Leading and Managing Change. Collins and Porras are
coauthors of Built to Last: Successful
Habits of Visionary Companies (HarperBusiness, 1994).

Core ideology deﬁnes the enduring character
of an organization—a consistent identity that
transcends product or market life cycles,
technological breakthroughs, management
fads, and individual leaders. In fact, the most
lasting and signiﬁcant contribution of those
who build visionary companies is the core
ideology. As Bill Hewlett said about his
longtime friend and business partner David
Packard upon Packard’s death not long ago,
“As far as the company is concerned, the
greatest thing he left behind him was a code
of ethics known as the HP Way.” HP’s core
ideology, which has guided the company
since its inception more than 50 years ago,
includes a deep respect for the individual, a
dedication to affordable quality and reliability, a commitment to community responsibility (Packard himself bequeathed his $4.3
billion of Hewlett-Packard stock to a charitable foundation), and a view that the company
exists to make technical contributions for the
advancement and welfare of humanity. Company builders such as David Packard, Masaru
Ibuka of Sony, George Merck of Merck, William McKnight of 3M, and Paul Galvin of Motorola understood that it is more important
to know who you are than where you are going, for where you are going will change as
the world around you changes. Leaders die,
products become obsolete, markets change,
new technologies emerge, and management

harvard business review • september–october 1996

fads come and go, but core ideology in a great
company endures as a source of guidance
and inspiration.
Core ideology provides the glue that holds
an organization together as it grows, decentralizes, diversiﬁes, expands globally, and develops workplace diversity. Think of it as
analogous to the principles of Judaism that
held the Jewish people together for centuries
without a homeland, even as they spread
throughout the Diaspora. Or think of the
truths held to be self-evident in the Declaration of Independence, or the enduring ideals
and principles of the scientiﬁc community
that bond scientists from every nationality
together in the common purpose of advancing human knowledge. Any effective vision
must embody the core ideology of the organization, which in turn consists of two distinct parts: core values, a system of guiding
principles and tenets; and core purpose,
the organization’s most fundamental reason
for existence.
Core Values. Core values are the essential
and enduring tenets of an organization. A
small set of timeless guiding principles, core
values require no external justiﬁcation; they
have intrinsic value and importance to those
inside the organization. The Walt Disney
Company’s core values of imagination and
wholesomeness stem not from market requirements but from the founder’s inner
belief that imagination and wholesomeness
should be nurtured for their own sake. William Procter and James Gamble didn’t instill
in P&G’s culture a focus on product excellence merely as a strategy for success but as
an almost religious tenet. And that value has
been passed down for more than 15 decades
by P&G people. Service to the customer—
even to the point of subservience—is a way of
life at Nordstrom that traces its roots back to
1901, eight decades before customer service
programs became stylish. For Bill Hewlett
and David Packard, respect for the individual
was ﬁrst and foremost a deep personal
value; they didn’t get it from a book or hear it
from a management guru. And Ralph S.
Larsen, CEO of Johnson & Johnson, puts it
this way: “The core values embodied in our
credo might be a competitive advantage, but
that is not why we have them. We have them
because they deﬁne for us what we stand
for, and we would hold them even if they

page 45

<-----Page 45----->Building Your Company’s Vision

became a competitive disadvantage in certain situations.”
The point is that a great company decides
for itself what values it holds to be core, largely
independent of the current environment, competitive requirements, or management fads.
Clearly, then, there is no universally right set
of core values. A company need not have as its
core value customer service (Sony doesn’t) or
respect for the individual (Disney doesn’t) or
quality (Wal-Mart Stores doesn’t) or market
focus (HP doesn’t) or teamwork (Nordstrom
doesn’t). A company might have operating
practices and business strategies around those
qualities without having them at the essence of
its being. Furthermore, great companies need
not have likable or humanistic core values,
although many do. The key is not what core
values an organization has but that it has core
values at all.
Companies tend to have only a few core values, usually between three and ﬁve. In fact,
we found that none of the visionary companies we studied in our book had more than
ﬁve: most had only three or four. (See the insert “Core Values Are a Company’s Essential
Tenets.”) And, indeed, we should expect that.
Only a few values can be truly core—that is, so
fundamental and deeply held that they will
change seldom, if ever.
To identify the core values of your own
organization, push with relentless honesty to
deﬁne what values are truly central. If you
articulate more than ﬁve or six, chances are
that you are confusing core values (which do

not change) with operating practices, business
strategies, or cultural norms (which should be
open to change). Remember, the values must
stand the test of time. After you’ve drafted a
preliminary list of the core values, ask about
each one, If the circumstances changed and
penalized us for holding this core value, would
we still keep it? If you can’t honestly answer
yes, then the value is not core and should be
dropped from consideration.
A high-technology company wondered
whether it should put quality on its list of core
values. The CEO asked, “Suppose in ten years
quality doesn’t make a hoot of difference in
our markets. Suppose the only thing that matters is sheer speed and horsepower but not
quality. Would we still want to put quality on
our list of core values?” The members of the
management team looked around at one another and ﬁnally said no. Quality stayed in the
strategy of the company, and quality-improvement
programs remained in place as a mechanism
for stimulating progress; but quality did not
make the list of core values.
The same group of executives then wrestled with leading-edge innovation as a core
value. The CEO asked, “Would we keep innovation on the list as a core value, no matter
how the world around us changed?” This
time, the management team gave a resounding yes. The managers’ outlook might be
summarized as, “We always want to do leadingedge innovation. That’s who we are. It’s really important to us and always will be. No
matter what. And if our current markets
don’t value it, we will ﬁnd markets that do.”
Leading-edge innovation went on the list
and will stay there. A company should not
change its core values in response to market
changes; rather, it should change markets, if
necessary, to remain true to its core values.
Who should be involved in articulating the
core values varies with the size, age, and geographic dispersion of the company, but in
many situations we have recommended what
we call a Mars Group. It works like this: Imagine that you’ve been asked to re-create the
very best attributes of your organization on
another planet but you have seats on the
rocket ship for only ﬁve to seven people.
Whom should you send? Most likely, you’ll
choose the people who have a gut-level understanding of your core values, the highest
level of credibility with their peers, and the

page 46

<-----Page 46----->Building Your Company’s Vision

highest levels of competence. We’ll often ask
people brought together to work on core values to nominate a Mars Group of ﬁve to seven
individuals (not necessarily all from the assembled group). Invariably, they end up selecting highly credible representatives who do
a super job of articulating the core values
precisely because they are exemplars of those
values—a representative slice of the company’s genetic code.
Even global organizations composed of people from widely diverse cultures can identify a
set of shared core values. The secret is to work
from the individual to the organization. People
involved in articulating the core values need to
answer several questions: What core values do
you personally bring to your work? (These
should be so fundamental that you would hold
them regardless of whether or not they were
rewarded.) What would you tell your children
are the core values that you hold at work and
that you hope they will hold when they become working adults? If you awoke tomorrow
morning with enough money to retire for the
rest of your life, would you continue to live
those core values? Can you envision them
being as valid for you 100 years from now as
they are today? Would you want to hold those
core values, even if at some point one or more
of them became a competitive disadvantage? If

you were to start a new organization tomorrow in a different line of work, what core values would you build into the new organization
regardless of its industry? The last three questions are particularly important because they
make the crucial distinction between enduring
core values that should not change and practices and strategies that should be changing all
the time.
Core Purpose. Core purpose, the second
part of core ideology, is the organization’s reason for being. An effective purpose reﬂects
people’s idealistic motivations for doing the
company’s work. It doesn’t just describe the
organization’s output or target customers; it
captures the soul of the organization. (See the
insert “Core Purpose Is a Company’s Reason
for Being.”) Purpose, as illustrated by a speech
David Packard gave to HP employees in 1960,
gets at the deeper reasons for an organization’s existence beyond just making money.
Packard said,
I want to discuss why a company exists in
the first place. In other words, why are we here?
I think many people assume, wrongly, that a
company exists simply to make money. While
this is an important result of a company’s existence, we have to go deeper and find the real
reasons for our being. As we investigate this,
we inevitably come to the conclusion that a
group of people get together and exist as an
institution that we call a company so they are
able to accomplish something collectively that
they could not accomplish separately—they
make a contribution to society, a phrase which
sounds trite but is fundamental... You can look
around [in the general business world and] see
people who are interested in money and nothing else, but the underlying drives come
largely from a desire to do something else: to
make a product, to give a service—generally
to do something which is of value.1
Purpose (which should last at least 100
years) should not be confused with speciﬁc
goals or business strategies (which should
change many times in 100 years). Whereas
you might achieve a goal or complete a strategy, you cannot fulﬁll a purpose; it is like a
guiding star on the horizon—forever pursued
but never reached. Yet although purpose itself does not change, it does inspire change.
The very fact that purpose can never be fully
realized means that an organization can
never stop stimulating change and progress.

page 47

<-----Page 47----->Building Your Company’s Vision

In identifying purpose, some companies
make the mistake of simply describing their
current product lines or customer segments.
We do not consider the following statement
to reﬂect an effective purpose: “We exist to
fulﬁll our government charter and participate in the secondary mortgage market by
packaging mortgages into investment securities.” The statement is merely descriptive. A
far more effective statement of purpose
would be that expressed by the executives of
the Federal National Mortgage Association,
Fannie Mae: “To strengthen the social fabric
by continually democratizing home ownership.” The secondary mortgage market as we
know it might not even exist in 100 years,
but strengthening the social fabric by continually democratizing home ownership can be
an enduring purpose, no matter how much
the world changes. Guided and inspired by
this purpose, Fannie Mae launched in the
early 1990s a series of bold initiatives, including a program to develop new systems for reducing mortgage underwriting costs by 40%
in ﬁve years; programs to eliminate discrimination in the lending process (backed by
$5 billion in underwriting experiments); and
an audacious goal to provide, by the year
2000, $1 trillion targeted at 10 million families that had traditionally been shut out of

home ownership—minorities, immigrants,
and low-income groups.
Similarly, 3M deﬁnes its purpose not in
terms of adhesives and abrasives but as the
perpetual quest to solve unsolved problems
innovatively—a purpose that is always leading
3M into new ﬁelds. McKinsey & Company’s
purpose is not to do management consulting
but to help corporations and governments be
more successful: in 100 years, it might involve
methods other than consulting. HewlettPackard doesn’t exist to make electronic test
and measurement equipment but to make
technical contributions that improve people’s
lives—a purpose that has led the company far
aﬁeld from its origins in electronic instruments. Imagine if Walt Disney had conceived
of his company’s purpose as to make cartoons,
rather than to make people happy; we probably wouldn’t have Mickey Mouse, Disneyland,
EPCOT Center, or the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
Hockey Team.
One powerful method for getting at purpose
is the ﬁve whys. Start with the descriptive statement We make X products or We deliver X
services, and then ask, Why is that important?
ﬁve times. After a few whys, you’ll ﬁnd that
you’re getting down to the fundamental purpose of the organization.
We used this method to deepen and enrich a
discussion about purpose when we worked
with a certain market-research company. The
executive team ﬁrst met for several hours and
generated the following statement of purpose
for their organization: To provide the best market-research data available. We then asked the
following question: Why is it important to provide the best market-research data available?
After some discussion, the executives answered
in a way that reﬂected a deeper sense of their
organization’s purpose: To provide the best
market-research data available so that our customers will understand their markets better
than they could otherwise. A further discussion let team members realize that their sense
of self-worth came not just from helping customers understand their markets better but
also from making a contribution to their customers’ success. This introspection eventually
led the company to identify its purpose as: To
contribute to our customers’ success by helping them understand their markets. With this
purpose in mind, the company now frames its
product decisions not with the question Will it

Listen to people in truly

about their

sell? but with the question Will it make a contribution to our customers’ success?
The ﬁve whys can help companies in any
industry frame their work in a more meaningful way. An asphalt and gravel company
might begin by saying, We make gravel and
asphalt products. After a few whys, it could
conclude that making asphalt and gravel is
important because the quality of the infrastructure plays a vital role in people’s safety
and experience; because driving on a pitted
road is annoying and dangerous; because
747s cannot land safely on runways built
with poor workmanship or inferior concrete;
because buildings with substandard materials weaken with time and crumble in earthquakes. From such introspection may
emerge this purpose: To make people’s lives
better by improving the quality of manmade structures. With a sense of purpose
very much along those lines, Granite Rock
Company of Watsonville, California, won the
Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award—
not an easy feat for a small rock quarry and
asphalt company. And Granite Rock has
gone on to be one of the most progressive
and exciting companies we’ve encountered
in any industry.
Notice that none of the core purposes fall
into the category “maximize shareholder
wealth.” A primary role of core purpose is to
guide and inspire. Maximizing shareholder
wealth does not inspire people at all levels of
an organization, and it provides precious little
guidance. Maximizing shareholder wealth is
the standard off-the-shelf purpose for those organizations that have not yet identiﬁed their
true core purpose. It is a substitute—and a
weak one at that.
When people in great organizations talk
about their achievements, they say very little
about earnings per share. Motorola people
talk about impressive quality improvements
and the effect of the products they create on
the world. Hewlett-Packard people talk about
their technical contributions to the marketplace. Nordstrom people talk about heroic
customer service and remarkable individual
performance by star salespeople. When a Boeing engineer talks about launching an exciting and revolutionary new aircraft, she does
not say, “I put my heart and soul into this
project because it would add 37 cents to our
earnings per share.”

harvard business review • september–october 1996

One way to get at the purpose that lies beyond
merely maximizing shareholder wealth is to
play the “Random Corporate Serial Killer”
game. It works like this: Suppose you could sell
the company to someone who would pay a
price that everyone inside and outside the
company agrees is more than fair (even with a
very generous set of assumptions about the expected future cash ﬂows of the company). Suppose further that this buyer would guarantee
stable employment for all employees at the
same pay scale after the purchase but with no
guarantee that those jobs would be in the
same industry. Finally, suppose the buyer plans
to kill the company after the purchase—its
products or services would be discontinued, its
operations would be shut down, its brand
names would be shelved forever, and so on.
The company would utterly and completely
cease to exist. Would you accept the offer?
Why or why not? What would be lost if the
company ceased to exist? Why is it important
that the company continue to exist? We’ve
found this exercise to be very powerful for
helping hard-nosed, ﬁnancially focused executives reﬂect on their organization’s deeper
reasons for being.
Another approach is to ask each member of
the Mars Group, How could we frame the purpose of this organization so that if you woke
up tomorrow morning with enough money in
the bank to retire, you would nevertheless
keep working here? What deeper sense of purpose would motivate you to continue to dedicate your precious creative energies to this
company’s efforts?
As they move into the twenty-ﬁrst century,
companies will need to draw on the full creative
energy and talent of their people. But why
should people give full measure? As Peter
Drucker has pointed out, the best and most dedicated people are ultimately volunteers, for they
have the opportunity to do something else with
their lives. Confronted with an increasingly mobile society, cynicism about corporate life, and an
expanding entrepreneurial segment of the economy, companies more than ever need to have a
clear understanding of their purpose in order to
make work meaningful and thereby attract, motivate, and retain outstanding people.

Discovering Core Ideology
You do not create or set core ideology. You discover core ideology. You do not deduce it by

page 49

<-----Page 49----->Building Your Company’s Vision

You discover core ideology
by looking inside. It has to
be authentic. You can’t
fake it.

looking at the external environment. You understand it by looking inside. Ideology has to
be authentic. You cannot fake it. Discovering
core ideology is not an intellectual exercise.
Do not ask, What core values should we hold?
Ask instead, What core values do we truly and
passionately hold? You should not confuse values that you think the organization ought to
have—but does not—with authentic core values. To do so would create cynicism throughout the organization. (“Who’re they trying to
kid? We all know that isn’t a core value around
here!”) Aspirations are more appropriate as
part of your envisioned future or as part of
your strategy, not as part of the core ideology.
However, authentic core values that have
weakened over time can be considered a legitimate part of the core ideology—as long as
you acknowledge to the organization that you
must work hard to revive them.
Also be clear that the role of core ideology
is to guide and inspire, not to differentiate.
Two companies can have the same core values
or purpose. Many companies could have the
purpose to make technical contributions, but
few live it as passionately as Hewlett-Packard.
Many companies could have the purpose to
preserve and improve human life, but few
hold it as deeply as Merck. Many companies
could have the core value of heroic customer
service, but few create as intense a culture
around that value as Nordstrom. Many companies could have the core value of innovation, but few create the powerful alignment
mechanisms that stimulate the innovation we
see at 3M. The authenticity, the discipline,
and the consistency with which the ideology
is lived—not the content of the ideology—
differentiate visionary companies from the
rest of the pack.
Core ideology needs to be meaningful and
inspirational only to people inside the organization; it need not be exciting to outsiders.
Why not? Because it is the people inside the
organization who need to commit to the organizational ideology over the long term. Core
ideology can also play a role in determining
who is inside and who is not. A clear and wellarticulated ideology attracts to the company
people whose personal values are compatible
with the company’s core values; conversely, it
repels those whose personal values are incompatible. You cannot impose new core values
or purpose on people. Nor are core values and

harvard business review • september–october 1996

purpose things people can buy into. Executives often ask, How do we get people to
share our core ideology? You don’t. You can’t.
Instead, ﬁnd people who are predisposed to
share your core values and purpose; attract
and retain those people; and let those who do
not share your core values go elsewhere. Indeed, the very process of articulating core ideology may cause some people to leave when
they realize that they are not personally compatible with the organization’s core. Welcome that outcome. It is certainly desirable to
retain within the core ideology a diversity of
people and viewpoints. People who share the
same core values and purpose do not necessarily all think or look the same.
Don’t confuse core ideology itself with
core-ideology statements. A company can
have a very strong core ideology without a
formal statement. For example, Nike has not
(to our knowledge) formally articulated a
statement of its core purpose. Yet, according
to our observations, Nike has a powerful core
purpose that permeates the entire organization: to experience the emotion of competition, winning, and crushing competitors. Nike
has a campus that seems more like a shrine to
the competitive spirit than a corporate ofﬁce
complex. Giant photos of Nike heroes cover
the walls, bronze plaques of Nike athletes hang
along the Nike Walk of Fame, statues of Nike
athletes stand alongside the running track
that rings the campus, and buildings honor
champions such as Olympic marathoner Joan
Benoit, basketball superstar Michael Jordan,
and tennis pro John McEnroe. Nike people
who do not feel stimulated by the competitive
spirit and the urge to be ferocious simply do
not last long in the culture. Even the company’s name reﬂects a sense of competition:
Nike is the Greek goddess of victory. Thus,
although Nike has not formally articulated its
purpose, it clearly has a strong one.
Identifying core values and purpose is
therefore not an exercise in wordsmithery. Indeed, an organization will generate a variety
of statements over time to describe the core
ideology. In Hewlett-Packard‘s archives, we
found more than half a dozen distinct versions of the HP Way, drafted by David Packard between 1956 and 1972. All versions stated
the same principles, but the words used varied depending on the era and the circumstances. Similarly, Sony’s core ideology has

page 50

<-----Page 50----->Building Your Company’s Vision

been stated many different ways over the
company’s history. At its founding, Masaru
Ibuka described two key elements of Sony’s
ideology: “We shall welcome technical difﬁculties and focus on highly sophisticated technical products that have great usefulness for
society regardless of the quantity involved; we
shall place our main emphasis on ability, performance, and personal character so that each
individual can show the best in ability and
skill.”2 Four decades later, this same concept
appeared in a statement of core ideology
called Sony Pioneer Spirit: “Sony is a pioneer
and never intends to follow others. Through
progress, Sony wants to serve the whole
world. It shall be always a seeker of the unknown.... Sony has a principle of respecting
and encouraging one’s ability...and always
tries to bring out the best in a person. This is
the vital force of Sony.”3 Same core values, different words.
You should therefore focus on getting the
content right—on capturing the essence of
the core values and purpose. The point is not
to create a perfect statement but to gain a
deep understanding of your organization’s
core values and purpose, which can then be
expressed in a multitude of ways. In fact, we
often suggest that once the core has been
identiﬁed, managers should generate their
own statements of the core values and purpose to share with their groups.
Finally, don’t confuse core ideology with
the concept of core competence. Core competence is a strategic concept that deﬁnes
your organization’s capabilities—what you
are particularly good at—whereas core ideology captures what you stand for and why
you exist. Core competencies should be well
aligned with a company’s core ideology and
are often rooted in it; but they are not the
same thing. For example, Sony has a core
competence of miniaturization—a strength
that can be strategically applied to a wide
array of products and markets. But it does
not have a core ideology of miniaturization.
Sony might not even have miniaturization as
part of its strategy in 100 years, but to remain a great company, it will still have the
same core values described in the Sony Pioneer Spirit and the same fundamental
reason for being—namely, to advance technology for the beneﬁt of the general public.
In a visionary company like Sony, core com-

harvard business review • september–october 1996

petencies change over the decades, whereas
core ideology does not.
Once you are clear about the core ideology,
you should feel free to change absolutely anything that is not part of it. From then on, whenever someone says something should not
change because “it’s part of our culture” or
“we’ve always done it that way” or any such excuse, mention this simple rule: If it’s not core,
it’s up for change. The strong version of the
rule is, If it’s not core, change it! Articulating
core ideology is just a starting point, however.
You also must determine what type of progress
you want to stimulate.

Envisioned Future
The second primary component of the vision
framework is envisioned future. It consists of
two parts: a 10-to-30-year audacious goal plus
vivid descriptions of what it will be like to
achieve the goal. We recognize that the phrase
envisioned future is somewhat paradoxical.
On the one hand, it conveys concreteness—
something visible, vivid, and real. On the
other hand, it involves a time yet unrealized—
with its dreams, hopes, and aspirations.
Vision-level BHAG. We found in our research that visionary companies often use bold
missions—or what we prefer to call BHAGs
(pronounced BEE-hags and shorthand for Big,
Hairy, Audacious Goals)—as a powerful way to
stimulate progress. All companies have goals.
But there is a difference between merely having a goal and becoming committed to a huge,
daunting challenge—such as climbing Mount
Everest. A true BHAG is clear and compelling,
serves as a unifying focal point of effort, and
acts as a catalyst for team spirit. It has a clear
ﬁnish line, so the organization can know when
it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for
ﬁnish lines. A BHAG engages people—it
reaches out and grabs them. It is tangible, energizing, highly focused. People get it right away;
it takes little or no explanation. For example,
NASA’s 1960s moon mission didn’t need a committee of wordsmiths to spend endless hours
turning the goal into a verbose, impossible-toremember mission statement. The goal itself
was so easy to grasp—so compelling in its own
right—that it could be said 100 different ways
yet be easily understood by everyone. Most corporate statements we’ve seen do little to spur
forward movement because they do not contain the powerful mechanism of a BHAG.

page 51

<-----Page 51----->Building Your Company’s Vision

Although organizations may have many
BHAGs at different levels operating at the
same time, vision requires a special type of
BHAG—a vision-level BHAG that applies to
the entire organization and requires 10 to 30
years of effort to complete. Setting the BHAG
that far into the future requires thinking beyond the current capabilities of the organization
and the current environment. Indeed, inventing such a goal forces an executive team to be
visionary, rather than just strategic or tactical.
A BHAG should not be a sure bet—it will
have perhaps only a 50% to 70% probability of
success—but the organization must believe
that it can reach the goal anyway. A BHAG
should require extraordinary effort and perhaps a little luck. We have helped companies
create a vision-level BHAG by advising them
to think in terms of four broad categories: tar-

get BHAGs, common-enemy BHAGs, rolemodel BHAGs, and internal-transformation
BHAGs. (See the insert “Big, Hairy, Audacious
Goals Aid Long-Term Vision.”)
Vivid Description. In addition to visionlevel BHAGs, an envisioned future needs what
we call vivid description—that is, a vibrant, engaging, and speciﬁc description of what it will
be like to achieve the BHAG. Think of it as
translating the vision from words into pictures, of creating an image that people can
carry around in their heads. It is a question of
painting a picture with your words. Picture
painting is essential for making the 10-to-30year BHAG tangible in people’s minds.
For example, Henry Ford brought to life the
goal of democratizing the automobile with this
vivid description: “I will build a motor car for
the great multitude.... It will be so low in price
that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one and enjoy with his family the
blessing of hours of pleasure in God’s great
open spaces.... When I’m through, everybody
will be able to afford one, and everyone will
have one. The horse will have disappeared
from our highways, the automobile will be
taken for granted...[and we will] give a large
number of men employment at good wages.”
The components-support division of a
computer-products company had a general
manager who was able to describe vividly the
goal of becoming one of the most sought-after
divisions in the company: “We will be respected and admired by our peers.... Our solutions will be actively sought by the end-product divisions, who will achieve signiﬁcant
product ‘hits’ in the marketplace largely because of our technical contribution.... We will
have pride in ourselves.... The best up-andcoming people in the company will seek to
work in our division.... People will give unsolicited feedback that they love what they are doing.... [Our own] people will walk on the balls
of their feet.... [They] will willingly work hard
because they want to.... Both employees and
customers will feel that our division has contributed to their life in a positive way.”
In the 1930s, Merck had the BHAG to transform itself from a chemical manufacturer into
one of the preeminent drug-making companies in the world, with a research capability to
rival any major university. In describing this
envisioned future, George Merck said at the
opening of Merck’s research facility in 1933,

page 52

<-----Page 52----->Building Your Company’s Vision

You must translate the
vision from words to
pictures with a vivid
description of what it will
be like to achieve your
goal.

“We believe that research work carried on
with patience and persistence will bring to industry and commerce new life; and we have
faith that in this new laboratory, with the
tools we have supplied, science will be advanced, knowledge increased, and human life
win ever a greater freedom from suffering
and disease.... We pledge our every aid that
this enterprise shall merit the faith we have in
it. Let your light so shine—that those who
seek the Truth, that those who toil that this
world may be a better place to live in, that
those who hold aloft that torch of science and
knowledge through these social and economic dark ages, shall take new courage and
feel their hands supported.”
Passion, emotion, and conviction are essential parts of the vivid description. Some managers are uncomfortable expressing emotion
about their dreams, but that’s what motivates
others. Churchill understood that when he
described the BHAG facing Great Britain in
1940. He did not just say, “Beat Hitler.” He
said, “Hitler knows he will have to break us on
this island or lose the war. If we can stand up
to him, all Europe may be free, and the life of
the world may move forward into broad, sunlit uplands. But if we fail, the whole world, including the United States, including all we
have known and cared for, will sink into the
abyss of a new Dark Age, made more sinister
and perhaps more protracted by the lights of
perverted science. Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that
if the British Empire and its Commonwealth
last for a thousand years, men will still say,
‘This was their ﬁnest hour.’”
A Few Key Points. Don’t confuse core ideology and envisioned future. In particular,
don’t confuse core purpose and BHAGs. Managers often exchange one for the other, mixing the two together or failing to articulate
both as distinct items. Core purpose—not
some speciﬁc goal—is the reason why the
organization exists. A BHAG is a clearly articulated goal. Core purpose can never be completed, whereas the BHAG is reachable in 10
to 30 years. Think of the core purpose as the
star on the horizon to be chased forever; the
BHAG is the mountain to be climbed. Once
you have reached its summit, you move on to
other mountains.
Identifying core ideology is a discovery process, but setting the envisioned future is a cre-

harvard business review • september–october 1996

ative process. We ﬁnd that executives often
have a great deal of difﬁculty coming up with
an exciting BHAG. They want to analyze their
way into the future. We have found, therefore, that some executives make more
progress by starting ﬁrst with the vivid description and backing from there into the
BHAG. This approach involves starting with
questions such as, We’re sitting here in 20
years; what would we love to see? What
should this company look like? What should
it feel like to employees? What should it have
achieved? If someone writes an article for a
major business magazine about this company in 20 years, what will it say? One biotechnology company we worked with had
trouble envisioning its future. Said one member of the executive team, “Every time we
come up with something for the entire company, it is just too generic to be exciting—
something banal like ‘advance biotechnology
worldwide.’” Asked to paint a picture of the
company in 20 years, the executives mentioned such things as “on the cover of Business
Week as a model success story...the Fortune
most admired top-ten list...the best science
and business graduates want to work
here...people on airplanes rave about one of
our products to seatmates...20 consecutive
years of proﬁtable growth...an entrepreneurial culture that has spawned half a dozen new
divisions from within...management gurus
use us as an example of excellent management and progressive thinking,” and so on.
From this, they were able to set the goal of becoming as well respected as Merck or as
Johnson & Johnson in biotechnology.
It makes no sense to analyze whether an
envisioned future is the right one. With a creation—and the task is creation of a future,
not prediction—there can be no right answer.
Did Beethoven create the right Ninth Symphony? Did Shakespeare create the right
Hamlet? We can’t answer these questions;
they’re nonsense. The envisioned future involves such essential questions as Does it get
our juices ﬂowing? Do we ﬁnd it stimulating?
Does it spur forward momentum? Does it get
people going? The envisioned future should
be so exciting in its own right that it would
continue to keep the organization motivated
even if the leaders who set the goal disappeared. City Bank, the predecessor of Citicorp, had the BHAG “to become the most

page 53

<-----Page 53----->Building Your Company’s Vision

powerful, the most serviceable, the most farreaching world ﬁnancial institution that has
ever been”—a goal that generated excitement
through multiple generations until it was
achieved. Similarly, the NASA moon mission
continued to galvanize people even though
President John F. Kennedy (the leader associated with setting the goal) died years before
its completion.
To create an effective envisioned future requires a certain level of unreasonable conﬁdence and commitment. Keep in mind that a
BHAG is not just a goal; it is a Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal. It’s not reasonable for a small regional bank to set the goal of becoming “the
most powerful, the most serviceable, the most
far-reaching world ﬁnancial institution that
has ever been,” as City Bank did in 1915. It’s not
a tepid claim that “we will democratize the automobile,” as Henry Ford said. It was almost
laughable for Philip Morris—as the sixth-place
player with 9% market share in the 1950s—to
take on the goal of defeating Goliath RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company and becoming number one. It was hardly modest for Sony, as a
small, cash-strapped venture, to proclaim the
goal of changing the poor-quality image of Japanese products around the world. (See the insert “Putting It All Together: Sony in the
1950s.”) Of course, it’s not only the audacity of
the goal but also the level of commitment to
the goal that counts. Boeing didn’t just envi-

sion a future dominated by its commercial jets;
it bet the company on the 707 and, later, on
the 747. Nike’s people didn’t just talk about the
idea of crushing Adidas; they went on a crusade to fulﬁll the dream. Indeed, the envisioned future should produce a bit of the “gulp
factor”: when it dawns on people what it will
take to achieve the goal, there should be an
almost audible gulp.
But what about failure to realize the envisioned future? In our research, we found that
the visionary companies displayed a remarkable
ability to achieve even their most audacious
goals. Ford did democratize the automobile;
Citicorp did become the most far-reaching
bank in the world; Philip Morris did rise from
sixth to ﬁrst and beat RJ Reynolds worldwide;
Boeing did become the dominant commercial
aircraft company; and it looks like Wal-Mart
will achieve its $125 billion goal, even without
Sam Walton. In contrast, the comparison
companies in our research frequently did not
achieve their BHAGs, if they set them at all.
The difference does not lie in setting easier
goals: the visionary companies tended to have
even more audacious ambitions. The difference does not lie in charismatic, visionary
leadership: the visionary companies often
achieved their BHAGs without such largerthan-life leaders at the helm. Nor does the difference lie in better strategy: the visionary
companies often realized their goals more by
an organic process of “let’s try a lot of stuff
and keep what works” than by well-laid strategic plans. Rather, their success lies in building the strength of their organization as their
primary way of creating the future.
Why did Merck become the preeminent
drug-maker in the world? Because Merck’s architects built the best pharmaceutical research
and development organization in the world.
Why did Boeing become the dominant commercial aircraft company in the world? Because of its superb engineering and marketing
organization, which had the ability to make
projects like the 747 a reality. When asked to
name the most important decisions that have
contributed to the growth and success of
Hewlett-Packard, David Packard answered entirely in terms of decisions to build the
strength of the organization and its people.
Finally, in thinking about the envisioned future, beware of the We’ve Arrived Syndrome—a
complacent lethargy that arises once an organi-

zation has achieved one BHAG and fails to replace it with another. NASA suffered from that
syndrome after the successful moon landings.
After you’ve landed on the moon, what do you
do for an encore? Ford suffered from the syndrome when, after it succeeded in democratizing
the automobile, it failed to set a new goal of
equal signiﬁcance and gave General Motors the
opportunity to jump ahead in the 1930s. Apple
Computer suffered from the syndrome after
achieving the goal of creating a computer that
nontechies could use. Start-up companies frequently suffer from the We’ve Arrived Syndrome
after going public or after reaching a stage in
which survival no longer seems in question. An
envisioned future helps an organization only as
long as it hasn’t yet been achieved. In our work
with companies, we frequently hear executives
say, “It’s just not as exciting around here as it used
to be; we seem to have lost our momentum.”
Usually, that kind of remark signals that the organization has climbed one mountain and not yet
picked a new one to climb.
Many executives thrash about with mission statements and vision statements. Unfortunately, most of those statements turn out to
be a muddled stew of values, goals, purposes,
philosophies, beliefs, aspirations, norms, strategies, practices, and descriptions. They are
usually a boring, confusing, structurally unsound stream of words that evoke the response “True, but who cares?” Even more
problematic, seldom do these statements have

harvard business review • september–october 1996

a direct link to the fundamental dynamic of
visionary companies: preserve the core and
stimulate progress. That dynamic, not vision
or mission statements, is the primary engine
of enduring companies. Vision simply provides the context for bringing this dynamic to
life. Building a visionary company requires 1%
vision and 99% alignment. When you have superb alignment, a visitor could drop in from
outer space and infer your vision from the operations and activities of the company without ever reading it on paper or meeting a
single senior executive.
Creating alignment may be your most important work. But the ﬁrst step will always be
to recast your vision or mission into an effective context for building a visionary company.
If you do it right, you shouldn’t have to do it
again for at least a decade.

necessary in order for a company to prosper—but they involve different tasks. Management copes with complexity; leadership
deals with change. The leader’s job is to set
the direction of change by communicating a

A compelling vision is not enough: senior
management must identify the crucial business challenges that change programs will
meet and then link them to the vision. Most
corporate change programs have a negligible
impact on operational and financial performance because management focuses on the
activities, not the results. By contrast, resultsdriven improvement programs focus on

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

When Apple introduced the iPod, it did
something far smarter than wrap a good
technology in a snazzy design. It wrapped a
good technology in a great business
model. Combining hardware, software,
and service, the model provided gamechanging convenience for consumers
and record-breaking profits for Apple.

UNDERSTAND YOUR CURRENT BUSINESS
MODEL

Great business models can reshape industries and drive spectacular growth.
Yet many companies find business-model
innovation difficult. Managers don’t understand their existing model well enough to
know when it needs changing—or how.
To determine whether your firm should
alter its business model, Johnson, Christensen, and Kagermann advise these
steps:

1. Articulate what makes your existing
model successful. For example, what customer problem does it solve? How does
it make money for your firm?
2. Watch for signals that your model needs
changing, such as tough new competitors
on the horizon.
3. Decide whether reinventing your
model is worth the effort. The answer’s yes
only if the new model changes the industry
or market.

accepted lower-than-standard gross margins, and sold the Nano in large volumes to
its target market: first-time car buyers in
emerging markets.

A successful model has these components:
• Customer value proposition. The model
helps customers perform a specific “job”
that alternative offerings don’t address.
Example:
MinuteClinics enable people to visit a
doctor’s office without appointments by
making nurse practitioners available to
treat minor health issues.

• Key resources and processes. Your company has the people, technology, products,
facilities, equipment, and brand required
to deliver the value proposition to your
targeted customers. And it has processes
(training, manufacturing, service) to leverage those resources.

• Profit formula. The model generates value
for your company through factors such as
revenue model, cost structure, margins, and
inventory turnover.
Example:
The Tata Group’s inexpensive car, the
Nano, is profitable because the company
has reduced many cost structure elements,

Example:
For Tata Motors to fulfill the requirements
of the Nano’s profit formula, it had to reconceive how a car is designed, manufactured,
and distributed. It redefined its supplier
strategy, choosing to outsource a remarkable 85% of the Nano’s components and to
use nearly 60% fewer vendors than normal
to reduce transaction costs.

These circumstances often require business model change:

The Nano’s goal is to open car ownership to low-income consumers

A company develops a commercial application for a technology

In 2003, Apple introduced the iPod with the
iTunes store, revolutionizing portable entertainment, creating a new market, and transforming the company. In just three years, the
iPod/iTunes combination became a nearly
$10 billion product, accounting for almost 50%
of Apple’s revenue. Apple’s market capitalization catapulted from around $1 billion in early
2003 to over $150 billion by late 2007.
This success story is well known; what’s less
well known is that Apple was not the ﬁrst to
bring digital music players to market. A company called Diamond Multimedia introduced
the Rio in 1998. Another ﬁrm, Best Data,
introduced the Cabo 64 in 2000. Both products worked well and were portable and
stylish. So why did the iPod, rather than the
Rio or Cabo, succeed?
Apple did something far smarter than take
a good technology and wrap it in a snazzy
design. It took a good technology and
wrapped it in a great business model. Apple’s
true innovation was to make downloading
digital music easy and convenient. To do

harvard business review • december 2008

that, the company built a groundbreaking
business model that combined hardware, software, and service. This approach worked like
Gillette’s famous blades-and-razor model in
reverse: Apple essentially gave away the
“blades” (low-margin iTunes music) to lock
in purchase of the “razor” (the high-margin
iPod). That model deﬁned value in a new way
and provided game-changing convenience to
the consumer.
Business model innovations have reshaped
entire industries and redistributed billions of
dollars of value. Retail discounters such as WalMart and Target, which entered the market
with pioneering business models, now account
for 75% of the total valuation of the retail sector. Low-cost U.S. airlines grew from a blip on
the radar screen to 55% of the market value of
all carriers. Fully 11 of the 27 companies born in
the last quarter century that grew their way
into the Fortune 500 in the past 10 years did
so through business model innovation.

however, are rare. An analysis of major innovations within existing corporations in
the past decade shows that precious few have
been business-model related. And a recent
American Management Association study
determined that no more than 10% of innovation investment at global companies is
focused on developing new business models.
Yet everyone’s talking about it. A 2005
survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit
reported that over 50% of executives believe
business model innovation will become even
more important for success than product or
service innovation. A 2008 IBM survey of
corporate CEOs echoed these results. Nearly
all of the CEOs polled reported the need to
adapt their business models; more than twothirds said that extensive changes were required. And in these tough economic times,
some CEOs are already looking to business
model innovation to address permanent shifts
in their market landscapes.
Senior managers at incumbent companies
thus confront a frustrating question: Why is it
so difﬁcult to pull off the new growth that
business model innovation can bring? Our
research suggests two problems. The ﬁrst is a
lack of deﬁnition: Very little formal study has
been done into the dynamics and processes
of business model development. Second, few
companies understand their existing business
model well enough—the premise behind its
development, its natural interdependencies,
and its strengths and limitations. So they
don’t know when they can leverage their core
business and when success requires a new
business model.
After tackling these problems with dozens of
companies, we have found that new business
models often look unattractive to internal and
external stakeholders—at the outset. To see
past the borders of what is and into the land
of the new, companies need a road map.
Ours consists of three simple steps. The ﬁrst
is to realize that success starts by not thinking
about business models at all. It starts with
thinking about the opportunity to satisfy a
real customer who needs a job done. The
second step is to construct a blueprint laying
out how your company will fulﬁll that need
at a proﬁt. In our model, that plan has four
elements. The third is to compare that model
to your existing model to see how much you’d
have to change it to capture the opportunity.

harvard business review • december 2008

Once you do, you will know if you can use
your existing model and organization or need
to separate out a new unit to execute a new
model. Every successful company is already
fulﬁlling a real customer need with an effective business model, whether that model is
explicitly understood or not. Let’s take a look
at what that entails.

Business Model: A Deﬁnition
A business model, from our point of view,
consists of four interlocking elements that,
taken together, create and deliver value. The
most important to get right, by far, is the ﬁrst.
Customer value proposition (CVP). A successful company is one that has found a way
to create value for customers—that is, a way to
help customers get an important job done. By
“job” we mean a fundamental problem in a
given situation that needs a solution. Once we
understand the job and all its dimensions,
including the full process for how to get it
done, we can design the offering. The more
important the job is to the customer, the
lower the level of customer satisfaction with
current options for getting the job done, and
the better your solution is than existing alternatives at getting the job done (and, of course,
the lower the price), the greater the CVP.
Opportunities for creating a CVP are at their
most potent, we have found, when alternative
products and services have not been designed
with the real job in mind and you can design
an offering that gets that job—and only
that job—done perfectly. We’ll come back to
that point later.
Proﬁt formula. The proﬁt formula is the
blueprint that deﬁnes how the company
creates value for itself while providing value
to the customer. It consists of the following:
• Revenue model: price x volume
• Cost structure: direct costs, indirect costs,
economies of scale. Cost structure will be
predominantly driven by the cost of the key
resources required by the business model.
• Margin model: given the expected volume
and cost structure, the contribution needed
from each transaction to achieve desired
proﬁts.
• Resource velocity: how fast we need to
turn over inventory, ﬁxed assets, and other
assets—and, overall, how well we need to
utilize resources—to support our expected
volume and achieve our anticipated proﬁts.

page 60

<-----Page 60----->Reinventing Your Business Model

People often think the terms “proﬁt formulas” and “business models” are interchangeable. But how you make a proﬁt is only one
piece of the model. We’ve found it most useful to start by setting the price required to
deliver the CVP and then work backwards
from there to determine what the variable
costs and gross margins must be. This then determines what the scale and resource velocity
needs to be to achieve the desired proﬁts.
Key resources. The key resources are assets
such as the people, technology, products,
facilities, equipment, channels, and brand
required to deliver the value proposition to
the targeted customer. The focus here is on
the key elements that create value for the
customer and the company, and the way those
elements interact. (Every company also has
generic resources that do not create competitive differentiation.)
Key processes. Successful companies have
operational and managerial processes that
allow them to deliver value in a way they
can successfully repeat and increase in scale.
These may include such recurrent tasks as
training, development, manufacturing, budgeting, planning, sales, and service. Key
processes also include a company’s rules,
metrics, and norms.
These four elements form the building
blocks of any business. The customer value
proposition and the proﬁt formula deﬁne
value for the customer and the company,
respectively; key resources and key processes
describe how that value will be delivered to
both the customer and the company.
As simple as this framework may seem, its
power lies in the complex interdependencies
of its parts. Major changes to any of these
four elements affect the others and the
whole. Successful businesses devise a more
or less stable system in which these elements
bond to one another in consistent and complementary ways.

How Great Models Are Built
To illustrate the elements of our business
model framework, we will look at what’s behind two companies’ game-changing business
model innovations.
Creating a customer value proposition.
It’s not possible to invent or reinvent a business model without ﬁrst identifying a clear
customer value proposition. Often, it starts

harvard business review • december 2008

as a quite simple realization. Imagine, for a
moment, that you are standing on a Mumbai
road on a rainy day. You notice the large
number of motor scooters snaking precariously in and out around the cars. As you look
more closely, you see that most bear whole
families—both parents and several children.
Your ﬁrst thought might be “That’s crazy!” or
“That’s the way it is in developing countries—
people get by as best they can.”
When Ratan Tata of Tata Group looked
out over this scene, he saw a critical job to be
done: providing a safer alternative for scooter
families. He understood that the cheapest car
available in India cost easily ﬁve times what a
scooter did and that many of these families
could not afford one. Offering an affordable,
safer, all-weather alternative for scooter families was a powerful value proposition, one
with the potential to reach tens of millions
of people who were not yet part of the
car-buying market. Ratan Tata also recognized
that Tata Motors’ business model could not
be used to develop such a product at the
needed price point.
At the other end of the market spectrum,
Hilti, a Liechtenstein-based manufacturer of
high-end power tools for the construction industry, reconsidered the real job to be done
for many of its current customers. A contractor makes money by ﬁnishing projects; if the
required tools aren’t available and functioning properly, the job doesn’t get done. Contractors don’t make money by owning tools;
they make it by using them as efﬁciently
as possible. Hilti could help contractors get
the job done by selling tool use instead of the
tools themselves—managing its customers’
tool inventory by providing the best tool at
the right time and quickly furnishing tool
repairs, replacements, and upgrades, all for a
monthly fee. To deliver on that value proposition, the company needed to create a ﬂeetmanagement program for tools and in the
process shift its focus from manufacturing
and distribution to service. That meant Hilti
had to construct a new proﬁt formula and
develop new resources and new processes.
The most important attribute of a customer
value proposition is its precision: how perfectly it nails the customer job to be done—
and nothing else. But such precision is often
the most difﬁcult thing to achieve. Companies
trying to create the new often neglect to focus

The Elements of a Successful Business Model
Every successful company already operates according to an effective business model. By systematically identifying all of its
constituent parts, executives can understand how the model fulﬁlls a potent value proposition in a proﬁtable way using certain
key resources and key processes. With that understanding, they can then judge how well the same model could be used to fulﬁll
a radically different CVP—and what they’d need to do to construct a new one, if need be, to capitalize on that opportunity.

Customer Value Proposition (CVP)
■

Target customer

■

Job to be done to solve an
important problem or fulfill an
important need for the target
customer

■

Offering, which satisfies the
problem or fulfills the need.
This is defined not only by what
is sold but also by how it’s sold.

on one job; they dilute their efforts by attempting to do lots of things. In doing lots
of things, they do nothing really well.
One way to generate a precise customer
value proposition is to think about the four
most common barriers keeping people from
getting particular jobs done: insufﬁcient
wealth, access, skill, or time. Software maker
Intuit devised QuickBooks to fulﬁll smallbusiness owners’ need to avoid running out of
cash. By fulﬁlling that job with greatly simpliﬁed accounting software, Intuit broke the skills
barrier that kept untrained small-business
owners from using more-complicated accounting packages. MinuteClinic, the drugstorebased basic health care provider, broke the
time barrier that kept people from visiting
a doctor’s ofﬁce with minor health issues by
making nurse practitioners available without
appointments.
Designing a proﬁt formula. Ratan Tata
knew the only way to get families off their
scooters and into cars would be to break
the wealth barrier by drastically decreasing
the price of the car. “What if I can change the
game and make a car for one lakh?” Tata
wondered, envisioning a price point of around
US$2,500, less than half the price of the

Hilti Sidesteps Commoditization
Hilti is capitalizing on a game-changing opportunity to increase proﬁtability by
turning products into a service. Rather than sell tools (at lower and lower prices),
it’s selling a “just-the-tool-you-need-when-you-need-it, no-repair-or-storage-hassles”
service. Such a radical change in customer value proposition required a shift in all
parts of its business model.

cheapest car available. This, of course, had
dramatic ramiﬁcations for the proﬁt formula:
It required both a signiﬁcant drop in gross
margins and a radical reduction in many
elements of the cost structure. He knew,
however, he could still make money if he
could increase sales volume dramatically,
and he knew that his target base of consumers
was potentially huge.
For Hilti, moving to a contract management
program required shifting assets from customers’ balance sheets to its own and generating
revenue through a lease/subscription model.
For a monthly fee, customers could have a full
complement of tools at their ﬁngertips, with
repair and maintenance included. This would
require a fundamental shift in all major components of the proﬁt formula: the revenue
stream (pricing, the staging of payments, and
how to think about volume), the cost structure
(including added sales development and contract management costs), and the supporting
margins and transaction velocity.
Identifying key resources and processes.
Having articulated the value proposition for
both the customer and the business, companies must then consider the key resources and
processes needed to deliver that value. For a
professional services ﬁrm, for example, the key
resources are generally its people, and the
key processes are naturally people related
(training and development, for instance). For a
packaged goods company, strong brands and
well-selected channel retailers might be the
key resources, and associated brand-building
and channel-management processes among
the critical processes.
Oftentimes, it’s not the individual resources
and processes that make the difference but
their relationship to one another. Companies
will almost always need to integrate their
key resources and processes in a unique way
to get a job done perfectly for a set of customers. When they do, they almost always create
enduring competitive advantage. Focusing
ﬁrst on the value proposition and the proﬁt
formula makes clear how those resources and
processes need to interrelate. For example,
most general hospitals offer a value proposition that might be described as, “We’ll do
anything for anybody.” Being all things to
all people requires these hospitals to have
a vast collection of resources (specialists,
equipment, and so on) that can’t be knit

page 63

<-----Page 63----->Reinventing Your Business Model

together in any proprietary way. The result
is not just a lack of differentiation but dissatisfaction.
By contrast, a hospital that focuses on a
speciﬁc value proposition can integrate its
resources and processes in a unique way that
delights customers. National Jewish Health
in Denver, for example, is organized around a
focused value proposition we’d characterize
as, “If you have a disease of the pulmonary
system, bring it here. We’ll deﬁne its root
cause and prescribe an effective therapy.”
Narrowing its focus has allowed National
Jewish to develop processes that integrate the
ways in which its specialists and specialized
equipment work together.
For Tata Motors to fulﬁll the requirements
of its customer value proposition and proﬁt
formula for the Nano, it had to reconceive
how a car is designed, manufactured, and
distributed. Tata built a small team of fairly
young engineers who would not, like the
company’s more-experienced designers, be
inﬂuenced and constrained in their thinking
by the automaker’s existing proﬁt formulas.
This team dramatically minimized the number of parts in the vehicle, resulting in a signiﬁcant cost saving. Tata also reconceived its
supplier strategy, choosing to outsource a remarkable 85% of the Nano’s components and
use nearly 60% fewer vendors than normal to
reduce transaction costs and achieve better
economies of scale.
At the other end of the manufacturing
line, Tata is envisioning an entirely new way
of assembling and distributing its cars. The
ultimate plan is to ship the modular components of the vehicles to a combined network of company-owned and independent
entrepreneur-owned assembly plants, which
will build them to order. The Nano will be
designed, built, distributed, and serviced in a
radically new way—one that could not be
accomplished without a new business model.
And while the jury is still out, Ratan Tata may
solve a trafﬁc safety problem in the process.
For Hilti, the greatest challenge lay in training its sales representatives to do a thoroughly
new task. Fleet management is not a halfhour sale; it takes days, weeks, even months of
meetings to persuade customers to buy a program instead of a product. Suddenly, ﬁeld reps
accustomed to dealing with crew leaders and
on-site purchasing managers in mobile trailers

harvard business review • december 2008

found themselves staring down CEOs and
CFOs across conference tables.
Additionally, leasing required new resources—new people, more robust IT systems, and other new technologies—to design
and develop the appropriate packages and
then come to an agreement on monthly
payments. Hilti needed a process for maintaining large arsenals of tools more inexpensively and effectively than its customers
had. This required warehousing, an inventory management system, and a supply of
replacement tools. On the customer management side, Hilti developed a website that
enabled construction managers to view all the
tools in their ﬂeet and their usage rates. With
that information readily available, the managers could easily handle the cost accounting
associated with those assets.
Rules, norms, and metrics are often the last
element to emerge in a developing business
model. They may not be fully envisioned
until the new product or service has been
road tested. Nor should they be. Business
models need to have the ﬂexibility to change
in their early years.

When a New Business Model Is
Needed
Established companies should not undertake
business-model innovation lightly. They
can often create new products that disrupt
competitors without fundamentally changing
their own business model. Procter & Gamble,
for example, developed a number of what
it calls “disruptive market innovations” with
such products as the Swiffer disposable mop
and duster and Febreze, a new kind of air
freshener. Both innovations built on P&G’s
existing business model and its established
dominance in household consumables.
There are clearly times, however, when creating new growth requires venturing not only
into unknown market territory but also into
unknown business model territory. When? The
short answer is “When signiﬁcant changes are
needed to all four elements of your existing
model.” But it’s not always that simple. Management judgment is clearly required. That
said, we have observed ﬁve strategic circumstances that often require business model
change:
1. The opportunity to address through disruptive innovation the needs of large groups

page 64

<-----Page 64----->Reinventing Your Business Model

of potential customers who are shut out of a
market entirely because existing solutions
are too expensive or complicated for them.
This includes the opportunity to democratize
products in emerging markets (or reach the
bottom of the pyramid), as Tata’s Nano does.
2. The opportunity to capitalize on a brandnew technology by wrapping a new business
model around it (Apple and MP3 players)
or the opportunity to leverage a tested technology by bringing it to a whole new market
(say, by offering military technologies in the
commercial space or vice versa).
3. The opportunity to bring a job-to-bedone focus where one does not yet exist.
That’s common in industries where companies focus on products or customer segments,
which leads them to reﬁne existing products
more and more, increasing commoditization
over time. A jobs focus allows companies to
redeﬁne industry proﬁtability. For example,
when FedEx entered the package delivery
market, it did not try to compete through
lower prices or better marketing. Instead, it
concentrated on fulﬁlling an entirely unmet
customer need to receive packages far, far
faster, and more reliably, than any service
then could. To do so, it had to integrate its
key processes and resources in a vastly more
efﬁcient way. The business model that resulted from this job-to-be-done emphasis

Dow Corning Embraces the Low End
Traditionally high-margin Dow Corning found new opportunities in low-margin
offerings by setting up a separate business unit that operates in an entirely different
way. By fundamentally differentiating its low-end and high-end offerings, the company avoided cannibalizing its traditional business even as it found new proﬁts at
the low end.

gave FedEx a signiﬁcant competitive advantage that took UPS many years to copy.
4. The need to fend off low-end disrupters.
If the Nano is successful, it will threaten
other automobile makers, much as minimills
threatened the integrated steel mills a generation ago by making steel at signiﬁcantly
lower cost.
5. The need to respond to a shifting basis
of competition. Inevitably, what deﬁnes an
acceptable solution in a market will change
over time, leading core market segments to
commoditize. Hilti needed to change its business model in part because of lower global
manufacturing costs; “good enough” low-end
entrants had begun chipping away at the
market for high-quality power tools.
Of course, companies should not pursue
business model reinvention unless they are
conﬁdent that the opportunity is large enough
to warrant the effort. And, there’s really no
point in instituting a new business model
unless it’s not only new to the company but
in some way new or game-changing to the
industry or market. To do otherwise would be
a waste of time and money.
These questions will help you evaluate
whether the challenge of business model
innovation will yield acceptable results. Answering “yes” to all four greatly increases
the odds of successful execution:
• Can you nail the job with a focused,
compelling customer value proposition?
• Can you devise a model in which all the
elements—the customer value proposition,
the proﬁt formula, the key resources, and the
key processes—work together to get the job
done in the most efﬁcient way possible?
• Can you create a new business development process unfettered by the often negative
inﬂuences of your core business?
• Will the new business model disrupt
competitors?
Creating a new model for a new business
does not mean the current model is threatened or should be changed. A new model
often reinforces and complements the core
business, as Dow Corning discovered.

How Dow Corning Got Out of Its
Own Way
When business model innovation is clearly
called for, success lies not only in getting
the model right but also in making sure the

page 65

<-----Page 65----->Reinventing Your Business Model

When the Old
Model Will Work
You don’t always need a new business model to capitalize on a gamechanging opportunity. Sometimes,
as P&G did with its Swiffer, a company ﬁnds that its current model is
revolutionary in a new market.
When will the old model do? When
you can fulﬁll the new customer
value proposition:
• With your current proﬁt formula
• Using most, if not all, of your current key resources and processes
• Using the same core metrics, rules,
and norms you now use to run your
business

incumbent business doesn’t in some way prevent the new model from creating value or
thriving. That was a problem for Dow Corning
when it built a new business unit—with a new
proﬁt formula—from scratch.
For many years, Dow Corning had sold
thousands of silicone-based products and
provided sophisticated technical services to
an array of industries. After years of proﬁtable
growth, however, a number of product areas
were stagnating. A strategic review uncovered
a critical insight: Its low-end product segment
was commoditizing. Many customers experienced in silicone application no longer
needed technical services; they needed basic
products at low prices. This shift created an
opportunity for growth, but to exploit that
opportunity Dow Corning had to ﬁgure out
a way to serve these customers with a lowerpriced product. The problem was that both
the business model and the culture were
built on high-priced, innovative product and
service packages. In 2002, in pursuit of what
was essentially a commodity business for
low-end customers, Dow Corning CEO Gary
Anderson asked executive Don Sheets to form
a team to start a new business.
The team began by formulating a customer
value proposition that it believed would fulﬁll the job to be done for these price-driven
customers. It determined that the price point
had to drop 15% (which for a commoditizing
material was a huge reduction). As the
team analyzed what that new customer value
proposition would require, it realized reaching that point was going to take a lot more
than merely eliminating services. Dramatic
price reduction would call for a different
proﬁt formula with a fundamentally lower
cost structure, which depended heavily on
developing a new IT system. To sell more
products faster, the company would need to
use the internet to automate processes and
reduce overhead as much as possible.
Breaking the rules. As a mature and successful company, Dow Corning was full of
highly trained employees used to delivering
its high-touch, customized value proposition.
To automate, the new business would have to
be far more standardized, which meant instituting different and, overall, much stricter
rules. For example, order sizes would be
limited to a few, larger-volume options; order
lead times would fall between two and four

harvard business review • december 2008

weeks (exceptions would cost extra); and
credit terms would be ﬁxed. There would be
charges if a purchaser required customer
service. The writing was on the wall: The new
venture would be low-touch, self-service, and
standardized. To succeed, Dow Corning would
have to break the rules that had previously
guided its success.
Sheets next had to determine whether this
new venture, with its new rules, could succeed
within the conﬁnes of Dow Corning’s core
enterprise. He set up an experimental war
game to test how existing staff and systems
would react to the requirements of the new
customer value proposition. He got crushed
as entrenched habits and existing processes
thwarted any attempt to change the game. It
became clear that the corporate antibodies
would kill the initiative before it got off the
ground. The way forward was clear: The new
venture had to be free from existing rules
and free to decide what rules would be appropriate in order for the new commodity
line of business to thrive. To nurture the
opportunity—and also protect the existing
model—a new business unit with a new brand
identity was needed. Xiameter was born.
Identifying new competencies. Following
the articulation of the new customer value
proposition and new proﬁt formula, the
Xiameter team focused on the new competencies it would need, its key resources and processes. Information technology, just a small
part of Dow Corning’s core competencies
at that time, emerged as an essential part of
the now web-enabled business. Xiameter also
needed employees who could make smart
decisions very quickly and who would thrive
in a fast-changing environment, ﬁlled initially
with lots of ambiguity. Clearly, new abilities
would have to be brought into the business.
Although Xiameter would be established
and run as a separate business unit, Don
Sheets and the Xiameter team did not want to
give up the incumbency advantage that deep
knowledge of the industry and of their own
products gave them. The challenge was to
tap into the expertise without importing
the old-rules mind-set. Sheets conducted a
focused HR search within Dow Corning for
risk takers. During the interview process,
when he came across candidates with the
right skills, he asked them to take the job
on the spot, before they left the room. This

What Rules, Norms, and Metrics Are Standing in Your Way?
In any business, a fundamental understanding of the core model often fades into the mists of institutional memory, but it lives on in rules,
norms, and metrics put in place to protect the status quo (for example, “Gross margins must be at 40%”). They are the ﬁrst line of defense
against any new model’s taking root in an existing enterprise.

approach allowed him to cherry-pick those
who could make snap decisions and take
big risks.
The secret sauce: patience. Successful new
businesses typically revise their business
models four times or so on the road to proﬁtability. While a well-considered businessmodel-innovation process can often shorten
this cycle, successful incumbents must tolerate
initial failure and grasp the need for course
correction. In effect, companies have to focus
on learning and adjusting as much as on executing. We recommend companies with new
business models be patient for growth (to
allow the market opportunity to unfold) but
impatient for proﬁt (as an early validation that
the model works). A proﬁtable business is the
best early indication of a viable model.
Accordingly, to allow for the trial and error
that naturally accompanies the creation of
the new while also constructing a development cycle that would produce results and
demonstrate feasibility with minimal resource outlay, Dow Corning kept the scale
of Xiameter’s operation small but developed
an aggressive timetable for launch and set
the goal of becoming proﬁtable by the end
of year one.
Xiameter paid back Dow Corning’s investment in just three months and went on to
become a major, transformative success. Beforehand, Dow Corning had had no online
sales component; now 30% of sales originate
online, nearly three times the industry aver-

age. Most of these customers are new to the
company. Far from cannibalizing existing customers, Xiameter has actually supported the
main business, allowing Dow Corning’s salespeople to more easily enforce premium pricing for their core offerings while providing a
viable alternative for the price-conscious.

•••
Established companies’ attempts at transformative growth typically spring from product
or technology innovations. Their efforts are
often characterized by prolonged development cycles and ﬁtful attempts to ﬁnd a
market. As the Apple iPod story that opened
this article suggests, truly transformative
businesses are never exclusively about the
discovery and commercialization of a great
technology. Their success comes from enveloping the new technology in an appropriate,
powerful business model.
Bob Higgins, the founder and general partner of Highland Capital Partners, has seen
his share of venture success and failure in
his 20 years in the industry. He sums up the
importance and power of business model
innovation this way: “I think historically
where we [venture capitalists] fail is when we
back technology. Where we succeed is when
we back new business models.”

Marketing Malpractice: The Cause and

Harvard Business Review

Ted Levitt used to tell his Harvard Business
School students, “People don’t want a quarterinch drill—they want a quarter-inch hole.”
But 35 years later, marketers are still thinking
in terms of products and ever-finer demographic segments. The structure of a market,
as seen from customers’ point of view, is very
simple. When people need to get a job done,
they hire a product or service to do it for
them. The marketer’s task is to understand
what jobs periodically arise in customers’
lives for which they might hire products the
company could make. New growth markets
are created when an innovative company
designs a product and then positions its
brand on a job for which no optimal product
yet exists. In fact, companies that historically
have segmented and measured markets by
product categories generally find that when
they instead segment by job, their market is
much larger (and their current share much
smaller) than they had thought. This is great
news for smart companies hungry for growth.

Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive
Change
by Clayton M. Christensen and

Harvard Business Review
March 2000
Product no. R00202
Why can’t large companies capitalize on the
opportunities brought about by major, disruptive changes in their markets? It’s because
organizations, independent of the people in
them, have capabilities. And those capabilities
also define disabilities. As a company grows,
what it can and cannot do becomes more

sharply defined in certain predictable ways.
The authors have analyzed those patterns
to create a framework managers can use to
assess the abilities and disabilities of their organization as a whole. They also suggest
ways large companies can capitalize on opportunities that normally would not fit in with
their processes or values.

We all know that people “hire” products and
services to get a job done. Surgeons hire scalpels to dissect soft tissue. Janitors hire soap
dispensers and paper towels to remove grime
from their hands. To find ways to innovate, it’s
critical to deconstruct the job the customer is
trying to get done from beginning to end, to
gain a complete view of all the points at
which a customer might desire more help
from a product or service. A methodology
called job mapping helps companies analyze
the biggest drawbacks of the products and
services customers currently use and discover
opportunities for innovation. It begins with
breaking down the task the customer wants
to accomplish into the eight universal steps of
a job: 1) defining the objectives, 2) locating
the necessary inputs, 3) preparing the physical
environment, 4) confirming that everything is
ready, 5) executing the task, 6) monitoring its
progress, 7) making modifications as necessary, and 8) concluding the job. Within each
step lies multiple opportunities for making
the job simpler, easier, or faster. By locating
those opportunities, companies can discover
new ways to differentiate their offerings.

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

The best way to drive profitable growth?
Stop competing in overcrowded industries.
In those red oceans, companies try to outperform rivals to grab bigger slices of existing demand. As the space gets increasingly
crowded, profit and growth prospects
shrink. Products become commoditized.
Ever-more-intense competition turns the
water bloody.

How to begin creating blue oceans? Kim and Mauborgne offer these suggestions:

COPYRIGHT © 2007 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

How to avoid the fray? Kim and Mauborgne
recommend creating blue oceans—
uncontested market spaces where the
competition is irrelevant. In blue oceans,
you invent and capture new demand, and
you offer customers a leap in value while
also streamlining your costs. Results? Handsome profits, speedy growth—and brand
equity that lasts for decades while rivals
scramble to catch up.
Consider Cirque du Soleil—which invented
a new industry that combined elements
from traditional circus with elements
drawn from sophisticated theater. In just
20 years, Cirque raked in revenues that
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey—the
world’s leading circus—needed more
than a century to attain.

UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC BEHIND BLUE
OCEAN STRATEGY
The logic behind blue ocean strategy is
counterintuitive:
• It’s not about technology innovation. Blue
oceans seldom result from technological
innovation. Often, the underlying technology already exists—and blue ocean creators link it to what buyers value. Compaq,
for example, used existing technologies to
create its ProSignia server, which gave buyers twice the file and print capability of the
minicomputer at one-third the price.
• You don’t have to venture into distant waters to create blue oceans. Most blue
oceans are created from within, not beyond, the red oceans of existing industries.
Incumbents often create blue oceans
within their core businesses. Consider
the megaplexes introduced by AMC—an
established player in the movie-theater
industry. Megaplexes provided moviegoers spectacular viewing experiences in
stadium-size theater complexes at lower
costs to theater owners.

APPLY BLUE OCEAN STRATEGIC MOVES
To apply blue ocean strategic moves:
• Never use the competition as a benchmark. Instead, make the competition irrelevant by creating a leap in value for both
yourself and your customers. Ford did this
with the Model T. Ford could have tried besting the fashionable, customized cars that
wealthy people bought for weekend jaunts
in the countryside. Instead, it offered a car
for everyday use that was far more affordable, durable, and easy to use and fix than
rivals’ offerings. Model T sales boomed, and
Ford’s market share surged from 9% in 1908
to 61% in 1921.
• Reduce your costs while also offering
customers more value. Cirque du Soleil
omitted costly elements of traditional circus, such as animal acts and aisle concessions. Its reduced cost structure enabled it
to provide sophisticated elements from
theater that appealed to adult audiences—
such as themes, original scores, and enchanting sets, all of which change year to
year. The added value lured adults who had
not gone to a circus for years and enticed
them to come back more frequently—
thereby increasing revenues. By offering
the best of circus and theater, Cirque created a market space that, as yet, has no
name—and no equals.

A onetime accordion player, stilt walker, and
ﬁre-eater, Guy Laliberté is now CEO of one of
Canada’s largest cultural exports, Cirque du
Soleil. Founded in 1984 by a group of street
performers, Cirque has staged dozens of productions seen by some 40 million people in 90
cities around the world. In 20 years, Cirque
has achieved revenues that Ringling Bros. and
Barnum & Bailey—the world’s leading circus—took more than a century to attain.
Cirque’s rapid growth occurred in an unlikely setting. The circus business was (and still
is) in long-term decline. Alternative forms of
entertainment—sporting events, TV, and video
games—were casting a growing shadow. Children, the mainstay of the circus audience, preferred PlayStations to circus acts. There was
also rising sentiment, fueled by animal rights
groups, against the use of animals, traditionally an integral part of the circus. On the supply side, the star performers that Ringling and
the other circuses relied on to draw in the
crowds could often name their own terms. As a
result, the industry was hit by steadily decreas-

ing audiences and increasing costs. What’s
more, any new entrant to this business would
be competing against a formidable incumbent
that for most of the last century had set the industry standard.
How did Cirque proﬁtably increase revenues
by a factor of 22 over the last ten years in such
an unattractive environment? The tagline for
one of the ﬁrst Cirque productions is revealing:
“We reinvent the circus.” Cirque did not make
its money by competing within the conﬁnes of
the existing industry or by stealing customers
from Ringling and the others. Instead it created uncontested market space that made the
competition irrelevant. It pulled in a whole
new group of customers who were traditionally noncustomers of the industry—adults and
corporate clients who had turned to theater,
opera, or ballet and were, therefore, prepared
to pay several times more than the price of a
conventional circus ticket for an unprecedented entertainment experience.
To understand the nature of Cirque’s
achievement, you have to realize that the busi-

ness universe consists of two distinct kinds of
space, which we think of as red and blue
oceans. Red oceans represent all the industries
in existence today—the known market space.
In red oceans, industry boundaries are deﬁned
and accepted, and the competitive rules of the
game are well understood. Here, companies
try to outperform their rivals in order to grab a
greater share of existing demand. As the space
gets more and more crowded, prospects for
proﬁts and growth are reduced. Products turn
into commodities, and increasing competition
turns the water bloody.
Blue oceans denote all the industries not in
existence today—the unknown market space,
untainted by competition. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There
is ample opportunity for growth that is both
proﬁtable and rapid. There are two ways to create blue oceans. In a few cases, companies can
give rise to completely new industries, as eBay
did with the online auction industry. But in
most cases, a blue ocean is created from within
a red ocean when a company alters the boundaries of an existing industry. As will become evident later, this is what Cirque did. In breaking
through the boundary traditionally separating
circus and theater, it made a new and proﬁtable blue ocean from within the red ocean of
the circus industry.
Cirque is just one of more than 150 blue
ocean creations that we have studied in over
30 industries, using data stretching back more
than 100 years. We analyzed companies that
created those blue oceans and their less successful competitors, which were caught in red
oceans. In studying these data, we have observed a consistent pattern of strategic thinking behind the creation of new markets and industries, what we call blue ocean strategy. The
logic behind blue ocean strategy parts with traditional models focused on competing in existing market space. Indeed, it can be argued that
managers’ failure to realize the differences between red and blue ocean strategy lies behind
the difﬁculties many companies encounter as
they try to break from the competition.
In this article, we present the concept of
blue ocean strategy and describe its deﬁning
characteristics. We assess the proﬁt and growth
consequences of blue oceans and discuss why
their creation is a rising imperative for companies in the future. We believe that an understanding of blue ocean strategy will help to-

day’s companies as they struggle to thrive in an
accelerating and expanding business universe.

Blue and Red Oceans
Although the term may be new, blue oceans
have always been with us. Look back 100 years
and ask yourself which industries known
today were then unknown. The answer: Industries as basic as automobiles, music recording,
aviation, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals,
and management consulting were unheard-of
or had just begun to emerge. Now turn the
clock back only 30 years and ask yourself the
same question. Again, a plethora of multibillion-dollar industries jump out: mutual funds,
cellular telephones, biotechnology, discount
retailing, express package delivery, snowboards, coffee bars, and home videos, to name
a few. Just three decades ago, none of these industries existed in a meaningful way.
This time, put the clock forward 20 years.
Ask yourself: How many industries that are unknown today will exist then? If history is any
predictor of the future, the answer is many.
Companies have a huge capacity to create new
industries and re-create existing ones, a fact
that is reﬂected in the deep changes that have
been necessary in the way industries are classiﬁed. The half-century-old Standard Industrial
Classiﬁcation (SIC) system was replaced in 1997
by the North American Industry Classiﬁcation
System (NAICS). The new system expanded
the ten SIC industry sectors into 20 to reﬂect
the emerging realities of new industry territories—blue oceans. The services sector under
the old system, for example, is now seven sectors ranging from information to health care
and social assistance. Given that these classiﬁcation systems are designed for standardization
and continuity, such a replacement shows how
signiﬁcant a source of economic growth the
creation of blue oceans has been.
Looking forward, it seems clear to us that
blue oceans will remain the engine of growth.
Prospects in most established market spaces—
red oceans—are shrinking steadily. Technological advances have substantially improved industrial productivity, permitting suppliers to
produce an unprecedented array of products
and services. And as trade barriers between nations and regions fall and information on products and prices becomes instantly and globally
available, niche markets and monopoly havens
are continuing to disappear. At the same time,

page 72

<-----Page 72----->Blue Ocean Strategy

there is little evidence of any increase in demand, at least in the developed markets,
where recent United Nations statistics even
point to declining populations. The result is
that in more and more industries, supply is
overtaking demand.
This situation has inevitably hastened the
commoditization of products and services,
stoked price wars, and shrunk proﬁt margins.
According to recent studies, major American
brands in a variety of product and service categories have become more and more alike.
And as brands become more similar, people
increasingly base purchase choices on price.
People no longer insist, as in the past, that
their laundry detergent be Tide. Nor do they
necessarily stick to Colgate when there is a
special promotion for Crest, and vice versa. In
overcrowded
industries,
differentiating
brands becomes harder both in economic upturns and in downturns.

The Paradox of Strategy
Unfortunately, most companies seem becalmed in their red oceans. In a study of business launches in 108 companies, we found that
86% of those new ventures were line extensions—incremental improvements to existing
industry offerings—and a mere 14% were
aimed at creating new markets or industries.
While line extensions did account for 62% of
the total revenues, they delivered only 39% of
the total proﬁts. By contrast, the 14% invested
in creating new markets and industries delivered 38% of total revenues and a startling 61%
of total proﬁts.
So why the dramatic imbalance in favor of
red oceans? Part of the explanation is that corporate strategy is heavily inﬂuenced by its
roots in military strategy. The very language of
strategy is deeply imbued with military references—chief executive “ofﬁcers” in “headquar-

ters,” “troops” on the “front lines.” Described
this way, strategy is all about red ocean competition. It is about confronting an opponent and
driving him off a battleﬁeld of limited territory. Blue ocean strategy, by contrast, is about
doing business where there is no competitor. It
is about creating new land, not dividing up existing land. Focusing on the red ocean therefore means accepting the key constraining factors of war—limited terrain and the need to
beat an enemy to succeed. And it means denying the distinctive strength of the business
world—the capacity to create new market
space that is uncontested.
The tendency of corporate strategy to focus
on winning against rivals was exacerbated by
the meteoric rise of Japanese companies in the
1970s and 1980s. For the ﬁrst time in corporate
history, customers were deserting Western
companies in droves. As competition mounted
in the global marketplace, a slew of red ocean
strategies emerged, all arguing that competition was at the core of corporate success and
failure. Today, one hardly talks about strategy
without using the language of competition.
The term that best symbolizes this is “competitive advantage.” In the competitive-advantage
worldview, companies are often driven to outperform rivals and capture greater shares of existing market space.
Of course competition matters. But by focusing on competition, scholars, companies,
and consultants have ignored two very important—and, we would argue, far more lucrative—aspects of strategy: One is to ﬁnd and
develop markets where there is little or no
competition—blue oceans—and the other is
to exploit and protect blue oceans. These
challenges are very different from those to
which strategists have devoted most of their
attention.

Toward Blue Ocean Strategy

A Snapshot of Blue Ocean Creation
The table on the next page identiﬁes the
strategic elements that were common to
blue ocean creations in three different
industries in different eras. It is not intended to be comprehensive in coverage
or exhaustive in content. We chose to
show American industries because they

harvard business review • october 2004

represented the largest and leastregulated market during our study
period. The pattern of blue ocean
creations exempliﬁed by these three
industries is consistent with what
we observed in the other industries
in our study.

What kind of strategic logic is needed to guide
the creation of blue oceans? To answer that
question, we looked back over 100 years of
data on blue ocean creation to see what patterns could be discerned. Some of our data are
presented in the exhibit “A Snapshot of Blue
Ocean Creation.” It shows an overview of key
blue ocean creations in three industries that
closely touch people’s lives: autos—how people get to work; computers—what people use
at work; and movie theaters—where people

go after work for enjoyment. We found that:
Blue oceans are not about technology innovation. Leading-edge technology is sometimes
involved in the creation of blue oceans, but it
is not a deﬁning feature of them. This is often
true even in industries that are technology intensive. As the exhibit reveals, across all three
representative industries, blue oceans were
seldom the result of technological innovation
per se; the underlying technology was often
already in existence. Even Ford’s revolutionary
assembly line can be traced to the meatpacking industry in America. Like those within the
auto industry, the blue oceans within the computer industry did not come about through
technology innovations alone but by linking
technology to what buyers valued. As with the
IBM 650 and the Compaq PC server, this often
involved simplifying the technology.
Incumbents often create blue oceans—and
usually within their core businesses. GM, the
Japanese automakers, and Chrysler were established players when they created blue
oceans in the auto industry. So were CTR and
its later incarnation, IBM, and Compaq in the
computer industry. And in the cinema industry, the same can be said of palace theaters
and AMC. Of the companies listed here, only
Ford, Apple, Dell, and Nickelodeon were new
entrants in their industries; the ﬁrst three
were start-ups, and the fourth was an established player entering an industry that was
new to it. This suggests that incumbents are
not at a disadvantage in creating new market
spaces. Moreover, the blue oceans made by incumbents were usually within their core businesses. In fact, as the exhibit shows, most blue
oceans are created from within, not beyond,
red oceans of existing industries. This challenges the view that new markets are in distant waters. Blue oceans are right next to you
in every industry.
Company and industry are the wrong units
of analysis. The traditional units of strategic
analysis—company and industry—have little
explanatory power when it comes to analyzing how and why blue oceans are created.
There is no consistently excellent company;
the same company can be brilliant at one time
and wrongheaded at another. Every company
rises and falls over time. Likewise, there is no
perpetually excellent industry; relative attractiveness is driven largely by the creation of
blue oceans from within them.

harvard business review • october 2004

The most appropriate unit of analysis for explaining the creation of blue oceans is the strategic move—the set of managerial actions and
decisions involved in making a major marketcreating business offering. Compaq, for example, is considered by many people to be “unsuccessful” because it was acquired by HewlettPackard in 2001 and ceased to be a company.
But the ﬁrm’s ultimate fate does not invalidate
the smart strategic move Compaq made that led
to the creation of the multibillion-dollar market
in PC servers, a move that was a key cause of the
company’s powerful comeback in the 1990s.
Creating blue oceans builds brands. So powerful is blue ocean strategy that a blue ocean
strategic move can create brand equity that
lasts for decades. Almost all of the companies
listed in the exhibit are remembered in no
small part for the blue oceans they created
long ago. Very few people alive today were
around when the ﬁrst Model T rolled off
Henry Ford’s assembly line in 1908, but the
company’s brand still beneﬁts from that blue
ocean move. IBM, too, is often regarded as an
“American institution” largely for the blue
oceans it created in computing; the 360 series
was its equivalent of the Model T.
Our ﬁndings are encouraging for executives
at the large, established corporations that are
traditionally seen as the victims of new market
space creation. For what they reveal is that
large R&D budgets are not the key to creating
new market space. The key is making the right
strategic moves. What’s more, companies that
understand what drives a good strategic move
will be well placed to create multiple blue
oceans over time, thereby continuing to deliver high growth and proﬁts over a sustained
period. The creation of blue oceans, in other
words, is a product of strategy and as such is
very much a product of managerial action.

The Deﬁning Characteristics
Our research shows several common characteristics across strategic moves that create blue
oceans. We found that the creators of blue
oceans, in sharp contrast to companies playing
by traditional rules, never use the competition
as a benchmark. Instead they make it irrelevant by creating a leap in value for both buyers and the company itself. (The exhibit “Red
Ocean Versus Blue Ocean Strategy” compares
the chief characteristics of these two strategy
models.)

page 75

<-----Page 75----->Blue Ocean Strategy

Perhaps the most important feature of blue
ocean strategy is that it rejects the fundamental tenet of conventional strategy: that a tradeoff exists between value and cost. According to
this thesis, companies can either create greater
value for customers at a higher cost or create
reasonable value at a lower cost. In other
words, strategy is essentially a choice between
differentiation and low cost. But when it
comes to creating blue oceans, the evidence
shows that successful companies pursue differentiation and low cost simultaneously.
To see how this is done, let us go back to Cirque du Soleil. At the time of Cirque’s debut,
circuses focused on benchmarking one another and maximizing their shares of shrinking
demand by tweaking traditional circus acts.
This included trying to secure more and betterknown clowns and lion tamers, efforts that
raised circuses’ cost structure without substantially altering the circus experience. The result
was rising costs without rising revenues and a
downward spiral in overall circus demand.
Enter Cirque. Instead of following the conventional logic of outpacing the competition by offering a better solution to the given problem—
creating a circus with even greater fun and
thrills—it redeﬁned the problem itself by offering people the fun and thrill of the circus and
the intellectual sophistication and artistic richness of the theater.
In designing performances that landed both
these punches, Cirque had to reevaluate the
components of the traditional circus offering.
What the company found was that many of
the elements considered essential to the fun

The imperatives for red ocean and blue ocean
strategies are starkly different.

and thrill of the circus were unnecessary and
in many cases costly. For instance, most circuses offer animal acts. These are a heavy economic burden, because circuses have to shell
out not only for the animals but also for their
training, medical care, housing, insurance, and
transportation. Yet Cirque found that the appetite for animal shows was rapidly diminishing
because of rising public concern about the
treatment of circus animals and the ethics of
exhibiting them.
Similarly, although traditional circuses promoted their performers as stars, Cirque realized that the public no longer thought of circus
artists as stars, at least not in the movie star
sense. Cirque did away with traditional threering shows, too. Not only did these create confusion among spectators forced to switch their
attention from one ring to another, they also
increased the number of performers needed,
with obvious cost implications. And while aisle
concession sales appeared to be a good way to
generate revenue, the high prices discouraged
parents from making purchases and made
them feel they were being taken for a ride.
Cirque found that the lasting allure of the
traditional circus came down to just three factors: the clowns, the tent, and the classic acrobatic acts. So Cirque kept the clowns, while
shifting their humor away from slapstick to a
more enchanting, sophisticated style. It glamorized the tent, which many circuses had abandoned in favor of rented venues. Realizing that
the tent, more than anything else, captured
the magic of the circus, Cirque designed this
classic symbol with a glorious external ﬁnish
and a high level of audience comfort. Gone
were the sawdust and hard benches. Acrobats
and other thrilling performers were retained,
but Cirque reduced their roles and made their
acts more elegant by adding artistic ﬂair.
Even as Cirque stripped away some of the
traditional circus offerings, it injected new elements drawn from the world of theater. For
instance, unlike traditional circuses featuring
a series of unrelated acts, each Cirque creation resembles a theater performance in that
it has a theme and story line. Although the
themes are intentionally vague, they bring
harmony and an intellectual element to the
acts. Cirque also borrows ideas from Broadway. For example, rather than putting on the
traditional “once and for all” show, Cirque
mounts multiple productions based on differ-

page 76

<-----Page 76----->Blue Ocean Strategy

ent themes and story lines. As with Broadway
productions, too, each Cirque show has an
original musical score, which drives the performance, lighting, and timing of the acts,
rather than the other way around. The productions feature abstract and spiritual dance,
an idea derived from theater and ballet. By introducing these factors, Cirque has created
highly sophisticated entertainments. And by
staging multiple productions, Cirque gives
people reason to come to the circus more often, thereby increasing revenues.
Cirque offers the best of both circus and
theater. And by eliminating many of the most
expensive elements of the circus, it has been
able to dramatically reduce its cost structure,
achieving both differentiation and low cost.
(For a depiction of the economics underpinning blue ocean strategy, see the exhibit “The
Simultaneous Pursuit of Differentiation and

The Simultaneous Pursuit of Differentiation
and Low Cost
A blue ocean is created in the region
where a company’s actions favorably
affect both its cost structure and its
value proposition to buyers. Cost savings
are made from eliminating and reducing the factors an industry competes on.

Buyer value is lifted by raising and
creating elements the industry has
never offered. Over time, costs are reduced further as scale economies kick
in, due to the high sales volumes that
superior value generates.

Costs

Low Cost.”)
By driving down costs while simultaneously
driving up value for buyers, a company can
achieve a leap in value for both itself and its
customers. Since buyer value comes from the
utility and price a company offers, and a company generates value for itself through cost
structure and price, blue ocean strategy is
achieved only when the whole system of a
company’s utility, price, and cost activities is
properly aligned. It is this whole-system approach that makes the creation of blue oceans
a sustainable strategy. Blue ocean strategy integrates the range of a ﬁrm’s functional and operational activities.
A rejection of the trade-off between low cost
and differentiation implies a fundamental
change in strategic mind-set—we cannot emphasize enough how fundamental a shift it is.
The red ocean assumption that industry structural conditions are a given and ﬁrms are
forced to compete within them is based on an
intellectual worldview that academics call the
structuralist view, or environmental determinism. According to this view, companies and
managers are largely at the mercy of economic
forces greater than themselves. Blue ocean
strategies, by contrast, are based on a worldview in which market boundaries and industries can be reconstructed by the actions and
beliefs of industry players. We call this the reconstructionist view.
The founders of Cirque du Soleil clearly did
not feel constrained to act within the conﬁnes
of their industry. Indeed, is Cirque really a circus with all that it has eliminated, reduced,
raised, and created? Or is it theater? If it is theater, then what genre—Broadway show, opera,
ballet? The magic of Cirque was created
through a reconstruction of elements drawn
from all of these alternatives. In the end, Cirque is none of them and a little of all of them.
From within the red oceans of theater and circus, Cirque has created a blue ocean of uncontested market space that has, as yet, no name.

Barriers to Imitation
Companies that create blue oceans usually
reap the beneﬁts without credible challenges
for ten to 15 years, as was the case with Cirque
du Soleil, Home Depot, Federal Express,
Southwest Airlines, and CNN, to name just a
few. The reason is that blue ocean strategy creates considerable economic and cognitive bar-

page 77

<-----Page 77----->Blue Ocean Strategy

riers to imitation.
For a start, adopting a blue ocean creator’s
business model is easier to imagine than to
do. Because blue ocean creators immediately
attract customers in large volumes, they are
able to generate scale economies very rapidly,
putting would-be imitators at an immediate
and continuing cost disadvantage. The huge
economies of scale in purchasing that WalMart enjoys, for example, have signiﬁcantly
discouraged other companies from imitating
its business model. The immediate attraction
of large numbers of customers can also create
network externalities. The more customers
eBay has online, the more attractive the auction site becomes for both sellers and buyers
of wares, giving users few incentives to go
elsewhere.
When imitation requires companies to make
changes to their whole system of activities, organizational politics may impede a would-be
competitor’s ability to switch to the divergent
business model of a blue ocean strategy. For instance, airlines trying to follow Southwest’s example of offering the speed of air travel with
the ﬂexibility and cost of driving would have
faced major revisions in routing, training, marketing, and pricing, not to mention culture.
Few established airlines had the ﬂexibility to
make such extensive organizational and operating changes overnight. Imitating a wholesystem approach is not an easy feat.
The cognitive barriers can be just as effective. When a company offers a leap in value, it
rapidly earns brand buzz and a loyal following
in the marketplace. Experience shows that
even the most expensive marketing campaigns
struggle to unseat a blue ocean creator. Microsoft, for example, has been trying for more
than ten years to occupy the center of the blue
ocean that Intuit created with its ﬁnancial software product Quicken. Despite all of its efforts
and all of its investment, Microsoft has not
been able to unseat Intuit as the industry
leader.
In other situations, attempts to imitate a
blue ocean creator conﬂict with the imitator’s
existing brand image. The Body Shop, for example, shuns top models and makes no promises of eternal youth and beauty. For the established cosmetic brands like Estée Lauder and
L’Oréal, imitation was very difﬁcult, because it
would have signaled a complete invalidation of
their current images, which are based on

harvard business review • october 2004

promises of eternal youth and beauty.

A Consistent Pattern
While our conceptual articulation of the pattern may be new, blue ocean strategy has always existed, whether or not companies have
been conscious of the fact. Just consider the
striking parallels between the Cirque du Soleil
theater-circus experience and Ford’s creation
of the Model T.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the automobile industry was small and unattractive.
More than 500 automakers in America competed in turning out handmade luxury cars
that cost around $1,500 and were enormously
unpopular with all but the very rich. Anticar
activists tore up roads, ringed parked cars with
barbed wire, and organized boycotts of cardriving businessmen and politicians. Woodrow
Wilson caught the spirit of the times when he
said in 1906 that “nothing has spread socialistic
feeling more than the automobile.” He called it
“a picture of the arrogance of wealth.”
Instead of trying to beat the competition
and steal a share of existing demand from
other automakers, Ford reconstructed the industry boundaries of cars and horse-drawn carriages to create a blue ocean. At the time,
horse-drawn carriages were the primary means
of local transportation across America. The carriage had two distinct advantages over cars.
Horses could easily negotiate the bumps and
mud that stymied cars—especially in rain and
snow—on the nation’s ubiquitous dirt roads.
And horses and carriages were much easier to
maintain than the luxurious autos of the time,
which frequently broke down, requiring expert
repairmen who were expensive and in short
supply. It was Henry Ford’s understanding of
these advantages that showed him how he
could break away from the competition and
unlock enormous untapped demand.
Ford called the Model T the car “for the
great multitude, constructed of the best materials.” Like Cirque, the Ford Motor Company
made the competition irrelevant. Instead of
creating fashionable, customized cars for
weekends in the countryside, a luxury few
could justify, Ford built a car that, like the
horse-drawn carriage, was for everyday use.
The Model T came in just one color, black,
and there were few optional extras. It was reliable and durable, designed to travel effortlessly over dirt roads in rain, snow, or sun-

shine. It was easy to use and ﬁx. People could
learn to drive it in a day. And like Cirque, Ford
went outside the industry for a price point,
looking at horse-drawn carriages ($400), not
other autos. In 1908, the ﬁrst Model T cost
$850; in 1909, the price dropped to $609, and
by 1924 it was down to $290. In this way, Ford
converted buyers of horse-drawn carriages
into car buyers—just as Cirque turned theatergoers into circusgoers. Sales of the Model
T boomed. Ford’s market share surged from
9% in 1908 to 61% in 1921, and by 1923, a majority of American households had a car.
Even as Ford offered the mass of buyers a
leap in value, the company also achieved the
lowest cost structure in the industry, much as
Cirque did later. By keeping the cars highly
standardized with limited options and interchangeable parts, Ford was able to scrap the
prevailing manufacturing system in which cars
were constructed by skilled craftsmen who
swarmed around one workstation and built a
car piece by piece from start to ﬁnish. Ford’s
revolutionary assembly line replaced craftsmen with unskilled laborers, each of whom
worked quickly and efﬁciently on one small

task. This allowed Ford to make a car in just
four days—21 days was the industry norm—
creating huge cost savings.

Blue and red oceans have always coexisted and
always will. Practical reality, therefore, demands that companies understand the strategic logic of both types of oceans. At present,
competing in red oceans dominates the ﬁeld
of strategy in theory and in practice, even as
businesses’ need to create blue oceans intensiﬁes. It is time to even the scales in the ﬁeld of
strategy with a better balance of efforts across
both oceans. For although blue ocean strategists have always existed, for the most part
their strategies have been largely unconscious.
But once corporations realize that the strategies for creating and capturing blue oceans
have a different underlying logic from red
ocean strategies, they will be able to create
many more blue oceans in the future.

The authors provide recent examples of businesses that have created blue oceans and
present a framework for crafting blue-ocean
strategies: 1) Eliminate factors in your industry
that no longer have value. For example, winemaker Yellow Tail eliminated fancy terminology in its marketing communications. 2) Reduce factors that overserve customers and
increase cost structure for no gain. Yellow Tail
initially offered just two choices: red or white
wine. 3) Raise factors that remove compromises buyers must make. Yellow Tail priced its
wines above the budget category of wines
but below those deemed “premium.” 4) Create factors that add new sources of value. Yellow Tail provided ease of selection and the fun
and adventure of Australian branding. By late
2003, Yellow Tail had become the United
States’ best-selling red wine in a 750-ml bottle—outstripping all California labels.

The authors provide suggestions for creating
blue oceans within your existing business. 1)
Redefine your unit of business—what you
bill customers for—to reflect what customers
value. For example, Mexican cement company
Cemex shifted its unit of business from cubic
yards of cement to delivery window: the right
amount of concrete delivered when needed.
2) Boost your performance on key metrics.
Cemex reoriented its information systems, logistics, and delivery infrastructure to improve
truck utilization—a key metric for delivery
businesses. 3) Improve customers’ performance. UPS handles shipping and repair for
laptop makers—freeing these customers from
employing expensive maintenance staff, and
getting laptops back in owners’ hands quickly.
The service enhances laptop makers’ productivity and lowers their costs.

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

A brilliant strategy may put you on the
competitive map. But only solid execution
keeps you there. Unfortunately, most companies struggle with implementation.
That’s because they overrely on structural
changes, such as reorganization, to execute
their strategy.

The following levers matter most for successful strategy execution:

Though structural change has its place in
execution, it produces only short-term
gains. For example, one company reduced
its management layers as part of a strategy
to address disappointing performance.
Costs plummeted initially, but the layers
soon crept back in.
Research by Neilson, Martin, and Powers
shows that execution exemplars focus their
efforts on two levers far more powerful
than structural change:

COPYRIGHT © 2008 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

• Clarifying decision rights—for instance,
specifying who “owns” each decision and
who must provide input
• Ensuring information flows where it’s
needed—such as promoting managers
laterally so they build networks needed
for the cross-unit collaboration critical to
a new strategy
Tackle decision rights and information
flows first, and only then alter organizational structures and realign incentives to
support those moves.

DECISION RIGHTS
• Ensure that everyone in your company
knows which decisions and actions they’re
responsible for.
Example:
In one global consumer-goods company,
decisions made by divisional and geographic
leaders were overridden by corporate functional leaders who controlled resource allocations. Decisions stalled. Overhead costs
mounted as divisions added staff to create
bulletproof cases for challenging corporate
decisions. To support a new strategy hinging
on sharper customer focus, the CEO designated accountability for profits unambiguously to the divisions.
• Encourage higher-level managers to delegate operational decisions.
Example:
At one global charitable organization,
country-level managers’ inability to delegate led to decision paralysis. So the leadership team encouraged country managers
to delegate standard operational tasks.
This freed these managers to focus on developing the strategies needed to fulfill the
organization’s mission.
INFORMATION FLOW
• Make sure important information about the
competitive environment flows quickly to
corporate headquarters. That way, the top
team can identify patterns and promulgate
best practices throughout the company.
Example:
At one insurance company, accurate information about projects’ viability was
censored as it moved up the hierarchy. To
improve information flow to senior levels
of management, the company took steps
to create a more open, informal culture.

Top executives began mingling with unit
leaders during management meetings
and held regular brown-bag lunches
where people discussed the company’s
most pressing issues.
• Facilitate information flow across organizational boundaries.
Example:
To better manage relationships with
large, cross-product customers, a B2B
company needed its units to talk with
one another. It charged its newly created
customer-focused marketing group with
encouraging cross-company communication. The group issued regular reports
showing performance against targets (by
product and geography) and supplied
root-cause analyses of performance gaps.
Quarterly performance-management
meetings further fostered the trust required for collaboration.
• Help field and line employees understand
how their day-to-day choices affect your
company’s bottom line.
Example:
At a financial services firm, salespeople
routinely crafted customized one-off deals
with clients that cost the company more
than it made in revenues. Sales didn’t understand the cost and complexity implications of these transactions. Management
addressed the information misalignment
by adopting a “smart customization” approach to sales. For customized deals, it
established standardized back-office processes (such as risk assessment). It also developed analytical support tools to arm
salespeople with accurate information on
the cost implications of their proposed
transactions. Profitability improved.

A brilliant strategy, blockbuster product, or
breakthrough technology can put you on the
competitive map, but only solid execution can
keep you there. You have to be able to deliver
on your intent. Unfortunately, the majority of
companies aren’t very good at it, by their own
admission. Over the past ﬁve years, we have
invited many thousands of employees (about
25% of whom came from executive ranks) to
complete an online assessment of their organizations’ capabilities, a process that’s generated
a database of 125,000 proﬁles representing
more than 1,000 companies, government
agencies, and not-for-proﬁts in over 50 countries. Employees at three out of every ﬁve
companies rated their organization weak at
execution—that is, when asked if they agreed
with the statement “Important strategic and
operational decisions are quickly translated
into action,” the majority answered no.
Execution is the result of thousands of decisions made every day by employees acting
according to the information they have and
their own self-interest. In our work helping

harvard business review • june 2008

more than 250 companies learn to execute
more effectively, we’ve identiﬁed four fundamental building blocks executives can use to
inﬂuence those actions—clarifying decision
rights, designing information ﬂows, aligning
motivators, and making changes to structure. (For simplicity’s sake we refer to them
as decision rights, information, motivators,
and structure.)
In efforts to improve performance, most organizations go right to structural measures
because moving lines around the org chart
seems the most obvious solution and the
changes are visible and concrete. Such steps
generally reap some short-term efﬁciencies
quickly, but in so doing address only the
symptoms of dysfunction, not its root causes.
Several years later, companies usually end up
in the same place they started. Structural
change can and should be part of the path to
improved execution, but it’s best to think of it
as the capstone, not the cornerstone, of any
organizational transformation. In fact, our
research shows that actions having to do with

decision rights and information are far more
important—about twice as effective—as improvements made to the other two building
blocks. (See the exhibit “What Matters Most
to Strategy Execution.”)
Take, for example, the case of a global consumer packaged-goods company that lurched
down the reorganization path in the early
1990s. (We have altered identifying details
in this and other cases that follow.) Disappointed with company performance, senior
management did what most companies were
doing at that time: They restructured. They
eliminated some layers of management and
broadened spans of control. Managementstafﬁng costs quickly fell by 18%. Eight years
later, however, it was déjà vu. The layers had
crept back in, and spans of control had once
again narrowed. In addressing only structure,
management had attacked the visible symptoms of poor performance but not the underlying cause—how people made decisions and
how they were held accountable.
This time, management looked beyond lines
and boxes to the mechanics of how work got
done. Instead of searching for ways to strip out
costs, they focused on improving execution—
and in the process discovered the true reasons
for the performance shortfall. Managers didn’t
have a clear sense of their respective roles and
responsibilities. They did not intuitively understand which decisions were theirs to make.
Moreover, the link between performance and
rewards was weak. This was a company long
on micromanaging and second-guessing, and
short on accountability. Middle managers
spent 40% of their time justifying and reporting upward or questioning the tactical decisions of their direct reports.
Armed with this understanding, the company designed a new management model that
established who was accountable for what and
made the connection between performance
and reward. For instance, the norm at this
company, not unusual in the industry, had
been to promote people quickly, within 18
months to two years, before they had a chance
to see their initiatives through. As a result,
managers at every level kept doing their old
jobs even after they had been promoted, peering over the shoulders of the direct reports
who were now in charge of their projects and,
all too frequently, taking over. Today, people
stay in their positions longer so they can follow

through on their own initiatives, and they’re
still around when the fruits of their labors start
to kick in. What’s more, results from those initiatives continue to count in their performance
reviews for some time after they’ve been
promoted, forcing managers to live with the
expectations they’d set in their previous jobs.
As a consequence, forecasting has become
more accurate and reliable. These actions did
yield a structure with fewer layers and greater
spans of control, but that was a side effect,
not the primary focus, of the changes.

The Elements of Strong Execution
Our conclusions arise out of decades of practical application and intensive research. Nearly
ﬁve years ago, we and our colleagues set out to
gather empirical data to identify the actions
that were most effective in enabling an organization to implement strategy. What particular
ways of restructuring, motivating, improving
information ﬂows, and clarifying decision
rights mattered the most? We started by drawing up a list of 17 traits, each corresponding to
one or more of the four building blocks we
knew could enable effective execution—traits
like the free ﬂow of information across organizational boundaries or the degree to which
senior leaders refrain from getting involved
in operating decisions. With these factors in
mind, we developed an online proﬁler that
allows individuals to assess the execution
capabilities of their organizations. Over the
next four years or so, we collected data from
many thousands of proﬁles, which in turn
allowed us to more precisely calibrate the impact of each trait on an organization’s ability
to execute. That allowed us to rank all 17 traits
in order of their relative inﬂuence. (See the
exhibit “The 17 Fundamental Traits of Organizational Effectiveness.)
Ranking the traits makes clear how important decision rights and information are to effective strategy execution. The ﬁrst eight traits
map directly to decision rights and information. Only three of the 17 traits relate to structure, and none of those ranks higher than 13th.
We’ll walk through the top ﬁve traits here.
1. Everyone has a good idea of the decisions and actions for which he or she is responsible. In companies strong on execution,
71% of individuals agree with this statement;
that ﬁgure drops to 32% in organizations weak
on execution.

page 84

<-----Page 84----->The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution

Blurring of decision rights tends to occur as
a company matures. Young organizations are
generally too busy getting things done to deﬁne roles and responsibilities clearly at the
outset. And why should they? In a small company, it’s not so difﬁcult to know what other
people are up to. So for a time, things work
out well enough. As the company grows,
however, executives come and go, bringing
in with them and taking away different expectations, and over time the approval process
gets ever more convoluted and murky. It becomes increasingly unclear where one person’s
accountability begins and another’s ends.
One global consumer-durables company
found this out the hard way. It was so rife
with people making competing and conﬂicting decisions that it was hard to ﬁnd anyone
below the CEO who felt truly accountable for
proﬁtability. The company was organized into
16 product divisions aggregated into three
geographic groups—North America, Europe,
and International. Each of the divisions was
charged with reaching explicit performance
targets, but functional staff at corporate
headquarters controlled spending targets—
how R&D dollars were allocated, for instance. Decisions made by divisional and
geographic leaders were routinely overridden
by functional leaders. Overhead costs began
to mount as the divisions added staff to help
them create bulletproof cases to challenge
corporate decisions.
Decisions stalled while divisions negotiated with functions, each layer weighing in
with questions. Functional staffers in the

What Matters Most to Strategy Execution
When a company fails to execute its strategy, the ﬁrst thing managers often think
to do is restructure. But our research shows that the fundamentals of good execution start with clarifying decision rights and making sure information ﬂows
where it needs to go. If you get those right, the correct structure and motivators
often become obvious.

divisions (ﬁnancial analysts, for example)
often deferred to their higher-ups in corporate rather than their division vice president,
since functional leaders were responsible for
rewards and promotions. Only the CEO and
his executive team had the discretion to
resolve disputes. All of these symptoms fed
on one another and collectively hampered
execution—until a new CEO came in.
The new chief executive chose to focus
less on cost control and more on proﬁtable
growth by redeﬁning the divisions to focus on
consumers. As part of the new organizational
model, the CEO designated accountability for
proﬁts unambiguously to the divisions and
also gave them the authority to draw on functional activities to support their goals (as well
as more control of the budget). Corporate
functional roles and decision rights were recast to better support the divisions’ needs and
also to build the cross-divisional links necessary for developing the global capabilities of
the business as a whole. For the most part,
the functional leaders understood the market realities—and that change entailed some
adjustments to the operating model of the
business. It helped that the CEO brought
them into the organizational redesign process, so that the new model wasn’t something
imposed on them as much as it was something they engaged in and built together.
2. Important information about the competitive environment gets to headquarters
quickly. On average, 77% of individuals in
strong-execution organizations agree with
this statement, whereas only 45% of those
in weak-execution organizations do.
Headquarters can serve a powerful function in identifying patterns and promulgating
best practices throughout business segments
and geographic regions. But it can play this
coordinating role only if it has accurate and
up-to-date market intelligence. Otherwise, it
will tend to impose its own agenda and policies rather than defer to operations that are
much closer to the customer.
Consider the case of heavy-equipment manufacturer Caterpillar.1 Today it is a highly
successful $45 billion global company, but a
generation ago, Caterpillar’s organization was
so badly misaligned that its very existence was
threatened. Decision rights were hoarded at
the top by functional general ofﬁces located
at headquarters in Peoria, Illinois, while

About the Data
We tested organizational effectiveness by having people ﬁll out an online diagnostic, a tool comprising 19
questions (17 that describe organizational traits and two that describe
outcomes).
To determine which of the 17 traits
in our proﬁler are most strongly associated with excellence in execution,
we looked at 31 companies in our
database for which we had responses
from at least 150 individual (anonymously completed) proﬁles, for a total
of 26,743 responses. Applying regression analysis to each of the 31 data
sets, we correlated the 17 traits with
our measure of organizational effectiveness, which we deﬁned as an
afﬁrmative response to the outcome
statement, “Important strategic and
operational decisions are quickly
translated into action.” Then we
ranked the traits in order, according
to the number of data sets in which
the trait exhibited a signiﬁcant correlation with our measure of success
within a 90% conﬁdence interval.
Finally, we indexed the result to a
100-point scale. The top trait—
“Everyone has a good idea of the
decisions and actions for which he or
she is responsible”—exhibited a signiﬁcant positive correlation with our
success indicator in 25 of the 31 data
sets, for an index score of 81.

harvard business review • june 2008

much of the information needed to make
those decisions resided in the ﬁeld with sales
managers. “It just took a long time to get decisions going up and down the functional silos,
and they really weren’t good business decisions; they were more functional decisions,”
noted one ﬁeld executive. Current CEO Jim
Owens, then a managing director in Indonesia, told us that such information that did
make it to the top had been “whitewashed
and varnished several times over along the
way.” Cut off from information about the
external market, senior executives focused on
the organization’s internal workings, overanalyzing issues and second-guessing decisions
made at lower levels, costing the company
opportunities in fast-moving markets.
Pricing, for example, was based on cost and
determined not by market realities but by the
pricing general ofﬁce in Peoria. Sales representatives across the world lost sale after sale to
Komatsu, whose competitive pricing consistently beat Caterpillar’s. In 1982, the company
posted the ﬁrst annual loss in its almost-60year history. In 1983 and 1984, it lost $1 million
a day, seven days a week. By the end of 1984,
Caterpillar had lost a billion dollars. By 1988,
then-CEO George Schaefer stood atop an entrenched bureaucracy that was, in his words,
“telling me what I wanted to hear, not what I
needed to know.” So, he convened a task force
of “renegade” middle managers and tasked
them with charting Caterpillar’s future.
Ironically, the way to ensure that the right
information ﬂowed to headquarters was to
make sure the right decisions were made
much further down the organization. By delegating operational responsibility to the people closer to the action, top executives were
free to focus on more global strategic issues.
Accordingly, the company reorganized into
business units, making each accountable for
its own P&L statement. The functional general ofﬁces that had been all-powerful ceased
to exist, literally overnight. Their talent and
expertise, including engineering, pricing, and
manufacturing, were parceled out to the new
business units, which could now design their
own products, develop their own manufacturing processes and schedules, and set their own
prices. The move dramatically decentralized
decision rights, giving the units control over
market decisions. The business unit P&Ls were
now measured consistently across the enter-

prise, as return on assets became the universal measure of success. With this accurate,
up-to-date, and directly comparable information, senior decision makers at headquarters
could make smart strategic choices and tradeoffs rather than use outdated sales data to
make ineffective, tactical marketing decisions.
Within 18 months, the company was working in the new model. “This was a revolution
that became a renaissance,” Owens recalls, “a
spectacular transformation of a kind of sluggish company into one that actually has entrepreneurial zeal. And that transition was
very quick because it was decisive and it was
complete; it was thorough; it was universal,
worldwide, all at one time.”
3. Once made, decisions are rarely
second-guessed. Whether someone is secondguessing depends on your vantage point. A
more senior and broader enterprise perspective can add value to a decision, but managers
up the line may not be adding incremental
value; instead, they may be stalling progress
by redoing their subordinates’ jobs while, in
effect, shirking their own. In our research, 71%
of respondents in weak-execution companies
thought that decisions were being secondguessed, whereas only 45% of those from
strong-execution organizations felt that way.
Recently, we worked with a global charitable organization dedicated to alleviating poverty. It had a problem others might envy: It
was suffering from the strain brought on by a
rapid growth in donations and a corresponding increase in the depth and breadth of its
program offerings. As you might expect, this
nonproﬁt was populated with people on a
mission who took intense personal ownership
of projects. It did not reward the delegation of
even the most mundane administrative tasks.
Country-level managers, for example, would
personally oversee copier repairs. Managers’
inability to delegate led to decision paralysis
and a lack of accountability as the organization grew. Second-guessing was an art form.
When there was doubt over who was empowered to make a decision, the default was
often to have a series of meetings in which no
decision was reached. When decisions were
ﬁnally made, they had generally been vetted
by so many parties that no one person could
be held accountable. An effort to expedite
decision-making through restructuring—by
collocating key leaders with subject-matter

Second-guessing was an
art form: When decisions

experts in newly established central and
regional centers of excellence—became instead another logjam. Key managers still
weren’t sure of their right to take advantage
of these centers, so they didn’t.
The nonproﬁt’s management and directors
went back to the drawing board. We worked
with them to design a decision-making map, a
tool to help identify where different types of
decisions should be taken, and with it they
clariﬁed and enhanced decision rights at all
levels of management. All managers were
then actively encouraged to delegate standard
operational tasks. Once people had a clear
idea of what decisions they should and should
not be making, holding them accountable for
decisions felt fair. What’s more, now they
could focus their energies on the organization’s mission. Clarifying decision rights and
responsibilities also improved the organization’s ability to track individual achievement,
which helped it chart new and appealing
career-advancement paths.
4. Information ﬂows freely across organizational boundaries. When information does
not ﬂow horizontally across different parts of
the company, units behave like silos, forfeiting
economies of scale and the transfer of best
practices. Moreover, the organization as a
whole loses the opportunity to develop a cadre
of up-and-coming managers well versed in all
aspects of the company’s operations. Our research indicates that only 21% of respondents
from weak-execution companies thought information ﬂowed freely across organizational
boundaries whereas 55% of those from strongexecution ﬁrms did. Since scores for even the
strong companies are pretty low, though, this
is an issue that most companies can work on.
A cautionary tale comes from a businessto-business company whose customer and
product teams failed to collaborate in serving
a key segment: large, cross-product customers.
To manage relationships with important
clients, the company had established a
customer-focused marketing group, which
developed customer outreach programs, innovative pricing models, and tailored promotions and discounts. But this group issued no
clear and consistent reports of its initiatives
and progress to the product units and had
difﬁculty securing time with the regular crossunit management to discuss key performance
issues. Each product unit communicated and

planned in its own way, and it took tremendous energy for the customer group to understand the units’ various priorities and tailor
communications to each one. So the units
were not aware, and had little faith, that this
new division was making constructive inroads
into a key customer segment. Conversely (and
predictably), the customer team felt the units
paid only perfunctory attention to its plans
and couldn’t get their cooperation on issues
critical to multiproduct customers, such as
potential trade-offs and volume discounts.
Historically, this lack of collaboration hadn’t
been a problem because the company had
been the dominant player in a high-margin
market. But as the market became more competitive, customers began to view the ﬁrm as
unreliable and, generally, as a difﬁcult supplier,
and they became increasingly reluctant to
enter into favorable relationships.
Once the issues became clear, though, the
solution wasn’t terribly complicated, involving little more than getting the groups to talk
to one another. The customer division became responsible for issuing regular reports
to the product units showing performance
against targets, by product and geographic
region, and for supplying a supporting rootcause analysis. A standing performancemanagement meeting was placed on the
schedule every quarter, creating a forum for
exchanging information face-to-face and discussing outstanding issues. These moves bred
the broader organizational trust required
for collaboration.
5. Field and line employees usually have
the information they need to understand
the bottom-line impact of their day-to-day
choices. Rational decisions are necessarily
bounded by the information available to employees. If managers don’t understand what it
will cost to capture an incremental dollar in
revenue, they will always pursue the incremental revenue. They can hardly be faulted,
even if their decision is—in the light of full
information—wrong. Our research shows that
61% of individuals in strong-execution organizations agree that ﬁeld and line employees
have the information they need to understand
the bottom-line impact of their decisions. This
ﬁgure plummets to 28% in weak-execution
organizations.
We saw this unhealthy dynamic play out at
a large, diversiﬁed ﬁnancial-services client,

which had been built through a series of successful mergers of small regional banks. In
combining operations, managers had chosen
to separate front-ofﬁce bankers who sold
loans from back-ofﬁce support groups who
did risk assessments, placing each in a different reporting relationship and, in many cases,
in different locations. Unfortunately, they
failed to institute the necessary information
and motivation links to ensure smooth operations. As a result, each pursued different, and
often competing, goals.
For example, salespeople would routinely
enter into highly customized one-off deals
with clients that cost the company more than
they made in revenues. Sales did not have a
clear understanding of the cost and complexity
implications of these transactions. Without
sufﬁcient information, sales staff believed
that the back-end people were sabotaging
their deals, while the support groups considered the front-end people to be cowboys. At
year’s end, when the data were ﬁnally reconciled, management would bemoan the sharp
increase in operational costs, which often
erased the proﬁt from these transactions.
Executives addressed this information misalignment by adopting a “smart customization” approach to sales. They standardized
the end-to-end processes used in the majority
of deals and allowed for customization only
in select circumstances. For these customized
deals, they established clear back-ofﬁce processes and analytical support tools to arm
salespeople with accurate information on the
cost implications of the proposed transactions. At the same time, they rolled out common reporting standards and tools for both
the front- and back-ofﬁce operations to ensure
that each group had access to the same data
and metrics when making decisions. Once
each side understood the business realities
confronted by the other, they cooperated
more effectively, acting in the whole company’s best interests—and there were no
more year-end surprises.

Creating a Transformation Program
The four building blocks that managers can
use to improve strategy execution—decision
rights, information, structure, and motivators—
are inextricably linked. Unclear decision rights
not only paralyze decision making but also
impede information ﬂow, divorce perfor-

mance from rewards, and prompt workarounds that subvert formal reporting lines.
Blocking information results in poor decisions, limited career development, and a reinforcement of structural silos. So what to do
about it?
Since each organization is different and
faces a unique set of internal and external
variables, there is no universal answer to that
question. The ﬁrst step is to identify the
sources of the problem. In our work, we often
begin by having a company’s employees take
our proﬁling survey and consolidating the results. The more people in the organization
who take the survey, the better.
Once executives understand their company’s
areas of weakness, they can take any number
of actions. The exhibit, “Mapping Improvements to the Building Blocks: Some Sample
Tactics” shows 15 possible steps that can have
an impact on performance. (The options
listed represent only a sampling of the dozens
of choices managers might make.) All of these
actions are geared toward strengthening one
or more of the 17 traits. For example, if you
were to take steps to “clarify and streamline
decision making” you could potentially
strengthen two traits: “Everyone has a good
idea of the decisions and actions for which
he or she is responsible,” and “Once made, decisions are rarely second-guessed.”
You certainly wouldn’t want to put 15 initiatives in a single transformation program.
Most organizations don’t have the managerial
capacity or organizational appetite to take on
more than ﬁve or six at a time. And as we’ve
stressed, you should ﬁrst take steps to address
decision rights and information, and then
design the necessary changes to motivators
and structure to support the new design.
To help companies understand their shortcomings and construct the improvement program that will have the greatest impact,
we have developed an organizational-change
simulator. This interactive tool accompanies
the proﬁler, allowing you to try out different
elements of a change program virtually, to
see which ones will best target your company’s particular area of weakness. (For an
overview of the simulation process, see the
sidebar “Test Drive Your Organization’s
Transformation.”)

formulating your strategy, to launching your
organizational transformation—consider the
experience of a leading insurance company
we’ll call Goodward Insurance. Goodward
was a successful company with strong capital
reserves and steady revenue and customer
growth. Still, its leadership wanted to further
enhance execution to deliver on an ambitious
ﬁve-year strategic agenda that included aggressive targets in customer growth, revenue
increases, and cost reduction, which would require a new level of teamwork. While there
were pockets of cross-unit collaboration within
the company, it was far more common for each
unit to focus on its own goals, making it difﬁ-

Mapping Improvements to the Building
Blocks: Some Sample Tactics
Companies can take a host of steps to improve their ability to execute strategy. The
15 here are only some of the possible examples. Every one strengthens one or more
of the building blocks executives can use to improve their strategy-execution capability: clarifying decision rights, improving information, establishing the right motivators, and restructuring the organization.

Focus corporate staff on supporting
business-unit decision making.
Clarify and streamline decision making at each
operating level.
Focus headquarters on important strategic
questions.
Create centers of excellence by consolidating similar functions into a single organizational unit.
Assign process owners to coordinate
activities that span organizational functions.
Establish individual performance measures.
Improve field-to-headquarters information flow.
Define and distribute daily operating metrics to the
field or line.
Create cross-functional teams.
Introduce differentiating performance awards.
Expand nonmonetary rewards to recognize
exceptional performers.
Increase position tenure.
Institute lateral moves and rotations.
Broaden spans of control.

cult to spare resources to support another
unit’s goals. In many cases there was little incentive to do so anyway: Unit A’s goals might
require the involvement of Unit B to succeed,
but Unit B’s goals might not include supporting Unit A’s effort.
The company had initiated a number of enterprisewide projects over the years, which
had been completed on time and on budget,
but these often had to be reworked because
stakeholder needs hadn’t been sufﬁciently
taken into account. After launching a sharedservices center, for example, the company had
to revisit its operating model and processes
when units began hiring shadow staff to focus
on priority work that the center wouldn’t expedite. The center might decide what technology applications, for instance, to develop on
its own rather than set priorities according to
what was most important to the organization.
In a similar way, major product launches
were hindered by insufﬁcient coordination
among departments. The marketing department would develop new coverage options
without asking the claims-processing group
whether it had the ability to process the
claims. Since it didn’t, processors had to create expensive manual work-arounds when the
new kinds of claims started pouring in. Nor
did marketing ask the actuarial department
how these products would affect the risk proﬁle and reimbursement expenses of the company, and for some of the new products, costs
did indeed increase.
To identify the greatest barriers to building
a stronger execution culture, Goodward Insurance gave the diagnostic survey to all of its
7,000-plus employees and compared the organization’s scores on the 17 traits with those
from strong-execution companies. Numerous previous surveys (employee-satisfaction,
among others) had elicited qualitative comments identifying the barriers to execution
excellence. But the diagnostic survey gave
the company quantiﬁable data that it could
analyze by group and by management level
to determine which barriers were most hindering the people actually charged with
execution. As it turned out, middle management was far more pessimistic than the top
executives in their assessment of the organization’s execution ability. Their input became
especially critical to the change agenda ultimately adopted.

page 90

<-----Page 90----->The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution

Through the survey, Goodward Insurance
uncovered impediments to execution in three
of the most inﬂuential organizational traits:
• Information did not ﬂow freely across
organizational boundaries. Sharing information was never one of Goodward’s hallmarks, but managers had always dismissed
the mounting anecdotal evidence of poor
cross-divisional information ﬂow as “some
other group’s problem.” The organizational
diagnostic data, however, exposed such plausible deniability as an inadequate excuse. In
fact, when the CEO reviewed the proﬁler
results with his direct reports, he held up the
chart on cross-group information ﬂows and
declared, “We’ve been discussing this problem
for several years, and yet you always say that
it’s so-and-so’s problem, not mine. Sixty-seven

percent of [our] respondents said that they
do not think information ﬂows freely across
divisions. This is not so-and-so’s problem—it’s
our problem. You just don’t get results that
low [unless it comes] from everywhere. We
are all on the hook for ﬁxing this.”
Contributing to this lack of horizontal
information ﬂow was a dearth of lateral promotions. Because Goodward had always
promoted up rather than over and up, most
middle and senior managers remained within
a single group. They were not adequately
apprised of the activities of the other groups,
nor did they have a network of contacts across
the organization.
• Important information about the competitive environment did not get to headquarters quickly. The diagnostic data and

you could conceivably pull if you had unlimited time and resources. But you don’t. You

How, then, do you make the most-educated
and cost-efﬁcient decisions about which
change initiatives to implement? We’ve developed a way to test the efﬁcacy of speciﬁc
actions (such as clarifying decision rights,
forming cross-functional teams, or expanding
nonmonetary rewards) without risking signiﬁcant amounts of time and money. You can
go to www.simulator-orgeffectiveness.com
to assemble and try out various ﬁve-step
organizational-change programs and assess
which would be the most effective and efﬁcient in improving execution at your company.
You begin the simulation by selecting one
of seven organizational proﬁles that most
resembles the current state of your organization. If you’re not sure, you can take a ﬁveminute diagnostic survey. This online survey
automatically generates an organizational
proﬁle and baseline execution-effectiveness
score. (Although 100 is a perfect score, nobody is perfect; even the most effective companies often score in the 60s and 70s.)
Having established your baseline, you use
the simulator to chart a possible course you’d
like to take to improve your execution capabilities by selecting ﬁve out of a possible 28

actions. Ideally, these moves should directly
address the weakest links in your organizational proﬁle. To help you make the right
choices, the simulator offers insights that shed
further light on how a proposed action inﬂuences particular organizational elements.
Once you have made your selections, the
simulator executes the steps you’ve elected
and processes them through a web-based engine that evaluates them using empirical
relationships identiﬁed from 31 companies
representing more than 26,000 data observations. It then generates a bar chart indicating
how much your organization’s execution score
has improved and where it now stands in relation to the highest-performing companies
from our research and the scores of other people like you who have used the simulator starting from the same original proﬁle you did. If
you wish, you may then advance to the next

round and pick another ﬁve actions. What
you will see is illustrated below.
The beauty of the simulator is its ability to
consider—consequence-free—the impact on
execution of endless combinations of possible actions. Each simulation includes only
two rounds, but you can run the simulation
as many times as you like. The simulator
has also been used for team competition
within organizations, and we’ve found that
it engenders very engaging and productive
dialogue among senior executives.
While the simulator cannot capture all of
the unique situations an organization might
face, it is a useful tool for assessing and building a targeted and effective organizationtransformation program. It serves as a
vehicle to stimulate thinking about the impact of various changes, saving untold amounts
of time and resources in the process.

page 91

<-----Page 91----->The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution

subsequent surveys and interviews with middle management revealed that the wrong
information was moving up the org chart.
Mundane day-to-day decisions were escalated to the executive level—the top team
had to approve midlevel hiring decisions, for
instance, and bonuses of $1,000—limiting
Goodward’s agility in responding to competitors’ moves, customers’ needs, and changes in
the broader marketplace. Meanwhile, more
important information was so heavily ﬁltered
as it moved up the hierarchy that it was all
but worthless for rendering key verdicts. Even
if lower-level managers knew that a certain
project could never work for highly valid
reasons, they would not communicate that
dim view to the top team. Nonstarters not
only started, they kept going. For instance,
the company had a project under way to
create new incentives for its brokers. Even
though this approach had been previously
tried without success, no one spoke up in meetings or stopped the project because it was a
priority for one of the top-team members.
• No one had a good idea of the decisions
and actions for which he or she was responsible. The general lack of information ﬂow
extended to decision rights, as few managers
understood where their authority ended and
another’s began. Accountability even for dayto-day decisions was unclear, and managers
did not know whom to ask for clariﬁcation.
Naturally, confusion over decision rights
led to second-guessing. Fifty-ﬁve percent of
respondents felt that decisions were regularly
second-guessed at Goodward.
To Goodward’s credit, its top executives
immediately responded to the results of the
diagnostic by launching a change program
targeted at all three problem areas. The
program integrated early, often symbolic,
changes with longer-term initiatives, in an
effort to build momentum and galvanize participation and ownership. Recognizing that
a passive-aggressive attitude toward people
perceived to be in power solely as a result of
their position in the hierarchy was hindering
information ﬂow, they took immediate steps
to signal their intention to create a more
informal and open culture. One symbolic
change: the seating at management meetings
was rearranged. The top executives used to sit
in a separate section, the physical space
between them and the rest of the room

harvard business review • june 2008

fraught with symbolism. Now they intermingled, making themselves more accessible and
encouraging people to share information
informally. Regular brown-bag lunches were
established with members of the C-suite, where
people had a chance to discuss the overall
culture-change initiative, decision rights, new
mechanisms for communicating across the
units, and so forth. Seating at these events
was highly choreographed to ensure that a
mix of units was represented at each table.
Icebreaker activities were designed to encourage individuals to learn about other units’
work.
Meanwhile, senior managers commenced
the real work of remedying issues relating to
information ﬂows and decision rights. They
assessed their own informal networks to
understand how people making key decisions
got their information, and they identiﬁed critical gaps. The outcome was a new framework
for making important decisions that clearly
speciﬁes who owns each decision, who must
provide input, who is ultimately accountable
for the results, and how results are deﬁned.
Other longer-term initiatives include:
• Pushing certain decisions down into the
organization to better align decision rights
with the best available information. Most
hiring and bonus decisions, for instance,
have been delegated to immediate managers,
so long as they are within preestablished
boundaries relating to numbers hired and
salary levels. Being clear about who needs
what information is encouraging cross-group
dialogue.
• Identifying and eliminating duplicative
committees.
• Pushing metrics and scorecards down to
the group level, so that rather than focus on
solving the mystery of who caused a problem,
management can get right to the root cause of
why the problem occurred. A well-designed
scorecard captures not only outcomes (like
sales volume or revenue) but also leading
indicators of those outcomes (such as the
number of customer calls or completed
customer plans). As a result, the focus of management conversations has shifted from trying
to explain the past to charting the future—
anticipating and preventing problems.
• Making the planning process more inclusive. Groups are explicitly mapping out the
ways their initiatives depend on and affect

page 92

<-----Page 92----->The Secrets to Successful Strategy Execution

one another; shared group goals are assigned
accordingly.
• Enhancing the middle management career path to emphasize the importance of
lateral moves to career advancement.
Goodward Insurance has just embarked on
this journey. The insurer has distributed ownership of these initiatives among various
groups and management levels so that these
efforts don’t become silos in themselves.
Already, solid improvement in the company’s
execution is beginning to emerge. The early
evidence of success has come from employeesatisfaction surveys: Middle management
responses to the questions about levels of
cross-unit collaboration and clarity of decision
making have improved as much as 20 to 25
percentage points. And high performers are
already reaching across boundaries to gain a
broader understanding of the full business,
even if it doesn’t mean a better title right
away.

•••
Execution is a notorious and perennial challenge. Even at the companies that are best at
it—what we call “resilient organizations”—

harvard business review • june 2008

just two-thirds of employees agree that important strategic and operational decisions are
quickly translated into action. As long as companies continue to attack their execution
problems primarily or solely with structural or
motivational initiatives, they will continue to
fail. As we’ve seen, they may enjoy short-term
results, but they will inevitably slip back into
old habits because they won’t have addressed
the root causes of failure. Such failures can
almost always be ﬁxed by ensuring that people
truly understand what they are responsible for
and who makes which decisions—and then
giving them the information they need to
fulﬁll their responsibilities. With these two
building blocks in place, structural and motivational elements will follow.

Build Execution into Strategy

It’s hard to balance pressing operational concerns with long-term strategic priorities. But
balance is critical: World-class processes won’t
produce success without the right strategic
direction, and the best strategy won’t get anywhere without strong operations to execute
it. To manage both strategy and operations,
companies must take five steps: 1) Develop
strategy, based on the company’s mission and
values and its strengths, weaknesses, and
competitive environment. 2) Translate the
strategy into objectives and initiatives linked
to performance metrics. 3) Create an operational plan to accomplish the objectives and
initiatives. 4) Put the plan into action, monitoring its effectiveness. 5) Test the strategy by
analyzing cost, profitability, and correlations
between strategy and performance. Update
as necessary.

The authors identify an additional lever essential for strategy execution: the alignment of
people behind a strategy. Incentives don’t in
themselves create alignment. You also need a
culture of trust and commitment. This chapter,
from Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant, shows how to build such a
culture, particularly by establishing fair strategyformulation processes. When people perceive
a process as fair, they go beyond the call of
duty and take initiative in executing the
strategy. To create a fair strategy-formulation
process: 1) Involve people in the strategic decisions that affect them, by asking for their
input. 2) Explain why final strategic decisions
were made. 3) Clearly state the new behaviors
you expect from people and what will happen
if they fail to fulfill them.

Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic
Management System
The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

Why do budgets often bear little direct
relation to a company’s long-term strategic
objectives? Because they don’t take
enough into consideration. A balanced
scorecard augments traditional financial
measures with benchmarks for performance in three key nonfinancial areas:

The balanced scorecard relies on four processes
to bind short-term activities to long-term
objectives:

• a company’s relationship with its
customers
• its key internal processes
• its learning and growth.

When performance measures for these
areas are added to the financial metrics, the
result is not only a broader perspective on
the company’s health and activities, it’s also
a powerful organizing framework. A sophisticated instrument panel for coordinating
and fine-tuning a company’s operations
and businesses so that all activities are
aligned with its strategy.

identify the most influential “drivers” of the
desired outcomes and then set milestones
for gauging the progress they make with
these drivers.

1. TRANSLATING THE VISION.
By relying on measurement, the scorecard
forces managers to come to agreement on
the metrics they will use to operationalize
their lofty visions.
Example:
A bank had articulated its strategy as providing “superior service to targeted customers.” But the process of choosing operational
measures for the four areas of the scorecard
made executives realize that they first
needed to reconcile divergent views of
who the targeted customers were and
what constituted superior service.
2. COMMUNICATING AND LINKING.

4. FEEDBACK AND LEARNING.
By supplying a mechanism for strategic feedback and review, the balanced scorecard
helps an organization foster a kind of learning
often missing in companies: the ability to reflect on inferences and adjust theories about
cause-and-effect relationships.
Feedback about products and services. New
learning about key internal processes. Technological discoveries. All this information can
be fed into the scorecard, enabling strategic
refinements to be made continually. Thus, at
any point in the implementation, managers
can know whether the strategy is working—
and if not, why.

When a scorecard is disseminated up and
down the organizational chart, strategy becomes a tool available to everyone. As the
high-level scorecard cascades down to individual business units, overarching strategic
objectives and measures are translated into
objectives and measures appropriate to
each particular group. Tying these targets to
individual performance and compensation
systems yields “personal scorecards.” Thus,
individual employees understand how their
own productivity supports the overall strategy.
3. BUSINESS PLANNING.
Most companies have separate procedures
(and sometimes units) for strategic planning
and budgeting. Little wonder, then, that typical long-term planning is, in the words of one
executive, where “the rubber meets the sky.”
The discipline of creating a balanced scorecard forces companies to integrate the two
functions, thereby ensuring that financial
budgets do indeed support strategic goals.
After agreeing on performance measures for
the four scorecard perspectives, companies

by Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton

Editor’s Note: In 1992, Robert S. Kaplan and
David P. Norton’s concept of the balanced scorecard revolutionized conventional thinking about
performance metrics. By going beyond traditional measures of ﬁnancial performance, the
concept has given a generation of managers a
better understanding of how their companies are
really doing.
These nonﬁnancial metrics are so valuable
mainly because they predict future ﬁnancial
performance rather than simply report what’s
already happened. This article, ﬁrst published in
1996, describes how the balanced scorecard can
help senior managers systematically link current
actions with tomorrow’s goals, focusing on that
place where, in the words of the authors, “the
rubber meets the sky.”

As companies around the world transform
themselves for competition that is based on
information, their ability to exploit intangible assets has become far more decisive
than their ability to invest in and manage
physical assets. Several years ago, in recogni-

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

tion of this change, we introduced a concept
we called the balanced scorecard. The balanced scorecard supplemented traditional
ﬁnancial measures with criteria that measured performance from three additional
perspectives—those of customers, internal
business processes, and learning and growth.
(See the exhibit “Translating Vision and
Strategy: Four Perspectives.”) It therefore enabled companies to track ﬁnancial results
while simultaneously monitoring progress
in building the capabilities and acquiring
the intangible assets they would need for
future growth. The scorecard wasn’t a replacement for ﬁnancial measures; it was
their complement.
Recently, we have seen some companies
move beyond our early vision for the scorecard to discover its value as the cornerstone
of a new strategic management system. Used
this way, the scorecard addresses a serious
deﬁciency in traditional management systems:
their inability to link a company’s long-term
strategy with its short-term actions.

Robert S. Kaplan is the Marvin Bower
Professor of Leadership Development
at Harvard Business School, in Boston,
and the chairman and a cofounder
of Balanced Scorecard Collaborative,
in Lincoln, Massachusetts. David P.
Norton is the CEO and a cofounder of
Balanced Scorecard Collaborative. They
are the coauthors of four books about
the balanced scorecard, the most recent of which is Alignment: Using the
Balanced Scorecard to Create Corporate
Synergies (Harvard Business School
Publishing, 2006).

Most companies’ operational and management control systems are built around ﬁnancial measures and targets, which bear
little relation to the company’s progress in
achieving long-term strategic objectives.
Thus the emphasis most companies place
on short-term ﬁnancial measures leaves a
gap between the development of a strategy
and its implementation.
Managers using the balanced scorecard do
not have to rely on short-term ﬁnancial measures as the sole indicators of the company’s
performance. The scorecard lets them introduce four new management processes that,
separately and in combination, contribute to
linking long-term strategic objectives with
short-term actions. (See the exhibit “Managing Strategy: Four Processes.”)
The ﬁrst new process—translating the vision—
helps managers build a consensus around
the organization’s vision and strategy. Despite the best intentions of those at the top,
lofty statements about becoming “best in
class,” “the number one supplier,” or an “empowered organization” don’t translate easily
into operational terms that provide useful
guides to action at the local level. For people
to act on the words in vision and strategy
statements, those statements must be expressed
as an integrated set of objectives and measures, agreed upon by all senior executives,
that describe the long-term drivers of success.
The second process—communicating and
linking—lets managers communicate their
strategy up and down the organization and
link it to departmental and individual objectives. Traditionally, departments are evaluated
by their ﬁnancial performance, and individual
incentives are tied to short-term ﬁnancial
goals. The scorecard gives managers a way of
ensuring that all levels of the organization understand the long-term strategy and that both
departmental and individual objectives are
aligned with it.
The third process—business planning—
enables companies to integrate their business
and ﬁnancial plans. Almost all organizations
today are implementing a variety of change
programs, each with its own champions,
gurus, and consultants, and each competing for
senior executives’ time, energy, and resources.
Managers ﬁnd it difﬁcult to integrate those
diverse initiatives to achieve their strategic
goals—a situation that leads to frequent disap-

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

pointments with the programs’ results. But
when managers use the ambitious goals set
for balanced scorecard measures as the basis
for allocating resources and setting priorities,
they can undertake and coordinate only those
initiatives that move them toward their longterm strategic objectives.
The fourth process—feedback and learning—
gives companies the capacity for what we
call strategic learning. Existing feedback and
review processes focus on whether the company, its departments, or its individual employees have met their budgeted ﬁnancial
goals. With the balanced scorecard at the
center of its management systems, a company
can monitor short-term results from the three
additional perspectives—customers, internal
business processes, and learning and growth—
and evaluate strategy in the light of recent
performance. The scorecard thus enables
companies to modify strategies to reﬂect
real-time learning.
None of the more than 100 organizations
that we have studied or with which we have
worked implemented their ﬁrst balanced
scorecard with the intention of developing a
new strategic management system. But in
each one, the senior executives discovered
that the scorecard supplied a framework and
thus a focus for many critical management
processes: departmental and individual goal
setting, business planning, capital allocations,
strategic initiatives, and feedback and learning. Previously, those processes were uncoordinated and often directed at short-term
operational goals. By building the scorecard,
the senior executives started a process of
change that has gone well beyond the original idea of simply broadening the company’s
performance measures.
For example, one insurance company—let’s
call it National Insurance—developed its ﬁrst
balanced scorecard to create a new vision for itself as an underwriting specialist. But once National started to use it, the scorecard allowed
the CEO and the senior management team not
only to introduce a new strategy for the organization but also to overhaul the company’s
management system. The CEO subsequently
told employees in a letter addressed to the
whole organization that National would
thenceforth use the balanced scorecard and
the philosophy that it represented to manage
the business.

National built its new strategic management
system step-by-step over 30 months, with each
step representing an incremental improvement. (See the exhibit “How One Company
Built a Strategic Management System…”) The
iterative sequence of actions enabled the
company to reconsider each of the four new
management processes two or three times
before the system stabilized and became
an established part of National’s overall management system. Thus the CEO was able to
transform the company so that everyone
could focus on achieving long-term strategic
objectives—something that no purely ﬁnancial
framework could do.

Translating the Vision
The CEO of an engineering construction
company, after working with his senior management team for several months to develop
a mission statement, got a phone call from a
project manager in the ﬁeld. “I want you to
know,” the distraught manager said, “that I
believe in the mission statement. I want to
act in accordance with the mission state-

ment. I’m here with my customer. What am
I supposed to do?”
The mission statement, like those of many
other organizations, had declared an intention
to “use high-quality employees to provide
services that surpass customers’ needs.” But
the project manager in the ﬁeld with his employees and his customer did not know how
to translate those words into the appropriate
actions. The phone call convinced the CEO
that a large gap existed between the mission
statement and employees’ knowledge of how
their day-to-day actions could contribute to realizing the company’s vision.
Metro Bank (not its real name), the result of
a merger of two competitors, encountered a
similar gap while building its balanced scorecard. The senior executive group thought it
had reached agreement on the new organization’s overall strategy: “to provide superior
service to targeted customers.” Research had
revealed ﬁve basic market segments among
existing and potential customers, each with
different needs. While formulating the measures for the customer-perspective portion

<-----Page 100----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

of their balanced scorecard, however, it became apparent that although the 25 senior
executives agreed on the words of the strategy, each one had a different deﬁnition of
superior service and a different image of
the targeted customers.
The exercise of developing operational
measures for the four perspectives on the
bank’s scorecard forced the 25 executives to
clarify the meaning of the strategy statement. Ultimately, they agreed to stimulate
revenue growth through new products and
services and also agreed on the three most
desirable customer segments. They developed scorecard measures for the speciﬁc
products and services that should be delivered to customers in the targeted segments
as well as for the relationship the bank
should build with customers in each segment. The scorecard also highlighted gaps
in employees’ skills and in information systems that the bank would have to close in
order to deliver the selected value propositions to the targeted customers. Thus, creating a balanced scorecard forced the bank’s

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

senior managers to arrive at a consensus and
then to translate their vision into terms that
had meaning to the people who would realize the vision.

Communicating and Linking
“The top ten people in the business now understand the strategy better than ever before.
It’s too bad,” a senior executive of a major oil
company complained, “that we can’t put this
in a bottle so that everyone could share it.”
With the balanced scorecard, he can.
One company we have worked with deliberately involved three layers of management
in the creation of its balanced scorecard.
The senior executive group formulated the
ﬁnancial and customer objectives. It then
mobilized the talent and information in the
next two levels of managers by having them
formulate the internal-business-process
and learning-and-growth objectives that
would drive the achievement of the ﬁnancial
and customer goals. For example, knowing
the importance of satisfying customers’ expectations of on-time delivery, the broader

page 101

<-----Page 101----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

group identiﬁed several internal business
processes—such as order processing, scheduling, and fulﬁllment—in which the company had to excel. To do so, the company
would have to retrain frontline employees
and improve the information systems available to them. The group developed performance measures for those critical processes
and for staff and systems capabilities.
Broad participation in creating a scorecard
takes longer, but it offers several advantages:
Information from a larger number of managers is incorporated into the internal objectives;
the managers gain a better understanding of
the company’s long-term strategic goals; and
such broad participation builds a stronger
commitment to achieving those goals. But
getting managers to buy into the scorecard is
only a ﬁrst step in linking individual actions to
corporate goals.
The balanced scorecard signals to everyone
what the organization is trying to achieve for
shareholders and customers alike. But to
align employees’ individual performances
with the overall strategy, scorecard users generally engage in three activities: communicat-

ing and educating, setting goals, and linking
rewards to performance measures.
Communicating and educating. Implementing a strategy begins with educating those
who have to execute it. Whereas some organizations opt to hold their strategy close to
the vest, most believe that they should disseminate it from top to bottom. A broad-based
communication program shares with all
employees the strategy and the critical objectives they have to meet if the strategy is to
succeed. Onetime events such as the distribution of brochures or newsletters and the
holding of “town meetings” might kick off the
program. Some organizations post bulletin
boards that illustrate and explain the balanced
scorecard measures, then update them with
monthly results. Others use groupware and
electronic bulletin boards to distribute the
scorecard to the desktops of all employees
and to encourage dialogue about the measures. The same media allow employees to
make suggestions for achieving or exceeding
the targets.
The balanced scorecard, as the embodiment
of business unit strategy, should also be com-

...Around the Balanced Scorecard

municated upward in the organization—to
corporate headquarters and to the corporate
board of directors. With the scorecard, business
units can quantify and communicate their
long-term strategies to senior executives using
a comprehensive set of linked ﬁnancial and
nonﬁnancial measures. Such communication
informs the executives and the board in speciﬁc terms that long-term strategies designed
for competitive success are in place. The measures also provide the basis for feedback and
accountability. Meeting short-term ﬁnancial
targets should not constitute satisfactory performance when other measures indicate that
the long-term strategy is either not working or
not being implemented well.
Should the balanced scorecard be communicated beyond the boardroom to external shareholders? We believe that as senior executives
gain conﬁdence in the ability of the scorecard
measures to monitor strategic performance
and predict future ﬁnancial performance, they
will ﬁnd ways to inform outside investors
about those measures without disclosing competitively sensitive information.
Skandia, an insurance and ﬁnancial services
company based in Sweden, issues a supplement to its annual report called “The Business Navigator”—“an instrument to help
us navigate into the future and thereby
stimulate renewal and development.” The
supplement describes Skandia’s strategy and
the strategic measures the company uses to
communicate and evaluate the strategy. It
also provides a report on the company’s performance along those measures during the
year. The measures are customized for each
operating unit and include, for example,
market share, customer satisfaction and retention, employee competence, employee
empowerment, and technology deployment.
Communicating the balanced scorecard
promotes commitment and accountability to
the business’s long-term strategy. As one executive at Metro Bank declared, “The balanced
scorecard is both motivating and obligating.”
Setting goals. Mere awareness of corporate
goals, however, is not enough to change many
people’s behavior. Somehow, the organization’s high-level strategic objectives and measures must be translated into objectives and
measures for operating units and individuals.
The exploration group of a large oil company developed a technique to enable and

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

encourage individuals to set goals for themselves that were consistent with the organization’s. It created a small, fold-up, personal
scorecard that people could carry in their
shirt pockets or wallets. (See the exhibit “The
Personal Scorecard.”) The scorecard contains
three levels of information. The ﬁrst describes corporate objectives, measures, and
targets. The second leaves room for translating
corporate targets into targets for each business unit. For the third level, the company
asks both individuals and teams to articulate
which of their own objectives would be consistent with the business unit and corporate
objectives, as well as what initiatives they
would take to achieve their objectives. It also
asks them to deﬁne up to ﬁve performance
measures for their objectives and to set targets
for each measure. The personal scorecard
helps to communicate corporate and business unit objectives to the people and teams
performing the work, enabling them to
translate the objectives into meaningful tasks
and targets for themselves. It also lets them
keep that information close at hand—in
their pockets.
Linking rewards to performance measures.
Should compensation systems be linked to
balanced scorecard measures? Some companies, believing that tying ﬁnancial compensation to performance is a powerful lever, have
moved quickly to establish such a linkage.
For example, an oil company that we’ll call
Pioneer Petroleum uses its scorecard as the
sole basis for computing incentive compensation. The company ties 60% of its executives’
bonuses to their achievement of ambitious
targets for a weighted average of four ﬁnancial
indicators: return on capital, proﬁtability,
cash ﬂow, and operating cost. It bases the
remaining 40% on indicators of customer
satisfaction, dealer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and environmental responsibility
(such as a percentage change in the level of
emissions to water and air). Pioneer’s CEO
says that linking compensation to the scorecard has helped to align the company with
its strategy. “I know of no competitor,” he
says, “who has this degree of alignment. It is
producing results for us.”
As attractive and as powerful as such linkage
is, it nonetheless carries risks. For instance,
does the company have the right measures on
the scorecard? Does it have valid and reliable

page 103

<-----Page 103----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

data for the selected measures? Could unintended or unexpected consequences arise from
the way the targets for the measures are
achieved? Those are questions that companies
should ask.
Furthermore, companies traditionally handle multiple objectives in a compensation
formula by assigning weights to each objective and calculating incentive compensation
by the extent to which each weighted objective was achieved. This practice permits substantial incentive compensation to be paid if
the business unit overachieves on a few objectives even if it falls far short on others. A better approach would be to establish minimum
threshold levels for a critical subset of the
strategic measures. Individuals would earn
no incentive compensation if performance in
a given period fell short of any threshold.
This requirement should motivate people to
achieve a more balanced performance across
short- and long-term objectives.
Some organizations, however, have reduced
their emphasis on short-term, formula-based
incentive systems as a result of introducing the

balanced scorecard. They have discovered that
dialogue among executives and managers
about the scorecard—both the formulation of
the measures and objectives and the explanation of actual versus targeted results—provides
a better opportunity to observe managers’
performance and abilities. Increased knowledge of their managers’ abilities makes it
easier for executives to set incentive rewards
subjectively and to defend those subjective
evaluations—a process that is less susceptible
to the game playing and distortions associated
with explicit, formula-based rules.
One company we have studied takes an
intermediate position. It bases bonuses for
business unit managers on two equally
weighted criteria: their achievement of a
ﬁnancial objective—economic value added—
over a three-year period and a subjective
assessment of their performance on measures
drawn from the customer, internal-businessprocess, and learning-and-growth perspectives
of the balanced scorecard.
That the balanced scorecard has a role to
play in the determination of incentive com-

page 104

<-----Page 104----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

pensation is not in doubt. Precisely what that
role should be will become clearer as more
companies experiment with linking rewards to
scorecard measures.

Business Planning
“Where the rubber meets the sky”: That’s
how one senior executive describes his
company’s long-range-planning process. He
might have said the same of many other
companies because their ﬁnancially based
management systems fail to link change programs and resource allocation to long-term
strategic priorities.
The problem is that most organizations
have separate procedures and organizational
units for strategic planning and for resource
allocation and budgeting. To formulate their
strategic plans, senior executives go off-site
annually and engage for several days in
active discussions facilitated by senior planning and development managers or external
consultants. The outcome of this exercise is a
strategic plan articulating where the company expects (or hopes or prays) to be in
three, ﬁve, and ten years. Typically, such
plans then sit on executives’ bookshelves for
the next 12 months.
Meanwhile, a separate resource-allocation
and budgeting process run by the ﬁnance
staff sets ﬁnancial targets for revenues, expenses, proﬁts, and investments for the next
ﬁscal year. The budget it produces consists
almost entirely of ﬁnancial numbers that
generally bear little relation to the targets in
the strategic plan.
Which document do corporate managers
discuss in their monthly and quarterly meetings during the following year? Usually only
the budget, because the periodic reviews
focus on a comparison of actual and budgeted
results for every line item. When is the strategic plan next discussed? Probably during the
next annual off-site meeting, when the senior
managers draw up a new set of three-, ﬁve-,
and ten-year plans.
The very exercise of creating a balanced
scorecard forces companies to integrate their
strategic planning and budgeting processes
and therefore helps to ensure that their budgets support their strategies. Scorecard users
select measures of progress from all four
scorecard perspectives and set targets for each
of them. Then they determine which actions

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

will drive them toward their targets, identify
the measures they will apply to those drivers
from the four perspectives, and establish the
short-term milestones that will mark their
progress along the strategic paths they have
selected. Building a scorecard thus enables a
company to link its ﬁnancial budgets with its
strategic goals.
For example, one division of the Style Company (not its real name) committed to achieving a seemingly impossible goal articulated
by the CEO: to double revenues in ﬁve years.
The forecasts built into the organization’s
existing strategic plan fell $1 billion short of
this objective. The division’s managers, after
considering various scenarios, agreed to
speciﬁc increases in ﬁve different performance
drivers: the number of new stores opened,
the number of new customers attracted into
new and existing stores, the percentage of
shoppers in each store converted into actual
purchasers, the portion of existing customers
retained, and average sales per customer.
By helping to deﬁne the key drivers of revenue growth and by committing to targets
for each of them, the division’s managers
eventually grew comfortable with the CEO’s
ambitious goal.
The process of building a balanced scorecard—
clarifying the strategic objectives and then
identifying the few critical drivers—also
creates a framework for managing an organization’s various change programs. These
initiatives—reengineering, employee empowerment, time-based management, and total
quality management, among others—promise
to deliver results but also compete with one
another for scarce resources, including the
scarcest resource of all: senior managers’ time
and attention.
Shortly after the merger that created it,
Metro Bank, for example, launched more
than 70 different initiatives. The initiatives
were intended to produce a more competitive
and successful institution, but they were inadequately integrated into the overall strategy.
After building their balanced scorecard,
Metro Bank’s managers dropped many of
those programs—such as a marketing effort
directed at individuals with very high net
worth—and consolidated others into initiatives that were better aligned with the company’s strategic objectives. For example, the
managers replaced a program aimed at en-

page 105

<-----Page 105----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

hancing existing low-level selling skills with
a major initiative aimed at retraining salespersons to become trusted ﬁnancial advisers,
capable of selling a broad range of newly
introduced products to the three selected
customer segments. The bank made both
changes because the scorecard enabled it to
gain a better understanding of the programs
required to achieve its strategic objectives.
Once the strategy is deﬁned and the drivers
are identiﬁed, the scorecard inﬂuences managers to concentrate on improving or reengineering those processes most critical to the
organization’s strategic success. That is how
the scorecard most clearly links and aligns
action with strategy.
The ﬁnal step in linking strategy to actions
is to establish speciﬁc short-term targets, or
milestones, for the balanced scorecard measures. Milestones are tangible expressions of
managers’ beliefs about when and to what
degree their current programs will affect
those measures.
In establishing milestones, managers are
expanding the traditional budgeting process
to incorporate strategic as well as ﬁnancial
goals. Detailed ﬁnancial planning remains
important, but ﬁnancial goals taken by
themselves ignore the three other balanced
scorecard perspectives. In an integrated
planning and budgeting process, executives
continue to budget for short-term ﬁnancial
performance, but they also introduce shortterm targets for measures in the customer,
internal-business-process, and learning-andgrowth perspectives. With those milestones
established, managers can continually test
both the theory underlying the strategy and
the strategy’s implementation.
At the end of the business-planning process, managers should have set targets for the
long-term objectives they would like to
achieve in all four scorecard perspectives;
they should have identiﬁed the strategic initiatives required and allocated the necessary
resources to those initiatives; and they should
have established milestones for the measures
that mark progress toward achieving their
strategic goals.

Feedback and Learning
“With the balanced scorecard,” a CEO of an engineering company told us, “I can continually
test my strategy. It’s like performing real-time

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

research.” That is exactly the capability that
the scorecard should give senior managers: the
ability to know at any point in its implementation whether the strategy they have formulated is, in fact, working, and if not, why.
The ﬁrst three management processes—
translating the vision, communicating and
linking, and business planning—are vital for
implementing strategy, but they are not sufﬁcient in an unpredictable world. Together
they form an important single-loop-learning
process—single-loop in the sense that the objective remains constant, and any departure
from the planned trajectory is seen as a defect
to be remedied. This single-loop process does
not require or even facilitate reexamination
of either the strategy or the techniques used
to implement it in light of current conditions.
Most companies today operate in a turbulent environment with complex strategies that,
though valid when they were launched, may
lose their validity as business conditions
change. In this kind of environment, where
new threats and opportunities arise constantly,
companies must become capable of what Chris
Argyris calls double-loop learning—learning
that produces a change in people’s assumptions and theories about cause-and-effect relationships. (See “Teaching Smart People How to
Learn,” HBR May–June 1991.)
Budget reviews and other ﬁnancially
based management tools cannot engage
senior executives in double-loop learning—
ﬁrst, because these tools address performance from only one perspective, and second, because they don’t involve strategic
learning. Strategic learning consists of gathering feedback, testing the hypotheses on
which strategy was based, and making the
necessary adjustments.
The balanced scorecard supplies three elements that are essential to strategic learning.
First, it articulates the company’s shared
vision, deﬁning in clear and operational terms
the results that the company, as a team, is
trying to achieve. The scorecard communicates a holistic model that links individual
efforts and accomplishments to business
unit objectives.
Second, the scorecard supplies the essential
strategic feedback system. A business strategy
can be viewed as a set of hypotheses about
cause-and-effect relationships. A strategic
feedback system should be able to test, vali-

page 106

<-----Page 106----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

date, and modify the hypotheses embedded
in a business unit’s strategy. By establishing
short-term goals, or milestones, within the
business-planning process, executives are
forecasting the relationship between changes
in performance drivers and the associated
changes in one or more speciﬁed goals. For
example, executives at Metro Bank estimated
the amount of time it would take for improvements in training and in the availability of
information systems before employees could
sell multiple ﬁnancial products effectively
to existing and new customers. They also estimated how great the effect of that selling

How One Company Linked Measures
from the Four Perspectives

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

capability would be.
Another organization attempted to validate
its hypothesized cause-and-effect relationships in the balanced scorecard by measuring
the strength of the linkages among measures
in the different perspectives. (See the exhibit
“How One Company Linked Measures from
the Four Perspectives.”) The company found
signiﬁcant correlations between employees’
morale, a measure in the learning-and-growth
perspective, and customer satisfaction, an
important customer perspective measure.
Customer satisfaction, in turn, was correlated
with faster payment of invoices—a relationship that led to a substantial reduction in
accounts receivable and hence a higher return
on capital employed. The company also found
correlations between employees’ morale and
the number of suggestions made by employees (two learning-and-growth measures) as
well as between an increased number of
suggestions and lower rework (an internalbusiness-process measure). Evidence of such
strong correlations help to conﬁrm the organization’s business strategy. If, however, the
expected correlations are not found over
time, it should be an indication to executives
that the theory underlying the unit’s strategy
may not be working as they had anticipated.
Especially in large organizations, accumulating sufﬁcient data to document signiﬁcant
correlations and causation among balanced
scorecard measures can take a long time—
months or years. Over the short term, managers’ assessment of strategic impact may have
to rest on subjective and qualitative judgments. Eventually, however, as more evidence
accumulates, organizations may be able to
provide more objectively grounded estimates
of cause-and-effect relationships. But just getting managers to think systematically about
the assumptions underlying their strategy
is an improvement over the current practice
of making decisions based on short-term
operational results.
Third, the scorecard facilitates the strategy
review that is essential to strategic learning.
Traditionally, companies use the monthly or
quarterly meetings between corporate and
division executives to analyze the most recent
period’s ﬁnancial results. Discussions focus on
past performance and on explanations of why
ﬁnancial objectives were not achieved. The
balanced scorecard, with its speciﬁcation of

page 107

<-----Page 107----->Using the Balanced Scorecard as a Strategic Management System •• •B EST OF HBR

the causal relationships between performance
drivers and objectives, allows corporate and
business unit executives to use their periodic
review sessions to evaluate the validity of the
unit’s strategy and the quality of its execution.
If the unit’s employees and managers have
delivered on the performance drivers (retraining of employees, availability of information
systems, and new ﬁnancial products and services, for instance), then their failure to
achieve the expected outcomes (higher sales
to targeted customers, for example) signals
that the theory underlying the strategy may
not be valid. The disappointing sales ﬁgures
are an early warning.
Managers should take such disconﬁrming
evidence seriously and reconsider their
shared conclusions about market conditions,
customer value propositions, competitors’
behavior, and internal capabilities. The result
of such a review may be a decision to reafﬁrm
their belief in the current strategy but to adjust the quantitative relationship among the
strategic measures on the balanced scorecard.
But they also might conclude that the unit
needs a different strategy (an example of
double-loop learning) in light of new knowledge about market conditions and internal
capabilities. In any case, the scorecard will
have stimulated key executives to learn about
the viability of their strategy. This capacity
for enabling organizational learning at the
executive level—strategic learning—is what
distinguishes the balanced scorecard, making
it invaluable for those who wish to create a
strategic management system.

Toward a New Strategic
Management System
Many companies adopted early balanced
scorecard concepts to improve their performance measurement systems. They achieved
tangible but narrow results. Adopting those
concepts provided clariﬁcation, consensus,
and focus on the desired improvements in
performance. More recently, we have seen

harvard business review • managing for the long term • july–august 2007

companies expand their use of the balanced
scorecard, employing it as the foundation of an
integrated and iterative strategic management
system. Companies are using the scorecard to
• clarify and update strategy;
• communicate strategy throughout the
company;
• align unit and individual goals with the
strategy;
• link strategic objectives to long-term targets and annual budgets;
• identify and align strategic initiatives;
and
• conduct periodic performance reviews to
learn about and improve strategy.
The balanced scorecard enables a company to align its management processes and
focuses the entire organization on implementing long-term strategy. At National Insurance, the scorecard provided the CEO and
his managers with a central framework
around which they could redesign each piece
of the company’s management system. And
because of the cause-and-effect linkages inherent in the scorecard framework, changes
in one component of the system reinforced
earlier changes made elsewhere. Therefore,
every change made over the 30-month period added to the momentum that kept the
organization moving forward in the agreedupon direction.
Without a balanced scorecard, most organizations are unable to achieve a similar consistency of vision and action as they attempt to
change direction and introduce new strategies
and processes. The balanced scorecard provides a framework for managing the implementation of strategy while also allowing the
strategy itself to evolve in response to
changes in the company’s competitive, market, and technological environments.

In this article, the authors argue that the balanced scorecard is more than a measurement
system. Four characteristics make it distinctive:
It is a top-down reflection of the company’s
mission and strategy; it is forward-looking; it
integrates external and internal measures; and
it helps a company focus. Together, these characteristics enable a scorecard to serve as a
means for motivating and implementing
breakthrough performance.

CREATING AND COMMUNICATING YOUR
STRATEGIC PRINCIPLE

A successful strategic principle:

Capturing and communicating the essence
of your company’s strategy in a simple, memorable, actionable phrase isn’t easy. These
steps can help:

Why does Southwest succeed while so
many other airlines fail? Because it sticks
to its powerful strategic principle: “Meet
customers’ short-haul travel needs at fares
competitive with the cost of automobile
travel.” This pithy, memorable, actionoriented phrase distills Southwest’s unique
strategy and communicates it throughout
the company.
An effective strategic principle lets a company simultaneously:
• maintain strategic focus,
• empower workers to innovate and
take risks,
• seize fleeting opportunities,

• create products and services that meet
subtle shifts in customers’ needs.
In today’s rapidly changing world, companies must integrate decentralized decision
making with coherent, strategic action. A
well-crafted, skillfully implemented strategic principle lets them strike that delicate
balance.

• Forces trade-offs between competing
resources.

Southwest Airlines’ 1983 expansion to the
high-traffic Denver area seemed sensible.
But unusually long delays there due to bad
weather and taxi time would have forced
Southwest to increase ticket prices—
preventing it from adhering to its strategic
principle of offering air fares competitive
with the cost of auto travel. The company
pulled out of Denver.
• Tests the strategic soundness of particular
decisions by linking leaders’ strategic insights with line operators’ pragmatic sense.
Example:
AOL’s strategic principle,“Consumer connectivity first—anytime, anywhere,” tested
the wisdom of a powerful business decision: expanding AOL’s global network
through alliances with local partners, rather
than using its own technology everywhere.
Partners’ understanding of local culture
greatly increased customers’ connectivity.
• Sets clear boundaries within which employees operate and experiment.
Example:
At mutual-fund giant The Vanguard Group,
frontline employees conceived a potent
idea: Let customers access their accounts
on-line, but limit on-line trading. This move
kept Vanguard’s costs low, enabling the
company to stick to its strategic principle:
creating “unmatchable value for investors/
owners.”

1. Draft a working strategic principle. Summarize your corporate strategy—your plan to
allocate scarce resources in order to create
value that distinguishes you from competitors—in a brief phrase. That phrase becomes
your working strategic principle.
2. Test its endurance. A good strategic principle endures. Ask: Does our working strategic
principle capture the timeless essence of our
company’s unique competitive value?
3. Test its communicative power. Ask: Is the
phrase clear, concise, memorable? Would you
feel proud to paint it on the side of your firm’s
trucks, as Wal-Mart does?
4. Test its ability to promote and guide action. Ask: Does the principle exhibit the three
essential attributes: forcing trade-offs, testing
the wisdom of business moves, setting
boundaries for employees’ experimentation?
5. Communicate it. Communicate your
strategic principle consistently, simply, and
repeatedly. You’ll know you’ve succeeded
when employees—as well as business writers,
MBA students, and competitors—all “chant
the rant.”

Transforming CornerOffice Strategy into
Frontline Action

We all know the beneﬁts of pushing decision
making from the CEO’s ofﬁce out to the far
reaches of an organization. Fleeting business
opportunities can be seized quickly. Products
and services better reﬂect subtle shifts in customers’ preferences. Empowered workers are
motivated to innovate and take risks.
But while the value of such an approach is
clear, particularly in a volatile business environment, there is also a built-in risk: an organization in which everyone is a decision maker has
the potential to spin out of control. Within a
single company, it’s tricky to achieve both decentralized decision making and coherent strategic action. Still, some companies—think General Electric, America Online, Vanguard, Dell,
Wal-Mart, Southwest Airlines, and eBay—have
done just that.
These companies employ what we call a strategic principle, a memorable and actionable
phrase that distills a company’s corporate strategy into its unique essence and communicates
it throughout the organization. (For a list of
companies’ strategic principles, see the exhibit

harvard business review • may 2001

“It’s All in a Phrase.”)
This tool—which we have observed in use at
about a dozen companies, even though they
don’t label it as such—would always serve a
company well. But it has become particularly
useful in today’s rapidly and constantly changing business environment. Indeed, in our conversations and work with more than 50 CEOs
over the past two years, we have come to appreciate the strategic principle’s power—its
ability to help companies maintain strategic
focus while fostering the ﬂexibility among employees that permits innovation and a rapid response to opportunities. Strategic principles
are likely to become even more crucial to corporate success in the years ahead.

Distillation and Communication
To better understand what a strategic principle is and how it can be used, it may be helpful
to look at a military analogy: the rules of engagement for battle. For example, Admiral
Lord Nelson’s crews in Britain’s eighteenthcentury wars against the French were guided

by a simple strategic principle: whatever you
do, get alongside an enemy ship.
The Royal Navy’s seamanship, training, and
experience gave it the advantage every time it
engaged one-on-one against any of Europe’s
lesser ﬂeets. So Nelson rejected as impractical
the common practice of an admiral attempting
to control a ﬂeet through the use of ﬂag signals. Instead, he gave his captains strategic parameters—they knew they had to battle rival
ships one-on-one—leaving them to determine
exactly how to engage in such combat. By
using a strategic principle instead of explicit
signals to direct his forces, Nelson consistently
defeated the French, including a great victory
in the dark of night, when signals would have
been useless. Nelson’s rule of engagement was
simple enough for every one of his ofﬁcers and
sailors to know by heart. And it was enduring,
a valid directive that was good until the relative naval capabilities of Britain and its rivals
changed.
The distillation of a company’s strategy into
a pithy, memorable, and prescriptive phrase is
important because a brilliant business strategy, like an insightful approach to warfare, is
of little use unless people understand it well
enough to apply it—both to anticipated decisions and unforeseen opportunities. In our
work, we often see evidence of what we call
the 80-100 rule: you’re better off with a strategy that is 80% right and 100% implemented
than one that is 100% right but doesn’t drive
consistent action throughout the company. A
strategic principle can help a company balance that ratio.
The beauty of having a corporate strategic
principle—a company should have only one—
is that everyone in an organization, the executives in the front ofﬁce as well as people in the
operating units, can knowingly work toward
the same strategic objective without being
rigid about how they do so. Decisions don’t always have to make the slow trip to and from
the executive suite. When a strategic principle
is well crafted and effectively communicated,
managers at all levels can be trusted to make
decisions that advance rather than undermine
company strategy.
Given what we’ve said so far, a strategic principle might seem to be a mission statement by
another name. But while both help employees
understand a company’s direction, the two are
different tools that communicate different

things. A mission statement informs a company’s culture. A strategic principle drives a
company’s strategy. A mission statement is aspirational: it gives people something to strive
for. A strategic principle is action oriented: it
enables people to do something now. A mission statement is meant to inspire frontline
workers. A strategic principle enables them to
act quickly by giving them explicit guidance to
make strategically consistent choices.
Consider the difference between GE’s mission statement and its strategic principle. The
company’s mission statement exhorts GE’s
leaders—“always with unyielding integrity”—
to be “passionately focused on driving customer success” and to “create an environment
of ‘stretch,’ excitement, informality, and trust,”
among other things. The language is aspirational and emotional. By contrast, GE’s wellknown strategic principle—“Be number one or
number two in every industry in which we
compete, or get out”—is action oriented. The
ﬁrst part of the phrase is an explicit strategic
challenge, and the second part leaves no question in line managers’ minds about what they
should do.

Three Deﬁning Attributes
A strategic principle, as the distillation of a
company’s strategy, should guide a company’s
allocation of scarce resources—capital, time,
management’s attention, labor, and brand—in
order to build a sustainable competitive advantage. It should tell a company what to do
and, just as important, what not to do. More
speciﬁcally, an effective strategic principle
does the following:
• It forces trade-offs between competing resource demands;
• It tests the strategic soundness of a particular action;
• It sets clear boundaries within which employees must operate while granting them freedom to experiment within those constraints.
These three qualities can be seen in America
Online’s strategic principle. CEO Steve Case
says personal interaction on-line is the soul of
the Internet, and he has positioned AOL to create that interaction. Thus, AOL’s strategic principle in the years leading up to its recent
merger with Time Warner has been “Consumer connectivity ﬁrst—anytime, anywhere.”
This strategic principle has helped AOL
make tough choices when allocating its re-

page 113

<-----Page 113----->Transforming Corner-Ofﬁce Strategy into Frontline Action

sources. For example, in 1997, the company
needed cash to grow, so it sold off its network
infrastructure and outsourced that capability—
a risky move at a time when it appeared that
network ownership might be the key to success
on the Internet. In keeping with its strategic
principle, AOL instead spent its time and cash
on improving connectivity at its Web site, focusing particularly on access, navigation, and
interaction. As a result, it avoided investing
capital in what turned out to be a relatively
low-return business.
Its strategic principle has also helped AOL
test whether a given business move makes strategic sense. For instance, the Internet company
has chosen to expand its global network
through alliances with local partners, even
though that approach can take longer than
simply transplanting AOL’s own technology
and know-how. AOL acknowledges that a local
partner better understands the native culture
and community, which is essential for connecting with customers.
Finally, AOL’s strategic principle has spurred
focused experimentation in the ﬁeld by clearly
deﬁning employees’ latitude for making moves.
For example, AOL’s former vice president of
marketing, Jan Brandt, mailed more than 250
million AOL diskettes to consumers nationwide. The innovative campaign turned the
company into one of the best-known names in

It’s All in a Phrase
A handful of companies have distilled their strategy
into a phrase and have used it to drive consistent
strategic action throughout their organizations.

cyberspace—all because Brandt, now AOL’s
vice chair and chief marketing ofﬁcer, guided
by the principle of connecting consumers, put
her resources into empowering AOL’s target
community rather than sinking time and
money into slick advertising.
As AOL’s experience illustrates, a strong strategic principle can inform high-level corporate
decisions—those involving divestitures, for example—as well as decisions made by department heads or others further down in an organization. It also frees up CEOs from constant
involvement in the implementation of their
strategic mandates. “The genius of a great
leader is to leave behind him a situation that
common sense, without the grace of genius,
can deal with successfully,” said journalist and
political thinker Walter Lippman. Scratch the
surface of a number of high-performing companies, and you’ll ﬁnd that strategic principles
are connecting the strategic insights—if not always the genius—of leaders with the pragmatic sense of line operators.

Now More Than Ever
In the past, a strategic principle was nice to
have but was hardly required, unless a company found itself in a trying business situation.
Today, many companies simultaneously face
four situations that make a strategic principle
crucial for success: decentralization, rapid
growth, technological change, and institutional turmoil.
For the reasons mentioned above, decentralization is becoming common at companies of all
stripes; thus, there is a corresponding need for a
mechanism to ensure coherent strategic action.
Especially in the case of diversiﬁed conglomerates, where strategy is formed in each of the
business units, a strategic principle can help executives maintain consistency while giving unit
managers the freedom to tailor their strategies
to meet their own needs. It can also clarify the
value of the center at such far-ﬂung companies.
For example, GE’s long-standing strategic principle of always being number one or number
two in an industry offers a powerful rationale
for how a conglomerate can create value but
still give individual units considerable strategic
freedom.
A strategic principle is also crucial when a
company is experiencing rapid growth. During
such times, it’s increasingly the case that lessexperienced managers are forced to make deci-

page 114

<-----Page 114----->Transforming Corner-Ofﬁce Strategy into Frontline Action

sions about nettlesome issues for which there
may be no precedent. A clear and precise strategic principle can help counteract this shortage of experience. This is particularly true
when a start-up company is growing rapidly in
an established industry. For instance, as Southwest Airlines began to grow quickly, it might
have been tempted to mimic its rivals’ ultimately unsuccessful strategies if it hadn’t had
its own strategic principle to follow: “Meet customers’ short-haul travel needs at fares competitive with the cost of automobile travel.” Likewise, eBay, whose principle is “Focus on trading
communities,” might have been tempted, like
many Internet marketplaces, to diversify into
all sorts of services. But eBay has chosen to outsource certain services—for instance, management of the photos that sellers post on the site
to illustrate the items they put up for bid—
while it continues to invest in services like Billpoint, which lets sellers accept credit-card payments from bidders. EBay’s strategic principle
has ensured that the entire company stays fo-

cused on the core trading business.
The staggering pace of technological change
over the past decade has been costly for companies that don’t have a strategic principle.
Never before in business has there been more
uncertainty combined with so great an emphasis on speed. Managers in high-tech industries
in particular must react immediately to sudden and unexpected developments. Often, the
sum of the reactions across the organization
ends up deﬁning the company’s strategic
course. A strategic principle—for example,
Dell’s mandate to sell direct to end users—
helps ensure that the decisions made by frontline managers in such circumstances add up to
a consistent, coherent strategy.
Finally, a strategic principle can help provide
continuity during periods of organizational turmoil. An increasingly common example of turmoil in this era of short-term CEOs is leadership succession. A new CEO can bring with him
or her a new strategy—but not necessarily a
new strategic principle. For instance, when

Bain & Company: Case Study of a Strategic Principle
I learned the most about strategic principles
in the trenches at Bain & Company when, a
decade ago, we almost went bankrupt.
Bill Bain founded Bain & Company nearly
30 years ago on the basis of a simple but powerful notion: “The product of a consultant
should be results for clients—not reports.”
Over time, this mandate to deliver
results through strategy became Bain’s strategic principle. It remains so today.
This directive fosters speciﬁc action, as an
effective strategic principle should. It means
that, from the very beginning of an assignment, you are constantly thinking about how
a recommendation will get implemented. It
also requires you to tell clients the truth, even
if it’s difﬁcult, because you can’t achieve results by whitewashing problems. And this strategic principle has teeth: Bain has always measured partners’ performance according to the
results they achieve for their clients, not just
on billings to the ﬁrm.
That was the company I joined. And for
many years it grew rapidly, all the time guided
by its strategic principle. Then, just over a decade ago, the founding partners decided to get

harvard business review • may 2001

their money out and sold 30% of the ﬁrm to an
employee stock-option plan. This saddled us
with hundreds of millions of dollars of debt
and tens of millions of dollars of interest payments. The move, whose details initially were
not disclosed to the rest of us, was based on
the assumption that the company would continue its historic growth rate of 50% a year,
which couldn’t be sustained at the size we had
become. When growth slowed, the details
came to light.
The nonfounding partners faced a critical
choice. Everybody had attractive offers. Competitors and the press predicted we wouldn’t
survive. Recruits and clients were watchful. To
make a long story short, we sat down around a
conference table and resolved to turn the company around. The key to doing that, we decided, was to stick with our strategic principle.
What followed was a couple of years during
which adhering to that goal was achingly difﬁcult. But doing so forced important trade-offs.
In one case, right in the middle of the crisis,
we pulled out of a major assignment that was
inconsistent with our principle. We believed
the projects that the client was determined to

undertake could not produce signiﬁcant results for the company. Today, we all believe
that had we veered from our principle in that
instance, we would not be around.
More recently, our strategic principle has
freed us to explore other ventures. Seven years
ago, for instance, we became interested in private equity consulting, quite a different business from serving corporate clients. We initially struggled with the notion but quickly
realized that it ﬁt our strategic principle of delivering results through strategy, only to a new
client segment. We knew that we could trust
our colleagues forming the practice area to act
consistently with the company’s broader goals
because the strategic principle was fundamental to their perspective. The strength of our
shared principle permitted us to experiment
and ultimately develop a successful new practice area.
Our principle continues to let partners develop new practices, markets, and interests
quickly and without splintering the ﬁrm. It has
given us the capacity to evolve and endure.

Jack Brennan took over as chairman and CEO
at Vanguard ﬁve years ago, the strategic transition was seamless, despite some tension
around the leadership transition. He maintained the mutual fund company’s strategic
principle—“Unmatchable value for the investor-owner”—thereby allowing managers to
pursue their strategic objectives without many
of the distractions so often associated with
leadership changes. (For our own experience
with organizational turmoil and strategic principles, see the sidebar “Bain & Company: Case
Study of a Strategic Principle.”)

Strategic Principles in Action
Strategic principles and their beneﬁts can best
be understood by seeing the results they create.
Forcing Trade-Offs at Southwest Airlines.
Southwest Airlines is one of the air-travel industry’s great success stories. It is the only airline that hasn’t lost money in the past 25 years.
Its stock price rose a compounded 21,000% between 1972 and 1992, and it is up 300% over
the past ﬁve years, which have been difﬁcult
ones in the airline industry. For most companies, such rapid growth would cause problems:
legions of frontline employees taking up the
mantle of decision making from core executives and, inevitably, stumbling. But in Southwest’s case, employees have consistently made
trade-offs in keeping with the company’s strategic principle.
The process for making important and complicated decisions about things like network
design, service offerings, route selection and
pricing, cabin design, and ticketing procedures
is straightforward. That’s because the tradeoffs required by the strategic principle are
clear. For instance, in 1983, Southwest initiated
service to Denver, a potentially high-trafﬁc destination and a seemingly sensible expansion of
the company’s presence in the Southwestern
United States. However, the airline experienced longer and more consistent delays at
Denver’s Stapleton airport than it did anywhere else. These delays were caused not by
slow turnaround at the gate but by increased
taxi time on the runway and planes circling in
the air because of bad weather. Southwest had
to decide whether the potential growth from
serving the Denver market was worth the
higher costs associated with the delays, which
would ultimately be reﬂected in higher ticket
prices. The company turned to its strategic

harvard business review • may 2001

principle: would the airline be able to maintain fares competitive with the cost of automobile travel? Clearly, in Denver at least, it
couldn’t. Southwest pulled out of Stapleton
three years after inaugurating the service there
and has not returned.
Testing Action at AOL. A large part of
AOL’s ability to move so far and so fast across
untrod ground lies in its practice of testing potential moves against its strategic principle.
Employees who see attractive opportunities
can ask themselves whether seizing one or several will lead to deeper consumer connectivity
or broader distribution. Take, for example,
line manager Katherine Borescnik, now president of programming at AOL. Several years
ago she noticed increased activity—call it consumer connectivity—around the bulletinboard folders created on the site by two irreverent stock analysts and AOL subscribers. She
offered the analysts the chance to create their
own ﬁnancial site, which became Motley Fool,
a point of connection and information for doit-yourself investors.
And AOL’s strategic principle reaches even
deeper into the organization. The hundreds of
acquisitions and deals that AOL has made in
the past few years have involved numerous
employees. While top ofﬁcers make ﬁnal decisions, employees on the ground ﬁrst screen opportunities against the company’s strategic
principle. Furthermore, the integration efforts
following acquisitions, while choreographed at
the top, are executed by a coterie of managers
who ensure that the plans comply with the
company’s strategic principle. “We have succeeded, both in our deal making and in our integration, because our acquisitions have all
been driven by our focus on how our customers communicate and connect,” says Ken Novack, AOL Time Warner’s vice chairman.
AOL’s massive merger with Time Warner
clearly furthers AOL’s strategic principle of enabling consumer connections “anytime, anywhere” by adding TV and cable access to the
Internet company’s current dial-up access on
the personal computer. But integrating this
merger, which will involve hundreds of employees making and executing thousands of decisions, may be the ultimate test of AOL’s strategic principle.
Experimenting Within Boundaries at Vanguard. The Vanguard Group, with $565 billion
in assets under management, has quietly be-

page 116

<-----Page 116----->Transforming Corner-Ofﬁce Strategy into Frontline Action

come a giant in the mutual fund industry. The
company’s strategy is a response to the inability of most mutual funds to beat the market,
often because of the cost of their marketing
activities, overhead, and frequent transactions. To counter this, Vanguard discourages
investors from making frequent trades and
keeps its own overhead and advertising costs
far below the industry average. It passes the
savings directly to investors, who, because
Vanguard is a mutual rather than a public
company, are the fund’s owners.
While this was Vanguard’s founding strategy,
for years the company didn’t communicate it
widely to employees. As a result, they often
suggested initiatives that were out of sync with
the company’s core strategy. “Midlevel managers would walk in holding the newspaper saying, ‘Look at what Fidelity just did. How about
if we do that?’” Jack Brennan says. It wasn’t apparent to them that Vanguard’s strategy was
very different from that of its rival, which has
higher costs and isn’t mutually owned. Over
the years, Vanguard has invested considerable
energy in crafting a strategic principle and
using it to disseminate the company’s strategy.
Now, because employees understand the strategy, top management trusts them to initiate
moves on their own.
Consider Vanguard’s response to a major
trend in retail fund distribution: the emergence of the on-line channel. Industry surveys
indicated that most investors wanted Internet
access to their accounts and that on-line traders were more active than off-line traders. So
Vanguard chose to integrate the Internet into
its service in a way that furthered its strategy
of keeping costs low: basically, it lets customers access their accounts on-line, but it limits
Web-based trading. It should be noted that
the original ideas for Vanguard’s on-line initiatives, including early ventures with AOL,
were conceived by frontline employees, not
senior executives.
Brennan says the company’s strategic principle affects the entire management process, including hiring, training, performance measurement, and incentives. He points to a hidden
beneﬁt of having a strong strategic principle:
“You’re more efﬁcient and can run with a
leaner management team because everyone is
on the same page.”

harvard business review • may 2001

Creating a Strategic Principle
Many of the best and most conspicuous examples of strategic principles come from companies that were founded on them, companies
such as eBay, Dell, Vanguard, Southwest Airlines, and Wal-Mart (“Low prices, every day”).
The founders of those companies espoused a
clear guiding principle that summarized the
essence of what would become a full-blown
business strategy. They attracted investors
who believed it, hired employees who bought
into it, and targeted customers who wanted it.
Leaders of long-standing multinationals, like
GE, crafted their strategic principles at a critical juncture: when increasing corporate complexity threatened to confuse priorities on the
front line and obscure the essence that truly
differentiated their strategy from that of their
rivals.
Companies in this second category, which
represents most of the companies that are
likely to contemplate creating a strategic principle, face a demanding exercise. It probably
comes as no surprise that identifying the essence of your strategy so it can be translated
into a simple, memorable phrase is no easy
task. It’s a bit like corporate genomics: the principle must isolate and capture the corporate
equivalent of the genetic code that differentiates your company from its competitors. This
is somewhat like identifying the 2% of DNA
that separates man from monkey—or, even
more difﬁcult and more apt, the .1% of DNA
that differentiates each human being.
There are different ways to identify the elements that must be captured in a strategic
principle, but keep in mind that a corporate
strategy represents a plan to effectively allocate scarce resources to achieve sustainable
competitive advantage. Managers need to ask
themselves: how does my company allocate
those resources to create value in a unique
way, one that differentiates my company from
competitors? Try to summarize the answer in a
brief phrase that captures the essence of your
company’s point of differentiation.
Once that idea has been expressed in a
phrase, test the strategic principle for its enduring nature. Does it capture what you intend to
do for only the next three to ﬁve years, or does
it capture a more timeless essence: the genetic
code of your company’s competitive differentiation? Then test the strategic principle for its
communicative power. Is it clear, concise, and

page 117

<-----Page 117----->Transforming Corner-Ofﬁce Strategy into Frontline Action

memorable? Would you feel proud to paint it
on the side of a truck, as Wal-Mart does?
Finally, test the principle for its ability to
promote and guide action. In particular, assess
whether it exhibits the three attributes of an
effective strategic principle. Will it force tradeoffs? Will it serve as a test for the wisdom of a
particular business move, especially one that
might promote short-term proﬁts at the expense of long-term strategy? Does it set boundaries within which people will nonetheless be
free to experiment?
Given the importance of getting your strategic principle right, it is wise to gather feedback
on these questions from executives and other
employees during an incubation period. Once
you are satisﬁed that the statement is accurate
and compelling, disseminate it throughout the
organization.
Of course, just as a brilliant strategy is
worthless unless it is implemented, a powerful
strategic principle is of no use unless it is communicated effectively. When CEO Jack Welch
talks about aligning employees around GE’s
strategy and values, he emphasizes the need
for consistency, simplicity, and repetition. The
approach is neither ﬂashy nor complicated, but
it takes enormous discipline and could scarcely
be more important. Welch has so broadly evangelized GE’s “Be number one or number two”
strategic principle that employees are not the
only ones to chant the rant. So can most business writers, MBA students, and managers at
other companies.

When Rethinking Is Required
No strategy is eternal, nor is any strategic principle. But even if the elements of your strategy
change, the very essence of it is likely to remain the same. Thus, your strategy may shift
substantially as your customers’ demographics and needs change. It may have to be modiﬁed in light of your company’s changing costs
and assets compared with those of competitors. Strategic half-lives are shortening, and, in
general, strategy should be reviewed every
quarter and updated every year. But while it’s
worth revisiting your strategic principle every
time you reexamine your strategy, it is likely to
change only when there is a signiﬁcant shift in
the basic economics and opportunities of your
market caused by, say, legislation or a completely new technology or business model.
Even then, your strategic principle may need

harvard business review • may 2001

only reﬁning or expanding. GE’s strategic principle has been enhanced, but not replaced,
since Welch articulated it in 1981. Similarly,
AOL’s strategic principle will need to be broadened, but not necessarily jettisoned, following
its merger with Time Warner. Ultimately, the
merged company’s strategic principle will also
need to embody the importance of high-quality
and relevant content, Time Warner’s hallmark.
Vanguard takes explicit steps to ensure that
the direction provided by its strategic principle
remains current. For example, as part of an internal “devil’s advocacy” process, managers are
divided into groups to critique and defend past
decisions and current policies. Recently, the
group reconsidered two major strategic policies: the prohibitions against opening branch
ofﬁces and against acquiring money management ﬁrms. After considerable discussion, the
policies remained in place. According to CEO
Brennan, “Sometimes the greatest value [of revisiting our strategic principle] is reconﬁrming
what we’re already doing.” At the same time,
Vanguard has the process to identify when
change is needed.

Fundamental Principles
Respondents to Bain’s annual survey of executives on the usefulness of management tools
repeatedly cite the key role a mission statement can play in a company’s success. We
agree that a mission statement is crucial for
promulgating a company’s values and building a robust corporate culture. But it still
leaves a large gap in a company’s management
communications portfolio. At least as important as a mission statement is something that
promulgates a company’s strategy—that is, a
strategic principle.
The ability of frontline employees to execute
a company’s strategy without close central
oversight is vital as the pace of technological
change accelerates and as companies grow rapidly and become increasingly decentralized. To
drive such behavior, a company needs to give
employees a mandate broad enough to encourage enterprising behavior but speciﬁc enough
to align employees’ initiatives with company
strategy.
While not a perfect analogy, the U.S. Constitution is in some ways like a strategic principle.
It articulates and embodies the essence of the
country’s “strategy”—to guarantee liberty and
justice for all of its citizens—while providing

page 118

<-----Page 118----->Transforming Corner-Ofﬁce Strategy into Frontline Action

direction to those drafting the laws and regulations that implement the strategy. While no
corporate strategy has liberty and justice at its
heart, the elements of an effective strategy are
just as central to the success of a company as
those concepts are to the prosperity of the
United States. And in neither case will success
be realized unless the core strategy is communicated broadly and effectively.

What Is Strategy?
by Michael E. Porter
Harvard Business Review
November–December 1996
Product no. 96608
An effective strategic principle helps a company to maintain strategic focus, including forcing trade-offs and creating carefully integrated
systems. In this article, Porter expands on those
points within his definition of strategy. As he
explains, operational effectiveness—producing, selling, and delivering offerings faster than
rivals—can reap advantages. However, rivals
can quickly copy these “best practices.” Therefore, companies need to hone their strategic
positioning, enabling them to achieve sustainable competitive advantage through 1) preserving their distinctive qualities, 2) performing
different activities from rivals, or 3) performing
similar activities in different ways. Effectively implementing strategy requires trade-offs (“what
we won’t do”) and reinforcing “fit” among company activities.

This interview with General Electric CEO Jack
Welch examines in greater depth the everyday ramifications of GE’s strategic principle:
“Be number one or number two in every industry in which we compete, or get out.” As
Welch makes clear, this principle translates
into five “keys” that unlock the energy of GE’s
people: 1) candor (seeing the world as it is),
2) simplicity, 3) self-confidence in communicating objectives, 4) two-way communication
between leaders and followers, and 5) evaluation of and reward for agility and candor.

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

Most companies’ strategies deliver only
63% of their promised financial value. Why?
Leaders press for better execution when
they really need a sounder strategy. Or they
craft a new strategy when execution is the
true weak spot.

Seven rules for successful strategy execution:

COPYRIGHT © 2005 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

How to avoid these errors? View strategic
planning and execution as inextricably
linked—then raise the bar for both simultaneously. Start by applying seven deceptively straightforward rules, including: keeping your strategy simple and concrete,
making resource-allocation decisions early
in the planning process, and continuously
monitoring performance as you roll out
your strategic plan.
By following these rules, you reduce the
likelihood of performance shortfalls. And
even if your strategy still stumbles, you
quickly determine whether the fault lies
with the strategy itself, your plan for pursuing it, or the execution process. The payoff?
You make the right midcourse corrections—promptly. And as high-performing
companies like Cisco Systems, Dow Chemical, and 3M have discovered, you boost
your company’s financial performance 60%
to 100%.

• Keep it simple. Avoid drawn-out descriptions of lofty goals. Instead, clearly describe
what your company will and won’t do.
Example:
Executives at European investment-banking giant Barclays Capital stated they
wouldn’t compete with large U.S. investment banks or in unprofitable equitymarket segments. Instead, they’d position
Barclays for investors’ burgeoning need for
fixed income.
• Challenge assumptions. Ensure that the
assumptions underlying your long-term
strategic plans reflect real market economics and your organization’s actual performance relative to rivals’.
Example:
Struggling conglomerate Tyco commissioned cross-functional teams in each business unit to continuously analyze their markets’ profitability and their offerings, costs,
and price positioning relative to competitors’. Teams met with corporate executives
biweekly to discuss their findings. The revamped process generated more realistic
plans and contributed to Tyco’s dramatic
turnaround.
• Speak the same language. Unit leaders
and corporate strategy, marketing, and finance teams must agree on a common
framework for assessing performance. For
example, some high-performing companies use benchmarking to estimate the size
of the profit pool available in each market
their company serves, the pool’s potential
growth, and the company’s likely portion of
that pool, given its market share and profitability. By using the shared approach, executives easily agree on financial projections.

• Discuss resource deployments early. Challenge business units about when they’ll
need new resources to execute their strategy. By asking questions such as, “How fast
can you deploy the new sales force?” and
“How quickly will competitors respond?”
you create more feasible forecasts and
plans.
• Identify priorities. Delivering planned performance requires a few key actions taken
at the right time, in the right way. Make
strategic priorities explicit, so everyone
knows what to focus on.
• Continuously monitor performance. Track
real-time results against your plan, resetting
planning assumptions and reallocating resources as needed. You’ll remedy flaws in
your plan and its execution—and avoid
confusing the two.
• Develop execution ability. No strategy can
be better than the people who must implement it. Make selection and development
of managers a priority.
Example:
Barclays’ top executive team takes responsibility for all hiring. Members vet each others’ potential hires and reward talented
newcomers for superior execution. And
stars aren’t penalized if their business enters
new markets with lower initial returns.

Turning Great Strategy
into Great Performance

COPYRIGHT © 2005 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

by Michael C. Mankins and Richard Steele

Three years ago, the leadership team at a
major manufacturer spent months developing
a new strategy for its European business. Over
the prior half-decade, six new competitors had
entered the market, each deploying the latest
in low-cost manufacturing technology and
slashing prices to gain market share. The performance of the European unit—once the
crown jewel of the company’s portfolio—had
deteriorated to the point that top management was seriously considering divesting it.
To turn around the operation, the unit’s
leadership team had recommended a bold
new “solutions strategy”—one that would leverage the business’s installed base to fuel
growth in after-market services and equipment ﬁnancing. The ﬁnancial forecasts were
exciting—the strategy promised to restore
the business’s industry-leading returns and
growth. Impressed, top management quickly
approved the plan, agreeing to provide the
unit with all the resources it needed to make
the turnaround a reality.
Today, however, the unit’s performance is

harvard business review • july–august 2005

nowhere near what its management team
had projected. Returns, while better than before, remain well below the company’s cost of
capital. The revenues and proﬁts that managers had expected from services and ﬁnancing
have not materialized, and the business’s cost
position still lags behind that of its major
competitors.
At the conclusion of a recent half-day review
of the business’s strategy and performance, the
unit’s general manager remained steadfast and
vowed to press on. “It’s all about execution,”
she declared. “The strategy we’re pursuing is
the right one. We’re just not delivering the
numbers. All we need to do is work harder,
work smarter.”
The parent company’s CEO was not so sure.
He wondered: Could the unit’s lackluster performance have more to do with a mistaken
strategy than poor execution? More important, what should he do to get better performance out of the unit? Should he do as the
general manager insisted and stay the course—
focusing the organization more intensely on

execution—or should he encourage the leadership team to investigate new strategy options?
If execution was the issue, what should he do
to help the business improve its game? Or
should he just cut his losses and sell the business? He left the operating review frustrated
and confused—not at all conﬁdent that the
business would ever deliver the performance
its managers had forecast in its strategic plan.
Talk to almost any CEO, and you’re likely to
hear similar frustrations. For despite the enormous time and energy that goes into strategy
development at most companies, many have
little to show for the effort. Our research suggests that companies on average deliver only
63% of the ﬁnancial performance their strategies promise. Even worse, the causes of this
strategy-to-performance gap are all but invisible to top management. Leaders then pull the
wrong levers in their attempts to turn around
performance—pressing for better execution
when they actually need a better strategy, or
opting to change direction when they really
should focus the organization on execution.
The result: wasted energy, lost time, and continued underperformance.
But, as our research also shows, a select
group of high-performing companies have
managed to close the strategy-to-performance
gap through better planning and execution.
These companies—Barclays, Cisco Systems,
Dow Chemical, 3M, and Roche, to name a
few—develop realistic plans that are solidly
grounded in the underlying economics of their
markets and then use the plans to drive execution. Their disciplined planning and execution
processes make it far less likely that they will
face a shortfall in actual performance. And, if
they do fall short, their processes enable them
to discern the cause quickly and take corrective
action. While these companies’ practices are
broad in scope—ranging from unique forms of
planning to integrated processes for deploying
and tracking resources—our experience suggests that they can be applied by any business
to help craft great plans and turn them into
great performance.

The Strategy-to-Performance Gap
In the fall of 2004, our ﬁrm, Marakon Associates, in collaboration with the Economist Intelligence Unit, surveyed senior executives from
197 companies worldwide with sales exceeding
$500 million. We wanted to see how successful

harvard business review • july–august 2005

companies are at translating their strategies
into performance. Speciﬁcally, how effective
are they at meeting the ﬁnancial projections set
forth in their strategic plans? And when they
fall short, what are the most common causes,
and what actions are most effective in closing
the strategy-to-performance gap? Our ﬁndings
were revealing—and troubling.
While the executives we surveyed compete
in very different product markets and geographies, they share many concerns about planning and execution. Virtually all of them struggle to produce the ﬁnancial performance
forecasts in their long-range plans. Furthermore, the processes they use to develop plans
and monitor performance make it difﬁcult to
discern whether the strategy-to-performance
gap stems from poor planning, poor execution,
both, or neither. Speciﬁcally, we discovered:
Companies rarely track performance against
long-term plans. In our experience, less than
15% of companies make it a regular practice to
go back and compare the business’s results
with the performance forecast for each unit in
its prior years’ strategic plans. As a result, top
managers can’t easily know whether the projections that underlie their capital-investment
and portfolio-strategy decisions are in any way
predictive of actual performance. More important, they risk embedding the same disconnect between results and forecasts in their future investment decisions. Indeed, the fact
that so few companies routinely monitor actual versus planned performance may help explain why so many companies seem to pour
good money after bad—continuing to fund
losing strategies rather than searching for new
and better options.
Multiyear results rarely meet projections.
When companies do track performance relative to projections over a number of years,
what commonly emerges is a picture one of
our clients recently described as a series of “diagonal venetian blinds,” where each year’s performance projections, when viewed side by
side, resemble venetian blinds hung diagonally. (See the exhibit “The Venetian Blinds of
Business.”) If things are going reasonably well,
the starting point for each year’s new “blind”
may be a bit higher than the prior year’s starting point, but rarely does performance match
the prior year’s projection. The obvious implication: year after year of underperformance
relative to plan.

page 124

<-----Page 124----->Turning Great Strategy into Great Performance

The venetian blinds phenomenon creates a
number of related problems. First, because
the plan’s ﬁnancial forecasts are unreliable,
senior management cannot conﬁdently tie
capital approval to strategic planning. Consequently, strategy development and resource
allocation become decoupled, and the annual operating plan (or budget) ends up driving the company’s long-term investments and
strategy. Second, portfolio management gets
derailed. Without credible ﬁnancial forecasts,
top management cannot know whether a particular business is worth more to the company and its shareholders than to potential
buyers. As a result, businesses that destroy
shareholder value stay in the portfolio too
long (in the hope that their performance will
eventually turn around), and value-creating
businesses are starved for capital and other resources. Third, poor ﬁnancial forecasts complicate communications with the investment
community. Indeed, to avoid coming up short
at the end of the quarter, the CFO and head
of investor relations frequently impose a
“contingency” or “safety margin” on top of

the forecast produced by consolidating the
business-unit plans. Because this top-down
contingency is wrong just as often as it is
right, poor ﬁnancial forecasts run the risk of
damaging a company’s reputation with analysts and investors.
A lot of value is lost in translation. Given the
poor quality of ﬁnancial forecasts in most strategic plans, it is probably not surprising that
most companies fail to realize their strategies’
potential value. As we’ve mentioned, our survey indicates that, on average, most strategies
deliver only 63% of their potential ﬁnancial
performance. And more than one-third of the
executives surveyed placed the ﬁgure at less
than 50%. Put differently, if management
were to realize the full potential of its current
strategy, the increase in value could be as
much as 60% to 100%!
As illustrated in the exhibit “Where the Performance Goes,” the strategy-to-performance
gap can be attributed to a combination of factors, such as poorly formulated plans, misapplied resources, breakdowns in communication, and limited accountability for results. To

elaborate, management starts with a strategy
it believes will generate a certain level of ﬁnancial performance and value over time
(100%, as noted in the exhibit). But, according
to the executives we surveyed, the failure to
have the right resources in the right place at
the right time strips away some 7.5% of the
strategy’s potential value. Some 5.2% is lost to
poor communications, 4.5% to poor action
planning, 4.1% to blurred accountabilities,
and so on. Of course, these estimates reﬂect
the average experience of the executives we
surveyed and may not be representative of
every company or every strategy. Nonetheless, they do highlight the issues managers
need to focus on as they review their companies’ processes for planning and executing
strategies.

The Venetian Blinds of Business
This graphic illustrates a dynamic common to many companies. In January
2001, management approves a strategic
plan (Plan 2001) that projects modest
performance for the ﬁrst year and a high
rate of performance thereafter, as shown
in the ﬁrst solid line. For beating the ﬁrst
year’s projection, the unit management
is both commended and handsomely rewarded. A new plan is then prepared,

projecting uninspiring results for the ﬁrst
year and once again promising a fast rate
of performance improvement thereafter,
as shown by the second solid line (Plan
2002). This, too, succeeds only partially,
so another plan is drawn up, and so on.
The actual rate of performance improvement can be seen by joining the start
points of each plan (the dotted line).

What emerges from our survey results is a
sequence of events that goes something like
this: Strategies are approved but poorly communicated. This, in turn, makes the translation of strategy into speciﬁc actions and resource plans all but impossible. Lower levels
in the organization don’t know what they
need to do, when they need to do it, or what
resources will be required to deliver the performance senior management expects. Consequently, the expected results never materialize. And because no one is held responsible
for the shortfall, the cycle of underperformance gets repeated, often for many years.
Performance bottlenecks are frequently
invisible to top management. The processes
most companies use to develop plans, allocate
resources, and track performance make it difﬁcult for top management to discern whether
the strategy-to-performance gap stems from
poor planning, poor execution, both, or neither. Because so many plans incorporate
overly ambitious projections, companies frequently write off performance shortfalls as
“just another hockey-stick forecast.” And when
plans are realistic and performance falls short,
executives have few early-warning signals.
They often have no way of knowing whether
critical actions were carried out as expected,
resources were deployed on schedule, competitors responded as anticipated, and so on. Unfortunately, without clear information on how
and why performance is falling short, it is virtually impossible for top management to take
appropriate corrective action.
The strategy-to-performance gap fosters a
culture of underperformance. In many companies, planning and execution breakdowns are
reinforced—even magniﬁed—by an insidious
shift in culture. In our experience, this change
occurs subtly but quickly, and once it has taken
root it is very hard to reverse. First, unrealistic
plans create the expectation throughout the organization that plans simply will not be fulﬁlled. Then, as the expectation becomes experience, it becomes the norm that performance
commitments won’t be kept. So commitments
cease to be binding promises with real consequences. Rather than stretching to ensure that
commitments are kept, managers, expecting
failure, seek to protect themselves from the
eventual fallout. They spend time covering their
tracks rather than identifying actions to enhance performance. The organization becomes

page 126

<-----Page 126----->Turning Great Strategy into Great Performance

less self-critical and less intellectually honest
about its shortcomings. Consequently, it loses its
capacity to perform.

Closing the Strategy-toPerformance Gap
As signiﬁcant as the strategy-to-performance
gap is at most companies, management can
close it. A number of high-performing companies have found ways to realize more of their
strategies’ potential. Rather than focus on improving their planning and execution processes separately to close the gap, these companies work both sides of the equation, raising
standards for both planning and execution simultaneously and creating clear links between them.
Our research and experience in working
with many of these companies suggests they
follow seven rules that apply to planning and
execution. Living by these rules enables them
to objectively assess any performance shortfall
and determine whether it stems from the strategy, the plan, the execution, or employees’ capabilities. And the same rules that allow them
to spot problems early also help them prevent
performance shortfalls in the ﬁrst place. These
rules may seem simple—even obvious—but
when strictly and collectively observed, they
can transform both the quality of a company’s
strategy and its ability to deliver results.
Rule 1: Keep it simple, make it concrete.
At most companies, strategy is a highly abstract concept—often confused with vision or
aspiration—and is not something that can be
easily communicated or translated into action.
But without a clear sense of where the company is headed and why, lower levels in the organization cannot put in place executable
plans. In short, the link between strategy and
performance can’t be drawn because the strategy itself is not sufﬁciently concrete.
To start off the planning and execution process on the right track, high-performing companies avoid long, drawn-out descriptions of lofty
goals and instead stick to clear language describing their course of action. Bob Diamond,
CEO of Barclays Capital, one of the fastestgrowing and best-performing investment banking operations in Europe, puts it this way:
“We’ve been very clear about what we will and
will not do. We knew we weren’t going to go
head-to-head with U.S. bulge bracket ﬁrms. We
communicated that we wouldn’t compete in

harvard business review • july–august 2005

this way and that we wouldn’t play in unproﬁtable segments within the equity markets but instead would invest to position ourselves for the
euro, the burgeoning need for ﬁxed income,
and the end of Glass-Steigel. By ensuring everyone knew the strategy and how it was different,
we’ve been able to spend more time on tasks
that are key to executing this strategy.”
By being clear about what the strategy is
and isn’t, companies like Barclays keep everyone headed in the same direction. More important, they safeguard the performance their
counterparts lose to ineffective communications; their resource and action planning becomes more effective; and accountabilities are
easier to specify.
Rule 2: Debate assumptions, not forecasts.
At many companies, a business unit’s strategic
plan is little more than a negotiated settlement—the result of careful bargaining with
the corporate center over performance targets
and ﬁnancial forecasts. Planning, therefore, is
largely a political process—with unit management arguing for lower near-term proﬁt projections (to secure higher annual bonuses) and
top management pressing for more long-term
stretch (to satisfy the board of directors and
other external constituents). Not surprisingly,
the forecasts that emerge from these negotiations almost always understate what each
business unit can deliver in the near term and
overstate what can realistically be expected in
the long-term—the hockey-stick charts with
which CEOs are all too familiar.
Even at companies where the planning
process is isolated from the political concerns
of performance evaluation and compensation, the approach used to generate ﬁnancial
projections often has built-in biases. Indeed,
ﬁnancial forecasting frequently takes place in
complete isolation from the marketing or
strategy functions. A business unit’s ﬁnance
function prepares a highly detailed line-item
forecast whose short-term assumptions may
be realistic, if conservative, but whose longterm assumptions are largely uninformed. For
example, revenue forecasts are typically based
on crude estimates about average pricing,
market growth, and market share. Projections
of long-term costs and working capital requirements are based on an assumption
about annual productivity gains—expediently tied, perhaps, to some companywide efﬁciency program. These forecasts are difﬁcult

page 127

<-----Page 127----->Turning Great Strategy into Great Performance

for top management to pick apart. Each line
item may be completely defensible, but the
overall plan and projections embed a clear
upward bias—rendering them useless for
driving strategy execution.
High-performing companies view planning
altogether differently. They want their forecasts to drive the work they actually do. To
make this possible, they have to ensure that
the assumptions underlying their long-term
plans reﬂect both the real economics of their
markets and the performance experience of
the company relative to competitors. Tyco CEO
Ed Breen, brought in to turn the company
around in July 2002, credits a revamped planbuilding process for contributing to Tyco’s dramatic recovery. When Breen joined the company, Tyco was a labyrinth of 42 business units
and several hundred proﬁt centers, built up
over many years through countless acquisitions. Few of Tyco’s businesses had complete
plans, and virtually none had reliable ﬁnancial
forecasts.
To get a grip on the conglomerate’s complex
operations, Breen assigned cross-functional
teams at each unit, drawn from strategy, marketing, and ﬁnance, to develop detailed information on the proﬁtability of Tyco’s primary
markets as well as the product or service offerings, costs, and price positioning relative to the
competition. The teams met with corporate executives biweekly during Breen’s ﬁrst six
months to review and discuss the ﬁndings.
These discussions focused on the assumptions
that would drive each unit’s long-term ﬁnancial performance, not on the ﬁnancial forecasts
themselves. In fact, once assumptions about
market trends were agreed on, it was relatively
easy for Tyco’s central ﬁnance function to prepare externally oriented and internally consistent forecasts for each unit.
Separating the process of building assumptions from that of preparing ﬁnancial projections helps to ground the business unit–corporate center dialogue in economic reality.
Units can’t hide behind specious details, and
corporate center executives can’t push for unrealistic goals. What’s more, the fact-based
discussion resulting from this kind of approach builds trust between the top team
and each unit and removes barriers to fast
and effective execution. “When you understand the fundamentals and performance
drivers in a detailed way,” says Bob Diamond,

harvard business review • july–august 2005

“you can then step back, and you don’t have
to manage the details. The team knows
which issues it can get on with, which it
needs to ﬂag to me, and which issues we really need to work out together.”
Rule 3: Use a rigorous framework, speak a
common language. To be productive, the dialogue between the corporate center and the
business units about market trends and assumptions must be conducted within a rigorous framework. Many of the companies we advise use the concept of proﬁt pools, which
draws on the competition theories of Michael
Porter and others. In this framework, a business’s long-term ﬁnancial performance is tied
to the total proﬁt pool available in each of the
markets it serves and its share of each proﬁt
pool—which, in turn, is tied to the business’s
market share and relative proﬁtability versus
competitors in each market.
In this approach, the ﬁrst step is for the corporate center and the unit team to agree on
the size and growth of each proﬁt pool.
Fiercely competitive markets, such as pulp and
paper or commercial airlines, have small (or
negative) total proﬁt pools. Less competitive
markets, like soft drinks or pharmaceuticals,
have large total proﬁt pools. We ﬁnd it helpful
to estimate the size of each proﬁt pool directly—through detailed benchmarking—and
then forecast changes in the pool’s size and
growth. Each business unit then assesses what
share of the total proﬁt pool it can realistically
capture over time, given its business model
and positioning. Competitively advantaged
businesses can capture a large share of the
proﬁt pool—by gaining or sustaining a high
market share, generating above-average proﬁtability, or both. Competitively disadvantaged
businesses, by contrast, typically capture a negligible share of the proﬁt pool. Once the unit
and the corporate center agree on the likely
share of the pool the business will capture over
time, the corporate center can easily create the
ﬁnancial projections that will serve as the
unit’s road map.
In our view, the speciﬁc framework a company uses to ground its strategic plans isn’t all
that important. What is critical is that the
framework establish a common language for
the dialogue between the corporate center and
the units—one that the strategy, marketing,
and ﬁnance teams all understand and use.
Without a rigorous framework to link a busi-

page 128

<-----Page 128----->Turning Great Strategy into Great Performance

ness’s performance in the product markets
with its ﬁnancial performance over time, it is
very difﬁcult for top management to ascertain
whether the ﬁnancial projections that accompany a business unit’s strategic plan are reasonable and realistically achievable. As a result,
management can’t know with conﬁdence
whether a performance shortfall stems from
poor execution or an unrealistic and ungrounded plan.
Rule 4: Discuss resource deployments early.
Companies can create more realistic forecasts
and more executable plans if they discuss up
front the level and timing of critical resource
deployments. At Cisco Systems, for example, a
cross-functional team reviews the level and
timing of resource deployments early in the
planning stage. These teams regularly meet
with John Chambers (CEO), Dennis Powell
(CFO), Randy Pond (VP of operations), and
the other members of Cisco’s executive team
to discuss their ﬁndings and make recommendations. Once agreement is reached on resource allocation and timing at the unit level,
those elements are factored into the company’s two-year plan. Cisco then monitors
each unit’s actual resource deployments on a
monthly basis (as well as its performance) to
make sure things are going according to plan
and that the plan is generating the expected
results.
Challenging business units about when new
resources need to be in place focuses the planning dialogue on what actually needs to happen across the company in order to execute
each unit’s strategy. Critical questions invariably surface, such as: How long will it take us
to change customers’ purchase patterns? How
fast can we deploy our new sales force? How
quickly will competitors respond? These are
tough questions. But answering them makes
the forecasts and the plans they accompany
more feasible.
What’s more, an early assessment of resource needs also informs discussions about
market trends and drivers, improving the quality of the strategic plan and making it far more
executable. In the course of talking about the
resources needed to expand in the rapidly
growing cable market, for example, Cisco came
to realize that additional growth would require
more trained engineers to improve existing
products and develop new features. So, rather
than relying on the functions to provide these

harvard business review • july–august 2005

resources from the bottom up, corporate management earmarked a speciﬁc number of
trained engineers to support growth in cable.
Cisco’s ﬁnancial-planning organization carefully monitors the engineering head count, the
pace of feature development, and revenues
generated by the business to make sure the
strategy stays on track.
Rule 5: Clearly identify priorities. To deliver
any strategy successfully, managers must
make thousands of tactical decisions and put
them into action. But not all tactics are
equally important. In most instances, a few
key steps must be taken—at the right time and
in the right way—to meet planned performance. Leading companies make these priorities explicit so that each executive has a clear
sense of where to direct his or her efforts.
At Textron, a $10 billion multi-industrial
conglomerate, each business unit identiﬁes
“improvement priorities” that it must act
upon to realize the performance outlined in
its strategic plan. Each improvement priority
is translated into action items with clearly deﬁned accountabilities, timetables, and key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow executives to tell how a unit is delivering on a
priority. Improvement priorities and action
items cascade to every level at the company—
from the management committee (consisting
of Textron’s top ﬁve executives) down to the
lowest levels in each of the company’s ten
business units. Lewis Campbell, Textron’s CEO,
summarizes the company’s approach this way:
“Everyone needs to know: ‘If I have only one
hour to work, here’s what I’m going to focus
on.’ Our goal deployment process makes each
individual’s accountabilities and priorities
clear.”
The Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche goes
as far as to turn its business plans into detailed
performance contracts that clearly specify the
steps needed and the risks that must be managed to achieve the plans. These contracts all
include a “delivery agenda” that lists the ﬁve to
ten critical priorities with the greatest impact
on performance. By maintaining a delivery
agenda at each level of the company, Chairman and CEO Franz Humer and his leadership
team make sure “everyone at Roche understands exactly what we have agreed to do at a
strategic level and that our strategy gets translated into clear execution priorities. Our delivery agenda helps us stay the course with the

page 129

<-----Page 129----->Turning Great Strategy into Great Performance

strategy decisions we have made so that execution is actually allowed to happen. We cannot
control implementation from HQ, but we can
agree on the priorities, communicate relentlessly, and hold managers accountable for executing against their commitments.”
Rule 6: Continuously monitor performance.
Seasoned executives know almost instinctively whether a business has asked for too
much, too little, or just enough resources to
deliver the goods. They develop this capability
over time—essentially through trial and error.
High-performing companies use real-time performance tracking to help accelerate this trialand-error process. They continuously monitor
their resource deployment patterns and their
results against plan, using continuous feedback to reset planning assumptions and reallocate resources. This real-time information allows management to spot and remedy ﬂaws in
the plan and shortfalls in execution—and to
avoid confusing one with the other.
At Textron, for example, each KPI is carefully monitored, and regular operating reviews
percolate performance shortfalls—or “red
light” events—up through the management
ranks. This provides CEO Lewis Campbell, CFO
Ted French, and the other members of Textron’s management committee with the information they need to spot and ﬁx breakdowns
in execution.
A similar approach has played an important
role in the dramatic revival of Dow Chemical’s
fortunes. In December 2001, with performance
in a free fall, Dow’s board of directors asked
Bill Stavropoulos (Dow’s CEO from 1993 to
1999) to return to the helm. Stavropoulos and
Andrew Liveris (the current CEO, then COO)
immediately focused Dow’s entire top leadership team on execution through a project they
called the Performance Improvement Drive.
They began by deﬁning clear performance
metrics for each of Dow’s 79 business units.
Performance on these key metrics was tracked
against plans on a weekly basis, and the entire
leadership team discussed any serious discrepancies ﬁrst thing every Monday morning. As
Liveris told us, the weekly monitoring sessions
“forced everyone to live the details of execution” and let “the entire organization know
how we were performing.”
Continuous monitoring of performance is
particularly important in highly volatile industries, where events outside anyone’s control

harvard business review • july–august 2005

can render a plan irrelevant. Under CEO Alan
Mulally, Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ leadership team holds weekly business performance
reviews to track the division’s results against its
multiyear plan. By tracking the deployment of
resources as a leading indicator of whether a
plan is being executed effectively, BCA’s leadership team can make course corrections each
week rather than waiting for quarterly results
to roll in.
Furthermore, by proactively monitoring the
primary drivers of performance (such as passenger trafﬁc patterns, airline yields and load
factors, and new aircraft orders), BCA is better
able to develop and deploy effective countermeasures when events throw its plans off
course. During the SARS epidemic in late
2002, for example, BCA’s leadership team took
action to mitigate the adverse consequences of
the illness on the business’s operating plan
within a week of the initial outbreak. The
abrupt decline in air trafﬁc to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other Asian business centers signaled that the number of future aircraft deliveries to the region would fall—perhaps
precipitously. Accordingly, BCA scaled back its
medium-term production plans (delaying the
scheduled ramp-up of some programs and accelerating the shutdown of others) and adjusted its multiyear operating plan to reﬂect
the anticipated ﬁnancial impact.
Rule 7: Reward and develop execution capabilities. No list of rules on this topic would
be complete without a reminder that companies have to motivate and develop their staffs;
at the end of the day, no process can be better
than the people who have to make it work.
Unsurprisingly, therefore, nearly all of the
companies we studied insisted that the selection and development of management was an
essential ingredient in their success. And while
improving the capabilities of a company’s
workforce is no easy task—often taking many
years—these capabilities, once built, can drive
superior planning and execution for decades.
For Barclays’ Bob Diamond, nothing is more
important than “ensuring that [the company]
hires only A players.” In his view, “the hidden
costs of bad hiring decisions are enormous, so
despite the fact that we are doubling in size,
we insist that as a top team we take responsibility for all hiring. The jury of your peers is
the toughest judgment, so we vet each others’
potential hires and challenge each other to

keep raising the bar.” It’s equally important to
make sure that talented hires are rewarded for
superior execution. To reinforce its core values
of “client,” “meritocracy,” “team,” and “integrity,” Barclays Capital has innovative pay
schemes that “ring fence” rewards. Stars don’t
lose out just because the business is entering
new markets with lower returns during the
growth phase. Says Diamond: “It’s so bad for
the culture if you don’t deliver what you promised to people who have delivered…. You’ve
got to make sure you are consistent and fair,
unless you want to lose your most productive
people.”
Companies that are strong on execution also
emphasize development. Soon after he became CEO of 3M, Jim McNerney and his top
team spent 18 months hashing out a new leadership model for the company. Challenging debates among members of the top team led to
agreement on six “leadership attributes”—
namely, the ability to “chart the course,” “energize and inspire others,” “demonstrate ethics,
integrity, and compliance,” “deliver results,”
“raise the bar,” and “innovate resourcefully.”
3M’s leadership agreed that these six attributes
were essential for the company to become
skilled at execution and known for accountability. Today, the leaders credit this model
with helping 3M to sustain and even improve
its consistently strong performance.

true beneﬁts. Companies that create tight
links between their strategies, their plans, and,
ultimately, their performance often experience a cultural multiplier effect. Over time, as
they turn their strategies into great performance, leaders in these organizations become
much more conﬁdent in their own capabilities
and much more willing to make the stretch
commitments that inspire and transform large
companies. In turn, individual managers who
keep their commitments are rewarded—with
faster progression and fatter paychecks—reinforcing the behaviors needed to drive any
company forward.
Eventually, a culture of overperformance
emerges. Investors start giving management
the beneﬁt of the doubt when it comes to bold
moves and performance delivery. The result is
a performance premium on the company’s
stock—one that further rewards stretch commitments and performance delivery. Before
long, the company’s reputation among potential recruits rises, and a virtuous circle is created in which talent begets performance, performance begets rewards, and rewards beget
even more talent. In short, closing the strategyto-performance gap is not only a source of immediate performance improvement but also
an important driver of cultural change with a
large and lasting impact on the organization’s
capabilities, strategies, and competitiveness.

Sull identifies another important cause of strategic underperformance: active inertia.
Through active inertia, executives cling to strategic formulas that brought success in the
past—even though emerging business realities call for new formulas. The strategic frames
of the past become blinders; processes harden
into routines; relationships become shackles;
and values turn into dogmas. Sull offers additional advice for avoiding active inertia. Rather
than asking, “What should we do?” ask, “What’s

How Clear Decision Roles Enhance Organizational Performance

The Idea in Brief

The Idea in Practice

Decisions are the coin of the realm in business. Every success, every mishap, every opportunity seized or missed stems from a decision someone made—or failed to make.
Yet in many firms, decisions routinely stall
inside the organization—hurting the entire
company’s performance.

The RAPID Decision Model
For every strategic decision, assign the following roles and responsibilities:

COPYRIGHT © 2005 HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The culprit? Ambiguity over who’s accountable for which decisions. In one auto manufacturer that was missing milestones for
rolling out new models, marketers and
product developers each thought they
were responsible for deciding new models’
standard features and colors. Result? Conflict over who had final say, endless revisiting of decisions—and missed deadlines
that led to lost sales.
How to clarify decision accountability? Assign clear roles for the decisions that most
affect your firm’s performance—such as
which markets to enter, where to allocate
capital, and how to drive product innovation. Think “RAPID”: Who should recommend a course of action on a key decision?
Who must agree to a recommendation before it can move forward? Who will perform
the actions needed to implement the decision? Whose input is needed to determine
the proposal’s feasibility? Who decides—
brings the decision to closure and commits
the organization to implement it?
When you clarify decision roles, you make
the right choices—swiftly and effectively.

PEOPLE WHO...

ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR...

Recommend

• Making a proposal on a key decision, gathering input, and providing data and
analysis to make a sensible choice in a timely fashion
• Consulting with input providers—hearing and incorporating their views, and
winning their buy-in

Agree

• Negotiating a modified proposal with the recommender if they have concerns
about the original proposal
• Escalating unresolved issues to the decider if the “A” and “R” can’t resolve
differences
• If necessary, exercising veto power over the recommendation

Perform

• Executing a decision once it’s made
• Seeing that the decision is implemented promptly and effectively

Input

• Providing relevant facts to the recommender that shed light on the proposal’s
feasibility and practical implications

Decide

• Serving as the single point of accountability
• Bringing the decision to closure by resolving any impasse in the decision-making
process
• Committing the organization to implementing the decision

Decision-Role Pitfalls
In assigning decision roles:
• Ensure that only one person “has the D.” If
two or more people think they’re in charge
of a particular decision, a tug-of-war results.
• Watch for a proliferation of “A’s.” Too many
people with veto power can paralyze recommenders. If many people must agree,
you probably haven’t pushed decisions
down far enough in your organization.
• Avoid assigning too many “I’s.” When many
people give input, at least some of them
aren’t making meaningful contributions.
The RAPID Model in Action
Example:
At British department-store chain John
Lewis, company buyers wanted to increase
sales and reduce complexity by offering
fewer salt and pepper mill models. The
company launched the streamlined prod-

uct set without involving the sales staff.
And sales fell. Upon visiting the stores, buyers saw that salespeople (not understanding the strategy behind the recommendation) had halved shelf space to match the
reduction in product range, rather than
maintaining the same space but stocking
more of the products.
To fix the problem, the company “gave buyers the D” on how much space product categories would have. Sales staff “had the A”:
If space allocations didn’t make sense to
them, they could force additional negotiations. They also “had the P,” implementing
product layouts in stores.
Once decision roles were clarified, sales of salt
and pepper mills exceeded original levels.

Decisions are the coin of the realm in business.
Every success, every mishap, every opportunity seized or missed is the result of a decision
that someone made or failed to make. At
many companies, decisions routinely get stuck
inside the organization like loose change. But
it’s more than loose change that’s at stake, of
course; it’s the performance of the entire organization. Never mind what industry you’re in,
how big and well known your company may
be, or how clever your strategy is. If you can’t
make the right decisions quickly and effectively, and execute those decisions consistently, your business will lose ground.
Indeed, making good decisions and making
them happen quickly are the hallmarks of
high-performing organizations. When we surveyed executives at 350 global companies
about their organizational effectiveness, only
15% said that they have an organization that
helps the business outperform competitors.
What sets those top performers apart is the
quality, speed, and execution of their decision
making. The most effective organizations score

well on the major strategic decisions—which
markets to enter or exit, which businesses to
buy or sell, where to allocate capital and talent.
But they truly shine when it comes to the critical operating decisions requiring consistency
and speed—how to drive product innovation,
the best way to position brands, how to manage channel partners.
Even in companies respected for their decisiveness, however, there can be ambiguity over
who is accountable for which decisions. As a result, the entire decision-making process can
stall, usually at one of four bottlenecks: global
versus local, center versus business unit, function versus function, and inside versus outside
partners.
The ﬁrst of these bottlenecks, global versus
local decision making, can occur in nearly
every major business process and function. Decisions about brand building and product development frequently get snared here, when
companies wrestle over how much authority
local businesses should have to tailor products
for their markets. Marketing is another classic

page 135

<-----Page 135----->Who Has the D?

global versus local issue—should local markets
have the power to determine pricing and advertising?
The second bottleneck, center versus business
unit decision making, tends to afﬂict parent
companies and their subsidiaries. Business
units are on the front line, close to the customer; the center sees the big picture, sets
broad goals, and keeps the organization focused on winning. Where should the decisionmaking power lie? Should a major capital investment, for example, depend on the approval
of the business unit that will own it, or should
headquarters make the ﬁnal call?
Function versus function decision making is
perhaps the most common bottleneck. Every
manufacturer, for instance, faces a balancing
act between product development and marketing during the design of a new product. Who
should decide what? Cross-functional decisions
too often result in ineffective compromise solutions, which frequently need to be revisited
because the right people were not involved at
the outset.
The fourth decision-making bottleneck, inside versus outside partners, has become familiar with the rise of outsourcing, joint ventures,
strategic alliances, and franchising. In such arrangements, companies need to be absolutely
clear about which decisions can be owned by
the external partner (usually those about the
execution of strategy) and which must continue to be made internally (decisions about
the strategy itself). In the case of outsourcing,
for instance, brand-name apparel and footwear marketers once assumed that overseas
suppliers could be responsible for decisions
about plant employees’ wages and working
conditions. Big mistake.

harvard business review • january 2006

The most important step in unclogging decisionmaking bottlenecks is assigning clear roles and
responsibilities. Good decision makers recognize which decisions really matter to performance. They think through who should recommend a particular path, who needs to agree,
who should have input, who has ultimate responsibility for making the decision, and who is
accountable for follow-through. They make the
process routine. The result: better coordination
and quicker response times.
Companies have devised a number of methods to clarify decision roles and assign respon-

sibilities. We have used an approach called
RAPID, which has evolved over the years, to
help hundreds of companies develop clear decision-making guidelines. It is, for sure, not a
panacea (an indecisive decision maker, for example, can ruin any good system), but it’s an
important start. The letters in RAPID stand for
the primary roles in any decision-making process, although these roles are not performed
exactly in this order: recommend, agree, perform, input, and decide—the “D.” (See the sidebar “A Decision-Making Primer.”)
The people who recommend a course of action are responsible for making a proposal or
offering alternatives. They need data and analysis to support their recommendations, as well
as common sense about what’s reasonable,
practical, and effective.
The people who agree to a recommendation
are those who need to sign off on it before it
can move forward. If they veto a proposal, they
must either work with the recommender to
come up with an alternative or elevate the issue
to the person with the D. For decision making
to function smoothly, only a few people should
have such veto power. They may be executives
responsible for legal or regulatory compliance
or the heads of units whose operations will be
signiﬁcantly affected by the decision.
People with input responsibilities are consulted about the recommendation. Their role
is to provide the relevant facts that are the
basis of any good decision: How practical is the
proposal? Can manufacturing accommodate
the design change? Where there’s dissent or
contrasting views, it’s important to get these
people to the table at the right time. The recommender has no obligation to act on the
input he or she receives but is expected to take
it into account—particularly since the people
who provide input are generally among those
who must implement a decision. Consensus is
a worthy goal, but as a decision-making standard, it can be an obstacle to action or a recipe
for lowest-common-denominator compromise. A more practical objective is to get everyone involved to buy in to the decision.
Eventually, one person will decide. The decision maker is the single point of accountability
who must bring the decision to closure and
commit the organization to act on it. To be
strong and effective, the person with the D
needs good business judgment, a grasp of the
relevant trade-offs, a bias for action, and a keen

page 136

<-----Page 136----->Who Has the D?

awareness of the organization that will execute
the decision.
The ﬁnal role in the process involves the people who will perform the decision. They see to it
that the decision is implemented promptly and
effectively. It’s a crucial role. Very often, a good
decision executed quickly beats a brilliant decision implemented slowly or poorly.
RAPID can be used to help redesign the way
an organization works or to target a single bottleneck. Some companies use the approach for
the top ten to 20 decisions, or just for the CEO
and his or her direct reports. Other companies
use it throughout the organization—to improve
customer service by clarifying decision roles on
the front line, for instance. When people see an
effective process for making decisions, they
spread the word. For example, after senior managers at a major U.S. retailer used RAPID to sort
out a particularly thorny set of corporate decisions, they promptly built the process into their
own functional organizations.
To see the process in action, let’s look at the

way four companies have worked through their
decision-making bottlenecks.

Global Versus Local
Every major company today operates in global
markets, buying raw materials in one place,
shipping them somewhere else, and selling ﬁnished products all over the world. Most are trying simultaneously to build local presence and
expertise, and to achieve economies of scale.
Decision making in this environment is far
from straightforward. Frequently, decisions
cut across the boundaries between global and
local managers, and sometimes across a regional layer in between: What investments
will streamline our supply chain? How far
should we go in standardizing products or tailoring them for local markets?
The trick in decision making is to avoid becoming either mindlessly global or hopelessly
local. If decision-making authority tilts too far
toward global executives, local customers’ preferences can easily be overlooked, undermining

A Decision-Making Primer
Good decision making depends on assigning
clear and speciﬁc roles. This sounds simple
enough, but many companies struggle to
make decisions because lots of people feel accountable—or no one does. RAPID and other
tools used to analyze decision making give
senior management teams a method for assigning roles and involving the relevant people. The key is to be clear who has input, who
gets to decide, and who gets it done.
The ﬁve letters in RAPID correspond to the
ﬁve critical decision-making roles: recommend, agree, perform, input, and decide. As
you’ll see, the roles are not carried out lockstep in this order—we took some liberties for
the sake of creating a useful acronym.
Recommend. People in this role are responsible for making a proposal, gathering
input, and providing the right data and analysis to make a sensible decision in a timely
fashion. In the course of developing a proposal, recommenders consult with the people
who provide input, not just hearing and incorporating their views but also building buy
in along the way. Recommenders must have
analytical skills, common sense, and organizational smarts.
harvard business review • january 2006

Agree. Individuals in this role have veto
power—yes or no—over the recommendation. Exercising the veto triggers a debate between themselves and the recommenders,
which should lead to a modiﬁed proposal. If
that takes too long, or if the two parties simply can’t agree, they can escalate the issue to
the person who has the D.
Input. These people are consulted on the
decision. Because the people who provide
input are typically involved in implementation, recommenders have a strong interest in
taking their advice seriously. No input is
binding, but this shouldn’t undermine its importance. If the right people are not involved
and motivated, the decision is far more likely
to falter during execution.
Decide. The person with the D is the formal decision maker. He or she is ultimately
accountable for the decision, for better or
worse, and has the authority to resolve any
impasse in the decision-making process and
to commit the organization to action.
Perform. Once a decision is made, a person or group of people will be responsible for
executing it. In some instances, the people responsible for implementing a decision are

the same people who recommended it.
Writing down the roles and assigning accountability are essential steps, but good decision making also requires the right process.
Too many rules can cause the process to collapse under its own weight. The most effective process is grounded in speciﬁcs but simple enough to adapt if necessary.
When the process gets slowed down, the
problem can often be traced back to one of
three trouble spots. First is a lack of clarity
about who has the D. If more than one person think they have it for a particular decision, that decision will get caught up in a tugof-war. The ﬂip side can be equally damaging:
No one is accountable for crucial decisions,
and the business suffers. Second, a proliferation of people who have veto power can make
life tough for recommenders. If a company
has too many people in the “agree” role, it
usually means that decisions are not pushed
down far enough in the organization. Third,
if there are a lot of people giving input, it’s a
signal that at least some of them aren’t making a meaningful contribution.

the efﬁciency and agility of local operations.
But with too much local authority, a company
is likely to miss out on crucial economies of
scale or opportunities with global clients.
To strike the right balance, a company must
recognize its most important sources of value
and make sure that decision roles line up with
them. This was the challenge facing Martin
Broughton, the former CEO and chairman of
British American Tobacco, the second-largest
tobacco company in the world. In 1993, when
Broughton was appointed chief executive, BAT
was losing ground to its nearest competitor.
Broughton knew that the company needed to
take better advantage of its global scale, but
decision roles and responsibilities were at odds
with this goal. Four geographic operating units
ran themselves autonomously, rarely collaborating and sometimes even competing. Achieving consistency across global brands proved difﬁcult, and cost synergies across the operating
units were elusive. Industry insiders joked that
“there are seven major tobacco companies in
the world—and four of them are British American Tobacco.” Broughton vowed to change the
punch line.
The chief executive envisioned an organization that could take advantage of the opportunities a global business offers—global brands
that could compete with established winners
such as Altria Group’s Marlboro; global purchasing of important raw materials, including
tobacco; and more consistency in innovation
and customer management. But Broughton
didn’t want the company to lose its nimbleness
and competitive hunger in local markets by
shifting too much decision-making power to
global executives.
The ﬁrst step was to clarify roles for the most
important decisions. Procurement became a
proving ground. Previously, each operating
unit had identiﬁed its own suppliers and negotiated contracts for all materials. Under
Broughton, a global procurement team was set
up in headquarters and given authority to
choose suppliers and negotiate pricing and
quality for global materials, including bulk tobacco and certain types of packaging. Regional
procurement teams were now given input into
global materials strategies but ultimately had
to implement the team’s decision. As soon as
the global team signed contracts with suppliers, responsibility shifted to the regional teams,
who worked out the details of delivery and ser-

vice with the suppliers in their regions. For materials that did not offer global economies of
scale (mentholated ﬁlters for the North American market, for example), the regional teams
retained their decision-making authority.
As the effort to revamp decision making in
procurement gained momentum, the company set out to clarify roles in all its major decisions. The process wasn’t easy. A company the
size of British American Tobacco has a huge
number of moving parts, and developing a
practical system for making decisions requires
sweating lots of details. What’s more, decisionmaking authority is power, and people are
often reluctant to give it up.
It’s crucial for the people who will live with
the new system to help design it. At BAT,
Broughton created working groups led by people earmarked, implicitly or explicitly, for leadership roles in the future. For example, Paul
Adams, who ultimately succeeded Broughton
as chief executive, was asked to lead the group
charged with redesigning decision making for
brand and customer management. At the time,
Adams was a regional head within one of the
operating units. With other senior executives,
including some of his own direct reports,
Broughton speciﬁed that their role was to provide input, not to veto recommendations.
Broughton didn’t make the common mistake
of seeking consensus, which is often an obstacle to action. Instead, he made it clear that the
objective was not deciding whether to change
the decision-making process but achieving buy
in about how to do so as effectively as possible.
The new decision roles provided the foundation the company needed to operate successfully on a global basis while retaining ﬂexibility
at the local level. The focus and efﬁciency of its
decision making were reﬂected in the company’s results: After the decision-making overhaul, British American Tobacco experienced
nearly ten years of growth well above the levels of its competitors in sales, proﬁts, and market value. The company has gone on to have
one of the best-performing stocks on the UK
market and has reemerged as a major global
player in the tobacco industry.

Center Versus Business Unit
The ﬁrst rule for making good decisions is to
involve the right people at the right level of
the organization. For BAT, capturing economies of scale required its global team to appro-

priate some decision-making powers from regional divisions. For many companies, a
similar balancing act takes place between executives at the center and managers in the
business units. If too many decisions ﬂow to
the center, decision making can grind to a halt.
The problem is different but no less critical if
the decisions that are elevated to senior executives are the wrong ones.
Companies often grow into this type of problem. In small and midsize organizations, a single management team—sometimes a single
leader—effectively handles every major decision. As a company grows and its operations
become more complex, however, senior executives can no longer master the details required
to make decisions in every business.
A change in management style, often triggered by the arrival of a new CEO, can create
similar tensions. At a large British retailer, for
example, the senior team was accustomed to
the founder making all critical decisions. When
his successor began seeking consensus on important issues, the team was suddenly unsure
of its role, and many decisions stalled. It’s a
common scenario, yet most management
teams and boards of directors don’t specify
how decision-making authority should change
as the company does.
A growth opportunity highlighted that issue
for Wyeth (then known as American Home
Products) in late 2000. Through organic
growth, acquisitions, and partnerships, Wyeth’s
pharmaceutical division had developed three
sizable businesses: biotech, vaccines, and traditional pharmaceutical products. Even though
each business had its own market dynamics,
operating requirements, and research focus,
most important decisions were pushed up to
one group of senior executives. “We were using
generalists across all issues,” said Joseph M.
Mahady, president of North American and global businesses for Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. “It
was a signal that we weren’t getting our best
decision making.”
The problem crystallized for Wyeth when
managers in the biotech business saw a vital—
but perishable—opportunity to establish a
leading position with Enbrel, a promising
rheumatoid arthritis drug. Competitors were
working on the same class of drug, so Wyeth
needed to move quickly. This meant expanding
production capacity by building a new plant,
which would be located at the Grange Castle

Business Park in Dublin, Ireland.
The decision, by any standard, was a complex one. Once approved by regulators, the facility would be the biggest biotech plant in the
world—and the largest capital investment
Wyeth had ever undertaken. Yet peak demand
for the drug was not easy to determine. What’s
more, Wyeth planned to market Enbrel in partnership with Immunex (now a part of Amgen).
In its deliberations about the plant, therefore,
Wyeth needed to factor in the requirements of
building up its technical expertise, technology
transfer issues, and an uncertain competitive
environment.
Input on the decision ﬁltered up slowly
through a gauze of overlapping committees,
leaving senior executives hungry for a more detailed grasp of the issues. Given the narrow
window of opportunity, Wyeth acted quickly,
moving from a ﬁrst look at the Grange Castle
project to implementation in six months. But
in the midst of this process, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals’ executives saw the larger issue: The company needed a system that would push more
decisions down to the business units, where
operational knowledge was greatest, and elevate the decisions that required the senior
team’s input, such as marketing strategy and
manufacturing capacity.
In short order, Wyeth gave authority for
many decisions to business unit managers,
leaving senior executives with veto power over
some of the more sensitive issues related to
Grange Castle. But after that investment decision was made, the D for many subsequent decisions about the Enbrel business lay with
Cavan Redmond, the executive vice president
and general manager of Wyeth’s biotech division, and his new management team. Redmond gathered input from managers in biotech manufacturing, marketing, forecasting,
ﬁnance, and R&D, and quickly set up the complex schedules needed to collaborate with Immunex. Responsibility for execution rested
ﬁrmly with the business unit, as always. But
now Redmond, supported by his team, also
had authority to make important decisions.
Grange Castle is paying off so far. Enbrel is
among the leading brands for rheumatoid arthritis, with sales of $1.7 billion through the
ﬁrst half of 2005. And Wyeth’s metabolism for
making decisions has increased. Recently,
when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
granted priority review status to another new

page 139

<-----Page 139----->Who Has the D?

drug, Tygacil, because of the antibiotic’s efﬁcacy against drug-resistant infections, Wyeth
displayed its new reﬂexes. To keep Tygacil on a
fast track, the company had to orchestrate a
host of critical steps—reﬁning the process technology, lining up supplies, ensuring quality
control, allocating manufacturing capacity.
The vital decisions were made one or two
levels down in the biotech organization,
where the expertise resided. “Instead of debating whether you can move your product
into my shop, we had the decision systems in
place to run it up and down the business
units and move ahead rapidly with Tygacil,”
said Mahady. The drug was approved by the
FDA in June 2005 and moved into volume
production a mere three days later.

Function Versus Function
Decisions that cut across functions are some
of the most important a company faces. Indeed, cross-functional collaboration has become an axiom of business, essential for arriving at the best answers for the company
and its customers. But ﬂuid decision making
across functional teams remains a constant
challenge, even for companies known for
doing it well, like Toyota and Dell. For instance, a team that thinks it’s more efﬁcient
to make a decision without consulting other
functions may wind up missing out on relevant input or being overruled by another
team that believes—rightly or wrongly—it
should have been included in the process.
Many of the most important cross-functional
decisions are, by their very nature, the most
difﬁcult to orchestrate, and that can string
out the process and lead to sparring between
ﬁefdoms and costly indecision.
The theme here is a lack of clarity about

A Recipe for a Decision-Making Bottleneck
At one automaker we studied, marketers and product developers were confused
about who was responsible for making decisions about new models.
When we asked, “Who has the right to
decide which features will be standard?”
64% of product developers said, “We
do.”
83% of marketers said, “We do.”

When we asked, “Who has the right
to decide which colors will be offered?”
77% of product developers said, “We
do.”
61% of marketers said, “We do.”

Not surprisingly, the new models were delayed.

who has the D. For example, at a global auto
manufacturer that was missing its milestones for rolling out new models—and was
paying the price in falling sales—it turned
out that marketers and product developers
were confused about which function was responsible for making decisions about standard features and color ranges for new models. When we asked the marketing team who
had the D about which features should be
standard, 83% said the marketers did. When
we posed the same question to product developers, 64% said the responsibility rested
with them. (See the exhibit “A Recipe for a
Decision-Making Bottleneck.”)
The practical difﬁculty of connecting functions through smooth decision making crops
up frequently at retailers. John Lewis, the leading department store chain in the United Kingdom, might reasonably expect to overcome
this sort of challenge more readily than other
retailers. Spedan Lewis, who built the business
in the early twentieth century, was a pioneer in
employee ownership. A strong connection between managers and employees permeated
every aspect of the store’s operations and remained vital to the company as it grew into the
largest employee-owned business in the
United Kingdom, with 59,600 employees and
more than £5 billion in revenues in 2004.
Even at John Lewis, however, with its heritage
of cooperation and teamwork, cross-functional
decision making can be hard to sustain. Take
salt and pepper mills, for instance. John Lewis,
which prides itself on having great selection,
stocked nearly 50 SKUs of salt and pepper
mills, while most competitors stocked around
20. The company’s buyers saw an opportunity
to increase sales and reduce complexity by offering a smaller number of popular and wellchosen products in each price point and style.
When John Lewis launched the new range,
sales fell. This made no sense to the buyers
until they visited the stores and saw how the
merchandise was displayed. The buyers had
made their decision without fully involving the
sales staff, who therefore did not understand
the strategy behind the new selection. As a result, the sellers had cut shelf space in half to
match the reduction in range, rather than devoting the same amount of shelf space to
stocking more of each product.
To ﬁx the communication problem, John
Lewis needed to clarify decision roles. The buy-

page 140

<-----Page 140----->Who Has the D?

ers were given the D on how much space to allocate to each product category. If the space allocation didn’t make sense to the sales staff,
however, they had the authority to raise their
concerns and force a new round of negotiations. They also had responsibility for implementing product layouts in the stores. When
the communication was sorted out and shelf
space was restored, sales of the salt and pepper
mills climbed well above original levels.
Crafting a decision-making process that connected the buying and selling functions for salt
and pepper mills was relatively easy; rolling it
out across the entire business was more challenging. Salt and pepper mills are just one of
several hundred product categories for John
Lewis. This element of scale is one reason why
cross-functional bottlenecks are not easy to unclog. Different functions have different incentives and goals, which are often in conﬂict.
When it comes down to a struggle between
two functions, there may be good reasons to
locate the D in either place—buying or selling,
marketing or product development.
Here, as elsewhere, someone needs to think
objectively about where value is created and
assign decision roles accordingly. Eliminating
cross-functional bottlenecks actually has less to
do with shifting decision-making responsibilities between departments and more to do with
ensuring that the people with relevant information are allowed to share it. The decision
maker is important, of course, but more impor-

tant is designing a system that aligns decision
making and makes it routine.

Inside Versus Outside Partners
Decision making within an organization is hard
enough. Trying to make decisions between separate organizations on different continents
adds layers of complexity that can scuttle the
best strategy. Companies that outsource capabilities in pursuit of cost and quality advantages
face this very challenge. Which decisions
should be made internally? Which can be delegated to outsourcing partners?
These questions are also relevant for strategic partners—a global bank working with an
IT contractor on a systems development
project, for example, or a media company that
acquires content from a studio—and for companies conducting part of their business
through franchisees. There is no right answer
to who should have the power to decide what.
But the wrong approach is to assume that contractual arrangements can provide the answer.
An outdoor-equipment company based in
the United States discovered this recently
when it decided to scale up production of gas
patio heaters for the lower end of the market.
The company had some success manufacturing
high-end products in China. But with the advent of superdiscounters like Wal-Mart, Target, and Home Depot, the company realized it
needed to move more of its production overseas to feed these retailers with lower-cost of-

The Decision-Driven Organization
The deﬁning characteristic of high-performing
organizations is their ability to make good
decisions and to make them happen quickly.
The companies that succeed tend to follow a
few clear principles.
Some decisions matter more than others.
The decisions that are crucial to building
value in the business are the ones that matter
most. Some of them will be the big strategic
decisions, but just as important are the critical operating decisions that drive the business day to day and are vital to effective execution.
Action is the goal. Good decision making
doesn’t end with a decision; it ends with implementation. The objective shouldn’t be
consensus, which often becomes an obstacle
to action, but buy in.
harvard business review • january 2006

Ambiguity is the enemy. Clear accountability is essential: Who contributes input,
who makes the decision, and who carries it
out? Without clarity, gridlock and delay are
the most likely outcomes. Clarity doesn’t necessarily mean concentrating authority in a
few people; it means deﬁning who has responsibility to make decisions, who has input, and who is charged with putting them
into action.
Speed and adaptability are crucial. A
company that makes good decisions quickly
has a higher metabolism, which allows it to
act on opportunities and overcome obstacles.
The best decision makers create an environment where people can come together
quickly and efﬁciently to make the most important decisions.

Decision roles trump the organizational
chart. No decision-making structure will be
perfect for every decision. The key is to involve the right people at the right level in the
right part of the organization at the right
time.
A well-aligned organization reinforces
roles. Clear decision roles are critical, but
they are not enough. If an organization does
not reinforce the right approach to decision
making through its measures and incentives,
information ﬂows, and culture, the behavior
won’t become routine.
Practicing beats preaching. Involve the
people who will live with the new decision
roles in designing them. The very process of
thinking about new decision behaviors motivates people to adopt them.

7. Were the decisions based on appropriate facts?
8. To the extent that there were divergent facts or opinions, was it clear who had the D?

ferings. The timetable left little margin for error: The company started tooling up factories
in April and June of 2004, hoping to be ready
for the Christmas season.
Right away, there were problems. Although
the Chinese manufacturing partners understood costs, they had little idea what American
consumers wanted. When expensive designs
arrived from the head ofﬁce in the United
States, Chinese plant managers made compromises to meet contracted cost targets. They
used a lower grade material, which discolored.
They placed the power switch in a spot that
was inconvenient for the user but easier to
build. Instead of making certain parts from a
single casting, they welded materials together,
which looked terrible.
To ﬁx these problems, the U.S. executives
had to draw clear lines around which decisions
should be made on which side of the ocean.
The company broke down the design and manufacturing process into ﬁve steps and analyzed
how decisions were made at each step. The
company was also much more explicit about
what the manufacturing specs would include
and what the manufacturer was expected to do
with them. The objective was not simply to
clarify decision roles but to make sure those
roles corresponded directly to the sources of
value in the business. If a decision would affect
the look and feel of the ﬁnished product, headquarters would have to sign off on it. But if a
decision would not affect the customer’s expe-

harvard business review • january 2006

rience, it could be made in China. If, for example, Chinese engineers found a less expensive
material that didn’t compromise the product’s
look, feel, and functionality, they could make
that change on their own.
To help with the transition to this system,
the company put a team of engineers on-site in
China to ensure a smooth handoff of the specs
and to make decisions on issues that would become complex and time-consuming if elevated
to the home ofﬁce. Marketing executives in the
home ofﬁce insisted that it should take a customer ten minutes and no more than six steps
to assemble the product at home. The company’s engineers in China, along with the Chinese manufacturing team, had input into this
assembly requirement and were responsible
for execution. But the D resided with headquarters, and the requirement became a major
design factor. Decisions about logistics, however, became the province of the engineering
team in China: It would ﬁgure out how to
package the heaters so that one-third more
boxes would ﬁt into a container, which reduced shipping costs substantially.

•••
If managers suddenly realize that they’re
spending less time sitting through meetings
wondering why they are there, that’s an early
signal that companies have become better at
making decisions. When meetings start with a
common understanding about who is responsible for providing valuable input and who has
the D, an organization’s decision-making metabolism will get a boost.
No single lever turns a decision-challenged
organization into a decision-driven one, of
course, and no blueprint can provide for all the
contingencies and business shifts a company is
bound to encounter. The most successful companies use simple tools that help them recognize potential bottlenecks and think through
decision roles and responsibilities with each
change in the business environment. That’s difﬁcult to do—and even more difﬁcult for competitors to copy. But by taking some very practical steps, any company can become more
effective, beginning with its next decision.

What You Don’t Know About Making
Decisions
by David A. Garvin and Michael A. Roberto
Harvard Business Review

Even if you’ve clearly defined roles, decision
makers can experience conflict—for example,
disagreements among people who must
“Agree.” The authors present six strategies for
managing conflict in a way that promotes
smart decisions: 1) Devise and implement a
common method for resolving conflict.
2) Provide people with criteria for making
trade-offs. 3) Use escalation of conflict as an
opportunity for coaching. 4) Establish and
enforce a requirement of joint escalation—
sharing a disagreement’s escalation up the
management chain. 5) Ensure that managers
resolve escalated conflicts directly with their
counterparts. 6) Make the process for escalated conflict-resolution transparent. By applying these strategies, you integrate conflict resolution into day-to-day decision-making—
removing barriers to cross-organizational
collaboration.

The authors provide guidelines to help “Recommenders” gather high-quality input. The
key? Inquiry—carefully considering a variety
of opinions, working with others to discover
the best ideas, and stimulating creative thinking rather than suppressing disagreement. To
use inquiry, master these “three C’s”: 1) Conflict: Ask tough questions and invite people to
play devil’s advocate while evaluating your
recommendation. 2) Consideration: Ensure
that input providers perceive your decision
process as fair—by conveying openness to
new ideas, listening attentively, and explaining the rationale behind your decisions.
3) Closure: Resist any temptation to decide
too early so as to avoid extensive disagreement among input providers. But don’t delay
decision making too long, either, just because
you think you must resolve every last issue or
concern before making any decision.
