tics may provide an effective way to approximate the appropriate decisions. The use of heuristics
has also been found to be associated with innovativeness. Perhaps a critical difference between these
sets of individuals is the extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making.
We examined differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations with respect
to two biases and heuristics: overconfidence (overestimating the probability of being right) and
representativeness (the tendency to overgeneralize from a few characteristics or observations).
In this study, entrepreneurs are those who have founded their own firms and are currently
involved in the start-up process with the average time since founding of I. 7 years. The analysis for
this study involved responses from 124 entrepreneurs. Managers are individuals with middle to
upper level responsibilities with substantial oversight in large organizations. To be included in this
study, the managers had to oversee at least two functional areas (sample average was 4.55 functional
areas). Usable responses were received from 95 managers.
The results from the logistic regression analysis show strong support for both hypotheses. Even
after controlling for numerous factors, such as several traits and demographic factors, enduring
support was found for the way entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations make decisions.
Our overconfidence and representativeness variables correctly categorized entrepreneurs and managers more than 70% of the time. Thus, this research indicates that entrepreneurs do behave differently than do managers in large organizations and that these differences are substantial.
Practically, we speculate that without the use of biases and heuristics, many entrepreneurial
decisions would never be made. With entrepreneurial ventures in particular, the window ofopportunity would often be gone by the time all the necessary information became available for more rational decision-making. Additionally, successfully starting a new business usually involves overcoming multiple hurdles. Using biases and heuristics as simplifying mechanisms for dealing with these
multiple problems may be crucial. To face such hurdles from a strict econometric approach would
not only postpone decisions, but would in all likelihood make them overwhelming. More specifically, overconfidence may be particularly beneficial in implementing a specific decision and persuading others to be enthusiastic about it as well.
The use of biases and heuristics may also offer some help in explaining why entrepreneurs
sometimes make bad managers. Whereas the use of cognitive biases may be beneficial in some circumstances, it can lead to major errors in others. Although research has yet to establish performance
implications, it is possible that the more extensive use of heuristics in strategic decision-making may
be a great advantage during the start-up years. However, it may also lead to the demise of a business
as a firm matures. © 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Casual observation suggests that individuals who start their own organizations are
somehow different from those that work in large organizations. Entrepreneurs have
been described as risk-takers and rugged individualists (Begley and Boyd 1987;
McGrath et al. 1992), as engaging in deviate social behavior (Shapero 1975), and as
being a "breed apart" (Ginsberg and Buchholtz 1989). In contrast, managers in large
organizations have been described as being risk averse (Amihud and Lev 1981), adhering to broadly accepted norms of behavior (Pettigrew 1973), and more professional and
predictable in their decision-making (Barnard 1968; Hofer and Schendel 1978).
These casual observations have not gone untested in the research literature. Unfortunately, most efforts to empirically describe differences between entrepreneurs and
managers in large organizations have met with limited success (Low and MacMillan
1988). These results have led many researchers to abandon the search for individual
differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations (Gartner 1988)
and to look for explanations of entrepreneurial phenomena elsewhere (Aldrich and

<-----Page 2----->ENTREPRENEURS VS MANAGERS

11

Zimmer 1986). And yet, the observation that these differences exist continues (e.g., Bird
1988; Ginsberg and Buchholtz 1989).
The purpose of this study is to further explore differences between entrepreneurs
and managers in large organizations. However, rather than focusing on previously examined individual differences, this study examines differences in the decision-making
processes used by entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. Building on nonrational decision-making models from behavioral decision theory (Pitz and Sachs 1984;
Stevenson et al. 1990), we argue that the use of bias and heuristics may explain significant
portions of the variations in strategic decision-making (Haley and Stumpf 1989). More
specifically, we argue that entrepreneurs use biases and heuristics more extensively in
their strategic decision-making than do managers in large organizations. We examine
differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations with respect
to two biases and heuristics: overconfidence and representativeness (Tversky and Kahneman 1974; Hogarth 1987; Bazerman 1990).

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Previous research on differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations has generally examined psychological and personal/demographic differences.
After a great deal of research (e:g., McClelland 1961; Brockhaus 1980; Schere 1982),
it is now often concluded that most of the psychological differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations are small or nonexistent (Brockhaus and
Horwitz 1986; Low and MacMillan 1988).
In the psychological differences literature, a wide variety of individual psychological attributes, including locus of control and risk-taking, has been shown not to vary
significantly between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations (Begley and
Boyd 1987; Sexton and Bowman 1984). Some relatively small but consistent psychological differences have been documented such as need for achievement, tolerance for ambiguity, and need for conformity (Begley and Boyd 1987; Miner et al. 1989). Despite the
fact that very few studies have shown statistically significant differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations in their risk-taking propensity (Brockhaus
1980, Low and MacMillan 1988), this individual psychological difference continues to
be discussed as an important variable for understanding entrepreneurial behavior (e.g.,
Stevenson and Gumpert 1985; Ray 1994).
Research focusing on personal/demographic differences between these types of individuals has also been met with limited success. Cooper and Dunkelberg (1987) concluded from their large sample that such differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations are quite small and rarely systematic. Despite these findings,
age, gender, and education are several personal/demographic differences that continue
to receive attention in the entrepreneurship literature (Robinson and Sexton 1994).
There have been three fairly distinct responses to the failure to discover systematic
psychological and personal/demographic differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. First, some have argued that this failure represents inadequate methodology (Ginsberg and Buchholtz 1989). Unfortunately, the application of
more sophisticated methods has done little to alter earlier findings.
Second, others have argued that the search for individual differences should be
abandoned, in favor of research that focuses on external causes of entrepreneurial behavior (Acs and Audretsch 1987; Aldrich and Zimmer 1986; Gartner 1988; Shapero

<-----Page 3----->12

L.W. BUSENITZ AND J.B. BARNEY

1984). Unfortunately, this more externally oriented work has been unable to completely
abandon the individual differences approach. For example, many economists have argued that entrepreneurial behavior is caused by market imperfections that create an
opportunity for entrepreneurs to earn above average economic wealth (Hebert and
Link 1988). While emphasizing external market forces in motivating entrepreneurial
activity, these models fail to explain why some individuals are able to perceive and exploit these opportunities, whereas others are not. This has led some economists to acknowledge that entrepreneurs have "special aptitudes" (Schumpeter 1934), "special
resources" (Schultz 1975), and unusual levels of "alertness" to economic opportunities
(Kirzner 1973; Kaish and Gilad 1991). Unfortunately, the sources of these individual
differences are left largely unexplained in economic models of entrepreneurship.
Finally, another group of scholars continues to assert that individual differences
exist between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. However, this group
generally suggests that previous research has examined the "wrong" individual differences (e.g., Robinson et al. 1991). Rather then examining psychological and personal!
demographic differences, this group of scholars suggests the importance of examining
differences in behavior between these sets of individual (Gartner et al. 1992). Research
is increasingly focusing on the more behavioral approach (e.g., Covin and Slevin 1991;
Miller 1983; Manimala 1992; Zahra 1993). Robinson et al. (1991) developed several attitudinal scales for predicting behavioral tendencies. This study is consistent with this last
group of scholars, particularly that of Manimala (1992) who identified 186 examples
of very specific heuristics used by entrepreneurs. Our intent is to better understand the
decision-making style of entrepreneurs. More specifically, we probe why entrepreneurs
and managers in large organizations may vary in the extent to which they manifest biases
and heuristics in their strategic decision-making. In this study, entrepreneurs are those
who have founded their own firms. Managers are individuals with middle to upper level
responsibilities with substantial oversight in large organizations.

THEORY
Biases, Heuristics, and Entrepreneurial Decision-Making: Previous Work
Since Simon's (1955) early work, organizational scholars have recognized that managerial decision-making often falls short of the purely rational model (e.g., Haley and
Stumpf 1989) Several factors that prevent purely rational decision-making have been
cited, including: (1) the high costs of such decision-making efforts (Simon 1979), (2)
information-processing limits of decision-makers (Abelson and Levi 1985), (3) differences in decision-making procedures adopted by managers (Shafer 1986), and (4) differences in the values of decision-makers (Payne et al. 1992).
One of the most important classes of models that explain deviations from rational
decision-making focuses on biases and heuristics (Kahneman et al. 1982; Schwenk 1988;
Stevenson et al. 1990). Biases and heuristics are decision rules, cognitive mechanisms,
and subjective opinions people use to assist in making decisions. Frequently, the use
of biases and heuristics yields acceptable solutions to problems for individuals in an
effective and efficient manner. In this study, the term "biases and heuristics" is used
to refer to these simplifying strategies that individuals use to make decisions, especially
in uncertain and complex conditions.
Although most previous research has been conducted in laboratory conditions, a

<-----Page 4----->ENTREPRENEURS VS MANAGERS

13

broad range of empirical findings suggests that most decision-makers apply biases and
heuristics to simplify their decision-making most of the time (Bateman and Zeithaml
1989; Jackson and Dutton 1988; Kahneman et al. 1982; Zajac and Bazerman 1991) and
that inquiry into such behavior is critical for understanding strategic decision-making
(Bazerman 1990; Cowen 1991; Schwenk 1988). This research is also consistent with this
observation. However, we acknowledge the possibility that all decision-makers may not
be subject to these biases and heuristics in their decision-making to the same degree.
In support of this research direction, decision-makers have recently been found to have
different cognitive trails (Haley and Stumpf 1989; Stumpf and Dunbar 1991). Furthermore, Bazerman and Neale (1983, p. 317) noted in their review that although individuals
are generally affected by systematic deviations from rationality, some individuals appear to be more accurate in their interpersonal judgments or less influenced by the frame
of the situation. The possibility that there may be differences in the extent to which
decision-makers are subject to biases and heuristics suggests an interesting possibility
for research on differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations.
Biases and heuristics may be particularly critical for explaining variations in strategic
decisions (Haley and Stumpf 1989). Perhaps a critical difference between these two sets
of individuals is the extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making.

Differences in the Use of Bias and Heuristics
To understand why entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations may vary in the
extent to which they manifest biases and heuristics in their decision-making, it is important to understand the utility of non-rational decision-making. Under conditions of environmental uncertainty and complexity, biases and heuristics can be an effective and
efficient guide to decision-making (Pitz and Sachs 1984). In such settings, more comprehensive and cautious decision-making is not possible, and biases and heuristics may provide an effective way to approximate the appropriate decisions (Tversky and Kahneman
1974; Haley and Stumpf 1989). Also, entrepreneurship has been characterized as an
"enactment" process where acting precedes thinking (Gartner et al. 1992; Weick 1979).
In this sense, entrepreneurship is more a function of actions taken than some objective
set of conditions.

Decision Uncertainty
On average, the level of uncertainty facing entrepreneurs in making decisions is greater
than the level of uncertainty facing managers in large organizations in making decisions
(Hambrick and Crozier 1985; Covin and Slevin 1989). At the very least, managers in
large organizations usually have access to historical trends, past performance, and other
information that can help reduce the level of uncertainty they face in making decisions
(Mintzberg 1973). Moreover, this information can reduce the level of uncertainty facing
decision-makers in large firms at relatively low costs (Thompson 1967). In this sense,
managers in large organizations can more closely approximate the rational ideal in their
decision-making.
Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, often have to make decisions where there are
no historical trends, no previous levels of performance, and little if any specific market
information (Miller and Friesen 1984). Just the decision to start a venture based on a

<-----Page 5----->14

L.W. BUSENITZ AND J.B. BARNEY

new product or service involves making numerous decisions for which there is little or no
hard information. Furthermore, the market's acceptance of the new product or service
almost always contains a great deal of uncertainty. However, efforts by entrepreneurs
to reduce their uncertainty in decision-making are likely to be very costly and usually
not terribly effective. And yet, decisions still need to be made if the venture is going
to be launched or to quickly move forward once the venture has started (Eisenhardt
1989; Miller 1983; Wally and Baum 1994). A greater use of biases and heuristics facilitates a perceived sense of overall understanding and a sense that the "rules ofthe game"
are now understood. Thus, we argue that those who are more susceptible to the use
of biases and heuristics in decision-making are the very ones who are most likely to
become entrepreneurs. The more cautious decision-makers will tend to be attracted
to larger organizations where more methodical information tends to be more readily
available. Entrepreneurial activities simply become too overwhelming to those who are
less willing to generalize through the use of bias and heuristics.

Decision Complexity
Not only are the decisions made by entrepreneurs, on average, made in a more uncertain
environment then decisions made by managers in large organizations, the decision-making context facing entrepreneurs also tends to be more complex then that facing managers in large organizations (Covin and Slevin 1991; Gartner et al. 1992; Miller and Friesen
1984). Whereas they may have some potential pitfalls, biases and heuristics are likely to
have more utility in these highly complex decision settings, compared with less complex
decision settings (Pitz and Sachs 1984; Tversky and Kahneman 1974).
Large organizations develop elaborate policies and procedures to aid managers in
their decision-making. Nelson and Winter (1982) call these decision-making practices
"routines" and emphasize the ability of routines to simplify the decision-making complexity facing managers. In addition to these routines, large organizations adopt elaborate organizational charts that define areas of decision-making responsibility. These limits have the effect of reducing the complexity of the decision-making context facing a
firm, thus enabling managers in large organizations not to rely on biases and heuristics
as much.
Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, usually have not developed the elaborate decision-making policies and procedures characteristic of large firms (Fredrickson and Iaquinto 1989). In this context, simplifying biases and heuristics may have a great deal
of utility in enabling entrepreneurs to make decisions that exploit brief windows of opportunity (Tversky and Kahneman 1974; Hambrick and Crozier 1985; Stevenson and
Gumpert 1985). Furthermore, entrepreneurs are often opportunists, acting on an idea
with limited information (Gartner et al. 1992). In doing so, they must convince numerous
stakeholders of the credibility of the venture. Using base rate probabilities to justify
their entrepreneurial ventures is usually meaningless.
It is important to recognize that we are not arguing that the decisions facing managers in large organizations are not uncertain or complex. Clearly, they often are. Rather,
all we are arguing is that, on average, decisions made by entrepreneurs tend to be more
uncertain and more complex than the decisions made by managers in large organizations. Also, without some unsubstantiated enthusiasm, many ventures would never be
started or would quickly die following their start-up. This logic that biases and heuristics
may have more utility for entrepreneurs is consistent with findings suggesting that entre-

<-----Page 6----->ENTREPRENEURS VS MANAGERS

15

preneurial posture and proactive ness are positively related to performance (Covin and
Slevin 1989; Zahra 1993). Thus, those who make greater use of biases and heuristics
in their decision-making are more likely to find themselves in an entrepreneurial context. By doing so, they should be able to filter through more information and more effectively communicate to various stakeholders the legitimacy of the venture.

Specific Decision-Making Differences
As previously suggested, a large number of biases and heuristics have been studied in
the nonrational decision-making literature (Hogarth 1987; Bazerman 1990). From
among all these biases and heuristics, we chose to examine differences between these
sets of individuals with reference to two biases and heuristics: overconfidence and representativeness. Overconfidence was chosen because it is considered somewhat characteristic of a number of other biases and heuristics identified in the literature (Kahneman
et al. 1982). Representativeness is one of more widely used heuristics (Pitz and Sachs
1984; Barnes 1984; Katz 1992) and is a good indicator of how quickly one is likely to
generalize from a single or limited number of experiences (Schwenk 1988).

Overconfidence
First described by Oskamp (1965), overconfidence has been shown to exist in a wide
variety of settings (Lichtenstein and Fischoff 1977; Bazerman 1990). Overconfidence
exists when decision-makers are overly optimistic in their initial assessment of a situation, and then are slow to incorporate additional information about a situation into their
assessmentbecause of their initial overconfidence (Fischhoff et al. 1977; Alpert and
Raiffa 1982). For example, Fischhoff et al. (1977) found that subjects who assigned odds
of 1000:1 of being correct were correct only 81 % of the time. Most decision-makers
are overconfident in their estimation abilities and do not acknowledge the actual uncertainty that exists (Bazerman 1990). Furthermore, decision-makers are generally slow
to incorporate additional information because of their confidence in their existing assumptions and opinions (Phillips and Wright 1977; Russo and Schoemaker 1989).
A priori, overconfidence seems likely to manifest itself in decisions made by entrepreneurs to a greater extent than in decision made by managers in large organizations.
Overconfidence enables an entrepreneur to proceed with an idea before all the steps
to that specific venture are fully known. Even though enormous uncertainties exist in
this decision-making situation (e.g., is there a real economic opportunity to be exploited,
how should that opportunity be exploited, how large is this opportunity, how will competitors react to this opportunity), a higher level of confidence is likely to encourage an
entrepreneur to take action before it makes complete sense. Furthermore, being more
optimistic than the data would suggest may serve to convince other potential stakeholders (such as investors, suppliers, customers, key employees) of the opportunity that affords them if they get in on the ground floor of the venture. Put differently, if entrepreneurs wait until all the "facts" are in to start convincing others that their venture is
indeed legitimate, the opportunity they are seeking to exploit will most likely be gone
by the time more complete data becomes available (Stevenson and Gumpert 1985).
Mangers in large organizations, on the other hand, do not have to rely on their personal
confidence in making decisions to as great an extent. Rather, these mangers can rely on
decision-making tools and historical performance patterns to convince top management

<-----Page 7----->16

L.W. BUSENITZ AND J.B. BARNEY

that their projects should have priority. These observations lead to the following hypothesis:
HI: Entrepreneurs will manifest more overconfidence than will managers in
large organizations.

Previous research provides some empirical support for Hl. For example, Cooper et al.
(1988) found that entrepreneurs assigned a higher probability of success to their own
ventures compared with competing ventures. This is consistent with entrepreneurs having an unreasonably high level of confidence in their own decision-making ability. Also,
Manimala (1992) found that entrepreneurs do manifest such tendencies in their decision-making. Although suggestive, this research only indicates that entrepreneurs do
manifest overconfidence. However, as suggested earlier, most research on nonrational
decision-making suggests that most decision-makers manifest various biases and heuristicsincluding overconfidenceto some extent. Unfortunately, this previous research does
not examine whether or not entrepreneurs are more overconfident then managers in
large organizations.

Representativeness
Representativeness was first described by Tversky and Kahneman (1971) and is one of
the most common of all decision-making biases and heuristics (Hogarth 1987). Decisionmakers manifest this heuristic when they are willing to generalize about a person or
a phenomenon based on only a few attributes of that person or only a few observations
of a specified phenomenon (Nisbett and Ross 1980; Bazerman 1990). A wide variety of
problems has been developed to test representativeness with studies repeatedly showing
that subjects consistently ignore base rate information (e.g., Bar-Hillel 1979; Tversky
and Kahneman 1974). Decision-makers consistently underestimate the error and unreliability inherent in small samples of data (Payne et al. 1992).
The particular form of representativeness examined here is a willingness of decision-makers to generalize from small, nonrandom samples (Tversky and Kahneman
1971). The law of large numbers suggests that large random samples can be used to
make rigorous inferences about popUlation statistics. However, sometimes, decisionmakers are willing to make such inferences, not from large random samples, but from
small, nonrandom samples. The most common type of small nonrandom sample used
as a basis for generalization is, of course, personal experience (Kahneman et al. 1982).
Again, there is reason to believe that representativeness, and especially the willingness to generalize from small, nonrandom samples, is a decision-making short cut that
may be particularly common in entrepreneurial settings (Katz 1992). In such setting,
large random samples to reliably estimate customer demand, production costs, and
other key pieces of information are rarely available. Nor do most entrepreneurs have
the resources (including the time) to engage in such systematic data collection. Indeed,
such systematic data collection activities might prematurely reveal an entrepreneurs
products and technologies to competitors, thereby reducing the return potential of those
products and technologies to competitors (Porter 1980). In this setting, entrepreneurs
must be willing to rely on small, nonrandom samplesin particular, their personal experience with current and potential customersto guide their decision-making. Of course,
managers in large organizations have to rely less on these nonrandom samples, and thus,

<-----Page 8----->ENTREPRENEURS VS MANAGERS

17

on average, will be able to more closely approximate purely rational decision-making.
These observations lead to the following hypothesis:
H2: Entrepreneurs will manifest representativeness more extensively in their decision-making than will managers in large organizations.

As with overconfidence, Manimala's (1992) research indicates that entrepreneurs do
manifest representativeness in their decision-making. However, Manimala fails to examine the extent to which entrepreneurs manifest this decision-making short cut in comparison with other decision-makers, including managers in large organizations.

METHODS
Samples
As implied by these hypotheses, samples from two populations were drawn: a sample
of entrepreneurs and a sample of managers in large organizations. Survey research was
used to collect the primary data.

Sample of Entrepreneurs
The sales tax file of a state comptroller's office was used to identify potential entrepreneurs, because it has been found to be a superior source for identifying new businesses
(Busenitz and Murphy In Press). These files contain the name and address of the organization, owner, organization type, SIC code, and date of first sale. A sample of firms
showing a date of first sale within the past two years and having an SIC code in the
2800,2900,3000,3500,3600,3700, and 3800 categories was selected. These SIC categories include the manufacturing of plastics, electronics, and instruments. A priori, it was
thought that these categories would represent a higher percentage of newly emerging
firms, because they represent more dynamic industries. This procedure resulted in a
sample of 573 firms. A mail questionnaire was developed and sent to the identified sample, and 176 responses were received for a 31 % response rate.
Because, historically, identifying entrepreneurs has been somewhat problematic
(Gartner 1988), we wanted to be more precise in our operationalization. Our operationalization consisted of two dimensions. First, respondents had to have been a founder
of the identified firm. Being responsible for an independent start-up is widely used as
a distinguishing feature of entrepreneurship (e.g., Begley and Boyd 1987; Cooper et
al. 1988; Miner et al. 1989) and thus was used here as a prerequisite for inclusion in
the sample for this study. With the second dimension, subjects had to be currently involved in the start-up process. This was operationalized by requiring subjects to have
started their venture within the last two years and/or currently planning on starting another venture within the next five years. These restrictions resulted in 124 usable responses. The average time since founding for the entrepreneurs included in this sample
was 1.7 years. To test for a biased response, nonrespondents were compared with respondents based on the two-digit SIC categories identified previously. The results from
the chi-square test suggested that the usable response was not biased (X 2 (5) = 1.782;
p = .878).

<-----Page 9----->18 L.W. BUSENITZ AND J.B. BARNEY

Sample of Managers in Large Organizations
In this study, managers in large organizations were defined as individuals who have responsibility for at least two functional areas (such as marketing, finance, personnel, research and development, and manufacturing) and work for publicly owned organizations with more than 10,000 employees. These managers are often referred to as
divisional managers or general managers because they oversee multiple functional areas
(e.g., marketing, research and development, accounting, manufacturing). Contact was
made with three organizations, and two agreed to participate in the study. Data collection was coordinated through the human resource departments of the respective organizations with a company cover letter attached. To be included in this sample, the managers had to oversee at least two functional areas (sample average was 4.55 functional
areas). A usable response rate of 54 % was received. The SIC for the managers included
in this sample came from the 1300, 3400, 3500, 3600, and 3800. 1 The results of the chisquare test between usable responses and nonrespondents again suggest that the response was not biased (X 2 (4) = 3.973; p = .59).

Measures
The central goal of this study was to measure the use of biases and heuristics as a part
of the decision-making style of entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations.
Thus, some diversity of decision problems was sought to give a better representation of
the decision style in a specific context of these two groups of strategic decision-makers.

Overconfidence
To measure overconfidence, the procedure used in the widely cited studies conducted
by Fischhoff et al. (1977) and Lichtenstein and Fischhoff (1977) was replicated. A series
of five questions based on death rates from various diseases and accidents in the United
States was developed. All items were dichotomous in nature with the general form of
"Which cause of death is more frequent in the United States? A. Cancer of all types, B.
Heart disease." One of the two choices is correct based on the most recent vital statistics
report prepared by the National Center for Health Statistics. Subjects were asked to
make two responses to each item. First, they were to choose one of the two alternatives
as their best guess of the correct alternative. Second, they indicated, on a provided scale
ranging from 50% to 100% the level of confidence they had in their answer. In the instructions, they were told that 50% would indicate that their answer was a total guess,
whereas 70% would indicate that they thought they had seven chances in 10 of being
correct. A response of 100% would indicate that they were totally confident that their
choice was right. Again, in taking our cues from the earlier work of Lichtenstein and
Fischhoff (1977), all "level of confidence" responses were grouped into one of six probability categories: 0.50-0.59,0.60-0.69,0.70-0.79,0.80-0.89,0.90-0.99, and 1.00 for analyI Not only do these industries largely coincide with those from which our entrepreneurs came, but they
are also industries characterized by high levels of research and development. Also, both organizations we
sampled in these industries claimed that they attempted to recruit "intrapreneurial" managers into their organizations. The choice of these firms creates a conservative test of our individual differences hypotheses since
entrepreneurial type individuals tend to be attracted to these industries.

sis purposes. Those probability responses that were in the 0.50-0.59 range were coded
as 0.50, 0.60-0.69 responses as 0.60, etc.
Two primary measures were computed from this information. The first is what
Fischhoff et al. (1977) referred to as the group calibration curve. This curve reveals how
closely the designated probability score for each category (0.50, 0.60, etc.) and for each
group (in this case entrepreneurs versus managers in large organizations) approximates
the perfectly calibrated curve. For example, for all responses in the 0.70 category, perfect
calibration would be reflected in correct responses to the dichotomous part of the question seven out of 10 times. If all the responses in the 0.70 category were correct only
60% of the time, one would conclude that the designated group was overconfident in
that category.
For the purpose of statistical analyses on each observation, a second score was computed. Again, following the lead of Fischhoff et al. (1977), this was done by noting the
mean probability response across all items for each subject and the percentage of items
for which the correct alternative was selected. The difference between these two scores
then becomes a measure of over- or underconfidence (a positive score indicates overconfidence, whereas a negative score indicates underconfidence). For example, a respondent who answered 0.50, 0.60, 0.70, 0.70, and 0.90 and gave the correct answer three
out of five times would receive an overconfidence score of 0.08 (mean of 0.68 minus 0.60).

Representativeness
To measure the representativeness, we followed the approach used by Fong et al. (1986)
and Fong and Nisbett (1991) in which subjects were given scenarios representing various
types of real-to-life strategic decisions. As in the scenarios developed by Fong and colleagues, both of our scenario problems portrayed a strategic decision pitting two alternatives against one another. One alternative was based on quantitative/statistical information, whereas the other was based on heuristic reasoning. Problem 1 involved the
purchase of a major piece of equipment, whereas problem 2 depicted an automation
update decision (see Appendix for these two problems). Subjects were told to decide
between the two alternatives for each problem and then to describe their reasoning for
reaching the designated decision. Coders then analyzed these responses to determine
whether heuristic type reasoning was used by the respondents to answer these scenarios.
The coding schema used to analyze the responses also closely paralleled that of
Fong et al. (1986) and Fong and Nisbett (1991). A code of "I" was given for responses
that contained no mention of statistical reasoning, but relied instead on subjective opinions or simple rules of thumb. Examples of this form of reasoning included reference
to personal experience or simple decision rules like "buy American" and "personal
experience." A code of "0" was given for responses that contained some form of statistical reasoning, including references to variability or sample size. An additional category
was added because some responses from the subjects of this study were uncategorizable
based on the Fong et al. (1986) criteria. These 17 uncategorizable responses were omitted from subsequent analyses.
After some initial training, all responses were coded blind to conditions according
to these criteria by two individuals (one of the authors and a graduate student). There
was exact agreement between coder 1 and coder 2 84 % of the time across the two problems. In cases where disagreement existed, the evaluation of a third coder (another grad-

uate student) was used to resolve the disparity. These results were then summed across
the two problems to create a single three-category variable (0-2). A "0" indicated that
an individual used statistical reasoning across both problems, whereas a "2" indicated
that only heuristic reasoning was used.

Control Variables
Although previous research on differences between entrepreneurs and managers in
large organizations has generated mixed results, we chose to include various measures
of these variables. Also, a measure of economic alertness has been included, because
it has been used to help explain entrepreneurial activity and could impact decisionmaking.

Risk- Taking and Conformity
The psychological trait of risk-taking propensity was included because risk is so commonly associated with entrepreneurial activity. Conformity, although not studied as frequently as risk-taking, has received some consistent empirical support. These two traits
were assessed by using the Jackson Personality Inventory (Jackson 1976). Jackson
(1977) reported reliability coefficients of 0.81-0.84 for risk-taking and 0.81-0.82 for conformity in terms of scale homogeneity and test-retest stability. Sexton and Bowman
(1984) reduced this risk-taking scale to eight items to better accommodate survey research. The utilization of this eight-item risk-taking scale yielded a Kuder-Richardson20 (KR-20) reliability coefficient of 0.77 in this study. A KR-20 of 0.70 was obtained
for the conformity factor.

Personal/Demographic Characteristics
Age and education information was also collected, since entrepreneurship has been examined from this perspective. Additionally, it is conceivable that age and/or greater
amounts of education may impact the use of biases and heuristics. Age was simply measured by asking for their birth year. Education was measured using a five-point scale
ranging from high school or less to a graduate degree.

Economic Factors
Some have argued that economic concerns are what encourage entrepreneurial activity.
In the context of this study, factors involving risk and profit concerns and alertness to
economic opportunities may impact entrepreneurial decision-making. Kaish and Gilad
(1991) recently developed several scales to measure these factors. However, due to low
reliability estimates for the economic risk cue and economic profits scales received in
this study (0.47 and 0.57 respectively), they were omitted from further analyses. Kaish
and Gilad (1991) also developed measures of "alertness" to economic opportunities
(Kirzner 1973). The nonverbal search or reading alertness for economic opportunity
generated a Cronbach's alpha reliability rating of 0.81 in this study. A second factor
measuring open thinking about new ideas received a reliability rating of 0.52 in this
study and thus was dropped from further analysis.

ENTREPRENEURS VS MANAGERS

RESULTS
Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients among
all variables. These correlations show that the overconfidence and representativeness
variables are related to one's vocation (entrepreneurs versus managers in large organizations), indicating preliminary support for both hypotheses.
Further bivariate analysis was conducted with the overconfidence variable. The calibration curve shown in Figure 1 represents the aggregated results of the number of
correct responses in each category (50%, 60%, 100%) divided by the total number of
responses in each category. For example, if all the responses in the 0.70% category given
by managers were correct seven out of 10 times, then one would conclude that as a
group they tend to be perfectly calibrated (at least in that category). The charting of
these two curves in Figure 1 indicates that entrepreneurs are overconfident in their
choices in five out of the six probability categories, whereas managers were overconfident only three out of the six categories. Additionally, entrepreneurs were more overconfident than managers in large organizations in each of the categories except in the
0.8 range probability where they were very nearly identical.
Further analysis was conducted with the overconfidence and representativeness
variables. Because the dependent variable in this model is dichotomous, logistic regression was used as the primary test afHl and H2 (Aldrich and Nelson 1984). In this study,
the dependent variable represented the entrepreneur versus manager in a large organization (coded "2" and "I" respectively).
Given the coding of the dependent variable, the coefficients for the overconfidence
and representativeness variables should be positive and significant. Table 2 presents
the results of the logistic regression analysis. Model 1 tested the overconfidence and
representativeness variables by themselves. Both variables are significant and in the expected direction. These two variables by themselves correctly predicted entrepreneur
versus manager more than 70% of the time.
Further examination of Table 1 suggests little collinearity among independent variables. However, several moderate intercorrelations involving control variables suggest
that including these variables in an analysis would be important. The results of this analysis are shown in model 2 of Table 2. Of the control variables, education, conformity,
and alertness remain statistically significant. The risk-taking and age variables were nonsignificant. Overall, these results support the emerging consensus that psychological,
personal/demographic, and broader social and economic factors have a limited ability to

distinguish entrepreneurs from managers in large organizations (the hit ratio reported in
Table 2 only improved 9% with the inclusion of the control variables). More importantly
for this study, continuing support was found for HI and H2. Even after controlling for
previously examined factors, the overconfidence and representativeness measures remain statistically significant and help distinguish between entrepreneurs and managers
in large organizations.
To ensure that an industry effect was not confounding the results, a subanalysis
was conducted. Based on the two-digit SIC classification, eight different industries were
represented by these two samples. However, 62 % of the entrepreneurs and 86 % of the
managers in large organizations came from three industries (3500, 3600, and 3800). As
these three industries are closely related (industrial and commercial machinery and
computer equipment; electronic equipment and components; and measuring, analyzing,
and controlling instruments) and they represent the majority of the two samples, the

full logistic regression model id~ntified earlier was again tested with this subsample.
Overconfidence and representativeness still remain significant at the same levels as with
the full samples reported previously. The only significant change was with the alertness
variable. With the full samples reported in Table 2, it was not quite significant at the
.05 level, whereas with the subsample, it did turn significant.

DISCUSSION
These results have several important implications, both for research and for practice. These implications are discussed below.

Theoretical Implications
Common experience suggests that entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations
are, somehow, different from each other. It has been somewhat disconcerting that most
academic efforts at discovering the sources of these experienced differences have met
with limited success. This study presents empirical evidence suggesting that entrepreneurs do behave differently than managers in large organizations and that these differences are substantial. By applying the theory of biases and heuristics, this study has
shown that entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations think differently.
This field study has important implications for future work on biases and heuristics.
In particular, most previous work has focused on understanding whether specific biases
and heuristics exist and the conditions that affect their usage (Abelson and Levi 1985;
Stevenson et al. 1990). This research accepts this general premise and moves to another
question: Do individuals vary in the extent to which biases and heuristics operate in
their decision-making? The results of this study suggest that the extent to which decision-makers deviate from the strict econometric approach may not be a constant and
that different individuals may utilize biases and heuristics to different degrees.

<-----Page 15----->24 L.W. BUSENITZ AND J.B. BARNEY

Of course, this research only examines two biases and heuristics: overconfidence
and representativeness. Other biases and heuristics already identified in the literature
may also differentiate between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. Future research will need to examine other biases and heuristics to more completely explain the differences between entrepreneurs and managers in large organizations. Also,
future research will need to refine current measures of biases and heuristics, to examine
not only if these phenomena exist, but also the extent to which they vary among individuals and organizations. Finally, additional samples of entrepreneurs and managers in
large organizations should be examined to ensure the generalizability of the findings
reported here.
In addition to extending this research to examine other kinds of biases and heuristics, future work will need to examine whether the use of biases and heuristics in strategic
decision-making remains stable over time. Some have argued that biases and heuristics
are often applied in an unconscious manner (Tversky and Kahneman 1981) and thus
are relatively immune from change or modification. Alternatively, others have reasoned
that decision biases can be corrected through training (e.g., Russo and Schoemaker
1989; Fong and Nisbett 1991). If the use of biases and heuristics are stable over time,
then it would follow that those who are uncomfortable with heuristic-based decisionmaking, on average, will be attracted and selected into larger firms where this type of
decision-making is less frequently required. On the other hand, those who are comfortable with creating and relying on these decision-making short cuts are likely to be attracted to entrepreneurial settings where these decision skills are best utilized (Schneider 1987; Haley and Stumpf 1989). An assumption future research could address is
whether individuals with different decision preferences will naturally and efficiently select into organizational contexts where those preferences are valued and accepted, i.e.,
into entrepreneurial firms or larger organizations. Future research should also explore
if the use of biases and heuristics effectively helps with career placement decisions.
This research on biases and heuristics also potentially helps resolve some counterintuitive conclusions from previous work on risk. Few themes are as synonymous with
entrepreneurship as risk, and yet, remain so clouded. Entrepreneurs clearly accept
higher levels of risk in their careers and business decisions than managers in large organizations (Bird 1989), yet empirical evidence surrounding this phenomenon is diverse
and often weak. For example, many psychological-based studies have shown that the
risk-taking propensity of entrepreneurs is not greater than that of managers in large
organizations (Brockhaus 1980; Low and MacMillan 1988). Thus, most academicians
hold that entrepreneurs do not differ substantially in their risk-taking propensity (e.g.,
Ray 1994). This conclusion is widely held even though it is clear that entrepreneurs are
generally involved in starting ventures that are more likely to fail than succeed. This
contradiction is frequently resolved by characterizing entrepreneurs as risk accepters
(versus risk seekers or risk averse). Thus, the focus has shifted toward understanding how to manage the risk inherent in an entrepreneurial opportunity (Bird 1989;
Ray 1994).
For understanding entrepreneurial behavior, the issue may not be one of risk propensity or the sensitivity to probability estimates of possible outcomes, but rather how
entrepreneurs think about the decisions they make surrounding the business opportunities they undertake (Ray 1994). It may be that entrepreneurs are more susceptible to
the use of biases and heuristics and are likely to perceive less risk in a given decision

<-----Page 16----->ENTREPRENEURS VS MANAGERS

25

situation than are managers in large organizations in the same situation. By being more
willing to generalize from limited experience (representativeness) and by feeling overconfident that they will be able to master the major obstacles, entrepreneurs may conclude that a situation is simply less risky than would managers in large organizations.
Thus, it may not be the differences in risk propensity that distinguish entrepreneurs
from managers in large organizations, but the ways they perceive and think about risk.
Finally, these observations have a potentially important impact in analyzing the
relationship between decision-making and performance. Tversky and Kahneman
(1974) noted that the use of heuristics may actually improve decisions by noting that
they are "quite useful" (p. 1124); that they are "valuable estimation procedure[s]" (p.
1128) and that they "are highly economical and usually effective" (p. 1131). Nonetheless, such claims are typically followed by warnings that heuristics may also "lead to
severe and systematic errors" (p. 1131). Rarely if ever do Tversky and Kahneman give
examples of heuristics working well. However, if different individuals and organizations
are cognitively biased in different ways, then they may make strategic choices in fundamentally different ways (Stumpf and Dunbar 1991). If these cognitive biases are difficult
to change, they may represent sources of sustained differences among individuals and
firms. Such differences, in the field of strategic management, have been shown to be
sources of sustained competitive advantage and sustained competitive disadvantage
(Barney 1991). By recognizing that strategic decisions can be nonrational in different
ways, this research points to a possible connection between cognitive theories of decision-making, strategic management, and firm performance. Of course, additional research will need to be conducted to examine these potential linkages.

Practical Implications
There are several practical implications that emerge from this study as well. We suspect
that without these biases and heuristics, many decisions would never be made. In entrepreneurial ventures, in particular, the window of opportunity would often be gone by the
time all the necessary information became available for more rational decision-making.
Additionally, successfully starting a new business usually involves overcoming multiple
hurdles. Using biases and heuristics as simplifying mechanisms for dealing with these
mUltiple problems may be crucial. To face such hurdles from a strict econometric approach would not only postpone decisions, but would in all likelihood make them overwhelming. More specifically, a greater degree of overconfidence may be particularly
beneficial in implementing a specific decision and persuading others to be enthusiastic
about it as well (Russo and Schoemaker 1989).
As an illustration of the possible benefits of using biases and heuristics in decisionmaking, consider the following. One entrepreneur from our sample wrote to us because
he took issue with the quantitative emphasis of our study. Overall, he rejected this systematic approach to decision-making. He stated:
You see, people who are engaged in businesses such as mine are rarely influenced by surveys because they don't place any stock in them. Survey reports, in general, are most highly prized by those individuals who lack sufficient knowledge of
a matter in which they are required to make a decision. It is my considered opinion
that those individuals are not going to be found successfully engaging in entrepreneurial businesses.

<-----Page 17----->26

The use of biases and heuristics may also offer some help in explaining why entrepreneurs sometimes make bad managers (Schell 1991). Whereas the use of cognitive biases
may be beneficial in some circumstances, it can lead to major errors in others (Tversky
and Kahneman 1974). Although research has yet to establish performance implications,
it is possible that more extensive use of heuristics in strategic decision-making may be
a great advantage during the start-up years. However, it may also lead to the demise
of a business as a firm matures.
Implications may also exist for managers in large organizations in how they manage
the entrepreneurial individuals in their firms. It would appear that a fundamental decision needs to be made as to whether such individuals should be accommodated within
the firm or released to go and start their own firm. As large organizations tend to be
characterized by more methodical decision-making, such environments can be very stifling for those more comfortable with biased and heuristic reasoning. Thus, if an organization values such individuals, it is important to find organizational contexts for letting
these individuals make their contributions. More specifically, it has been suggested that
such individuals may be particularly good with problem solving and new product development (Bazerman 1990; Russo and Schoemaker 1989). A second alternative is to decide that such individuals simply will not help an organization long-term. It may be better to help these individuals to start their own firms, where their biased decision-making
approach is likely to be more beneficial.

APPENDIX
Problem 1: Equipmeut Purchase Decision
Mr. Johnson is about to invest in a new machine and has narrowed his options to Machine A, which is made in the United States or Machine B, which is made overseas.
Both machines are equally capable of performing the same function. In considering this
decision, Mr. Johnson said to his friend, "You know, it seems that every time I buy a
piece of equipment made by a foreign manufacturer, it breaks down in the first month
of use."
After further discussion, Mr. Johnson's friend remembers a recent industrial report
that gives a significantly higher ranking to Machine B (the one made overseas) than
to Machine A. This report bases its recommendation on extensive testing as well as on
feedback from dozens of users. If you were in Mr. Johnson's position, which machine
would you purchase? Why?

Problem 2: Automation Update Decision
The president is urging the board of directors to accept the purchase of a state-of-theart computerized machine that would fundamentally change their operations. After describing the capability of this machine, the president cites a recent nationwide study
which examined 120 businesses making similar upgrades. Results indicated that at least
85% showed a sizable increase in productivity. In a parallel control group of firms not
making the upgrade, about half as many firms (40%) showed a sizable increase in productivity. Based on this study, the president concludes that the computerized machine
needs to be purchased.
One of the directors now takes the floor giving two reasons why computerized
equipment is not the real reason for increased productivity. First, the managers of businesses that make such changes are likely to be more energetic and adventurous, thus
creating an environment for superior performance. Second, any change is likely to lead
to superior performance because of the increased interest and commitment on the part
of management.
If you were participating in such a decision, whose line of reasoning (president or
director) would you be more likely to accept? Why?
