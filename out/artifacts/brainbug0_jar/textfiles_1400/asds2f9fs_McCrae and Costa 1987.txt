Validation of the Five-Factor Model of Personality Across
Instruments and Observers

Two data sources—self-reports and peer ratings—and two instruments—adjective factors and questionnaire scales—were used to assess the five-factor model of personality. As in a previous study of
self-reports {McCrae & Costa, 1985b), adjective factors of neuroticism, extraversion, openness to
experience, agreeableness-antagonism, and conscientiousness-undirectedness were identified in an
analysis of 738 peer ratings of 275 adult subjects. Intraclass correlations among raters, ranging from
.30 to .65, and correlations between mean peer ratings and self-reports, from .25 to .62, showed
substantial cross-observer agreement on all five adjective factors. Similar results were seen in analyses
of scales from the NEO Personality Inventory. Items from the adjective factors were used as guides
in a discussion of the nature of the five factors. These data reinforce recent appeals for the adoption
of the five-factor model in personality research and assessment.

Kenrick and Dantchik (1983) complained that "catalogs of
convenience" have replaced meaningful taxonomies of personality traits among "most of the current generation of social/

Five Factors in Self-Reports and Ratings
One of the strongest arguments in favor of the five-factor
model has been its appearance in both self-reports and ratings.
Norman (1963) reported the structure in peer ratings. Goldberg
(1980) showed parallel structures in both ratings and self-reports. As early as the 1960s, convergence across observers was
also demonstrated (Borgatta, 1964; Norman & Goldberg,
1966). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Norman, 1969),
these studies used only adjective-rating scales, and few attempts
were made to compare adjective factors with standardized questionnaires that are more widely used in personality research.
In a recent publication (McCrae & Costa, 1985b), we examined the correspondence between adjective and questionnaire
formats to see if the same substantive dimensions of personality
would be obtained in each. Our adjective-rating instrument was
an extension of one devised by Goldberg (1983); our questionnaire was the N EO Inventory (McCrae & Costa, 1983a), which
measures three broad dimensions identified in analyses of standard personality measures. Self-reports on five adjective factors
were compared with both self-reports and spouse ratings on the
inventory dimensions of neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience. In brief, the study showed that a version of
the five-factor model could be recovered from the adjectives,
that there were clear correspondences for neuroticism and extraversion dimensions across the two instruments, that Norman's culture factor was better interpreted as openness to experience, and that validity coefficients above .50 could be obtained with both self-reports and spouse ratings.
Three major questions were left unanswered by that study.
As Kammann, Smith, Martin, and McQueen (1984) pointed
out, research using spouses as raters differs in some respects
from more traditional peer-rating studies. Spouses may "more
often disclose their feelings to each other through verbal selfstatements" (p. 117), and spouses may be more willing to adopt
and support the self-concept thus communicated than would
peers. Further, the design of our earlier study allowed comparison only between an observer and a self-report; no comparisons
were possible between different external observers. A first question, then, concerned the generalizability of our findings to
agreement among peer ratings and between peer ratings and
self-reports.
A second question involved the particular five-factor structure observed in our set of 80 adjectives. In most studies the
fifth and smallest factor has been labeled culture and has been
thought to include intelligence, sophistication, and intellectual
curiosity. The latter element, in particular, suggested correspondence with the questionnaire factor of openness to experience (McCrae & Costa, 1985a). In Goldberg's 40-item instrument (1983) the terms curious and creative fell on a factor defined primarily by self-rated intelligence. By adding 40
additional items, including some intended to measure such aspects of openness as preference for variety and imaginativeness,
we tested the hypothesis that the fifth factor might better be
construed as openness rather than as culture. Results confirmed
this expectation by showing a factor with only small loadings
from intelligent and cultured but large loadings from original,
imaginative, and creative, and including other forms of openness (independent, liberal, daring) that were clearly distinct

from intelligence. This factor correlated .57 with the NEO Inventory Openness scale. Because of the conceptual importance
of this reformulation of the Norman model, it was essential to
replicate the adjective-factor structure among peer ratings—the
data source on which Norman (1963) had originally relied.
Finally, the NEO Inventory included no measures of two of
the Norman factors: agreeableness and conscientiousness.
These two dimensions have occurred less frequently in questionnaire measures, and they have been thought by some to represent merely the respondent's evaluation of the target. Consensual validation across observers is therefore particularly important for these two dimensions. For that purpose we developed
questionnaire measures of agreeableness-antagonism and conscientiousness-undirectedness, and we examined agreement
for both dimensions across instruments and observers in the
present study.
Method
Subjects
Individuals who provided self-reports and who were targets for peer
ratings were members of the Augmented Baltimore Longitudinal Study
of Aging. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) sample
is composed of a community-dwelling, generally healthy group of volunteers who have agreed to return for medical and psychological testing
at regular intervals (Shock et al., 1984). The sample has been recruited
continuously since 1958, with most new subjects referred by friends or
relatives already in the study. Among the men, 93% are high school
graduates and 71 % are college graduates; nearly one fourth have doctorate-level degrees. The Augmented BLSA sample consists of 423 men
and 129 women who participate in the BLSA, and it includes 183 wives
and 16 husbands who are not themselves BLSA participants but who
have agreed to complete questionnaires at home. Some participants
chose not to participate in this study, and some provided incomplete
data. Results are based on the 156 men and 118 women for whom complete data were available, except for one subject who scored more than
five standard deviations below the mean on the conscientiousness adjective factor and whose adjective data were thrown out. Comparison of
individuals who chose to participate in the peer-rating study with others
showed no significant differences in age or sex. Somewhat surprisingly,
there were also no differences in self-reported personality as measured
by the five adjective factors. Participating subjects were slightly more
open to experience than were others, F(\, 634) = 4.15, p < .05, when
NEO Inventory scores were examined. At the time of the peer ratings,
ages ranged from 29 to 93 (M = 59.9 years) for men and from 28 to 85
(M =53.8 years) for women.

Peer Raters
Subjects were asked to nominate
three or four individuals who know you very well as you are now.
They can be friends, neighbors, or co-workers, but they should not
be relatives. These should be people who have known you for at
least one year and have seen you in a variety of situations.
A few subjects nominated more than four raters, and names and addresses for 1,075 raters were obtained, a few of whom were dropped
because they were themselves members of the BLSA or had already
been nominated by another subject (peers rated only one subject). Of
those contacted, 747 (69%) provided rating data. Raters were assured
of the confidentiality of their responses and were specifically instructed
not to discuss the ratings with the subject-

scores from the NEO Inventory Rating Form. To be included in the
final selection, items were required to show higher correlations with the
Agreeableness or Conscientiousness scale than with any of the other
four scales. Because the final selection included some items written after
the self-report data had been collected, the final self-report scales consisted of only 10 agreeableness and 14 conscientiousness items.
Coefficient alpha for the Conscientiousness scale was .91 within peer
ratings and .84 within self-reports; for the Agreeableness scale it was .89
within peer ratings but only .56 within self-reports. In part, this low
internal consistency was due to the inclusion of only 10 items in the selfreport scale; in part, it was due to lower average interitem correlations.
Correlations between questionnaire and adjective measures of agreeableness and conscientiousness in self-reports were .48 and .65, respectively; neither scale correlated over .20 with any of the other adjective
factors.
It is essential to note that although the development of the Agreeableness and Conscientiousness scales was conducted in parallel on peers
and self-reports, correlations across these two methods did not influence item selection in any way. Thus, the correlation between self-reports and ratings was not inflated by the capitalization on chance inherent in some types of item selection.

here lay with the questionnaire scale and not with the construct.
This was expected given the low reliability of the preliminary
Agreeableness scale used in self-reports. For all five dimensions,
the median validity coefficient was .44. When examined by sex,
convergent correlations ranged from .19 to .58 for men
(median = .35) and from . 17 to .56 for women (median = .48).

psychopathology have led to the development of innumerable
scales saturated with neuroticism. Indeed, neuroticism is so
ubiquitous an element of personality scales that theorists sometimes take it for granted.
A provocative view of neuroticism is provided by Tellegen (in
press), who views it as negative emotionality, the propensity to
experience a variety of negative affects, such as anxiety, depression, anger, and embarrassment. Virtually all theorists would
concur in the centrality of negative affect to neuroticism; the
question is whether other features also define it. Tellegen himself (in press) pointed out that his construct of negative emo-

with popular speech in identifying extraversion with lively sociability.
However, disputes remain about which elements are central
and which are peripheral to extraversion. Most writers would
agree that sociability, cheerfulness, activity level, assertiveness,
and sensation seeking all covary, however loosely. But the Eysencks have at times felt the need to distinguish between sociability
and what they call impulsiveness (S. B. G. Eysenck & Eysenck,

develop intelligence, but the two seem best construed as separate dimensions of individual differences.

agreeableness-antagonism is less familiar than extraversion or

carrying out those intentions? Agreeableness-antagonism, in
particular, has often been assumed to be an evaluative factor of
sonality (e.g., A. Tellegen, personal communication, March 28,
1984).
However, the fact that a trait may be judged from a moral
point of view does not mean that it is not a substantive aspect
of personality. The consensual validation seen among peers and
between peer-reports and self-reports demonstrates that there
are some observable consistencies of behavior that underlie attributions of agreeableness and conscientiousness. They may be

which we have labeled antagonism. As the high-loading adjec-

they are mistrustful and skeptical; affectively they are callous

or bonding with their fellow human beings is defective, and in
extreme cases antagonism may resemble sociopathy (cf. H. J.
Eysenck & Eysenck's, 1975, psychoticism).
An insightful description of antagonism in its neurotic form

spoke of impulse control. This terminology connotes an inhibiting agent, as Cattell (Cattell, Eber, & Tatsuoka, 1970) recognized when he named his Factor G superego strength. A conscientious person in this sense should be dutiful, scrupulous, and
perhaps moralistic.
A different picture, however, is obtained by examining the
adjectives that define this factor. In addition to conscientious

FIVE FACTORS IN PEER RATINGS

though there is no guarantee that they will be so inclined. An
undirected individual may have a demanding conscience and a
pervasive sense of guilt but be unable to live up to his or her
own standards for lack of self-discipline and energy. In any case,
it is clear that this is a dimension worthy of a good deal more
empirical attention than it has yet received. Important real-life
outcomes such as alcoholism (Conley & Angelides, 1984) and
academic achievement (Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981) are
among its correlates, and a further specification of the dimension is sure to be fruitful.
Some personality theorists might object that trait ratings, in
whatever form and from whatever source, need not provide the
best foundation for understanding individual differences. Experimental analysis of the psychophysiological basis of personality (H. J. Eysenck & Eysenck, 1984), examination ofprototypic acts and act frequencies (Buss & Craik, 1983), psychodynamic formulations (Homey, 1945), or behavioral genetics
(Plomin, DeFries, & McClearn, 1980) provide important alternatives. But psychophysiological, behavioral, psychodynamic,
and genetic explanations must eventually be related to the traits
that are universally used to describe personality, and the fivefactor model can provide a framework within which these relations can be systematically examined. The minor conceptual
divergences noted in this article suggest the need for additional
empirical work to fine-tune the model, but the broad outlines
are clear in self-reports, spouse ratings, and peer ratings; in
questionnaires and adjective factors; and in English and in German (Amelang & Borkenau, 1982; John, Goldberg, & Angleitner, 1984). Deeper causal analyses may seek to account for
the structure of personality, but the structure that must be explained is, for now, best represented by the five-factor model.
