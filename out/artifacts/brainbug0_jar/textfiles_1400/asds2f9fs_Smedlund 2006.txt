Abstract
Purpose – The purpose of this article is to provide a tool to map the critical roles of intermediate
organizations. To clarify the concept of intermediate organizations in a regional context, especially
from the network dynamics point-of-view.
Design/methodology/approach – Regional dynamics are presented as networks of production,
development and innovation in the regional cluster. The intermediaries are divided into national,
regional and local level actors. The roles of the intermediaries from the network dynamics
point-of-view are then illustrated with examples from a case study in a medical technology cluster
located in a sparsely inhabited area in Finland.
Findings – According to the results of the case study, the regional intermediaries have the most
important role in the creation and supporting of the network dynamics. The most critical roles include
forming shared innovation strategies between the actors and attracting anchor tenants to the region.
Research limitations/implications – The characteristics of the case region are discussed in a
generic sense with the concepts of social capital and communities of practice.
Practical implications – Conceptually, the article provides an approach to reducing the complexity
of the regional networks to a more understandable level. The model provides a tool for the decision
makers in a region to define the critical roles of the intermediaries from the network dynamics
point-of-view.
Originality/value – The novel approach introduced in this paper addresses three gaps in existing
research: it helps to define the concept of an intermediary in a regional context; it shows that the
intermediaries have a much broader role in a region than just knowledge transfer and that the roles of
the intermediaries differ on national, regional and local levels.

Introduction
Globalization has made it possible for companies to outsource virtually anything to a
country with lower costs of production. This leads to numerous challenges in regional
development. It has been said that in the new knowledge-based economy, the
importance of attractive regions is emphasized (Castells, 1996). A region and the
clusters within it are the main building blocks of successful states. The region has to be
able to maintain its critical mass of constant innovation and effective production in
order to prevent slow decay. Only a healthy region is capable of attracting flows of
capital, competent employees and multinational companies, and compete against other
regions in the world.
Based on a case study in the mechanical wood processing industry, Pöyhönen and
Smedlund have taken a dynamic knowledge-based view on clusters and argue that
regional clusters can be perceived as consisting of three types of networks: production,
development and innovation networks. Each network type creates a certain type of

<-----Page 1----->knowledge-based competitive advantage, and has its own operational logic and
effectiveness criteria. Furthermore, it can be claimed that in order to implement,
develop and innovate intellectual resources effectively, a regional cluster has to include
all types of network. (Pöyhönen and Smedlund, 2004).
Smedlund and Pöyhönen also argue that a single actor in a regional cluster can be a
member of different kinds of networks at the same time. In order to be successful, the
regional cluster has to be able to:
.
make use of existing knowledge as efficiently as possible in a vertical production
network;
.
transfer firm-specific knowledge and ideas in a horizontal development network;
and
.
invent new knowledge, products, production methods or processes in a
diagonal innovation network.
When these network types are all present in a region, new innovations are transmitted
to all the actors to benefit each of them individually, and new innovation ideas emerge
constantly. The cyclic nature of innovations and innovation ideas between the
production, development and innovation networks can be called the regional
knowledge system (Smedlund and Pöyhönen, 2005).
In brief, the main idea of the dynamic, knowledge-based view of regions can be
summarized as follows: a regional cluster of small firms is structured in a network type
of co-operation, depending on the intellectual capital-related functions. These functions
come in three basic forms:
(1) knowledge creation;
(2) knowledge transfer; and
(3) knowledge implementing.
They represent the basic tasks of a firm in the new knowledge based economy.
Knowledge creation is needed in new innovations, knowledge transfer is needed in
learning the best practices, and knowledge implementing is needed in producing
products as efficiently as possible. A single firm in a region can be a member of a
dynamic innovation network, an organic development network and a mechanic
production network at the same time (Ståhle et al., 2003). The networks have members
outside the region as well.
Thinking of a regional cluster as a set of interconnected networks that serve
different IC-related functions provides a preliminary understanding on how regional
competitive advantage is created in the knowledge -based economy. The question that
still remains is how to foster the process of continuous and simultaneous innovation,
learning and production in a regional cluster. In other words, how to improve the
overall dynamics of the regional knowledge system? According to Saxenian (1994),
networking among firms in a region is enabled and supported by regionally embedded
institutions such as chambers of commerce, employers’ unions, banks, science parks,
universities, and training centres (Saxenian, 1994; Ebers, 1997). These kinds of
institutions can also be called intermediaries, or intermediate organizations that
transfer knowledge inside the region and influence the success factors of the region.

In this paper, the roles of intermediaries are discussed from the regional dynamics
point of view. The dynamic, knowledge based view of the region adopted in this paper
reduces the complexity of the regional networks into a more understandable level.
Besides knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and knowledge implementing
functions, the intermediaries are divided into national, regional and local level actors.
The roles of the intermediaries in a regional knowledge system are then illustrated
with examples from a case study in the eastern part of Finland. As the result of the case
study, it is argued that the regional level intermediaries have the most important roles
in the improvement of regional dynamics. These regional roles include such tasks as
ensuring coherent innovation strategies between the actors and attracting anchor
tenants to the region.
There is no one recipe to create successful regions. Managers and decision makers
working with regional development issues face difficult challenges, including how to
attract not only physical capital but also creative human capital to the region.
Furthermore, the needs and motives of the different regional actors seem in many cases
inconsistent and undefined. With the simple modeling tool that this article provides, it
is easier to see the critical roles of the intermediaries that are associated with the
dynamics of a region, and this way improve the overall regional capability to meet the
future challenges and adapt to the global market environment.
Dynamic success factors of a region
In this paper, the success factors of a region are divided into three classes:
(1) substance;
(2) structures; and
(3) dynamics (Ståhle et al., 2003; Smedlund et al., 2005).
This division is logical and provides a mind map to explain different kinds of factors
that are related to the success of regions. This division is highly inspired by the
intellectual capital literature, where IC is commonly explained in terms related to:
human capital; structural/organizational capital; and relational capital (for a good
overview, see Andriessen, 2004).
In the regional context, the substance factors are field specific knowledge, skills and
competence. Structural factors form the infrastructure of a region and dynamic factors
make the region alive. This way, the dynamic success factors can be seen as the
processes that turn the substance and structures of a region into value.
The production and transaction cost-based structures of regions have traditionally
been regarded as their success factors. These components include factors of
production, demand conditions, related and supporting industries, and rivalry, as
presented by Porter (1990), and geographical distance and the economics of scale as
presented by Krugman (1991).
Both Porter and Krugman argue that the success factors of clusters are “hard”
structures typical for mature and physical capital intensive industries. These hard
structures are easier to make concrete than new intellectual capital-based, “soft”
structures. From the viewpoint of the overall success of a region, the soft structures
include such things as regional steering methods, strategies, institutions and
legislation that are likely to support innovation, development and production activities

<-----Page 3----->in the region. The soft structures should be as unequivocal as possible to steer the
economic activity in the region persistently and consistently (Smedlund et al., 2005).
Besides structures, a region also needs a solid base of substance that is the
knowledge, competence and managerial skills – human capital – of the actors inside
the region. Even though the structures and substance are important for a region, the
new knowledge-based theory emphasizes dynamics – the tangible and intangible
flows that occur inside the region that make the system alive (i.e. Allee, 1999, 2000,
2002). In the heart of the dynamics are the different networks and their interplay.
The structure, substance and dynamics of a region can be further made concrete by
using the terms appearing in the intellectual capital literature. The approaches to the
determinants of competitive advantage in the knowledge-based economy can be
divided into three categories: assets, capabilities and relations (Pöyhönen and
Smedlund, 2004). To take full advantage of the hard and soft structures of a region, the
existing intangible assets need to be identified and valued. Capabilities are related to
the substance of a knowledge-based region, because the capabilities view emphasizes
the capability to create, develop and modify intangibles. The capabilities view also
highly emphasizes personal skills and know-how. Thirdly, the relations are connected
to the dynamic side of a knowledge-based region. Production, development and
innovation networks require social relations, interaction and collaboration (Figure 1).
The dynamics of a region can be argued to be the most important success factor of
the region. In Allee’s view of value networks, the flows that take place in the networks
make a value system alive (Allee, 2002). Without the dynamics, a region is just a
skeleton. The tangible and intangible flows between the actors function as a blood
circulation system in the region, enabling the system to meet the changing needs of the
business environment.
According to the idea of a regional knowledge system (Smedlund and Pöyhönen,
2005), the tangible and intangible flows flow in the regional networks of production,
development and innovation. An individual actor can be a member of each type of

network simultaneously. A production network is a vertical type of co-operation
between multiple actors, and its purpose is to create value to the region by producing
and selling products to the markets. In achieving this purpose, the production network
implements the existing knowledge as effectively as possible. The main benefit of the
production network is that it lowers the transaction costs of the actors by letting them
to concentrate on their core competences.
The development network is horizontal, and the purpose of the network is to ensure
that information is transferred between the actors. In achieving this purpose, the
development network shares firm-specific knowledge between the actors. The
development network increases learning among the actors by creating trustworthy
relationships and increased communication.
The shape of the innovation network is diagonal. The innovation network is a
complex network of many kinds of actors, for example firms, institutions, financiers
etc. The relations in the innovation network cross many traditional borders of
hierarchy. The main purpose of the innovation network is to bring together different
actors and resources to raise the value of the network. The task of the innovation
network is to create new knowledge. The main benefit of the innovation network for
the region is continuous improvement of products, production methods and production
processes.
The idea of the three types of networks of knowledge creation, knowledge transfer
and knowledge implementing is originally based on the theories of the knowledge
environments of an organization presented by Ståhle (Ståhle, 1998; Ståhle and
Grönroos, 2000; Ståhle et al., 2003). According to Ståhle the competitive advantage of
an organization is formed with the interplay of mechanic, organic and dynamic
knowledge environments. The knowledge is managed in the organization by creating
different environments that have different logic of producing value with knowledge.
Another similar classification has been presented recently by Möller and Svahn (2003).
In their theoretical article based on the theories of the industrial network approach,
strategic management and dynamic capabilities, Möller and Svahn argue that there are
three main archetypes of inter-organizational networks. These are stable value
systems, established value systems and emerging value systems. In their approach,
firms in a certain market form strategic “nets” that follow different value system logics.
In a stable value system, well-known and specified value activities prevail. The actors,
technologies and business procedures are clear and defined. In an established value
system, the incremental improvements take place between the actors. The value
system is well known, but the network evolves through local and incremental
modifications within the existing value system. An emerging value system represents
radical changes, where the whole value system is not yet defined, the actors are not
known and the old value activities are changed radically. An emerging value system is
capable of changing rapidly, but there is also a lot of uncertainty involved.
The implications of the different knowledge environments and value systems on the
regional level are the production, development and innovation networks. These
networks form a hologram type of system that we call the regional knowledge system
(Figure 2). According to this framework, new innovations are innovated on the
innovation network level with the combination of different knowledge, competence and
creativity. On the development network level the innovations are improved gradually,
but nothing new is invented. In the production network the final products are produced

as effectively as possible, or a new production method or process is applied into
practice. It is important to understand that the dynamic innovation network level alone
does not guarantee the success of a region. The region also needs organic development
networks and mechanic production networks to turn innovations into money. Besides
having these different types of networks, the networks have to be linked with each
other. According to the framework that this thinking provides, the region is able to
achieve the benefits of lower transaction costs, economics of scale as a form of united
market force, and continuous innovation simultaneously.
In the regional knowledge system, the production network (order and supply chain)
brings cash flow to the region and functions as a customer interface. The development
network (best-practice type of learning, spillover of knowledge) improves the
performance of the independent actors. The innovation network (research and design)
ensures continuous creation of new knowledge. In the regional knowledge system of
production, development and innovation networks, not only new innovations are
utilized, but also new innovation ideas that emerge in the production function can be
taken into account rapidly.
In the regional knowledge system framework, every actor in the region can be a
member of every type of network. The network-based view of the dynamics of a region
is that the actors form collaboration relationships to serve different tasks. Production,
development and innovation are just the archetypes of different tasks that firms need
in the knowledge-based economy. The actors have to be conscious of other actors in the
region as well. The interplay of the different networks is a prerequisite for the
dynamics of a region. New innovations require a platform for new ideas, a broad
learning base and the capability to make products effectively. Links between the
networks are formed when an actor is involved simultaneously for example in
production and innovating. This makes it possible for new innovation ideas and best
practices to improve the production processes through mutual learning.
As mentioned above, the success factors of a region can be thought of as factors
related to substance, structures and dynamics. Substance consists of the field-specific
knowledge base in the region and structures are the factors that make it possible to

<-----Page 6----->JIC

make profit out of knowledge with the dynamics. In this paper, regional dynamics are
defined as being the networks of production, development and innovation and their
interplay. Structures and substance can be influenced directly to some extent, because
they are easy to understand and concretize. Dynamics, instead, cannot be acted on
directly. The networks cannot be administered, but they can be steered towards the
desired outcome. In the following I will discuss the concept of an intermediary and
particularly the roles that intermediaries have in the network dynamics of a region.
National, regional and local intermediaries
In general, an intermediate organization is an organization that functions in the midst
of the users and producers of knowledge. According to Vonortas, intermediaries can be
found between the government and the private sector (Vonortas, 2002). Case studies in
Latin America have shown that these intermediaries have a significant effect on the
performance of SMEs. The intermediaries assist SMEs in many ways. Vonortas argues
that “Frequently, the most useful type of assistance to SMEs is not technological but
more general business oriented such as locating and approaching the customer,
achieving a steady cash flow, developing relationships of trust, accessing finance,
managing the firm effectively, and training the employees” (Vonortas, 2002, p. 4).
A narrow definition of the concept of an intermediary is related to the substance of
the region. According to this definition, the purpose of an intermediary is solely
knowledge transfer from the creators of knowledge to the users of knowledge. This is
the definition that is used when the technology transfer from universities to local firms
is studied.
However, the effect of an intermediary to the surrounding region is broader than
just technology transfer. For the success of a region, the founding of structures and
dynamics is also an important task of an intermediary. The broad definition of an
intermediary thus covers:
.
the knowledge transfer related to the substance of a region;
.
the direct or indirect effect of intermediary on the structures of a region; and
.
the direct or indirect effect on the dynamics – production, development and
innovation network and their interplay (Smedlund et al., 2005).
Defining clear roles for intermediaries is not simple. On one hand, an intermediate
organization can be a form of an organization of its own, but on the other the concept of
an intermediary can be defined as being a role or a mission of any organization in a
region. In a regional cluster, there seldom are organizations that focus exclusively on
intermediating tasks. Many organizations can function as intermediaries
unconsciously. The concept of intermediary should be defined as a framework in
which the roles of different actors in a regional knowledge system can be studied.
In the field of social capital research, and especially in the publications of the World
Bank, the unit of application highly depends on whether the event studied is
considered to be on the macro, meso or micro level (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001).
The macro level is the national political atmosphere in which the norms, networks
and trust between individuals and groups evolve. It is possible to influence the macro
level social capital by influencing the institutions, political regime, laws, or the freedom
of speech (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001). Some researchers even consider the
differences on the macro level social capital between nations to be the reason for the

<-----Page 7----->economical success of certain nations (Hjerppe, 2003). This view is based on the idea
that even though the knowledge is available to all, only nations with high social capital
can turn this knowledge into economic value. The social capital on the macro level
offers national conditions for the success of the regions and it also includes the meso
and micro levels.
The micro level covers the relationships between individual persons and/or
individual small groups of persons. When these micro level groups function properly,
they cause positive externalities to the surrounding society. Of course, the externalities
can also be negative, as for example in the case of mafia. The meso level perspective
includes mainly the relationships and networks between organizations and groups.
Individuals or organizations perform actions within a certain type of social structure.
The links on the meso level are both vertical and horizontal, and therefore it functions
as a link between the macro and micro levels (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001).
As with the concepts of social capital, the goals and missions of an intermediary
vary according the level of observation. These levels are:
.
national (macro);
.
regional (meso); and
.
local (micro).
The mission of a national intermediate organization is to ensure the success of the
nation as a whole. The mission of a regional intermediary is to support the success
factors of the region, and the mission of a local intermediary is to serve local firms in
their business. The macro, meso and micro level intermediaries have a different effect
on the success of the regional knowledge system. The different levels of intermediate
organizations represent the nature of the mechanisms that make a region successful.
The macro level intermediate organizations create national prerequisites for
successful regions. According to Porter (1996), the government has to support
companies, because companies create competitive industries. Porter also states that
“Government policies that succeed are those that create an environment in which
companies can gain competitive advantage rather than those that involve the
government directly in the process” (Porter, 1996, p. 185). The macro level intermediate
organizations are those that function, in Porter’s terms, as catalysts and challengers for
companies.
On the regional level, the main task of an intermediary is to orchestrate
collaboration between the key actors in the region. The regional meso level ensures
that regional strategies are consistent and up to date. An intermediary on the regional
level also functions as a link between the micro and macro levels.
The local micro level intermediary functions locally and helps individual firms or
persons to gain knowledge. On the micro level, interpersonal relationships are
emphasized and the basis for trust and communication between the actors is created.
The local intermediaries establish contacts, arrange networks and offer resources to
the companies in the region. Examples of local intermediaries are knowledge intensive
business service firms (KIBS). According to Miles, KIBS organizations, for example,
work with companies in the innovation process, mobilize new ideas for further
development, and keep track on possible partners and markets (Miles, 2001; Kemppilä
and Mettänen, 2004).

Roles of intermediaries from the regional dynamics point of view – case
Kuopio region
National, regional and local intermediaries influence the substance, structures and
dynamics of a successful region in many different ways. The right substance –
knowledge and competence – require regional capabilities to create, develop and
modify intangible assets. The intermediaries are able to influence these capabilities for
example by creating national programs, by regional politics or by supporting local
competence. From the point-of-view of structures, existing assets need to be identified
and valued. An intermediary can evaluate the existing structures and intangible assets
and focus on developing essential structures. A national intermediary can for example
try to change patent laws, a regional intermediary can build the basic infrastructure,
and a local intermediary can improve the business services of a region.
In this paper I concentrate merely on the dynamics creation aspect. As mentioned
above, by regional dynamics I mean different networks and their interplay in a
regional cluster. From the viewpoint of regional dynamics, the roles of the
intermediaries are related to relationships, interaction, networks and collaboration.
Naturally, a successful region is based on a solid base of substance that the structures
support. It is also obvious that without dynamics the substance and structures cannot
be turned into value. Therefore, substance, structures and dynamics are connected
together with positive feedback loops. The intermediaries can affect the loops by
taking the right initiatives. When the roles of the intermediaries are known, it is easier
to make the right decisions.
The roles of the intermediaries from the regional dynamics point of view were
constructed during the summer 2004 in a research project launched by the Finnish
Ministry of Trade and Industry (Ståhle et al., 2004; Smedlund et al., 2005). The result of
this short research project was a report on the challenges of Finnish national, regional
and local intermediate organizations. The case region was the Kuopio region in the
eastern part of Finland, and especially the medical technology cluster in the region.
The data collection method was a theme-based interview ðn ¼ 8Þ with the key persons
in the region. The themes were the missions, roles and collaboration of the
organizations, and the personal opinions of the interviewees. Also previous reports and
articles about the case region and the Finnish innovation system were used. During the
case study, around 20 organizations were identified in the Kuopio region that have a
role of an intermediate organization in the region. In this paper I use only three of these
organizations to illustrate the roles of the intermediaries in the region. The three
intermediaries presented in this part are: the national “Finnwell” technology program
(www.tekes.fi/eng/), the regional “Health-Kuopio” project (www.tervekuopio.fi/
freimstart.htm), and the local “Teknia”-technology center (www.teknia.fi/).
In Finland, the growth of the economy takes mainly place in three areas: in the
Helsinki area, where most of the people live, in the Tampere region in central Finland,
and in the Oulu region in the north. Oulu has been successful mainly because of Nokia,
Tampere has a long industrial history, and Helsinki has most of the head offices of
Finnish companies as well as most of the research and development activity in Finland.
The Kuopio region is an exceptional region compared to the other growing regions in
Finland. The whole region, including the town of Kuopio and the surrounding
municipalities has only 117,000 inhabitants (Valovirta and Virtanen, 2004). The
Kuopio region is located far from all the other growth areas (Helsinki ¼ 250 miles;

<-----Page 9----->Oulu ¼ 150 miles and Tampere ¼ 180 miles). Also, Kuopio does not have a port and
there are no natural resources, except for spruce trees and lakes. The industrial history
of the region is also not very notable, except for a couple of forest mills and pulp
factories. The main field of business in the region has been agriculture, but along with
the structural changes in the agricultural politics of Finland and the EU, farming has
become unprofitable. Furthermore, basic labor in Finland is too expensive, so basic
factory labor will not be the source of the future success of the Kuopio region.
The main competitive advantage of the future that the whole Kuopio region counts
on is the University of Kuopio and the research and development activities that the
university supports. The University of Kuopio was founded in 1972 as a result of the
regional politics of the Finnish government. In the 1960s and 1970s, three universities
were established in the sparsely inhabited eastern part of Finland. It is widely agreed
among the key persons of the Kuopio region that the university provides a solid base of
substance and knowledge. In fact, the university is the third biggest employer in the
region after the city of Kuopio and the central hospital. There are only a few
considerable employers in the private sector, and the rate of unemployment is around
ten percent (Statistics Finland, 2003). This skewed employment situation in the region
illustrates the present situation of the region as a periphery of the EU and one of the
poorest regions in Finland.
The main direction of the strategy of the region is clear, and all the key actors think
similarly about the future of the region. The competitive advantage of the region is
going to be built on technology related to medical technology. There is no clear
definition for this field, but the concepts of wellbeing, welfare or life-science are
commonly used.
Examples of national, macro level intermediaries affecting the dynamics of the
region are national technology programs where the actors in the region participate.
The actors in the region take part in numerous national research and development
programs that provide funding and form national and international links between
universities, research laboratories and companies. Examples of the programs are
“iWell” and “FinnWell”, both of which study how to improve health care services with
new technology. According to de Juan (2002), the strength of the Finnish national
system of innovation is often considered to be the close cooperation between
companies, research organizations and universities. One reason for the cooperation is
that the National Technology Agency (TEKES) requires joint research projects
between companies and universities in their funding programs.
In the research of regional development, the “triple helix” model is often used to
describe the regional collaboration between universities, government and firms. In the
“triple helix” model, private, public and science worlds are interwoven when the
processes of innovation and strategy formation are built up in the region. Shared
discussions and projects blur the borders of the institutions, and the actors may even
take up the role of each other in the region (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000).
In the Kuopio region, an example of a regional “triple helix” type of shared building
of strategies and visioning is a project led by the city of Kuopio. This project, called
“Health-Kuopio” is a kind of an “umbrella” project for the overall strategy of the whole
region. The ambitious vision of the project is that the region will be the best life-science
centre in the EU. The steering group of this project consists of members from
all-important actors of the region from private, public and science sectors. This project

was considered as being important, because it keeps the different strategies of the
different actors consistent. One result of this project is a study of the region’s strengths
and weaknesses compared to other life-science clusters in Finland. Besides strategy
formation, one of the goals of this project is to give a positive image of the region to the
outside world.
High-technology industrial parks and technology centers are examples of
intermediaries of the local level. In Kuopio, the technology center “Teknia” was
considered to be the most important local level intermediate organization. Teknia’s role
in the region is to help the small firms in the region. It provides a set of basic services to
the firms: for example office space and legal consulting. Teknia also seeks partners
from outside the region and evaluates the business ideas. To some extent, the publicly
owned Teknia functions as a KIBS organization. This is a good thing because the
region is not big enough yet to support specialized private service organizations. In the
long run, however, the business services should be privatized.
As a whole, the Kuopio region has good conditions for new innovations. From the
innovation network point of view, the region has the right substance and structures.
Universities, financiers and small businesses are located close to each other. From the
viewpoint of the development networks, the region lacks high quality business services
and the substance of a knowledge base for example in marketing, patent laws and
international relationships. In fact, the interviewees mentioned a variety of examples of
excellent innovations that had failed to succeed because of lack of management and
market competence. The production function in the region is very poor. At the time of
the interviews, it seemed that there were only a couple of firms in the region that
actually sold their life-science -related products to the market successfully. The
obvious hindsight of the lack of production networks was that the new knowledge did
not find its way to be used in practice. There was also no feedback system to receive
innovation ideas from the production. Roughly speaking, the new research and
innovations were either left unutilized or they were taken out of the region.
The interviewees saw the absence of big firms a problem in the region. The presence
of big, anchor tenant type corporations creates regional dynamics and provides growth
opportunities for other firms in a region (Agrawal and Cockburn, 2003). Also, the trend
in the field of medical technology seems to be that the nature of the business
environment favors large units. Furthermore, evidence of the importance of anchor
tenants can be found in the success of the Oulu region. Oulu in northern Finland seems
to be based on the fact that the Nokia corporation functions as an anchor tenant in the
region. Nokia, its subcontracts and the University of Oulu have been working in close
collaboration since the 1970s (Synocus, 2004). The substance created in the university
has been utilized successfully in Oulu and the knowledge has been successfully
anchored inside the region to benefit other regional actors.
As a result of the interviews and the regional knowledge system framework
(Smedlund and Pöyhönen, 2005), the main roles of the intermediaries from the regional
dynamics point of view can be introduced. National, regional and local intermediaries
have distinct roles from the point of view of the innovation, development and
production networks of a regional cluster of small firms. As summarized in Table I, the
main roles of a national intermediate organization is to support the joint projects of
science and private sectors in innovation, provide national forums of knowledge
sharing, and influence the institutional environment for production. The roles of

regional intermediate organizations are related to the overall strategy of the region.
The regional intermediaries promote the triple helix co-operation, form relations and
attract anchor tenants to the region. Local intermediate organizations are in a close
relationship with the firms in the region. The local intermediaries function as hubs in
the networks, coordinate forums of knowledge sharing and provide knowledge
intensive business services to firms.
In the Kuopio region, the main roles of the case intermediate organizations support
the roles introduced in Table I. The technology programs, such as the FinnWell
program, financed by the National Technology Agency (TEKES) are joint projects
between the universities and the private sector, the “Health-Kuopio” project lead by the
city of Kuopio is an umbrella type of a project to provide shared vision and strategies
to the whole region, and finally, the main role of the technology center Teknia is to
support the development of the start-ups and small firms in the region.
Discussion
Defining the concept of an intermediary and making sense of the numerous roles that
national, regional or local intermediaries have in a region is not simple. The narrow
definition presented in this paper was that the intermediaries transfer knowledge
between the producers and users of knowledge, thus improving the knowledge and
competence base of the region. In a broader sense, the intermediaries also influence the
structures and dynamics of a region. The view presented in this paper considered the
universities as producers of knowledge and local firms as the knowledge users. In real
life, besides the knowledge transfer from universities to firms, there is also a lot of
knowledge transfer and sharing between firms. The role of corporations as knowledge
producers is increasing and firms even produce the same kind of reports and articles as
universities do. Also, joint projects between firms and universities blur the distinction
between knowledge producers and knowledge users.
According to the case study, the regional intermediaries can be argued to have the
most important roles from the point of view of the overall dynamics of the region. The
regional intermediaries link local and national levels together with mutual strategy
formation and visioning processes. With the functioning triple helix of public, private
and science worlds, the overall strategy of the region can be steered towards the right
fields of business. This conclusion supports de Juan’s view that direct national
interventions cannot work alone when building successful regions (de Juan, 2002). It
seems that in addition to national regional politics and other macro level steering
methods, a successful region needs mutual commitment of the key actors in the region
as well as good business services to local firms.
The regional level intermediaries seemed to be emphasized in the case region,
possibly due to the small size of the region and the lack of possible paths of success in
the future. Medical technology was seen as the only possible competitive advantage in
the future among the interviewees. The region has good preconditions for this, only
companies making use of the knowledge and competence of the region are still missing.
The case region has many unique Finland-specific characteristics, such as the high
involvement of national government as the buyer of products and services from the
firms in the region, and the fact that nearly all of the intermediaries studied in the
Kuopio region were publicly run. The intermediaries introduced above (Finwell,
Health-Kuopio and Teknia) have been founded and have hired professional managers

<-----Page 13----->at the expense of the tax-payers. In the early stages of building the regional dynamics
in Kuopio, this was considered a good thing, because according to the definition of the
intermediary introduced in this paper, intermediaries “patch up” holes in the existing
regional networks and influence the success factors of a region in many ways. In this
sense, the focus of the roles of intermediaries is always different depending on the
characteristics of a region.
The general characteristics of the Kuopio case can be transferred to other regions as
well by using the concepts of social capital and communities of practice. At its
simplest, the concept of social capital is based on the notion that “social relationships
have value” (Putnam, 2000). Cohen and Prusak (2001, p. 4) define social capital as
follows: “Social capital consists of the stock of active connections among people: the
trust, mutual understanding, and shared values and behaviors that bind the members
of human networks and communities and make cooperative action possible”. It was
stated above that social capital has three dimensions, namely macro-, meso- and micro
level (Grootaert and van Bastelaer, 2001). In the regional context, there are studies that
show positive correlation with social capital and learning benefits in young technology
firms (Autio, 2000; Yli-Renko et al., 2001). In the case region, the intermediaries seemed
to leverage the social capital on macro-, meso- and micro level by directing funding to
the shared projects between firms and universities, bringing different actors together
to form shared strategies in a “triple helix” (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 2000) for the
region and building shared technology centers for the firms in the region.
The concept of communities of practice is related to social capital. In fact, it can be
stated that communities of practice represent micro level social capital that has
positive externalities to the surrounding region. Wenger and Snyder (2000, p. 139) state
that communities of practice are “groups of people informally bound together by
shared expertise and passion for a joint enterprise”. They also argue that communities
of practice cannot be created intentionally, but they can be encouraged by bringing the
right people together and providing an infrastructure for them. From the learning
perspective and in the light of a case study in Silicon Valley, Benner (2003) argues that
significant individual level learning takes place in communities of practice. He also
argues that communities of practice can be actively built through the formal activities
of professional associations.
In the Kuopio region, the intermediaries were able to encourage the formation of
communities of practice. The local level intermediaries working directly with the
companies can be considered especially important in building communities of practice.
During the work with companies, the intermediaries form a good understanding of the
characteristics and competencies of the region’s firms. This way they can act as
brokers in the building of different work-related associations between individuals
working in these firms. In Kuopio, Teknia also arranged seminars and other events
regularly for the firms in the region. Furthermore, mentioned as a curiosity, it was
noted that the shared cafeteria in the technology center Teknia was purposefully built
to be a little bit too small to encourage social networking between the employees of
different companies during lunch and coffee breaks.
The main contribution of this paper is the framework for defining the roles of
intermediaries in a region. By dividing the regional networks according to their
intellectual capital functions – knowledge creating, knowledge transfer and
knowledge implementing – and combining this with macro, meso and micro

perspectives, provides a tool for the decision makers of a region to understand the
critical roles of the intermediaries.
In the final analysis, only private sector companies can turn the substance,
structures and dynamics of a region into economic value. The most important task of
the intermediaries should be to offer support to the companies located in the region,
make the region attractive for entrepreneurs and allure anchor tenants to the region.
From the dynamics point of view, this leads to numerous challenges in the leadership
of the intermediaries. Especially on the regional level, the challenges will be to improve
the image and identity of the region, leverage the social capital and encourage
communities of practice in the region, create appealing environments to creative
individuals, and generate local, regional, national and international links and
relationships of knowledge creation, knowledge transfer and knowledge implementing.
When the roles of the intermediaries are realized first, it is easier to meet these
challenges.
