One-reason decision making in risky choice? A closer look at the
priority heuristic
Benjamin E. Hilbig∗
University of Mannheim
Abstract
Although many models for risky choices between gambles assume that information is somehow integrated, the recently proposed priority heuristic (PH) claims that choices are based on one piece of information only. That is, although
the current reason for a choice according to the PH can vary, all other reasons are claimed to be ignored. However,
the choices predicted by the PH and other pieces of information are often confounded, thus rendering critical tests of
whether decisions are actually based on one reason only, impossible. The current study aims to remedy this problem by
manipulating the number of reasons additionally in line with the choice implied by the PH. The results show that participants’ choices and decision times depend heavily on the number of reasons in line with the PH — thus contradicting
the notion of non-compensatory, one-reason decision making.
Keywords: priority heuristic, prospect theory, non-compensatory strategy, one-reason decision making, fast and frugal
heuristics, risky choice.

Introduction

The adaptive toolbox metaphor, put forward by Gigerenzer and co-workers (Gigerenzer, 2001; Gigerenzer, Todd,
& The ABC Research Group, 1999), implies that decision makers possess and use a collection of simple rules
of thumb — the so-called fast-and-frugal heuristics — to
achieve very good results with very little effort. Since it
was originally formulated, the toolbox has been rapidly
growing and new heuristics are introduced almost regularly. Despite Bröder’s (2003) criticism that “inventing
more and more new heuristics may soon become futile
if they are not seriously tested empirically” (p. 622) the
adaptive toolbox was recently extended to preferential decisions by means of the priority heuristic (PH, Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2006) — a simple lexicographic rule for choices between gambles. Although
the idea of adaptive decision making in choice is, in itself, not novel (e.g. Payne, Bettman, & Johnson, 1993),
the PH represents a new development in this area.
Brandstätter et al. (2006) concluded that the PH outperforms both normative and other heuristic models in
predicting participants choices. Also, they claim that
it represents a process model of choice, describing the
sequence of steps taken by a decision maker’s cognitive apparatus. Both claims have been seriously ques∗ I thank Andreas Glöckner, Sebastian A. Markett, Jonathan Baron,

tioned and substantial debates about the properties of the
PH (Birnbaum, 2008a; Brandstätter, Gigerenzer, & Hertwig, 2008; Johnson, Schulte-Mecklenbeck, & Willemsen, 2008; Rieger & Wang, 2008) and, more generally,
the plausibility of the fast-and-frugal-heuristics approach
(Dougherty, Franco-Watkins, & Thomas, 2008; Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & Goldstein, 2008) have arisen.
One serious caveat to studies investigating the PH lies
in the selection of gambles used: The choice predicted by
the PH and the gamble favored by other pieces of information are often confounded. Thus, adherence rates to
the PH, or modal choices as studied by Brandstätter et al.
(2006) might be biased measures of whether participants’
decisions are truly based on one reason only, as claimed
by the PH. The current study aims to remedy this problem. First, the choice rule of the PH will be introduced
along with a description of the problem of confounded
information in gamble-pairs. Then, an experiment will
be reported in which the number of pieces of information confounded with the choice predicted by the PH was
systematically varied to test whether participants actually
base their choices on one piece of information only.

1.1 The priority heuristic
In the simple case of non-negative two-outcome gambles
comprising a minimum gain, a maximum gain, and according probabilities, the PH claims that the following
steps are taken by a decision maker: First, an aspiration level is computed which is 1/10 of the largest maximum gain (rounded to the nearest prominent number,

457

<-----Page 1----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008

Brandstätter et al., 2006). If the difference between the
minimum gains exceeds this aspiration level, the gamble
with the larger minimum gain is chosen; thus, information search is stopped after one piece of information has
been examined (henceforth PH1 case) and all probabilities and maximum gains are ignored. If this is not the
case, the probabilities (of the minimum gains) are considered: should these differ by at least .10 the gamble with
the smaller probability (for the minimum gain) is chosen. So, search is terminated after the second reason has
been examined (thus labeled PH2 case) and a choice is
made ignoring all gains. Finally, if the probabilities yield
no such difference, the maximum gains are considered
(PH3 case) and the gamble comprising the larger maximum gain is chosen. No trade-offs are made and thus
there is no integration of information in the process.
Although the PH can be easily extended to multipleoutcome and negative-outcome gambles, its niche is limited by the following bounding conditions: The expected values of the gambles may differ by a maximal
ratio of 2:1, thus rendering choices adequately difficult
(Brandstätter et al., 2006, 2008). Moreover, cases of
strict dominance are excluded (Brandstätter et al., 2006),
even though such cases could be expected to be handled
smoothly by any heuristic (Rieger & Wang, 2008). Taken
together, these bounding conditions limit the PH’s applicability to less than 50% of a randomly generated set
of gamble-pairs as shown through simulation (Birnbaum,
2008a). However, this limitation by no means rules out
that the process predictions of the PH are adequate in
those cases to which it is argued to apply.
As Brandstätter et al. (2006) demonstrate, the PH is
successful at predicting majority choices in different sets
of gambles. Specifically, the authors show that it can predict modal choices better than quite a number of other
models — including the most recognized: cumulative
prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). However,
these results have been challenged and others have shown
that cumulative prospect theory and the transfer of attention exchange model (e.g., Birnbaum, 2004) are likely
to outperform the PH when more diagnostic gambles are
used and when competing models are allowed appropriate parameter fitting (Birnbaum, 2008a, 2008b; Glöckner
& Betsch, in press). In sum, whenever the PH and competing models made different predictions, choices were
mostly in line with the latter.
However, there is an inherent problem in some investigations of whether participants adhere to the PH: Often,
multiple pieces of information imply the same choice as
the PH. As a consequence, it is not always possible to
conclude which piece of information — or which combination of the latter — led to a given choice. The following
example illustrates this problem: Considering gambles A
(4,000; .50; 1,300; .50) and B (3,900; .35; 1000; .65) the

One-reason decision making in risky choice

458

PH would predict choice of gamble A since it comprises
the more attractive probabilities (and since the minimum
gains differ by less than 1/10 of the largest maximum
gain). However, the minimum gains, the maximum gains,
and the expected values (which are 2,850 and 1,430, respectively) all imply the same decision as the PH. Thus,
choice of gamble A cannot imply that (only) the probabilities were considered in the decision process. By contrast, one can construct gamble-pairs for which the choice
implied by the PH is not in line with any other piece of
information. Deciding between gambles C (4,000; .40;
1,200; .60) and D (3,150; .50; 950; .50) is such an example: The PH would predict choice of gamble D in line
with the probabilities (for the same reason as in the former example). However, the minimum gains, the maximum gains, and the expected values (which are 2,640 and
2,050, respectively) all imply choice of gamble C.
Since the PH claims that choices are always based on
one piece of information only, the number of other reasons in line with the choice implied by the PH should be
inconsequential. Stated bluntly, participants’ adherence
to the PH should not depend on the number of additional
reasons in line the PH — since these additional reasons
are claimed to be ignored. So, in the above examples,
choice of gamble A over B should be just as likely as
choice of gamble D over C. By contrast, any strategy
which integrates different pieces of information would
predict that choices in line with the PH should increase
with the number of reasons additionally in line with the
PH’s prediction.
Moreover, according to the PH, participants’ decision
times should also not be affected by the number of reasons in line with the PH: in the above examples, decision
makers should first consider the minimum gains, then
move on to the probabilities (since the minimum gains
do not differ sufficiently in both cases), and upon doing
so stop search and make a choice. Thus, they should take
equally long to choose A over B and D over C. Alternatively, one might claim that the choice between gambles A and B should afford less time than choice between
gambles C and D since in the former case all reasons imply the same decision (gamble A) whereas in the latter
case the probabilities (speaking for gamble D) contradict the choice implied by all other pieces of information
(gamble C).

2 Experiment
The predictions described above were tested in an experiment in which the number of reasons additionally in
line with the choice implied by the PH was manipulated
within participants. In the different gamble-pairs studied,
which comprised the minimum gains, maximum gains,

<-----Page 2----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008

probabilities, and expected values as pieces of information, either none, one, two, or three (all) reasons were
additionally in line with the PH. That is, there were four
levels of additional reasons in line with the PH which varied within participants.

2.1

Materials and procedure

Gambles were randomly generated with maximum gains
ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 (in steps of 50), minimum
gains taking values between 0 and 1,500 (also in steps of
50), and probabilities varying from 0 to 1 (in steps of .05).
Next, gambles were randomly paired and all pairs comprising dominance or ratios of expected values greater
than 2:1 were excluded. Consequently, all gamble-pairs
were within the PH’s niche as proposed by Brandstätter
et al. (2006). Finally, 36 gamble-pairs were randomly
selected: 9 gamble-pairs for each of the four levels of
reasons in line with the PH (none, one, two, and three,
respectively). Although there was no specific hypothesis
concerning the different PH cases (PH1, PH2 and PH3,
as described above) the number of these cases was held
constant across the four levels of reasons in line with the
PH. Thus, a four (levels of reason in line with the PH)
by three (PH case — PH1, PH2, or PH3) matrix resulted,
with a total of three gamble-pairs per cell. The gambles
used are listed in the accompanying data file.1
The experiment was administered by means of a webbased questionnaire. First, participants were familiarized
with the structure of the gambles used (all two-outcome,
non-negative) and were instructed that their task was to
choose which of two gambles they would prefer to play.
Then, after an exemplary choice task, all 36 choices between gambles were presented separately, one after the
other, in a predetermined randomized order which was
the same for all participants. For each gamble the maximum gains, probabilities of maximum gains, minimum
gains, and probabilities of minimum gains were presented. The expected values were not presented since
this would most likely bias choices. Participants were
instructed to respond speedily but to take the time they
needed to make their choices. They were also told that
there were no correct or false responses.
41 participants (37 female) were recruited from an
undergraduate-course in psychology at the University of
Mannheim. Participants were aged 19 to 68 (M = 22.8
years, SD = 8.5) and received partial course credit for
their participation.

nificantly above chance level, t(40) = 13.7, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 2.14. However, adherence rates differed substantially depending on the number of reasons in line with
the PH: Table 1 shows the proportion of choices in line
with the PH separately for the four levels of the number
of additional reasons in line with the PH.
As can be seen, participants adhered to the PH significantly below chance level whenever none or one additional reason was in line with the choice implied by the
PH. By contrast, whenever two or three additional reasons implied the same decision as the PH, choices were
largely in line with its predictions. All effect sizes can
be considered to be large (Cohen, 1988). A repeatedmeasures ANOVA with adherence to the PH as dependent
variable and the number of reasons in line with the PH as
independent variable confirmed the differences between
these four levels with F(2.2, 86.9)2 = 391.6, p < .001, η p ²
= .91. Thus, participants’ choices depended largely on
the number of additional reasons in favor of the choice
implied by the PH.3
Next, decision times were analyzed. For each participant the median decision time (excluding the first of all
36 decisions) was computed separately for the four levels of the number of additional reasons in line with the
PH. As depicted in Figure 1, participants had the longest
decision times (M = 9900ms, SE = 930ms) when one ad2 All

repeated-measures analysis could be questioned because the
same random order was used for all participants. Effects such as assimilation and accommodation between adjacent choices might be confounded with number of reasons. An additional analysis, using only
the means (across participants) of the 36 conditions yielded the same
result, however. In particular, with agreement proportion as the dependent variable, and predictors of number of reasons and order in which
each choice was presented (1–36), order had no significant effect, and
the coefficient for number of reasons was .29 (t(31) = 8.89, p < .001).

ditional reason was in line with the PH. Shorter decision
times (M = 9100ms, SE = 790ms) were observed when
no other piece of information was in line with the PH.
The shortest decision times occurred whenever two (M =
8100ms, SE = 660ms) or all (M = 7700ms, SE = 370ms)
other reasons predicted the same choice as the PH.
A repeated-measures ANOVA with decision times as
dependent variable and the number of reasons in line with
the PH as independent variable confirmed the difference
between these levels with F(1.6, 63.8) = 6.1, p < .001,
η p ² = .132. In sum, decision times were longest whenever the different pieces of information conflicted most
strongly (two vs. two); by contrast, decision times were
substantially shorter with an increasing number of reasons implying the same choice.
Additionally, the analysis of decision times was repeated including only those cases in which participants
adhered to the PH. In line with the previous analysis, median decision times decreased from M = 11086ms (SE
= 1370ms) for no additional reason in line with the PH
to M = 7491ms (SE = 374ms) when all reasons supported the PH (with M = 9619ms, SE = 1095ms and M
= 7958ms, SE = 755ms, for one and two additional reasons, respectively). This effect of the number of reasons
in line with the PH was again confirmed by a repeatedmeasures ANOVA, F(1.5, 64.2) = 6, p = .005, η p ² = .151.
Stated simply, decisions in line with the PH afforded less
time the more additional pieces of information supported
the PH-consistent choice.4

2.3 Additional analyses

4 Again, the repeated-measures analysis could be distorted by the use

of the same random order for all participants. Further, because of the restriction to cases in which the PH model agreed with the response, very
few participants contributed useful data to some of the choices. To insure the best estimate, decision times were first transformed logarithmically, which rendered their distribution approximately normal, and then
they were centered on each participant’s log mean decision time. Then

Although the analyses reported clearly reveal an influence of the number of reasons in line with the PH, a plausible caveat needs to be addressed: possibly, individuals differ in the heuristics they use. More specifically, it
may be that all participants use some non-compensatory
priority-heuristic but that these heuristics differ in the order in which pieces of information are considered. Thus,
what may look like compensatory decision-making on
the aggregate level, may turn out to be a blend of different non-compensatory process at the individual level.
To address this, all possible priority heuristics (with all
possible orderings) were modeled and the model fitting
each participants’ choices best5 was used for this participant (and will thus be denoted PHBEST in what follows).
Table 2 depicts these models along with the number of
participants for whom each model fitted best. As can be
seen, most participants’ choices were explained best by
a priority heuristic (PHiii ) which considered differences
in probabilities first, followed by differences in minimum
gains.
Next, the analyses concerning the impact of the number of additional reasons were repeated using the individually best-fitting priority heuristic for each participant.
the relevant cases were selected, and the mean of these cases across participants was computed for each case. This mean was then regressed on
order and number of reasons. In this case, order had a strong effect, but
the effects of order and of number of reasons were both highly significant: coefficients of –.01 (for a change of one position in the ordering)
and –.08 (per reason), t(32) = 3.73 and 3.35, p < .001 and p = .002,
respectively.
5 For differences in maximum gains the usual PH aspiration level
(of 1/10 of the larger maximum gain rounded to the nearest prominent
number) was used. If two models fitted a participant’s choices equally
well the model from the better fitting model category (minimum gains
first, probabilities first, or maximum gains first) was selected.

<-----Page 4----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008

Concerning choices, a repeated-measures ANOVA with
adherence to the PHBEST as dependent variable and the
number of reasons in line with the PHBEST as independent
variable revealed a significant and large effect, F(1.8,
70.6) = 194.5, p < .001, η p ² = .829. Specifically, choices
in line with the PHBEST increased from M = .27 (SE = .03)
when no additional reason was in line with the PHBEST to
M = .60 (SE = .02), M = .94 (SE = .01), and M = .96 (SE
= .02), for one, two, or three additional reasons, respectively. Thus, choices in line with the best-fitting priority
heuristic for each participant were again strongly influenced by the number of additional reasons in line with
the PHBEST which conflicts with the claim of one-reason
decision making.
Likewise, median decision times for PHBEST showed
the exact same pattern as in the previous analyses for
the original PH model. That is, decision times were M
= 9371ms (SE = 896ms) for no additional reason in line
with PHBEST , increased to M = 9977 (SE = 940ms) for
one additional reason, and then dropped to M = 8475ms
(SE = 652ms) and M = 7673ms (SE = 367ms) for two and
three additional reasons, respectively. This effect of the
number of reasons additionally in line with PHBEST was
confirmed by a repeated-measures ANOVA, F(1.7, 68.8)
= 4.9, p = .014, η p ² = .109. Likewise, and in line with the
analysis of the original PH model, decision times of only
those cases in which participants adhered to the PHBEST
dropped linearly across the levels of additional reasons in
line with the PHBEST , again corroborated by a repeatedmeasures ANOVA, F(1.9, 64.2) = 5.5, p = .007, η p ² =
.140. In sum, decision times for PHBEST comprised the
same pattern reported for the original PH model and thus
contradicting a non-compensatory decision process.

Discussion

The recently proposed and controversially debated priority heuristic (PH, Brandstätter et al., 2006) represents
a non-compensatory lexicographic strategy. As such, it
claims that choices between gambles are based on the
consideration of one piece of information only. In the
current study, this notion was tested through disentangling adherence to the priority heuristic from the number of other reasons implying the same choice as the PH.
Strictly speaking, reasons additionally in line with the PH
should be inconsequential since all other pieces of information are claimed to be ignored. For the same reason,
decision times should also not depend on these additional
pieces of information.
Both predictions were tested using a set of randomly
generated gambles which were all within the PH’s niche,
that is, excluding cases of dominance and ratios of
expected values greater than 2:1 (Brandstätter et al.,

One-reason decision making in risky choice

461

2006, 2008). The results obtained clearly contradict that
choices are based on one piece of information only: Adherence to the PH depended substantially on the number
of reasons additionally in line with its predictions. Whenever few (none or one) additional reasons implied the
same choice as the PH, adherence rates to the heuristic
were vastly below chance level. By contrast, whenever
two or three (all) additional reasons backed up the PH,
choices were virtually always in line with its predictions.
It can thus be concluded that good predictive performance
of the PH must be attributed to the fact that its prediction
and the choices implied by other pieces of information
are often confounded.
The results with respect to decision times also conflicted with the predictions derived from the PH: Choices
took longest whenever the different pieces of information conflicted most (two implying choice of one gamble, the other two implying the opposite). If, by contrast,
all pieces of information favored the same gamble, decisions were made notably faster. Such differences, however, rule out that only one piece of information was decisive, as claimed by the PH. Rather, decision times were
well in line with the notion that different pieces of information are integrated and that choices become easier (and thus faster) whenever all reasons favor one option. Likewise, decisions in line with the PH were performed with increasing speed when the number of reasons in line with the PH increased. Theoretical explanations outlining a (potentially compensatory) model accounting for the reported patterns, however, must remain
speculative at this point. Most obviously, the degree of
conflict between different pieces of information seems to
feed into longer decision times. This could, for example,
be explained though a process which first determines how
many reasons speak for each gamble before comparing
options on certain attributes in case of conflict. However,
future research advisably using process-tracing methods
(e.g. Johnson et al., 2008) is clearly needed since any
explanation herein will be post hoc and go untested.
Additionally, a different best-fitting priority heuristic
for each individual was examined owing to the possibility that participants might all use non-compensatory priority heuristics which differ in the order in which pieces
of information are considered. However, the results with
respect to both choices and decision times again contradicted the claim of one-reason decision-making, since the
number of additional reasons in line with the prediction
of the individually best-fitting model had a substantial impact.
Note, however, that the analyses using the best-fitting
priority heuristic for each participant are post-hoc and
thus bear some limitations. Most importantly, they are
no longer based on an equal number of cases for each
level of additional reasons within or across participants

<-----Page 5----->Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 6, August 2008

and should thus be interpreted with caution. However,
the reported results consistently show that even using different priority heuristics for each individual the claim of
one-reason decision-making must be refuted.
Finally, it could be argued that the hypothesis and results presented herein are based on a rather literal implementation of the PH with fixed aspiration levels (minimal
differences). Consequently, one may claim that allowing
these to vary would strongly increase the fit of the PH.
Although I readily acknowledge this, it seems unlikely
that the effect of the number of additional reasons in line
with the PH – especially on decision times — would vanish if these aspiration levels were allowed to vary. Also,
letting aspiration levels vary would drastically increase
the complexity of the PH model which is exactly what its
proponents are aiming to avoid (Brandstätter et al., 2006,
2008).
In sum, one of the PH’s central advantages — its formulation as a process model — is turning out to be its
downfall: different studies using different methods have
consistently shown that choices between gambles are not
based on one piece of information and that the steps
claimed by the PH are not likely to be taken by decision makers (Glöckner & Betsch, in press; Hilbig & Markett, 2008; Johnson et al., 2008). Moreover, the heuristic’s predictive power is at least questionable (Birnbaum,
2008a, 2008b; Glöckner & Betsch, in press) and turns
out to be rather poor whenever the PH is not backed up
by other pieces of information as shown in this article.
