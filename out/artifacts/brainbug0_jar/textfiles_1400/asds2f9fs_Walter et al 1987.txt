CODING ORDINAL INDEPENDENT VARIABLES IN MULTD7LE

biostatistics; regression analysis

Several investigators (1-3) have discussed the question of coding schemes for
discrete independent variables in multiple
logistic regression and multiple linear
regression analyses. They have described
various ways to characterize the contrasts
between the responses at the different
levels (or strata) of the independent variables. Two common options are 1) to compare the responses in each stratum with the
responses in a single referent or control
stratum or 2) to compare the responses in

the whole sample.
We would like to draw attention to an
additional coding scheme that we have
found useful in defining contrasts for
regression analyses involving categorical
independent variables that have discrete
ordered categories. If the categories are
coded by using a single variable which takes
values in a direct numerical sequence, such
as 1,2,3,4,..., the regression procedure will
analyze these numbers as though they represented a true dimension, with equal intervals measured between adjacent categories. If the ordinal values are arbitrarily
assigned rather than actually measured, the
regression coefficient is difficult or impossible to interpret. Also, depending on how
closely the assumed scaling (1,2,3, . ..)
agrees with the actual dose-response relationship, the test of significance of the coefficient may or may not be powerful against
alternative hypotheses of interest. If the
true dose-response relationship is linear,
with equal increments between successive
categories, the one degree of freedom test

The authors present a coding scheme for ordinal Independent variables which
may be used in various forms of regression analysis. The scheme is useful in
dose-response analyses, when the objective is to identify contrasts in the dependent (or response) variable between successive levels of the Independent
variable, or to identify critical threshold values of the independent variables at
which significant changes occur in the response. An example is given of evaluating the survival of lung cancer patients according to their stage of symptomatology. The authors discuss the interpretation of the regression coefficients when
this coding scheme is used with linear regression, logistic regression, or in the
proportional hazards regression model.

threshold exists, the overall linear test of
trend may have low power, as opposed to a
coding scheme that can completely reproduce the threshold relationship.

differences in survival. This approach
might, for instance, conclude that the largest differences in the outcome were between
patients with any symptoms (primary, systemic, or metastatic) as opposed to those

REGRESSION MODELS

By substituting appropriate values of Xi,
X2, and X3 into equation 1, one may calculate the average response for individuals
in each of the categories A to D. For example, in category C, we have Xi = 1, X2 =
1, and X3 = 0, thus, the predicted response
for level C in equation l i s Y = 5 + l + 2
+ 0 = 8. (The reader may verify that the
average values may be computed similarly
for the other groups.) The large difference
between categories C and D is reflected in
the large coefficient for X3.
Second, the model may include only a
single independent variable, X, say; here,

the coefficient of X, defines the contrast
between the aggregated responses in level i
and above, and the aggregated responses in
level (i — 1) and below. For instance, in the
previous example, the model with X2 alone
would provide a comparison between individuals in C and D (combined) and individuals in A and B (combined). This model
would be appropriate for pattern 2 of table
1, where a jump in the level of response
occurs between the two highest and two
lowest of the ordered strata. The coefficient
of X2 (equal to 4) represents the difference
in response between these two sets. Individuals in categories A or B have X2 = 0
and average response values of 5; in contrast, the other two categories have X2 = 1,
yielding a prediction of Y = 5 + 4 = 9.
This second model is attractive when
"stepwise" methods are used. By adopting
a forward inclusion rule for model selection,
one will identify at the first step the cut
point defining the most significant dichotomy on the scale of the independent variable X. Subsequent steps in the process will
identify any other demarcations in the scale
where meaningful changes occur in the response. Suppose pattern 3 of table 1 applied. With sufficient data, a stepwise algorithm will select Xi and X3 into the
model. We would conclude that there is no
prognostic difference between categories B
and C, but that individuals in categories A
and D differ from this combined "middle"
stratum (B and C) by amounts that are
represented by the coefficients of Xi and
X3, equal to 3 and 7, respectively.
We will now discuss the interpretation of
the coefficients b, in three particular types
of regression model, the linear, the proportional hazards, and the logistic.

We now consider, in general, regression
models that may include Xu X2, . . . Xk in
various combinations. Two specific models
are of particular interest. First, we may fit
the model with all k independent variables
included; in this model, the coefficient of
X, corresponds to the difference in responses between levels i and (i — 1), and
all such differences are estimated. Consider, for example, the hypothetical situation shown as pattern 1 in table 1. Here,
there is a progressive increase in the dependent variable going through categories
A, B, C, and D of the independent variable.
The largest difference appears to be between individuals in categories C and D.
Fitting the model with all three independent variables included yields the regression equation

while the hazard function for those with

hE =

Thus, hE/hE = exp(6i), or log(hE/hE) = 6,.
Hence, we may think of bi as a "log relative
risk" of the "exposed" to the "unexposed"
which, strictly speaking, applies to an infinitesimally short interval of time. Equivalently, exp(fe,) is the relative risk. Note that
this relative risk is constant over the time

the proportional hazards assumption, that

a log odds ratio; similarly, exp(6i) is the
odds ratio itself.
Finally, if we return again to the situation with k ordered strata, the coefficients

appropriate strata. For instance, if only X,
is fitted in the model (analogous to pattern
2 of table 1), exp(6,) is the odds ratio between the combined strata i and above, and
the combined strata (i — 1) and below.

We have presented a coding scheme for

text by considering a variety of coding
schemes to find "the most significant effect." With (k + 1) strata, there are only k
degrees of freedom available to examine
between-strata differences. This means
that a maximum of k statistically independent statements about the data can be
made. Ideally, the (up to) k contrasts to be
tested should be specified a priori, and the
coding scheme should be chosen accordingly.

useful in examining dose-response relationships for data with ordered categorical exposure strata.
It should be pointed out that if one has
(k + 1) strata and one parameterizes a full
set of k independent variables, it is always
possible to "convert" from any one coding
scheme to any other, obtaining point estimates and variances; this will typically involve some algebraic manipulation of the
codings, and of the corresponding variancecovariance matrices for the parameters.
However, the overall significance test of
association on k degrees of freedom, comparing differences between all the strata
simultaneously, is the same for any valid
coding scheme.
The choice between alternative codings
should be based on which particular contrasts between the various strata are required. The correct choice will lead directly
to relevant parameters, such as mean differences or odds ratios, even if only a partial
model is fitted. An incorrect coding choice
in a partial model will yield results that are
generally not "convertible" to another coding scheme, so reanalysis may be needed.
As usual, one must be conscious of the
danger of overanalysis of data, in this con-
