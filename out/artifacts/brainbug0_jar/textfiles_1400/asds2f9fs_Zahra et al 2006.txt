Entrepreneurship in established companies centers on new business creation that is essential for profitability and growth. Yet, it is a complex process that is riven with technical,
organizational, and political uncertainties. In this article, we explore the role of trust in the
new business creation process in established companies. While there is agreement that
trust is conducive to entrepreneurial activities in these companies, research on the dysfunctional effects of trust on new business creation initiatives has been sparse. We contribute to
the literature by discussing the various stages of the business creation process (focusing on
opportunity recognition, evaluation, refinement, championing, and implementation) in established companies, examining the positive effects of relational trust on each of these stages,
and analyzing the negative effects of overreliance on relational trust for each stage. We
conclude by highlighting the key managerial and theoretical implications of our analyses
and by outlining promising avenues for future research.

ew business creation is important for the continuous success, profitability, and
growth of established firms (Burgelman & Valikangas, 2005). These companies often
need to venture beyond their existing businesses to overcome competence traps that
preclude them from adapting to their environments (Ahuja & Lampert, 2001; Zahra &
Hayton, in press). In order to create new businesses, established companies have to
combine their existing (or new) resources in new ways (Schumpeter, 1934). These recombinations can open new paths for building new skills, renewing operations, or venturing
into market arenas within existing or new industries (Garvin, 2002).
The process of new business creation in established companies is costly, time consuming, and complex because it involves formal and informal activities across multiple

knowledge that they do not always share (Zahra, Nielsen, & Bogner, 1999). The gestation
period for new business ventures is frequently long, taking years to pay off (Van de Ven,
Venkataraman, Polley, & Garud, 2000). New business creation also requires the participation of different groups with different outlooks and perspectives (Garvin, 2004; Kanter,
1985). These conditions make formal monitoring and controls difficult and costly. The
complexity of the analyses involved in new venture creation, the interdependencies that
develop across organizational units, and the different information that different groups
control highlight the role of trust as a useful mechanism in managing the interdependencies and uncertainties encountered in recognizing, evaluating, and exploiting new business
opportunities (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003). Relation-based trust promotes cohesion, unity of direction, and cooperation that facilitates the introduction and acceptance of
new business ventures.
Trust has been defined differently in the literature. Most definitions view trust as “a
psychological state comprising the intention to accept vulnerability based upon positive
expectations of the intentions or behavior of another” (Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer,
1998, p. 395). Trust becomes relevant when people become dependent on and vulnerable
to the actions and decisions of others (McEvily et al., 2003). These people possess and
control different types of knowledge, view the purpose of the organization differently,
have different motivations in supporting new business creation, and often differ in the
evaluation of new business opportunities. When ambiguity and social complexity surrounds decision making, traditional organizational control systems may fail to bring about
or sustain an effective alignment of interest among these people. Relational trust that is
grounded in mutual respect and shared interests could be an effective complement
(Mellewigt, Madhok, & Webel, 2004; Poppo & Zenger, 2002) or supplement (Das &
Teng, 1998) to these organizational controls. Still, developing and maintaining trust takes
time, effort, and resources (Jones & George, 1998). Reliance on trust in the absence of
sufficient controls can also increase errors of judgment, obscure rational decision making,
and discourage entrepreneurial risk taking.

Objective and Contributions
The objective of this article was to examine the functional and dysfunctional roles of
relational trust in new business creation in established companies. We argue that relational
trust plays an important role in surfacing, recognizing, refining, evaluating, selecting, and
institutionalizing new business venturing initiatives. While the literature touts the positive
effects, relational trust can have serious negative effects on new business creation as well.
Consequently, we analyze the various stages of new business creation and discuss the
potentially adverse effect of relational trust on each.
We add to the literature by showing the limits of relational trust as a social mechanism
that supports the initiation and institutionalization of new ventures in established companies. Research has long advocated the need for autonomy and corresponding relational
trust as a means of stimulating the recognition and incubation of ideas (Zahra, 1991).
Relational trust enables employees to capitalize on their skills and competencies. It is also
essential because traditional valuation methods cannot fully and accurately capture the
complexity associated with new venture creation in established companies (Van de Ven
et al., 2000). The payoff from these ventures is also hard to measure a priori, complicating
analyses of the risk–return relationship.

creation and highlights questions worthy of further research.

New Business Creation in Established Companies: Stages and Challenges
The literature emphasizes the importance of new business creation for established
companies’ growth and profitability (Garvin, 2004; Van de Ven et al., 2000; Zahra, 1991;
Zahra, Neubaum, & Huse, 2000). Yet, little attention has been given to the process by
which new businesses are created within established companies (Garvin, 2002; Van de
Ven et al.). The scarcity of research on the topic stems from the complexity of the
processes involved and the long gestation period of many of these initiatives. Many ideas
for new business also develop informally (Burgelman, 1983a, 1983b; Garvin, 2004),
making it difficult to observe the processes and actors involved.
Established companies go through several iterative stages as they create new businesses (Garvin, 2002, 2004; Van de Ven et al., 2000). While there is no agreement on these
stages in the literature, Table 1 captures the most widely recognized. In the recognition
stage, new business opportunities are identified by individuals or groups of individuals.
Prior experiences and organizational skills and needs often influence the types of opportunities people and groups notice (Zahra, 1991). Some companies develop formal

Other companies rely on informal and even accidental discoveries by employees (Garvin,
2004). Since the nature and size of opportunities are frequently unclear, “innovators” rely
on the informal appraisal and feedback of their colleagues and other members of their
professional and personal networks. When making their evaluations, innovators rely on
their understanding of organizational norms and needs (Pinchot, 1985). This informal
evaluation is usually followed by the refinement stage where selected ideas are revised and
repositioned to make them more attractive to the firm’s management. In this stage, new
venture ideas should be positioned on technical and political grounds. Technical positioning means clarifying the scope of the opportunity, the potential synergies between the new
business and existing business(es), financial and other resource requirements, and the
skills needed to exploit the opportunity. Political positioning means making the business
idea salient and attractive to senior managers. The championing stage involves finding
capable and well-established individuals who will lead the venture or simply make it
attractive and accessible to the firm’s senior management.
Ideas that are well positioned technically and politically are likely to get the attention and consideration of the firm’s senior managers during the evaluation stage. These
ideas undergo multiple reviews. Once an idea receives formal management approval and
support, resources are allocated for its initiation and implementation. At the implementation stage, action plans are made and milestones are set to guide the venture’s decisions. Decisions are also made at this stage about the location of the new business
within the firm’s structure. Next, successful ventures enter the institutionalization stage
where they are permanently placed within the formal organization. Formal reviews
gauge these new ventures’ performance and progress in meeting their objectives. Still,
some companies may choose to spin off some ventures while retaining an ownership
stake in them.
Different actors with different motives, incentives, and political agenda take part in
the various stages of new business creation (Burgelman, 1983a, 1983b; Garvin, 2004; Van
de Ven et al., 2000), as indicated in Table 1. Moreover, moving from one stage of new
business creation to the next is neither assured nor predictable. Organizational politics and
cultural norms often shape these moves. Managers’ taste and receptivity to ideas for new
ventures also vary across organizational levels and time, making it difficult to foretell the
fortunes of these ventures. Venture champions also change on the basis of career accomplishments and life goals, influencing the extent to which they sell and pursue their ideas.
These realities make it difficult to determine with clarity and foresight which ventures will
gain managers’ support, possibly encouraging politicking and organizational maneuvering. Under these conditions, traditional (economic-based) controls cannot reliably align
the interests or actions of various actors. Relational trust can effectively induce and sustain
such an alignment, fostering new venture creation activities.

The Positive Effects of Relational Trust on New Business Creation in
Established Companies
Relational trust can have a significant impact on organizational attitudes and behaviors, such as cooperation (Axelrod, 1984; Jones & George, 1998; Mayer, Davis, &
Schoorman, 1995), communication (Roberts & O’Reilly, 1974), problem solving (Zand,
1972), and performance (Barney & Hansen, 1994; Earley, 1986). Relational trust can also
influence the support for and levels of entrepreneurship across sectors and national
contexts (Höhmann & Welter, 2005; Stull & Aram, 2005; Welter, Kautonen, Chepurenko,
544

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 4----->Malieva, & Venesaar, 2004). Indeed, relational trust can facilitate risk taking (McAllister,
1995), promote employees’ innovativeness (Clegg, Unsworth, Epitropaki, & Parker,
2002), and enhance proactiveness in the discovery and pursuit of new business opportunities (Stull & Aram, 2005).
Trust is a complex concept that has multiple forms and exists in diverse contexts
(Kramer, 1999; Nooteboom, 2002; Rousseau et al., 1998; Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998). There
is convergence in the literature that trust involves a willingness to be vulnerable (Barney
& Hansen, 1994; Mayer et al., 1995; Rousseau et al.) positive expectations regarding
another’s motives and/or conduct (Das & Teng, 1998; Lewicki, McAllister, & Bies, 1998),
and mutual interdependence and risk (Das & Teng, 1998, 2001; Gulati, 1995; Mayer
et al.). Though other classifications of trust exist, two are most widely acknowledged:
calculative and relational. Calculative trust is grounded in a person’s evaluation of risks
versus returns in a relationship. Relational trust, however, is based on the social interactions that take place between two or more individuals. Where relational trust prevails,
people become more interested in maintaining their social interactions while
de-emphasizing potential losses or gains. In this article, we focus on relational trust that
is grounded in the social interactions that occur within groups and networks.
In established companies, reliance on relational trust can enhance economic activity
by enabling and facilitating positive and productive interactions between and among
people and organizations while reducing transaction costs (Nooteboom, 2002). Trust may
also enhance the success of an economic transaction through its effects on the nature of
social exchange (Korsgaard, Brodt, & Whitener, 2002). When management acts in a
trustworthy manner, employees may wish to perpetuate and extend this positive relationship and to make greater contributions to the social exchange (Mayer & Gavin, 2005).
This may manifest itself in the form of greater willingness to work harder to achieve
organizational goals, innovate, or share information and knowledge.
Relational trust can also promote the achievement of a common purpose by ensuring
sufficient cognitive alignment of perceptions, interpretations, evaluations, and goals
(Nooteboom, 2002, pp. 23–29). Relational trust also facilitates the sharing of knowledge,
which is central to the identification and exploitation of entrepreneurial opportunities
(Venkataraman, 1997). Relational trust enhances frequent interactions among employees,
thereby improving facilitation of effective and rapid knowledge sharing.
Reliance on relational trust also gives established companies several specific advantages in each stage of new business creation. The magnitude of these advantages vary from
one company to the next, reflecting the idiosyncratic conditions that permeate its operations and the social structures that pervade their groups. In firms that have clear, wellestablished and communicated cultural norms, relational trust might magnify benefits
associated with new business creation efforts. The opposite may be true when social
structures are transient and relationships are loosely defined.

Recognizing Opportunities for Business Creation
Relational trust may increase entrepreneurs’ confidence that management and
coworkers will not take advantage of their openness (McEvily et al., 2003). As a result,
they may more easily share their knowledge and participate in joint problem-solving
activities, a key source of innovation and entrepreneurial ideas. Moreover, where relational trust prevails, the psychological contract with the organization is strengthened, and
employees feel strong attachments to their firm. As a consequence, employees will invest
time and energy in searching for or developing entrepreneurial ventures that improve their
company’s performance. Relational trust also enhances open communication and the
July, 2006

organizational possible changes. Recognizing that management will not penalize them for
faulty or poorly timed ideas, employees are more apt to share their ideas willingly—
setting the stage for the effective evaluation and review of proposed new business
ventures.

Evaluating New Business Creation Initiatives
In this stage, relational trust may expedite the informal evaluations made initially by
colleagues and friends who believe in the quality or future potential of ideas offered by
trustworthy parties. Members of the same network usually share a common history and
know-how to provide useful feedback that can improve the odds of innovative ideas being
formally accepted by management. Still, there is risk that such informal evaluators may
become more open to and supportive of even extreme or risky ideas, since relational trust
is likely to decrease their fear of failure. To counterbalance this tendency, formal and
thoughtful evaluations are needed. Here, too, relational trust can be useful as managers are
likely to be more positively disposed to support the ideas of those employees with credible
track records, and who are considered reliable and trustworthy. Managers may also
provide useful feedback that helps employees to refine their ideas, better positioning them
for organizational acceptance.

Framing New Business Opportunities
In this stage, relational trust can lead colleagues to make honest evaluations and give
beneficial feedback that improves the strategic positioning of the ideas. Refinement
requires “give-and-take” and mutual knowledge sharing. Colleagues and managers are apt
to share their doubts about the business idea when they trust that its developers are
credible, will receive feedback in good faith, and then use that feedback to improve the
idea. Of course, the amount and quality of feedback received and actions taken based on
it depend considerably on the social dynamics that exist among members.

Initiating and Institutionalizing New Business Ventures
In this stage, relational trust enriches the new business creation process in several
ways. For instance, relational trust increases the extent to which actors can depend on and
predict each other’s behavior. Under these conditions, the actors’ ability to coordinate
activities and their willingness to help each other increases. This increases cooperation
that also facilitates the assembly of resources, hiring of key personnel, and putting the
infrastructure together. Trust also makes the implementation of ideas faster by facilitating
conflict resolution. If disputes or different interpretations arise, they are addressed openly
and quickly since people trust each other’s judgments. Relational trust also strengthens the
actors’ identification with and commitment to common goals and objectives (McEvily
et al., 2003). As a result, the actors invest extra time and energy to ensure the success of
the proposed business ventures. The actors do so because they are not concerned about
being taken advantage of by others.
Relational trust also reduces the need for formal monitoring and control of the new
business creation initiatives, possibly lowering the cost of implementation. It can also give
employees more autonomy and flexibility in pursuing business creation activities. In turn,
this increases speed and ease by which new knowledge is captured and shared (Young,
546

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 6----->Sapienza, & Baumer, 2003). This can help employees adapt and adjust their behaviors in
ways that increase the success of the implementation of the proposed business ventures.
Trust in the benevolence of the senior management also enhances the acceptance of
rules and procedures (Lind, Tyler, & Huo, 1997). It also increases employees’ acceptance
of the decision for permanently placing the new business within the formal structure
(Tyler, Degoey, & Smith, 1996). It also becomes easier to share information about the
progress of the venture with others in the organization, making the process of institutionalizing the new venture easier.
To summarize, during the various stages of the established company’s new business
creation process, trust can give the organization several economic (e.g., lowering costs)
and social (e.g., increased commitment and solidarity) benefits. It can also promote the
employees’ satisfaction and increase their commitment, leading to successful new venture
creation. Table 2 summarizes the key benefits to be gained from trust in each stage of new
business creation.

The Dark Side of Relational Trust and New Business Creation Initiatives
Thus far, our discussion has illustrated the positive influence of trust on the various
activities of new business creation in the established company. Clearly, relational trust can
be an important social lubricant that makes things happen quickly and efficiently. It can
also expedite the accurate sharing of knowledge. Relational trust also builds the social
solidarity needed to take risks and introduce radical innovation into existing and changeresisting organizations.
Yet, reliance on trust can be excessive and can have negative effects by rendering
economic relations too exclusive or by inducing rigidities and erecting barriers to creativity and innovation (Nooteboom, 2002). Excessive relational trust can also lead to serious
errors of judgment. Deutsch (1973) argues that one source of excessive trust is naivety,
ignorance, or cognitive immaturity. The consequence of this is that the individual does not
develop a threshold of trust, which when exceeded should trigger the need to revise
expectations, attitudes, and behaviors. Accordingly, an individual may ignore evidence
that would falsify previous assumptions of trustworthiness (Nooteboom, 2002). Indeed,
evidence that contradicts trustworthiness beliefs is considered suspect and ignored
(Lewicki et al., 1998).
Relational trust also promotes overreliance on heuristics (Bazerman, 1998). Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial managers have been associated with the use of heuristics
such as representativeness and overconfidence to a greater extent than corporate managers
(Busenitz & Barney, 1997; Wright, Hoskisson, Busenitz, & Dial, 2000). In environments
where there is high uncertainty and limited information, these heuristics enable individuals to identify and exploit opportunities as well as to make decisions quickly. This latter
feature can be particularly important in entrepreneurial settings when the window of an
opportunity may be brief and a reluctance to act can result in the opportunity being
missed. When heuristic-based information processing prevails, accuracy is often compromised. Further, Nooteboom (2002) explains how heuristics can result in an inability to
adjust relational trust to changing circumstances. When events occur simultaneously,
individuals may prematurely assign causality. Thus, an individual who relies on the
“representativeness” heuristic may attribute trustworthiness on the basis of spurious
characteristics that the individual happened to observe in conjunction with the experience
of relational trust. The “overconfidence” heuristic may result in errors by neglecting the
sample size of experience. Accordingly, individuals may overestimate the probability of

<-----Page 8----->incidental occurrences and underestimate those of frequent ones. The “availability” heuristics entails a bias toward familiar experiences. This may encourage employees to use
sources of information and opportunities that are familiar to them at the exclusion of other
potentially valuable but less familiar sources.
Researchers have not been as attentive to examining the dark side of relational trust,
focusing more on its positive effects. Instead, researchers have discussed ways that reduce
chances of opportunism, and lower the probability of individual and group deviance while
increasing focus on organizational goal accomplishment. Talking about these various
mechanisms can help improve the chances that trust is well founded. But such discussions
do not capture the various ill effects of relational trust on new business creation activities.
Understanding these effects can set the stage for an informed discussion of intensifying
relational trust and, as a result, the odds of successful new business creation efforts.
Consequently, in this section, we pause and discuss the potential ill effects of relational
trust within the various stages of new business development. Table 2 shows that the
negative effects of relational trust could be felt in every stage of the new business creation
process, even though these effects may vary from one company to another. These effects
are also likely to differ within the same company on the basis of the stage, the nature of
the new business being created, and the conditions surrounding its establishment.

Recognizing Opportunities for Business Creation
In the opportunity recognition stage, it is useful to differentiate between the sources
and types of ideas for new business initiatives. Sources of ideas for these ventures could
come from within the firm, either formally or informally (Burgelman, 1983a, 1983b;
O’Connor & Rice, 2001). Ideas for the new business ventures might also come from
external sources (e.g., suppliers or alliance partners), also formally or informally (Zahra,
1991). Where relational trust prevails, the company is likely to make greater use of
informal internal and external sources (e.g., networks) to supplement or offset the limitations of any existing internal formal systems dedicated to opportunity recognition. When
relational trust pervades the venture creation process, greater attention will be given to
those sources within and outside the firm that are believed to be credible. Sources that are
not familiar to decision makers, controversial, or viewed as not supportive of existing
management or norms are likely to be overlooked, ignored, or even suppressed. As a
result, search for opportunities for new business might be limited in focus, selective, and
even biased. Given that controversial or unfamiliar sources are ignored, the search process
is likely to reinforce a “thinking alike” culture, leading to strategic blindness where
favored opportunities or those coming from well-known sources are not subjected to
systematic or rigorous analysis. Reliance on the same sources in identifying and determining potential opportunities could also limit the variety of these opportunities, handicapping the firm’s quest to break away from the familiar by venturing into new fields.
Ideas for new business creation could center on incremental or radical change.
Incremental change means adding to the firm’s existing businesses without venturing far
afield from its strategic core (Zahra, 1991). Radical change centers on altering the very
concept of business or the firm’s strategic core or how the firm competes (e.g., changing
its business model). Incremental changes are usually easier to evaluate and accept by
management. These changes require skills that are usually readily available in the organization. The organizational structure could also accommodate these changes. In contrast,
radical changes are harder to appraise and incorporate within the firm’s ongoing operations or existing structures.
July, 2006

549

<-----Page 9----->Where relational trust prevails, both incremental and radical changes are easier to
accept and implement in the firm. The problem is that where relational trust becomes
excessive, existing power centers are likely to favor ideas from well-known sources that
they already know, value, and trust. The stability of these sources makes it less likely
that they conceive and develop radical change that disrupts the status quo. Ideas for radical
innovation often thrive at the margin and have to fight hard for management’s recognition
and acceptance (Kanter, 1983, 1985). Advocates of these ideas are often not well connected to the firm’s power centers and may not enjoy the relational trust of the firm’s
leadership. These ideas are likely to be subjected to greater scrutiny and analyses, as
discussed next.

Evaluating New Business Creation Initiatives
In this stage, one can see several manifestations of the ill effects of excessive relational trust on new business creation activities. As we state in Table 2, where trust
dominates the process, analyses could be perfunctory and ad hoc in nature, failing to
establish the strategic relevance and viability of the proposed business ventures. Decision
makers might also show considerable favoritism to the sources they trust, as we have just
suggested. Specifically, senior managers might sacrifice objectivity in their analysis and
rely more on their intuition or shared experiences in appraising these ideas. Executives
might also downplay the potential risks associated with the proposed projects while
overstating their potential gains by overemphasizing the intangibles of these projects.
These intangibles are hard to assess under the most normal circumstances. The value of
these intangibles also varies on the basis of how they are used, further making it difficult
to evaluate their strategic importance. This importance, in turn, is likely to change over
time, and managers could use this to advocate (or sabotage) new business venture ideas.
Decision makers, thus, may not exercise the due diligence necessary to establish the
merits and limitations of the proposed business ventures.
Without rigorous analyses, the foundation for making effective decisions about the
new business ventures to pursue and develop is undermined. Worse, as we propose in
Table 2, managers might end up experiencing the “Abilene paradox,” where they more or
less agree on the same ventures without sufficient recognition of their limitations
or without genuine commitment to their fate (Harvey, 1988). Excessive relational trust
could discourage some managers from expressing their concerns or from questioning the
assumptions and conclusions of the analyses conducted of these proposed ventures.
Another insidious effect of excessive relational trust is that employees and interested
others watching how the firm makes decisions about new business ventures become
discouraged as they conclude that political, not economic, considerations shape these
decisions. When such beliefs take hold of employees, many become unwilling to suggest
or champion new business venture ideas, possibly reducing the variety of the ideas
presented to management. Over time, this could intensify inertia or perpetuate the “nearness trap” (Ahuja & Lampert, 2001), where the firm continues to search for ideas for
innovation and new business in the vicinity of the knowledge and skills it already has. This
reinforces the belief that those individuals who are overembedded in their social networks
might become risk averse (Brass, Galaskiewicz, Greve, & Tsai, 2004).

Framing New Business Opportunities
Table 2 offers several additional reasons for companies’ potential failure to escape
inertia through new business creation, where trust becomes excessive. In the opportunity
550

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 10----->framing (i.e., refinement) stage, certain venture ideas are likely to receive considerable
formal and informal feedback from the company’s decision makers. The higher the
relational trust these individuals have in the sources of the opportunity, the more detailed
and forthcoming their feedback is likely to be. Yes, as we argue later, much depends on the
social dynamics of the relationship. Higher trust could lead to less feedback and immediate acceptance of proposed ideas.
Relational trust encourages and facilitates the sharing of information, including negative feedback. This feedback can shape the fate of new business ideas by better positioning
them for the firm’s formal acceptance and implementation. Even when the feedback
comes from informal networks, it could help connect the new business idea to the firm’s
dominant logic and managers’ decision and mental models—expediting their formal
acceptance by the organization. Ideas for radical business concepts are more likely to
benefit from such feedback. The more feedback that advocates of these ideas receive, the
more they can refine and reframe them and better clarify their connections to the firm’s
mission, resources, and skills. Ironically, while these refinements could enhance the odds
of ideas for radically new projects’ survival, ideas might lose their originality as their
advocates seek to gain the support and commitment of senior managers. Champions may
scale down their own ideas or redefine them in ways that will make them more organizationally and politically acceptable.
Changing the scope and scale of radical new business venture ideas is easier to do
when champions come from existing power centers within the firm (Table 1). To retain
their connections to decision makers, champions may ask advocates of new business ideas
to compromise by changing their timetable, altering key design features, or even lowering
cost estimates. Aware of the biases that govern the selection of new business ideas, some
champions might hide key pieces of information from decision makers or might introduce
the idea piecemeal to complicate its accurate evaluation. Still, champions need to maintain
their credibility with decision makers and therefore may not support truly radically
different ideas, unless the organization is facing a major performance crisis. Clearly, eager
to maintain the trust that they enjoy throughout the organization, champions may favor
those ideas that they believe managers like. Champions may not support radically different ideas for new business ventures.

Initiating and Institutionalizing New Business Ventures
Some of the most serious effects of excessive relational trust could be observed in this
stage of new business creation (Table 2). For instance, relational trust could translate into
informal, ad hoc, or loose controls that produce faulty or incomplete information about the
progress being made. In turn, this could prevent managers and other key decision makers
from providing the help or support needed to ensure effective implementation or to take
corrective actions that reduce costs and keep the new project(s) on track.
The limited or misguided feedback that decision makers receive can also reduce
individual, group, and organizational learning. New business creation initiatives are “reallife experiments” (Garvin, 2004) that provide participants an opportunity to learn by doing
(Zahra et al., 1999). Feedback grounded in the actual implementation gives participants
important clues about the best ways to introduce and organize the new business, and
connect it to the organization. This information often becomes part of the firm’s “organizational memory” and determines its future business creation efforts. Without timely,
detailed, and accurate feedback, organization-wide experiential learning is likely to be
limited (Garvin, 2004; Zahra et al., 1999).

<-----Page 11----->Missed opportunities for organizational learning often signal serious knowledgesharing problems. Networks that are grounded in relational trust may not share negative
information about the failures of the projects that their members might have initiated.
Network members might overrate certain types of knowledge while downgrading the
value of other types. These members may not share it with others outside their group to
retain control or lower expectations of spectacular achievements that could not be realistically sustained. Accurate information about the new business, therefore, might remain
with only a few people who may not share it with the rest of the organization, possibly
frustrating and obfuscating organizational learning.
Bound by mutual trust, members of existing informal networks might join forces and
slow down the introduction and institutionalization of threatening radical business
ventures. The solidarity that binds network members and the trust that ties them might
unite them against threatening business ventures. These projects could change patterns of
resource allocations, disrupt existing social structures, and cause shifts in the powers that
network members have. These are real challenges to existing networks and their members.
Strong social bonds often discourage network members from questioning each other’s
motives or from sounding the alarm even when ethical violations occur, or from raising
questions about the value added to new ventures (Coleman, 1988). These effects increase
especially when networks become embedded in the organization, limiting the flow of
contradictory information that invites questioning and probing (Brass, Butterfield, &
Skaggs, 1998).
Excessive relational trust can raise the costs of developing, introducing, and adopting
new business ventures (Table 2) because there are major costs for creating and maintaining social networks. As linkages increase, the costs associated with network maintenance
usually rise (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). New business creation might also challenge the
social relations that exist in a unit, group, or network. Effort and time are needed to repair
damaged relationships, build new bridges to existing power centers, or simply renew and
sustain group solidarity (Adler & Kwon, 2002). This solidarity can evoke negative feelings and even the desire to protect the group by sabotaging the radically innovative
ventures championed by competing groups (Uzzi, 1997), intensifying conflicts within and
across groups. Finally, even when things go well, the need for communication, consultation, and involvement could increase the time and costs needed to implement new business
ventures (Gabbay & Zuckerman, 1998).
When faulty formal controls exist, management may unwittingly or prematurely
diffuse promising ventures within the organization, encouraged by early signs of their
progress. Early on, new projects might move according to schedule, but then they may
cross the “valley of death” where political, organizational, managerial, and informational
problems arise, slowing down their progress and, often, bringing them to a halt. Early
successes do not always translate into long-term viability: For instance, many promising
new ventures that are developed to commercialize radically new products fail because
they do not have the skills, competitors move quickly to preempt the firm, or the parent
company does not provide the requisite resources or complementary assets.

Discussion
New business creation in established companies is a complex, time-consuming, and
expensive organizational activity. It usually involves multiple, overlapping, and iterative
stages (Garvin, 2004; Van de Ven et al., 2000). In each of these stages, there are opportunities for serious informational asymmetries, opportunism by different and competing
552

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 12----->actors, and conflicts over end “goals” and means of “how to best achieve them.” Given the
social, technical, and organizational complexity of these stages, relational trust can bring
about better alignment among the goals of key players. As such, relational trust can
facilitate and foster the recognition of opportunities, rapid evaluation of alternatives, and
effective implementation. Still, our article also makes it clear that there is a heavy “price
tag” for companies’ overemphasis on relational trust. Cliques might form and limit the
flow of ideas on different opportunities, constraining the search for radical change. We
have also suggested that analyses could be perfunctory. Strategic variety might be scarified, handicapping a firm’s search for radical change through new business creation.

Limitations
Our discussion highlights the functional and dysfunctional effects of relational trust on
new venture creation in established companies. However, our presentation ignores several
outcomes of new venture creation by assuming that these ventures will be born and
developed within the organization. More and more companies are spinning off some of their
new ventures either for financial (e.g., lack of resources) or strategic (e.g., fit) reasons. Trust
might play different roles in those ventures that are spun off from those units that are
retained and supported by the organization. Another shortcoming of our article is ignorance
of the possibility that lessons learned at one level of the organization about new venture
creation could be transferred to other levels, influencing the functional and dysfunctional
effects of relational trust. Finally, while grounded in social relationships, relational trust
indicates a belief in the system rather than in the individuals managing that system. For
instance, employees might have questions about the trustworthiness of their superiors but
still believe that, in the end, the system will work well when it comes to considering,
evaluating, and selecting new venture ideas. Our analyses do not make a distinction between
trust in people versus the systems that exist within the organization.

Implications for Managerial Practice
Our discussion emphasizes the vital importance of managerial attention to the various
stages of new business creation. Some of these activities (e.g., opportunity recognition)
might start at the bottom or middle of the organization (Pinchot, 1985) where it might be
hard to gain the recognition and support of executives. Consequently, it is prudent
to develop systems and processes that enable employees throughout the organization to
come forward with their suggestions and proposals for new ventures. Managers should
also solicit ideas and proposals from groups and individuals who are not easily identified
with existing networks. Managers also need to create an environment where these proposals are considered and evaluated fairly.
Relational trust can also reduce the costs of experimentation associated with developing and transplanting new ventures in the organization. Naturally, maintaining relational trust at any cost could have a counterproductive effect on the firm and its operations.
In particular, the opportunity cost for the firm could be huge, exemplified in missed
opportunities to develop and grow new businesses that create new revenue streams and
ensure growth. Few organizations can afford missing such opportunities, especially at
times of industry change. Managers need to ensure that different people, with different
and even competing ideas, are plugged into the system and identify promising venture
opportunities.
Managers also need to “trust but verify.” Social networks promote trust that occasionally could obscure objective and rational evaluation. Managers need to recognize the
July, 2006

553

<-----Page 13----->“downside” of trust and to conduct their analyses with some degree of dispassion and
objectivity. These analyses serve to establish the credibility and viability of the proposed
venture. They can also serve as a visible signal that all good ideas, regardless of their
source, are worthy of attention and fair treatment. This, in turn, can encourage employees
on the fringes of existing networks to present and share their ideas for new business
development.
Some of the downside effects of overemphasis on relational trust arise from “embeddedness” in existing networks within the organization. Embeddedness means that a person
(group) is tightly integrated into an existing social network. These networks differ in their
complexity and social dynamics (e.g., how members make decisions or share information), complicating outsiders’ ability to know how members’ mind-sets develop. This
challenges managers to follow the social dynamics of various networks, communicate
with their members, solicit ideas from them, and work through the social processes
associated with their preferences. Managers also need to build trustworthy relationships
with individuals and groups (in and outside the company) that fall beyond the boundaries
of these networks.

Implications for Theory and Future Research
In this article, we have presented a stylized discussion of the functional and dysfunctional effects of relational trust on new venture creation in established companies. Future
researchers need to understand the context in which the new venture creation process takes
place. For example, the factors that determine new venture creation initiatives in established family firms might differ from those that exist in other companies. Familial and
kinship ties might foster trust (Zahra, 2003, 2005; Zahra, Hayton, & Salvato, 2004). As we
argued throughout this article, relational trust promotes a willingness to take and share the
risks associated with new business creation. Of course, in other situations, family dynamics could engender distrust and opportunistic behavior that can undermine value creation.
This latter situation is similar to that found in larger and publicly held corporations where
principal–agency problems are common.
The relationship between formal organizational controls and relational trust deserves
further analysis. Some view relational trust and formal trust as substitutes (Zaheer &
Venkatraman, 1995). Others view them as complements (Mellewigt et al., 2004) or
supplements (Das & Teng, 1998). We do not know the specific conditions that produce
these different effects (complements, supplements, or substitutes) and their respective
functional and dysfunctional impacts on the various stages of new business creation. Of
course, controls could be grounded in social norms (Ouchi, 1979) or formal organizational
systems (Cialdini, 1996). Future researchers would benefit from exploring the differences
in how social norms and formal organizational processes influence the relationship
between control and trust in new venture creation initiatives. Social controls, for instance,
might mitigate the negative effects of trust on the exploration of diverse ideas, expediting
the adoption of radical ventures. Social norms of honesty and respect of others’ property
rights should encourage employees to suggest ideas for new business ventures, magnifying the positive effect of relational trust on these initiatives.
The effects of relational trust on new business creation might be moderated by
institutional forces. For instance, when organizations are performing poorly, they might be
more open to different sources of new venture ideas and implement these ideas more
quickly. Sanders (2001) has also shown that when firms are performing poorly, managers
are more apt to take risks. Given the mounting pressures to improve performance, managers might show greater consideration of different sources of ideas or even employ
554

ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE

<-----Page 14----->different criteria in evaluating opportunities. Clearly, future research would benefit from
exploring the effects of situational variables (e.g., performance levels and environmental
conditions) on business creation initiatives as well as the functional or dysfunctional
effects of relational trust in this regard (Zahra, Rasheed, & Priem, 2005).
Entrepreneurship centers on the conception and creation of new business (Gartner,
1990; Zahra, 1991; Zahra, Sapienza, & Davidsson, 2006). To date, most researchers have
studied new business creation by independent entrepreneurs. In contrast, researchers have
given less attention to the processes associated with established companies’ creation of
new business, the sequence of these processes, and the skills and competencies needed to
succeed in each. This is a serious gap in the entrepreneurship literature. Case studies,
qualitative and large-scale quantitative studies, would be helpful in delineating the various
stages in new business creation as well as the various actors involved in each, and key
success factors.
Different social and professional networks usually exist in a company. These networks vary in their composition, structures, and social dynamics. As a result, they may
have different effects on the various stages of new venture creation discussed throughout
this article. Therefore, future researchers should examine the effects of different network
factors on the entrepreneurial activities leading to or associated with new business creation
initiatives. Researchers also need to investigate and document “dark sides” of these
networks on these initiatives.

Conclusion
Throughout this article, we have argued for a more balanced view of the implications
of relational trust for new business creation in established companies. We have noted that
relational trust can overcome some of the problems associated with the social complexity,
causal ambiguity, informational asymmetry problems, and political tensions that arise in
the various stages of new business creation. As such, relational trust can be a powerful
ingredient for fostering activities needed for successful new business creation. We have
also identified several downside effects of relational trust in the context of new business
creation in established companies. We hope our article stimulates future research on this
complex but important issue.
