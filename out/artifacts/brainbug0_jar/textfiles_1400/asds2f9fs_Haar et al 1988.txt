In this study we profile a group of informal investors, their investment
criteria and the nature of their referral network. The study supports the
findings of several earlier studies. It indicates the existence of an extensive
informal investment community on the East Coast of the U.S.A., which
can provide substantial financial resources to startup and young firms. A
full 58% of the sample investments were in startups; a huge proportion
compared with formal venture capital sources. The study further supports earlier findings that this
group is difficult to locate, for entrepreneurs and researchers alike. This opaque market consists
primarily offriends and business colleagues who individually provide modest sums of money ($20,000$50,000), but are often able to use their network to assemble a group of investors who will sponsor
the entire funding requirement. 130 informal investors report that in three years they and their networks
raised 38 million dollars to support 286 new venture proposals.
There are also encouraging indications that these angels are both enthusiastic and persistent.
Many of them claim that they have achieved higher returns via angel activity than any other investment
options that they have tried. Of the angels who did better with alternative investment options, more
than 80% are still prepared to make further investments. ,Even those who reported failed investments
in the informal risk capital market remain supportive; over 65% indicate a willingness to invest again.
The criteria by which the angels screen the proposals dtrer markedly from those of the venture
capital community. In particular, the angels do not appear to be interested in a thorough business
plan, a sine qua non for venture capitalists. Unlike the capital firms, angels are not interested in
competitive insulation. They do not limit their investments to industries that are appealing, or with
which they are familiar, nor do they care very much about the degree to which the entrepreneur has
identified competition. However, they are in close agreement with the venture capital community in

their concern with the management ability of the venture team and a requirement that there be a clear,
demonstrated need for the product or service, preferably in a market with large potential.
The study has shed some light on the structure of the referral networks of angels. Though we
do not know from this study how the respondents themselves first heard of the ventures that were
described in this survey, we do know that their referral network is composed primarily of friends and
business colleagues; to whom they refer as much as 60% of the proposals that they receive and in
which they themselves eventually invest. Thus they pass on serious opportunities to their network.
Their referees are inclined to be very supportive; in our sample almost 75% of them also invested in
the venture. The current strategy for informal investors is to approach mainly close contacts. These
are inclined to be supportive (8.5% also invested in the venture) and to follow a trusting investment
behavior pattern, relying mainly on the recommendation of the angel. This strategem ensures that the
total capital requirements are met via the network. However, given the results of this study; the angels
might be well-advised not to stop here, they might also approach at least one professional. Only a
small proportion of professionals were approached by our sample of angels (less than 30%). As the
study shows, professionals are more effective at selecting successful ventures. Thus a mixed strategy
may be called for: use mainly trusting referees to ensure full capitalization and a limited number of
professional referees to screen the proposals. This will help ensure that those proposals that do get
supported by the more trusting members of the network have been competently screened, thus increasing
to the probability of venture success.
A discriminant analysis revealed some useful pointers in helping the informal investor select
successful ventures. First it is critical to select only ventures in which the entrepeneur can be relied
on to evaluate the risks of the ventures and manage these risks well; Angels do not need entrepreneurs
that will gamble with their money. Equally important is to avoid placing too much credence on highly
articulate sales pitches by the venture team, or too much reliance on ventures in which the main
emphasis is on product and proprietary protection. Rather insist on being shown clear evidence that
the product or service has channel andlor market acceptance. It is also important for Angels to stick
to investments where they know the industry well, and to back venture teams with a solid reputation
and a propensity to get involved in the details rather than gloss them over. As in the case of studies
of venture capital investments, competitive insulation in the early stages of the venture is also important.

INTRODUCTION
Informal venture investors (business angels) fill an otherwise unmet need in the risk capital
market for new businesses (Wetzel 1983). Whereas, public offerings of equity financing are
generally available in the over $2 million range and professional venture capital investors
require over $500,000, business angels provide the bulk of the unsecured funding in the
under $500,000 category. In 1985, this funding source was estimated at $2.5 billion, far
greater than the other unsecured sources of risk capital (Wetzel 1986).
There is limited information about this group of informal investors. Several regional
studies have identified the demographic characteristics and investment patterns of informal
investors: New England (Wetzel 1983); Ohio and Kentucky (Neiswander 1982; Shaper0
1983); and California (Krasner and Tymes 1983.) The general conclusions of these studies
have been that the informal venture capital market is an imperfect market, for it is difficult
for angels and entrepreneurs to meet. In fact, the University of New Hampshire Venture
Capital Network was established in 1983, designed specifically to meet this need (Wetzel
1983, 1986).
Given the criticality of funding for new venture start ups it is important to learn all
that we can about this vital but imperfect financial market. Along these lines, this study was
developed for two purposes:

their criteria for making

In the discussion below, we shall lay out several propositions reflecting our expectations
regarding the profiles and investment behavior of the business angels we intend to study.

Demographic Characteristics
The findings of the several regional studies cited above, revealed consistent patterns of
informal investor demographics: Informal investors are typically in their mid40s and have
a graduate education (MBA or other postgraduate degree). Such investors also tend to have
high incomes; mostly in the range of $lOO,OOO-$250,000 per annum.
The previous studies revealed that business angels tend to be experienced investors,
who have invested in stocks, bonds, and even venture capital funds as well as informal riskcapital ventures. Their motivation for making informal investments is the potential for
especially high rate of return and for capital appreciation rather than for tax shelter purposes.
Given the consistency of results among other studies cited above, we did not expect
major differences in the profile of the business angels in the Eastern U.S.A. and those in
the other studies. The expectation was that they would exhibit similar demographic characteristics. However, it is necessary to do such comparisons, since there are distinct social
and economic differences among these regions.

Investment Characteristics
The regional study findings for investment patterns were equally consistent. Angels invest
in a wide range of venture projects, but have shown a greater interest in financing high
technology manufacturing
firms. Contributions
per venture vary by region, but generally
range between $10,000 and $100,000. Wetzel found in his 1983 study that the New England
angels invested about $16 million in 320 ventures, with about 75% of the investments under
$50,000. We expected the patterns to be similar for our study.
In the other studies the informal investors expected a high rate of return, and planned
to liquidate any one investment within 3-7 years. We expected to find much the same results.

Investment Criteria
In this study, we decided to explore the issue of investment criteria somewhat beyond the
expected rate of return. A study by MacMillan, Siegel and SubbaNarasimha (1985) identified
several key criteria that were used by venture capitalists to evaluate venture proposals. We
reasoned that while informal investors may not use as formal an evaluation process as the
venture capital community, there would be significant parallels between the criteria that both
groups use, and that the importance attached to certain criteria would be as high for informal
investors as for the formal venture capitalists.

Proposition 1: In line with the study of the formal venture capitalists, the following criteria
will be regarded

as highly important

by informal

investors:

l

entrepreneur

should be capable of sustained effort;

l

entrepreneur

should be able to evaluate risk well;

l

entrepreneur

should be thoroughly

familiar with the market targeted by the venture;

l

the target market should enjoy a significant

leadership ability in the past;

l

the market potential

l

the venture should have convenient

growth rate;

for the product should be large;

to the business angel.

In addition, the studies by Wetzel and by Krasner and Tymes indicated that there
would be one particular criterion idiosyncratic to business angels.
In addition, to the above qualifying criteria we decided to test for certain disqualifiers;
characteristics of the entrepreneur, product, market or venture that would render the project
totally unacceptable to the business angel despite its other apparently redeeming qualities.

Proposition 1 continued: The following characteristics
l

market potential

l

product’s

l

entrepreneur

l

informal

would disqualify

the proposal:

insufficient;

not protected by some proprietary
overestimates

characteristic;

with the technological

nature of the investment.

Referral Networks
Wetzel (1983, 1986) has clearly demonstrated that in the absence of a formal structure (stock
exchanges or formal venture capital networks) informal networking is a vehicle for assembling sufficient funds to support ventures. Informal venture capitalists tend to belong to a
referral network of friends and business associates which pool resources to finance a venture.
In New England, the funding of more than 60% of past ventures had been group efforts
where respondents had joined with other individuals to capitalize larger projects (Wetzel
1983). In Columbus, Ohio, and Louisville, Kentucky, angels would not invest alone, but
would try to interest others in investing with them (Shaper0 1983). Similarly, 78% of San
Francisco Bay area investors preferred to share their investments with other individuals
(Krasner and Tymes 1983). In fact, a good investment decision heuristic for an angel to use
might be to avoid investments which he or she could not persuade others to join, for two
reasons. First, the risk is shared with others and second the referees can be construed as an
informal jury; lack of support by referees can be taken as an indication of a suspect venture.
One of the major objectives of this study was to further our understanding of the
referral network.
Thus our expectations were that there would be a tendency for informal investors to
refer their proposals to others, and that those proposals in which they invested would tend
to have been supported by referees.

Proposition 2: A significant proportion of investments
would have been referred to others.
Proposition 3: A significant

proportion

in which business angels have invested

of the referees would have also invested

in the

venture.
The next set of expectations had to do with the nature of the network. Other studies
have shown that there is a wide spectrum of referrals, ranging form close friends and relatives
through business associates through professionals. We expected that this would also be the

<-----Page 4----->INFORMAL RISK CAPITAL INVESTMENT PATTERNS

15

case with the Eastern U.S. angels. However, we expected more specifically that the structure
of these referrals would be predominately friends and business associates; rather than,
professionals such as lawyers, accountants and venture capitalists.
Proposition 4: Friends, relatives and business associates will dominate the business angels
referral network.
~oposition 5: The closer the referee to the referrer, the more likely that they would invest;
in other words, friends, relatives and business associates are more likely to invest than
professionals.
Proposition 6a: The closer the referee to the referrer, the less likely that the investment
will be successful. (Proposition 6b appears further below)
This proposition is based on the assumption that closeness to the referral source clouds
judgment. Along similar lines we expected that the investment decision behavior of referees
would be characterised by varying degrees of trust in the business angel making the referral.
We envisaged a spectrum of trust, reflected in the following categories.
a. Truster: A referee who decides to support the venture without any questions and therefore
invests solely on the basis of the recommendation of the referrer.
b. Checker: A referee whose major criterion for deciding to support the venture is the
recommendation of the referrer but checks first to see whether the referrer is also investing
in the venture.
c. Evaluator: A referee who decides to support the venture only after carefully evaluating
the business proposal.
d. Advisor: A referee capable of contributing technical or managerial advice and who can
actually help the referrer to evaluate the business proposal.
e. Broker: Professionals who sell a deal to clients.
f. Gatekeepers: People who receive proposals and refer them to other investors but not for
a fee.
Proposition 6b: The more trusting the decision behavior of the referee, the less likely that
the investment will be successful.
Proposition 7: The truster and checker categories would tend to dominate the referral network
of business angels.
Proposition 8: The closer the referee to the referrer, the more trusting the decision behavior
of the referee.

For the purpose of the study, we defined an informal risk-capital investment as an investment
by a private individual in a young startup company. A survey approach was selected. A
questionnaire was developed and pilot tested with several business angels personally known
to the authors to assess the characteristics of the informal investors and their investments.
The questionnaire addressed the following: attitudes towards this type of investment alter-

native; criteria and expectations which shape the investor’s decisions regarding investment
opportunities; characteristics of up to five risk capital investments during the past three years;
and a focussed set of questions targeted at the referral patterns for one particular recent
venture.

SAMPLE SELECTION
The difficulty in identifying and eliciting responses from informal investors has been well
documented (Wetzel 1983). Given the imperfect market for informal investors, it is difficult
for entrepreneurs and researchers alike to locate potential respondents. Angels are reluctant
to respond to research inititives for fear of being identified and then deluged with investment
proposals. In anticipation of these difficulties we identified several groups of individuals
with high enough discretionary income that they might support informal investment activity
and who also might be willing to disclose informal investment information of a sensitive
nature.
The original intention of the study was to focus on the New York Metropolitan area;
but due to difficulties with obtaining a large enough sample of usable responses, the scope
of the study was expanded to the Eastern U.S.A. MBA alumni of New York University
and The Wharton School who lived in the New York Metropolitan area and who graduated
before 1970 were contacted, in the hope that their affiliation with the university would
prompt their participation in an NYU and Wharton based research effort. We also tried a
small sample of NYU medical school alumni. In addition, we sampled members of the New
York Venture Group, a list of New York Metropolitan dentists and a number of personal
referrals from business angels known to the authors. Eventually we expanded our sample
beyond the New York area; including members of venture capital clubs; subscribers to
Venture Magazine’s “Venture Capital Club Monthly” and subscribers to the University of
New Hampshire’s Venture Capital Network. Thus, we ended up with a varied and extensive
list of 2989 potential respondents who would be likely to participate in this type of investment
activity, screening data sources by occupation, age income and geographic area (Table 1).

Response Rate
From a total of 2989 questionnaires that were distributed, 320 were returned, for an overall
response rate of about 10%. Of the 320 that were returned 130 had made an informal
investment in the previous three years. 190 respondents reported that they had not made an
informal investment in the past three years. Though we do not really know whether the
nonrespondents
had never participated in this type of venture or whether this group was
reluctant to participate in this type of research, virtually all the respondents who had not
made recent investments indicated that they wished to receive the results of the survey,
indicating a strong interest in the phenomenon of informal investment. Our usable response
rate (4.3%) is comparable to the earlier regional studies by Wetzel in New England (response
rate = 1.3%), and Tymes and Krasner in California (response rate = 6%).
The final sample included informal investors identifiable from 17 states, with 40%
from the New York Metropolitan area (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut) (Table 2).
The remainder represented a broad geographic area. A comparison of their responses with
those from the New York Metropolitan area yielded few significant differences; most of
which are reported in our discussion of response biases. Nonetheless, we limited our sample
to those resident on the East Coast, from which 91% of the identifiable angels came. Fortytwo respondents chose to remain anonymous, but since their responses did not differ from
those of identifiable respondents we assumed that their inclusion in an East Coast sample
would not seriously bias the results and they were incorporated into our final sample, for a
total of 121 U.S. East Coast angels.

Sample Bias
It is important to bear in mind that there were several identifiable sample biases. One bias
in the sample was that respondents were highly educated. 56.2% held Master’s degrees,

which include the large number of NYU and Wharton business school graduates that were
included in the original sample.
A second major source of bias was that many were involved in the financial services
and investment community (32%). This is surely a reflection of the fact that New York City
is the major financial center in the U.S. and that a large percentage of NYU and Wharton
graduates enter the financial services sector. Contrast, only 24 (18%) had professional degrees
with only five dentists, which is disappointing given that 20% of the original sample were
New York Metropolitan dentists. Only six respondents reported that they were currently
self-employed.
A much more serious bias was a clearly identifiable self selection bias; as we show
below. Respondents reported inordinately high success rates in their ventures, indicating a
distinct propensity for successful informal investors to respond to the questionnaire.
Naturally the results of the study should be tempered by recognition of these biases.

RESULTS
Demographic Characteristics
East Coast Angels are predominantly
men (98.1%) in middle age, 60% being between 41
and 60 years old. The income level of respondents was high; 51% had annual income
between $I~,~
and $249,000, but there were very few millionaires.

<-----Page 8----->INFORMAL RISK CAPITAL INVESTMENT PATTERNS

19

As expected, our findings are similar to the findings of earlier studies. The sample
were experienced investors many of whom had also invested in stocks, bonds and even
formal venture capital funds. The main reason for making informal risk-capital investments
was the potential for especially high rate of return (44% of respondents) and the opportunity
for capital appreciation (39%). Only 8% were interested in this type of investment for tax
shelter purposes, and fully half of these 8% had primarily made real estate investments.
The major difference for our sample is the very high percentage of angels in the
financial services sector (32%) discussed above under biases in the sample.
Given the relatively large percentage of professional women in the east coast, the low
percentage of female angels is surprising; women have not yet entered the ranks of informal
risk capital investors to any great extent.

Inwstment Characteristics
The questionnaire
asked the angels to describe the general characteristics for up to five
informal investments made in the past three years: the amount of money invested; the general
industry category; the stage of business (startup or young firm) and results of the venture.

Inves~nt

Expectation

Compared to the other studies, this group had high expectations. They are not the patient
investors described by Wetzel, who consider the holding period unimportant or expect to
hold their risk capital investments longer titan ten years (Wetzel, 1983). Seventy-five percent
expected to liquidate their investment within five years. More than half of the respondents
expected to multiply their investment one to four times over as a minimum; and 20% expected
a multiple of ten times.
Surprisingly informal risk-capital ventures were the most profitable form of investment
for 42% of the respondents; only 30% reported that publicly traded stocks were the most
profitable. Their enthusiasm for this type of investment was overwhelming, more than 90%
would invest in an informal risk-capital investment again. This enthusiasm of the sample
was justified by the results that they reported. 38% of the respondents reported that they
made money on their investments. Only 21% lost al1 or part of their capital (13% lost part
of their capital and 8% lost all or most of their money). For 50% of the ventures it was still
too soon to determine the outcome. These positive results are remarkable given that 58%
of the investments were in startups (as firm which was still in the process of being organized
at time of investment) and 35% were less than five years old at time of investment. There
was also no difference in performance reported between investment in startups and those in
young firms. These findings are evidence of the self selection bias discussed above.
To try to control for this bias we determined the proportion of those angels who had
found other forms of investment most profitable yet would invest in angel type projects
again. This proportion was (86%). We also determined the proportion of angels whose
investment had failed yet would still invest in informal risk capital ventures again (68%).
We concluded that despite the self selection bias, once an angel has made informal investments there appears to be a very high commitment to continuing to do so.

Investment Size
In this study, the median funding requirement for ventures was $500,000, similar to the
interest thresholds of venture capital firms and equity oriented Small Business Investment

Company (SBIC) programs sponsored by the federal government. The investments ranged
from under $1 ,OOOto $2.5 million with a median requirement of $50,000 to $100,000 (Table
4). The majority of angels individually financed less than 10% of the total financial requirements for the venture.
In comparison with Wetzel’s study of New England investors over a four year period
(1976-1980), our group of investors invested twice as much money over a three year period
(Wetzel 1983). In New England, 133 angels invested over $16 million in 320 ventures. Our
sample invested in a total of 308 ventures, in three years, averaging more than 2.5 ventures
per investor. While 308 ventures were reported, the dollar figures were available for only
286 of them. The 116 respondents who reported dollar figures invested in ventures that
raised a total of $38 million dollars in these 286 ventures ($32 million if real estate ventures
were excluded). The average investments were high; $130,000 compared to $50,000 in New
England, and the median investments were higher; $50,000 compared to $2O,OOOin New
England. Our sample also had a much larger number of investments over $50,000, 43%
compared with 24% (Table 4).
There are two possible explanations for this finding. First our sample, predominantIy
from the New York Metropolitan area, may represent wealthier individu~s who are able to
commit more resources to informal investment ventures. Or, it is possible that informal
investment opportunities have increased in popularity since 1980, and our results portray
the expansion of this form of financial investment.

The distribution of investments by industry is found in Table 5. As in the other studies,
informal investors prefer to invest in manufacturing
businesses (41%), with the greatest
interest in high technology products (28%). An interesting finding from this study was that
there is some question as to whether the pervasive love affairs with high technology products
are justified; our sample reported no better performance with high technology ventures than
other ventures.

Investment Criteria
The questionnaire
asked respondents to rank criteria in terms of their importance for the
selection of investments.

flaws in the venture would render the proposal unfundable. The idea was to check for
consistency between those criteria ranked very high and those flaws which would disqualify
the venture. Table 6 reports, in descending order, the percentage of respondents who ranked
each criterion in the top two; while, Table 7 lists in descending order the percentage of
respondents who would disqualify a proposal with the relevant flaw.
Very few of the criteria were ranked in the top two by the majority of angels. In fact
only two were in this category: management clearly demonstrates ability to manage the
venture, and there is a demonstrated market need for the product or service. The consistency
between the two tables is encouraging.
It is clear that unlike the venture capitalists, these
angels have little interest in the proprietary nature of the product or service, or knowing the
industry in which the venture will compete. Unlike the venture capitalist they are not
interested in a thorough business plan. Where they display high consistency between the
two tables and with the venture capital community is a concern with the management
competence of the entrepreneur and a concern that there is a demonstrated need for the
product/service, preferably in a potentially large market. A key disqualifier is an entrepreneur
who overrates the venture.

In the New England and California studies, geographic proximity was a key factor,
75% of the firms were located within 300 miles of the investor, and 58% were within 50
miles. However, in this study, geographic location was considered to be one of the least
important criteria when compared to other aspects of the venture or the management team.
Perhaps the geographic proximity factor found in other studies is more a reflection of sheer
physical accessibility between entrepreneur and investor rather than a formal selection criterion .

Referral Networks
To test Propositions 2-8, we asked the respondents to focus on a particular venture, and to
answer questions specific to that investment. The distribution for these ventures by industry
was similar to the total investment portfolio. Manufacturing
ventures ranked the highest
(42%), with the greatest interest in high technology products (26%), and less interest in
Industrial (8.3%) and consumer (7.3%) products. There were 18 (19%) real estate ventures
and 16 (16.7%) service ventures.
Respondents who reported real estate investments were excluded from the remaining
analyses because the characteristics and return structure of real estate investments differ so
much from investments in service or manufactu~ng firms. This reduced the sample for the
remainder of the analysis to 105 cases.
In the discussion which follows we systematically cover our results relating to Propositions 2-8 above.
Respondents were asked to describe their relationship with up to three people who
were contacted about the investment opportunity, including relatives, friends, business colleagues, professionals an financial professionals. In order to increase the conservativeness
of the test of our proposition, if the contact was listed as both a friend and an attorney, the
relationship was categorized as an attorney relationship.

Proposition 2: A significant proportion of investments in which business angels have invested
would have been referred to others.
Z?e&t: There were 129 referrals, an average of 1.2 referrals for each investment. 52%
referred the venture to at least one referee. Thus, a significant proportion of angels refer
their investments to a referral network.

Results: Almost 75% of these referees also invested in the venture, supporting indications

associates will dominate the business angels

Result: The referral network in this study was dominated by business associates, friends,
and a few investment bankers. Professional and financial sources (accountants; attorneys;
business brokers; and commercial bankers) were more rarely contacted. The preferred referral
investors were friends (21%), business associates (23%), investor colleagues (12%), and
venture capitalists (14%) (Table 8). Relatives and professional relationships accounted for
relatively few of the referrals.
From Table 8 it is clear that there are limited sample sizes in some categories, so to
test Propositions 5-8, we combined the referees into two groups: a group of close personal
colleagues (relatives; friends; business associates; clients; and investor colleagues) and a
group of professional relationships (accounts; lawyers; commercial and investment bankers;
and venture capitalists).
Proposition 5: The closer the referee to the referrer, the more likely that they would invest.
Resulr: Personal colleagues invested in 85% of the investments referred to them, while
professional contacts only invested in 60%. This difference was statistically significant (Chisquare, p < .005).
Proposition 6a: The closer the referee to the referrer, the less likely that the investment
will be successful. Result: When the two groups representing different types of relationships
were compared with the outcome of the venture (classified as successful or unsuccessful);
the results were also statistically significant (Chi-square p c.05). Professionals select successful ventures better than personal colleagues.

Proposition 7: The truster and checker categories would tend to dominate the referral network
of business

angels.

Result: Table 9 depicts the distribution of the trust categories in the sample, from which it
is clear that the network is not dominated by the more trusting styles of referees. About half
the referees had a trusting style of investment decision making and half were much more
formal in their evaluation. There were very few brokers and gatekeepers in the referral
networks.
In order to achieve large enough cell sizes we combined the trusters and checkers into
a trusting evaluation style category and the evaluators and advisors into a formal evaluation
style category (and we left out the brokers and gatekeepers because of small numbers in
this category).

Proposition 8: The closer the referee to the referrer, the more trusting the decision behavior
of the referee.
Results: When personal colleagues and professionals were cross-tabulated against trusting
versus formal evaluation styles the result was significant (Chi-square, p < 0.001)

will be successful.

Factors Related to Investment Performance
The final part of the study focussed on what is probably the most important issue; predictability of investment outcome. Respondents were asked to assess a recent investment in
terms of several product, market, venture team and Angel characteristics, listed in Table 10
(rated on a scale of one to five, Extremely Poor to Outstanding). These criteria had been
identified in an earlier study of venture capital investment decisionmaking
(MacMillan et
al. 1985). In addition, they rated the outcome according to several performance measures;

profits, ROI, market share and sales revenues (also rated on a scale of one to five, Extremely
Poor Performance to Much Better than Targeted Projections). These had also been used in
a previous study of venture capital investments (MacMillan et al. 1987). Multiple performance measures were used to identify those investment-related
variables that appeared to
discriminate success and failure on several, rather than only one performance criterion.
Further, we are able to avoid potential disagreements regarding the appropriateness of any
single performance measure to judge the success of an investment decision.
The results of the ratings were subjected to discriminant analyses. Since discriminant
analysis is used here to classify the investments into one of two outcome groups, the
performance measures for all of the ventures were classified as either a success or failure.
Those that met or exceeded expectations, were considered to be successful ventures; while,
those that were rated as having not met expectations were categorized as unsuccessful. The
SAS stepwise discriminant
analysis procedure was then performed for each performance
measure (profits, ROI, market share and sales revenues) to determine which of the evaluation
criteria discriminate between successful and unsuccessful ventures. Stepwise analysis was
selected because there were high correlations among the independent variables. Those evaluation criteria which were retained by the stepwise analysis model (p = . 15) were then
used to classify the entire sample of original ventures into successes and failures. A hit rate
table was generated for each performance variable, showing the extent to which the discriminant functions correctly predicted outcomes.
Before discussing the results it is important to point out several problems with the
procedure. First, respondents provided an a posteriori evaluation of prediction variables
rather than an a priori evaluation. Second, there was once again evidence of a selection
bias; for each performance criteria about half the respondents reported having achieved
expectations or better, indicating a tendency to disproportionately
select successful ventures.
Finally, both the stepwise discriminant analysis and the subsequent classification procedure
were conducted on the full sample instead of employing a hold out sample due to the small
sample size. Given these problems, our results need to be viewed with circumspection.
The results of the stepwise discriminant analysis and subsequent classification pro-

cedure are displayed in Table 11, reporting the variables selected by the stepwise procedure
for each of the performance measures. For each variable we report the difference between
the disc~minant function coefficients for successes and the function coefficients for failures
which resulted from the classification analysis we conducted using the variables retained by
the stepwise discriminant analyses. Table 12 reports the hit rates which resulted from the
classification procedure.
Turning first to the hit rates in Table 12, the variables selected in each stepwise
discriminate analysis were able to achieve hit rates of 75% or better in predicting success.
Prediction of success is clearly more important than prediction of failure in this case, since
the individual Angels each have limited capital in relation to the number of deals in which
they could participate. Of particular interest is the ability of the discriminant function to
predict profitability; the hit rate was 83% for profit successes and 78% for ROI successes.
Admittedly, the fact the the same sample was used to calculate both disc~rn~~t
functions
and hit rates enhances the probability of correct classification, so we are not suggesting that
use of these criteria will lead to high success rates, rather we take the high hit rate to indicate
that considerable attention to the few criteria which do predict success is warranted.
Turning now to the more detailed results in Table 11, the general pattern is encouraging.
Even though several criteria have modest p values at best (p<O. 15), there is a clear tendency
for these modest variables to appear more than once, and to appear consistently together,

either in the measures of profitability (profits, ROI) or the measures of volume (sales, market
share).
Three variables were selected by the stepwise procedure as predictors for at least three
performance criteria, and are therefore particularly deserving of attention. The two with
positive effects on outcomes are (1) the ability of the venture team to calculate and react to
risk well; and (2) the propensity of the venture team to attend to detail. These characteristics
did not appear as major predictions of performance in the study of venture capitalists decisions
(MacMillan et al. 1987). However, this is not surprising if one accepts Driscoll’s (1974)
argument that the major role of the venture capitalist is to manage the risk of the venture.
In other words, in the formal venture capital market the venture capitalists play an active
role in managing down the risk and assessing due diligence on the part of the venture team,
whereas the informal angel does not, and probably cannot, do this and therefore has to rely
on the venture team’s ability to manage risk and pay due diligence via attention to detail.
This argument is to some extent corroborated by the negative effect between performance and the entrepreneur’s articulateness at discussing the venture. The message is clear;
beware of those appealing arguments by entrepreneurs whose pitch distracts one’s attention
from the entrepreneurs’ poor perceptions of the riskiness of the venture and/or their lack of
attention to important details. In the case of market share, the issue of articulateness is not
significant; however, personal compatibility is negatively correlated; once again suggesting
that the angels’ business judgement can be clouded by the personal appeals of the entrepreneur .
The problem is that personal compatability and articulateness are not indicative of

performance potential. On the other hand reputation is indicative of performance potential;
and thus is a significant predictor of both profits and ROJ in Table 11.
Another variable occurs as a negative predictor for both sales and market share;
proprietory protection of the product. To us this is indicative of another important message;
angels should not back ventures purely on the basis of a product or patent. Many an informal
investor has been disappointed in their investment because they have allowed themselves to
be mesmerized by patents and other proprietary product features which ignore the market.
It is market demand which generates sales, as was found in the case of venture capital
investments (MacMillan et al. 1987). This is supported by the results in Table 11 for Sales
and Market share, which indicate that it is important to have distribution channel and/or
market acceptance to generate revenues.
As in the case of venture capitalist investments, exposure to competitive vulnerability
has a negative effect on profits.
The final result is that the angels with industry famili~ty
do better than angels who
know little about the industry into which the venture is entering. This is a particularly
important issue, since Table 6 indicates that only 7.2% of the angels regarded this as a top
priority criterion.

CONCLUSIONS
The above results suggest a number of guidelines for the informal investor.
First there is value in making systematic use of the referral network. The current
strategy for informal investors is to approach mainly close contacts; friends, relatives; colleagues; and business associates. These are inclined to be supportive (85% also invested in
the venture) and to follow a trusting investment behavior pattern, relying mainly on the
recommendation
of the angel. This strategem ensures that the total capital requirement
are
met via the network. However, given the results of this study; the angels might be welladvised not to stop here, they might also invite at least one professional to invest as well.
Only a small proportion of professionals were approached by our sample of angels (less
than 30%). As the study shows, these professionals’ are more effective at identifying successful ventures. Thus a mixed strategy may be called for: approaching several trusting
referees to ensure full capitalization, but also approaching a limited number of professional
referees to screen the proposals. This will help ensure that those proposals that do get support
from the more trusting members of the network have been competently screened, thus
increasing the probability of venture success.
The discriminant analysis revealed some useful pointers in helping the informal investor
select ventures. First it is critical to select only ventures in which the entrepeneur can be
relied on to evaluate the risks of the ventures and manage these risks well. Angels do not
need entrepreneurs that will gamble with their money! Equally important is to avoid placing
too much credence on highly articulate sales pitches by the venture team, or too much
reliance on ventures in which the main emphasis is on product and proprietary protection.
Rather insist on being shown clear evidence that the product or service has channel and/or
market acceptance. It is also implant
for Angels to stick to investments where they know
the industry well, and to back venture teams with a solid reputation and a propensity to get
involved in details rather than gloss them over. As in the case of studies of venture capital
investments, competitive insulation in the early stages of the venture is also important.
The area cries out for additional research to contribute to our understanding of business
angels; their decision-making
modes; the characteristics they seek in their ventures; the

financial agreements they make; their portfolio performance;
of this critically important investment community.
