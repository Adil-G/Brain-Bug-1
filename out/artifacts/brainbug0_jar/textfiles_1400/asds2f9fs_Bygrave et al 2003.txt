29 nations composing the Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor

(Final version accepted 6 January 2003)
This study examined informal investment in the 29 nations that participated in the Global
Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) study in 2001. Investment was tabulated by gender, age
of investor and amount invested for the 29 nations combined. Prevalence of opportunitypull entrepreneurship was correlated with informal investment, entrepreneurial capacity,
and perception of start-up opportunities in a subset of 18 GEM nations. In contrast,
necessity-push entrepreneurship had no signiﬁcant correlation with those same variables.

Keywords: entrepreneurship; ﬁnance; business start-ups; business angels; love money

Introduction
The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) is a research initiative
conducted by a consortium of more than 100 scholars from 38 nations. It is
led by Babson College and the London Business School, with the
Kauffman Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership as the charter sponsor.
GEM’s principal purpose is to examine the complex relationship between
entrepreneurship and economic growth in many nations with a longitudinal
study, which annually collects and analyses data. Argentina, Australia,
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland France, Germany, Hungary,
India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand,
Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea,
Spain, Sweden, the UK and the USA participated in the third annual

study, completed in 2001. The combined GDP of those 29 nations was 85%
of the GDP of all the nations in the world.
The essence of the GEM model is that a nation’s entrepreneurial
framework conditions (education, ﬁnance, R&D, infrastructure, government policies, etc.) create opportunities that are pursued by would-be
entrepreneurs with both the motivation and the potential to develop them.
Subsequently, the ventures that they start contribute to economic growth.
In the paper presented at the Babson Kauffman Entrepreneurship
Research Conference in 2001, we analysed relationships among framework
conditions, opportunity, entrepreneurial motivation and potential, formal
venture capital investment and high-growth start-ups (Bygrave et al. 2001).
In this paper, we examine informal investment and show that it correlates
with the prevalence of opportunity-pull entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial
capacity and opportunity perception.
We believe that the main contribution of our research is fourfold. It is an
extensive international comparison of informal investing in a relatively
large number of countries. It is the ﬁrst conceptual model supported by
empirical evidence that links the prevalence of opportunity-pull entrepreneurship with informal investment, entrepreneurial capacity and perception of opportunities for starting businesses. It found no signiﬁcant links
between necessity-push entrepreneurship and those same variables, and, in
so doing, it demonstrated the importance of differentiating opportunitypulled from necessity-pushed entrepreneurs.
Informal investors
The systematic study of informal investments in early-stage companies can
be traced to the work of William Wetzel at the beginning of the 1980s. At
the very ﬁrst annual Babson Entrepreneurship Research Conference,
Wetzel presented what was to become a series of BERC papers by himself
and his co-authors at the University of New Hampshire. That initial paper
was on informal risk capital in New England (Wetzel 1981). A year or so
later, Wetzel’s study was replicated in California by Tynes and Krasner
(1983). Towards the end of the 1980s, Colin Mason and Richard Harrison
began to study informal investments in the UK. Rather as Wetzel and his
associates pioneered informal investor research in the USA, so too
Harrison and Mason lead the way in the UK. They ﬁrst presented a paper
dealing with informal investments at the BERC in 1988 (Harrison and
Mason 1988). Again, just like Wetzel and his associates, Harrison and
Mason, subsequent to their initial paper in 1981, presented a succession of
papers at the annual Babson Entrepreneurship Research Conference.
zBased on the ground-breaking studies of Wetzel and his associates in
the USA and Harrison and Mason in the UK, van Osnabrugge (1999)
wrote:
the BA [business angel] market in UK and the USA is the largest single source of risk ﬁnancing for
entrepreneurial ﬁrms, exceeding the institutional VC industry (Mason and Harrison 1996). In fact,
estimates in the UK and the USA suggest that BAs fund an annual amount of two to ﬁve times
more money to entrepreneurial ﬁrms than the VC industry (Wetzel 1987, Freear et al., 1997, Mason

<-----Page 2----->INFORMAL INVESTING

103

and Harrison 1993) it is ‘guesstimated’ that BAs fund between 30 – 40 times the number of
entrepreneurial ﬁrms ﬁnanced by the formal VC industry (Wetzel and Freear 1994).

Most of the research on informal investments has focused on business
angels who invest comparatively large sums of money in entrepreneurial
ventures with the potential to become substantial companies. It is probable
that studies of investments by business angels miss not only—as expected—
micro-companies that are destined to stay tiny, but also many—perhaps
most—companies that grow to become superstars. For instance, according
to an analysis of the Inc500 ‘America’s fastest growing private companies’
in 2000, 16% started with less than $1000, 42% with $10 000 or less, and
58% with $20 000 or less (Inc. 2000). We believe it is very unlikely that
companies starting with $20 000 or less received seed money from business
angels. Granted, when both seed and post-start-up rounds of investment
are combined, 12% of the 500 companies received ﬁnancing from business
angels. However, looking at it another way, 88% of ‘America’s [500] fastest
growing private companies’ never received ﬁnancing from business angels.
In contrast, 33% of the same 500 companies raised start-up capital ‘by
tapping assets of family and friends’.
In comparison with previous studies of informal investors that
concentrated mainly on business angels, the research described in this
paper encompasses all men and women who had personally invested in a
business start-up that was not their own, excluding stocks and mutual
funds. Thus, informal investments in our study range from tiny amounts
put into micro-ventures to huge sums invested in high-potential ventures.
Hence, we believe that our study gives a more comprehensive picture of
informal investors and their effect on entrepreneurship because it
comprises all sizes of informal investments in all types of companies, of
which business angel investments are just one—albeit very important—
subset.
GEM conceptual model1
The central argument of the GEM model is that national economic growth
is a function of two parallel sets of interrelated activities: those associated
with established ﬁrms and those related directly to the entrepreneurial
process. A simpliﬁed version of the model is shown in ﬁgure 1. Activity
among established ﬁrms only explains part of the story behind variations in
economic growth. The entrepreneurial process may also account for a
signiﬁcant proportion of the differences in economic prosperity among
countries. For example, it is estimated that nearly a third of all real GDP
growth in the USA between 1995 and 2000 was driven by the technology
sector—which is laden with entrepreneurial companies—even though that
sector accounted for only 8% of the US economy (Eisenach 2001). As
another example, a recent study by the DRI-WEFA (formerly Wharton
Econometric Forecasting Associates), which was supported by the National
Venture Capital Association, found that venture capital invested from 1970
to 2000 created 7.6 million US jobs and more than $1.3 trillion in revenue

as of the end of 2000. Put another way, venture-capital-backed companies
represented 5.9% of the total jobs in the USA and 13.1% of the GDP
(NVCA 2001).
When considering the nature of the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth, it is helpful to distinguish between entrepreneurial opportunities and entrepreneurial capacity. What drives
entrepreneurial activity is the perception of entrepreneurial opportunities
combined with the skills and motivation to exploit them. When
opportunities are met with skills and motivation to pursue them, the
outcome is the creation of new ﬁrms and, inevitably, the destruction of
existing ﬁrms; new ﬁrms frequently displace inefﬁcient or outmoded
existing ﬁrms. This process of Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’ is
captured in the model by business churning. Despite its negative
connotation, creative destruction actually has a positive impact on
economic growth as declining businesses are phased out as new start-ups
competitively manoeuvre their way into the market. These dynamic
transactions occur within a particular context, which is referred to in the
GEM Model as Entrepreneurial Framework Conditions. These conditions
include variables such as availability of ﬁnance, government policies and
programs designed to support start-ups, R&D transfer, commercial
infrastructure, social and cultural norms, internal market openness,
education in general, and speciﬁc education and training in entrepreneurship. Economic growth encompasses both sets of processes, although the
mix or relative contributions may vary among countries. A fundamental
aim of GEM is to understand how the entrepreneurial process operates and
how its contribution to economic growth varies across countries.

Financial support

Entrepreneurs are the engines that drive new companies, and ﬁnancing is
the fuel that propels them. Hence, ﬁnancial support, especially equity
ﬁnance for starting a company, is an important entrepreneurial framework
condition. The source of ﬁnancing depends on where a start-up sits on the
entrepreneurship spectrum. At one end of that spectrum is a lone, selfemployed person in an impoverished region for whom eking out a
subsistence living from a micro-business is better than no work at all. At
the other end is a team of high-tech superstars in a technology metropolis
with a high-potential opportunity that they believe will change the way in
which we work, live, and play. In the middle are start-up ventures founded
on opportunities that are more limited than high potential ones but have
the prospect of developing into viable companies that will eventually
provide a comfortable living for the entrepreneur and, in some cases, fulltime employees.
At the bottom end of the spectrum, micro-entrepreneurs pushed into
self-employment to survive have no choice other than self-ﬁnancing. In the
middle, entrepreneurs pulled into a start-up by an opportunity with
ordinary potential usually get ﬁnancing from informal investors, the socalled 4Fs: founders, family, friends and foolhardy investors. At the top
end, superstars with extraordinary opportunities launch their businesses
with ﬁnancing from professional venture capital, strategic partners, and
business angels, as well as the 4Fs.
The GEM study includes key elements across the spectrum of start-up
ﬁnancing. We estimate the extent of informal investments from the
household surveys. We gather data from industry sources on investments
by professional venture capital ﬁrms.
In a previous paper, Bygrave et al. (2001) developed a partial model for
the role of formal venture capital in the GEM Model for economic growth.
In the present paper, we develop a partial model to examine the role of
informal investment in the prevalence of opportunity-pull entrepreneurship. The partial model is shown in ﬁgure 2. In the model, entrepreneurs
are motivated by what they perceive to be opportunities to start a new
business, and believe that they have the necessary knowledge, skills, and
experience to develop those businesses. The principal source of external
ﬁnancial support to launch many of those new businesses is informal
investors (more on this later in the paper). The prevalence of opportunitypulled entrepreneurs is measured with the Total TEA (Opportunity) index,
described in the following section.
Prevalence of entrepreneurship

The Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) index is based on the
prevalence of nascent ﬁrms that are in the process of being set up,
but have not yet opened for business, and the prevalence of new ﬁrms
that are less than 42 months old. Entrepreneurs who are engaged in both
activities are counted only once. We differentiate entrepreneurs, and

<-----Page 5----->106

hence the TEA index, according to whether they are motivated to start a
new business to take advantage of an opportunity, or driven to start a
business out of necessity because of lack of suitable employment. Put
another way, the TEA (Opportunity) index measures the prevalence of
opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs, the TEA (Necessity) index measures
necessity-pushed entrepreneurs, and TEA (Overall) measures both types
combined.
The partial model for the prevalence of opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs is based on the proposition that the TEA (Opportunity) index is
related to perception of good opportunities, the prevalence of entrepreneurs
with the knowledge, skills and experience to develop those opportunities,
and the availability of informal investment.
TEA (Opportunity) = f(opportunity perception; knowledge, skills and
experience; informal investment)
On the other hand, necessity-pushed entrepreneurs—in contrast to
opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs—are not starting businesses because
they perceive good opportunities and believe that they have the necessary
skills and experience to develop those opportunities. Instead they are
starting businesses almost as a career of last resort because they have no
better choice for work. Hence, we would expect that TEA (Necessity)
would not be correlated with opportunity perception, entrepreneurial skills
and experience, and informal investment. Thus we expect that the above
model for opportunity-pulled entrepreneurship will not hold for necessitypushed entrepreneurship.

Economic growth

Where does economic growth ﬁt into the partial model? As stated earlier,
one of the principal objectives of the GEM research is to examine the link
between entrepreneurship and economic growth. It seems reasonable to
expect that opportunity-pull entrepreneurship and economic growth
form a virtuous circle. Opportunity-pull entrepreneurship contributes to
economic growth, which in turn creates opportunities for more entrepreneurship. On the other hand, it is possible that necessity-push
entrepreneurship—at least in developed nations—increases when the
economy is in a prolonged slump and unemployment is persistently high
so that starting a business is better than no job at all. Thus entrepreneurship and economic growth are intertwined, and to tease out cause from
effect requires a longitudinal study over many years. In 2001, we have three
years of annual data for 10 nations, two years of data for 21, and one year of
data for 29, hence it is premature to attempt to look for causal effects with a
longitudinal study. Nevertheless, because we think that economic growth
and entrepreneurship inﬂuence each other, economic growth is included in
the regression models that we present later in this paper. At this stage of the
GEM project we believe it is prudent to regard economic growth as a
control variable instead of an explanatory one.
Method
The empirical research had three major parts: (1) surveys of 2000 or more
adults in each of the GEM 2001 countries to gauge respondents’
involvement in and attitude toward entrepreneurship; (2) a wide selection
of standardized national data assembled from a variety of sources; (3) onehour, face-to-face interviews with approximately 35 experts on the
entrepreneurial framework conditions in each country. Experts completed
a brief questionnaire that involved standardized assessments, of important
aspects of their country’s entrepreneurial sector. In summary, more than
74 000 individuals were surveyed in 29 nations and nearly 950 experts were
interviewed in those same nations.
Professional survey research ﬁrms in each country administered the
adult population surveys. Sampling procedures varied somewhat, but all
the research ﬁrms provided samples that when properly weighted were
representative of the adult population, both urban and rural, in each
country. Telephone interviews were utilized in the more developed
countries where most households have telephones. Face-to-face interviews
were employed in developing countries to minimize bias toward higher
income households.
The actual GEM interview was conducted in the native language of each
country and the average time was two minutes, with a range of 60 seconds
to 15 minutes, depending on the extent of a respondent’s involvement in
entrepreneurship. The ﬁrst four items of the interview (ﬁgure 3) are related
to participation in entrepreneurial activities: starting a new ﬁrm, owning
and managing a new ﬁrm, and informally investing in someone else’s new

ﬁrm. Respondents engaged in any of those activities were asked for
additional details about that activity. The last six items assess attitudes
toward and knowledge of the entrepreneurial climate. The complete survey
instrument is published in Reynolds et al. (2001).2
Standardized cross-national data on a variety of national characteristics
and attributes (e.g. GDP growth) were assembled from an assortment of
harmonized international sources, including the United Nations, Eurostat,
ILO, national venture capital associations, US Census International Data
Base, World Bank and International Monetary Fund, among others.
Variables

The dependent variables are the TEA (Opportunity) and TEA (Necessity)
indices for each nation. Nascent and start-up entrepreneurs were classiﬁed
according to how they answered the question: ‘are you involved in this ﬁrm
to take advantage of a business opportunity or because you have no better
choices for work?’ Perception of entrepreneurial opportunity was determined by how respondents answered the following: ‘in the next six months,
there will be good opportunities for starting a business in the area where
you live?’ The percentage of nascent and start-up entrepreneurs answering
‘yes’ was computed for each nation. Entrepreneurial capacity was
determined by answers to the following: ‘You have to the knowledge, skill
and experience to start a new business’. The percentage of nascent and
start-up entrepreneurs answering ‘yes’ was computed for each nation.
The amount of informal capital as a percentage of GDP for each nation
was estimated as follows. The prevalence rate of informal investors and the
average annual amount invested per year by an investor was determined
from the adult population survey. This was then extrapolated to a nation’s

<-----Page 8----->INFORMAL INVESTING

entire adult population aged 18 years and older. We had data on informal
investors in every one of the 29 nations in the GEM 2001 study, but except
where we state otherwise we included only the 18 nations where 40 or more
respondents reported the amount that they had invested. To increase the
number of responses, we combined data from the 2000 and 2001 surveys
for nations where we had data for both years. Respondents were asked how
much they had invested in the last three years, so where 2000 and 2001
responses were combined, we were agglomerating data for four years
1997 – 2001 instead of three years 1998 – 2001 for nations where we had
surveys for only 2001.
Real growth of GDP in 2000—the latest year for which data were
available when this paper was being prepared—was taken from the IMF’s
World Economic Outlook Database 2000.
Results and discussion
Two of the most striking ﬁndings of the GEM household surveys are that
informal investing is very extensive and the amount invested per year is
enormous. The overall prevalence rate of informal investors 18 years of age
and older among the 18 GEM nations for which we have data from 40 or
more informal investors is 3.4%, with a range from 6.2% in New Zealand to
1.4% in Brazil. Informal investors provided $196 billion per year to start-up
and growing companies in those 18 GEM countries (table 1). In the context
of national economies, the total informal investment was 1.1% of the GDP
of all the GEM nations combined, with a range from 3.7% for South Korea
to 0.14% for Brazil. Viewed from another perspective, the amount of
informal investment per adult 20 years old and older in the 18 GEM
nations was $314, with a range from $653 in New Zealand to $9 in Brazil.
When informal investment is one or two percent of GDP, it has a
noticeable, swift impact on the economy because money put into start-up
and young ventures is spent almost immediately on wages, materials, plant
and equipment.
Informal investors in the 29 GEM nations were 67.7% male and 32.3%
female. The breakdown of female investors by the amount invested in the
29 nations combined, and the USA, UK and Germany separately is shown
in table 2. Their age distribution was 40.1% between 18 and 34, 43.7%
between 35 and 54, and 16.2% for 55 and older. The distribution of the
amount invested annually per investor by age group is shown in table 3. As
might be expected, the amount invested per year increases with age: 18.2%
of informal investors aged 55 and older invested at least $16 667 per year
compared with only 4.8% of those between 18 and 34; conversely, 30.3%
between 18 and 34 invested no more than $333 compared with only 18.2%
of those 55 years of age and older.
Table 4 shows that 25% of informal investors put less than $341 into
ventures, 50% less than $1548, 75% less than $6192, and 95% less than
$32 520. One percent invested $280 536 or more. The distribution shows
that the GEM adult surveys capture a spectrum of informal investments
from tiny sums invested by family and friends to huge sums invested by

business angels. Through the 75th percentile, there is reasonable
consistency among the USA, the UK and Germany. However, the amount
invested at the 99th percentile is very much less in Germany than in the
USA and the UK. We have no deﬁnite explanation of this, but it might be
caused by the belief—widely held by the media and researchers—that
wealthy Germans are very reluctant to reveal details of their personal
income and net worth.
The relationship of informal investors to the entrepreneur who they
invested in is shown in table 5. A total of 48% invested in a relative’s
business, 28.9% in a friend’s or neighbour’s, 10.6% in a work colleague’s
and 8.4% in a stranger’s.
Correlations and regressions

The correlations between the variables in the models are shown in table 6.
Correlations between the TEA (Opportunity) index and skills and
experience to do a start-up and informal investment per GDP are
signiﬁcant at the 0.1 level or better. In contrast, none of the correlations
with the TEA (Necessity) index are signiﬁcant.
The regressions, table 7, show that for the 18 nations in the data set, the
prevalence of opportunity-pulled entrepreneurs correlates at the 0.002 level
with entrepreneurial capacity (knowledge, skills and experience), at the
0.03 level with entrepreneurial opportunity (good opportunities in the next

signiﬁcant at the 0.075 level. The adjusted R-square is 0.724; and the
signiﬁcance is 0.000. In contrast, the prevalence of necessity-pushed
entrepreneurship does not correlate with any of the variables in the model.
These ﬁndings support the two models proposed earlier in this paper.
The regression analyses clearly demonstrate that it is important to
separate opportunity-pull from necessity-push entrepreneurship. We
expect that this simple dichotomous classiﬁcation of entrepreneurship will
prove to be valuable in developing models for the role of entrepreneurship
in economic growth.
Conclusions and implications
As mentioned previously, when the amount of informal investment for
startup and growing businesses is as much as one or two percent of a
nation’s GDP, it is a signiﬁcant factor in that nation’s economy. For all
countries except Israel, informal investors put up more money than
professional venture capital ﬁrms for start-ups and growing businesses in
2000 (ﬁgure 4). Indeed, for the 15 GEM nations where we have data for
amounts of both informal investment and classic venture capital, the
amount of informal investment was 62% of informal and classic venture
capital combined. So, for every dollar of classic venture capital there was
approximately 1.6 dollars of informal capital. The highest proportion of
informal capital was in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark and South
Korea where at least 90% of informal and classic venture capital
investments combined came from informal investors. The lowest
proportion was in Israel, USA and Canada, where the proportion of
informal was less than 60% of the total. The ratio of informal investment
to formal venture capital was 1.27 in the USA. That ﬁnding appears to
contradict van Osnabrugge’s (1999) claim that business angels fund an
annual amount of two to ﬁve times more money to entrepreneurial ﬁrms
than the VC industry in the USA. He was referring, however, to an
earlier period when the amount of formal venture capital invested each

year was considerably less than in 2000, when venture capital investments
hit a record high.
We believe that the ﬁndings from this study have important implications
for entrepreneurs, policy makers, educators, researchers, and journalists. In
a nutshell, they should pay more attention to the critical role of informal
investors in startup ventures.
Entrepreneurs

Close family members, friends and neighbours are by far the biggest
sources of informal capital for start-ups (table 5). This is in line with the
Inc. 500 ﬁnding that the most common sources of start-up capital after the
founder and cofounder themselves were family and friends (Inc. 2000).
Hence, entrepreneurs should look to family and friends for their initial seed
capital to augment their own investments in their start-ups. Many
entrepreneurs waste a lot of valuable time by prematurely seeking seed
capital from business angels and even from formal venture capitalists—
searches that come up empty-handed almost every time.
Policy makers

A 1.5% rise in informal investment correlates with a 1% raise in the
TEA Opportunity index among the 18 nations in our regression analysis.

WILLIAM D. BYGRAVE ET AL.

Thus, informal investment is a crucial component of the entrepreneurial
process. What is more, based on our results and the Inc. 500 ﬁndings,
small investments primarily by family and friends are crucial in funding
not only micro-companies but also future superstars. In comparison,
formal venture capital and business angel investments are very rare at
the seed stage of a new venture. For example, the GEM report for the
USA (Zacharakis et al. 2002) indicates that literally several million
Americans are nascent entrepreneurs attempting to start new ventures.
In a typical year, however, only a few hundred of them have formal
venture capital and another 10 000 or so have business angel investments
in hand when they launch their businesses. (The number of start-ups
backed by business angels was derived by multiplying the number of
companies launched with formal venture capital by 40, which is van
Osnabrugge’s (1999) ‘guesstimate’ of the ratio of the number of ﬁrms
backed by business angels to the number backed by formal venture
capital.)
Hence, it is guesstimated less than 0.5% of nascent entrepreneurs launch
their new ventures with formal venture capital or business angel
investments. However, in most developed nations, formal venture
capitalists get a disproportionate amount of attention from policy makers,
whereas informal investors—other than business angels—are almost
ignored. Therefore, it seems as if public policy initiatives aimed at various
sources of seed-stage ﬁnancing are inversely related to their importance for
nascent entrepreneurs raising funds to launch their ventures.
Educators

We believe that entrepreneurship educators often put too much emphasis
on venture capital and perhaps business angels as sources of funds for
would-be entrepreneurs and not enough on family and friends. Some
examples where evidence of this can be found are: new venture syllabi at
leading business schools, including some at our own institutions;
entrepreneurship teaching cases; some entrepreneurship text books; and
business plan competitions where participants have little chance of being
prize contenders unless they target venture capitalists and business angels
for their seed-stage funding.
Researchers

In recent years, research on formal venture capital has increased
substantially, likewise research on business angel investing and initial
public offerings, but there is little research on investing by family and
friends. At the 2002 Babson-Kauffman Entrepreneurship Research
Conference, for instance, approximately 15% of the papers presented
focused on formal venture capital investing, 5% on IPOs, and 3% on
business angels, but only 1% dealt substantially with informal investors
other than business angels. Again, similar to public policy, research interest

<-----Page 14----->INFORMAL INVESTING

in various sources of funding is inversely proportional to their importance
to nascent entrepreneurs.
Journalists

It seems to us that the mass media give more prominence to stories on
venture capital and IPOs than other forms of entrepreneurial ﬁnancing. We
believe that those stories, though they might be glamorous, tend to give
neophyte entrepreneurs a misleading impression of the relative importance
of the sources of venture ﬁnancing. We need more articles about raising
money from family and friends, even if such articles seem to be unexciting
compared with stories on venture capital and IPOs.
