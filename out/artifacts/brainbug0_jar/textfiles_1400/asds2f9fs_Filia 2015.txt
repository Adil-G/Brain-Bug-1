Business angel – venture negotiation in the post-investment
relationship: the use of the good cop, bad cop strategy

The paper reports on the utilization of the “good cop, bad cop” negotiation strategy in
ongoing investor– venture relationships. Four cases of business angel – venture
involvement are studied over a period of several years. Earlier research on the good cop,
bad cop strategy has described its efficiency in obtaining maximum distribution in
short-term distributive bargaining. This has been explained as a result of the emotional
contrast effect unlocked by the sequence of interaction with the bad cop followed by
interaction with the good cop. In an ongoing investment relationship, other rules apply.
The present findings suggest that only a business angel who is already trusted can become
a good cop – by virtue of introducing a bad cop. This is explained as a way of conducting
negotiations without destroying the trust that has been built over time in the business
angel – venture relationship. The strategy provides a scapegoat for the negativity
associated with the negotiations. The bad cop assumes the blame, while the good cop is
still trusted and can remain in the relationship, with less risk of being the target of any
retained hostility.

Introduction
One of the essential concerns for an investor is to ascertain that the invested resources
are being put to proper use in the venture in accordance with the terms of the investment
contract (Jensen and Meckling 1976). Traditional solutions have consisted of the use of
incentive schemes or monitoring. However, research suggests that there are drawbacks
to both of these methods (Tosi, Katz, and Gomez-Meija 1997; Deci, Koestner, and Ryan
1999; Falk and Kosfeld 2006). Instead, it has been argued that trust can substitute for
control as a means of organizing interorganizational relationships (Ring and van de Ven
1994; Costa and Bijlsma-Frankema 2007).
However, this coordination needs to accommodate change. Ventures face high
uncertainty and need to make continuous changes along the way, such as changing the
market offering, targeting other markets and segments, adopting alternative growth
strategies, or acquiring finance in other ways than initially planned. Such changes may cause
task conflicts where both investors and ventures feel that the terms of agreement should be
renegotiated to reflect the new situation. Such negotiation can be hard, as both parties can
stand to lose a lot, but still they want to avoid escalation into a relationship conflict (Jehn
1995). Even though it has been suggested that conflict is an unavoidable part of the

investor– venture relationship (Yitshaki 2008), relationship conflicts are entirely negative
for performance (De Dreu and Weingart 2003). Therefore, once negotiations are necessary,
an important question for investors would be how to avoid relationship conflict and preserve
the trust that they have managed to build, by choosing negotiation strategies carefully.
In the negotiation literature, an emotional contrast negotiation strategy called good
cop, bad cop has been described (Rafaeli and Sutton 1991; Hilty and Carnevale 1993;
Brodt and Tuchinsky 2000), although not within ongoing relationships. The purpose of
the present study is to conduct an in-depth analysis of how and when the good cop, bad
cop strategy is used in investor–venture relationships, by studying four cases where
Swedish business angels have negotiated with their ventures.
Business angels and the risks of venture investments
A business angel is defined as
a high net worth individual, acting alone or in a formal or informal syndicate, who invests
his or her own money directly in an unquoted business in which there is no family
connection and who, after making the investment, generally takes an active involvement in
the business, for example, as an advisor or member of the board of directors. (Mason and
Harrison 2008, 309)

Traditional business angels invest alone, but it seems that even such alone angels to a
large extent actually coordinate their investments informally with a few trusted business
angels, not to mention those who choose to participate in larger, formal angel networks
or even angel funds (Shane 2008).
Business angels are limited by the size of their own wealth in their ability to
diversify. Therefore, they focus on avoiding bad investments rather than finding the best
ones, because they will have difficulty exiting the venture if it is performing poorly
(Mason and Harrison 2002). Thus, business angels are committed to their ventures
through non-recoverable investments (Parkhe 1993a).
Through active involvement in their ventures, business angels create value in several
ways (for a review, see Politis 2008). It has been argued that the post-investment
relationship is characterized by a high degree of informality and a strong social element,
and that the involvement of business angels is better understood as a personal
relationship (Paul, Whittam, and Wyper 2007). The business angel acts as a mentor
(Brettel 2003; Amatucci and Sohl 2004; Madill, Haines, and Riding 2005; Macht 2011)
or as a member of the entrepreneurial team (Sörheim 2005). The majority of business
angels were originally entrepreneurs and still perceive themselves as co-entrepreneurs
rather than investors (Politis and Landström 2002), exhibiting a strong entrepreneurial
orientation (Lindsay 2004). Still, at times during the relationship, there will be a goal
divergence between investor and venture (Sapienza and Gupta 1994).
Task conflicts have been defined as conflicts that arise because of different views on
how to define and solve a certain task, while relationship conflicts are personal in nature
(Jehn 1995). While both are detrimental for performance (De Dreu and Weingart 2003),
relationship conflict has an even stronger negative effect, although this has not been
confirmed in investor –venture relationships (Collewaert 2012). It has been suggested
that task conflict may escalate into relationship conflict (Pondy 1967). Thus, when a task
conflict arises in the post-investment relationship, the business angel would want to
negotiate in such a way that relationship conflict is avoided.
The post-investment venture involvement has been studied from three major
theoretical perspectives: (1) agency theory (van Osnabrugge 2000; Arthurs and Busenitz

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:42 03 February 2015

311

2003), (2) stewardship theory (Davis, Schoorman, and Donaldson 1997), and (3)
procedural justice, as evidenced in the timing of communication and feedback (Sapienza
and Korsgaard 1996). Agency theory has focused mainly on how to ensure compliance
through monitoring and control (Ross 1973), whereas stewardship theory maintains that
compliance can be achieved through reliance on trust. There has been considerable
research devoted to the link between trust and governance in relationships; specifically
whether they act as substitutes or complements (see Puranam and Vanneste [2009] for a
review of the literature).
What sets negotiation during the post-investment setting apart is the fact that the
business angel may have become a trusted venture insider and/or mentor, and thus
inhabits a role more in line with stewardship, but suddenly needs to negotiate in the role
of investor. Thus, there is a need to switch between a trusting personal relationship and a
bargaining situation. Such switches have been studied within social exchange theory.
Reciprocal and negotiated exchange
In research on social exchange, a distinction is made between negotiated and reciprocal
exchange, each with its own specific rules and effects on the actors (Molm 2000).
Negotiated exchange is defined as bilateral transactions, exemplified through explicit
bargaining over benefits. These transactions are discrete in time. Its opposite is reciprocal
exchange. It evolves gradually, and discrete transactions are not easily identified. Instead,
each actor performs a beneficial act for the other without knowing if the other will give
something back (Molm 2003, 3). It is the particular form of exchange that decides its
impact. Trust develops as a result of the reciprocal form of social exchange, because the
psychological state of trust can arise only when there is sufficient time to be vulnerable, in
the time between reciprocal acts. Conversely, because of its competitive nature, a
negotiated exchange will be perceived as less fair by each actor than a structurally
equivalent reciprocal exchange with an equivalent outcome (Molm, Peterson, and
Takahashi 2003).
When it comes to trust in the business angel –venture setting, it has been shown that
business angels seldom invest in ventures that they do not already trust to a certain extent
(Mason and Harrison 2002; Sudek 2006). Thus, there is – at least – a certain hygiene level
of trust. Apart from this, initially there would be negotiated exchange, pre-investment, in a
joint decision process where the terms of the contract are being negotiated and settled.
There is negotiation between the investor and venture, and through explicit bargaining over
equity, influence, and funding, an agreement is struck where each actor wins only at the
other’s expense; in a zero-sum game.
This state of negotiation is not permanent. The initial state of primarily negotiated
exchange gives way to reciprocal exchange during the post-investment relationship
where acts are reciprocated over longer time periods, enabling the creation of trust.
During the trusting post-investment relationship, discrete transactions are hard to
identify. However, reciprocal exchange may be changed back into negotiated
exchange, for example, if there is a need for additional financing. Social exchange
theory states that switching to bargaining from a trustful relationship means switching
to negotiated exchange from reciprocal exchange, which implies that there will be a
negative impact on the post-investment relationship in terms of trust and commitment.
Indeed, investors harbor expectations of goal divergence and opportunistic behavior
from entrepreneurs during investment rounds (Christensen, Wuebker, and Wüstenhagen 2009).

Theory, therefore, suggests that once engaged in a reciprocal exchange with the venture,
the business angel would prefer not to re-engage in negotiated exchange, and risk a loss of
trust. However, as will be evident in the following four cases, in certain situations, the goals
diverge between the venture and business angel, leading to a need for negotiations.

The negotiation process
Spector (1977) proposes a three-phase model for negotiation. In the model, two
adversaries bargain. This model is divided into three phases: the background phase, the
process phase, and the outcome phase. In the background phase, personality and
perceptions/expectations are included as psychological factors that affect both the
bargaining phase and outcome phase. Thus, bargaining behavior is a function of both the
background factors and a response to the behavior of the adversary.
On the top half of Figure 1, the investor has been placed. In the bottom half of Figure 1,
the venture is placed. A more precise description of our four cases is that the adversary is the
venture CEO, who is either the venture founder or someone who is recruited at a later time.
Although deceptively simple, this model suggests that the behavior of each business
angel during negotiations is limited by the expectations and perceptions from the venture.
Based on the previous interaction, the business angel will have built a certain role toward the
venture, and the behavior during negotiation needs to stay true to that role. In the current
study, the personalities of the business angels and venture members have not been studied,
and although some empirical material comes from the ventures, the major part comes from
the business angels. Therefore, the personality factors in the model are not used.
Furthermore, the outcome phase is merely touched upon. The outcome is mentioned but not
developed, as the focus of the present paper is on the negotiation process.
The intentions of the business angels are central to an understanding of the
negotiation process from an interactional justice perspective (Bies and Shapiro 1987),
because action is interpreted as much more fair if it is believed that the underlying
intentions are benevolent (cf. Collewaert and Fassin 2013).
The good cop, bad cop negotiating team tactic

emotional contrast effect from their juxtaposition. Relative to each other, positivity is
perceived as even more positive, and negativity is perceived as even more negative (Rafaeli
and Sutton 1991). In the interrogation of suspects, this technique is known as the good cop,
bad cop strategy. One interrogator plays the role of the good cop, supporting and comforting
the suspect, whereas the other interrogator plays the role of the bad cop, conveying negative
and hostile emotions to the suspect. Team negotiations offer the possibility of each
negotiator adopting a highly choreographed role (Brodt and Thompson 2001).
By studying Israeli criminal interrogators and American bill collectors, Rafaeli and
Sutton (1991) identify five different variations of the good cop, bad cop strategies. These
variations are:
(1) Two people play good cop and bad cop in sequence, interacting separately with
the target, after each other.
(2) Two people play good cop and bad cop simultaneously, both interacting with the
target together in the same room.
(3) A single individual plays both roles by switching behavior between roles.
(4) A single individual plays good cop, and makes reference to a hypothetical bad
cop, who is attributed with bad cop behavior.
(5) A single individual plays good cop in contrast to a stereotype expectation of a
bad cop: the good cop acts only as a good cop, but the expectations of the target
is that this individual should exhibit bad cop behavior.
The first variation in the scheme by Rafaeli and Sutton (1991) has been studied in
experiments by Hilty and Carnevale (1993) and Brodt and Tuchinsky (2000). Hilty and
Carnevale (1993) report on an experiment on bilateral negotiation. They find that the
sequence of bad cop followed by the good cop, moving from competition toward cooperation,
was most likely to achieve agreements. The same findings are reported by Brodt and
Tuchinsky (2000). Studying sequences of good cop, bad cop negotiation in an experimental
setting of simulated three-person workgroups, they show that the traditional sequence, where
the bad cop is first introduced, followed by the good cop, is the most effective in obtaining the
desired contrast effect, and this effect is critical to the success of the tactic. Both roles were
necessary (bad-good); two similar cops (good-good or bad-bad) did not achieve the same
effect. They conclude that the good cop, bad cop strategy is very powerful and can be
generalized to other settings than that of interrogation. However, they provide some evidence
that participants are less willing to work with a bad cop again, and pose the question how
people would use the good cop, bad cop strategy in ongoing relationships.
Method
Four cases were selected (Table 1). They were selected for the following reasons. First,
by limiting the cases to four, each case could be described in detail in the empirical
section of the paper. Four cases can be sufficient in exploratory case research with the
aim of creating new theory (Eisenhardt 1989). Second, the data that could be accessed in
these particular four cases were richer and more varied. Cases based on only a single
method of data collection, such as interviews, are exposed to a potential commonmethod bias (Podsakoff et al. 2003). In order to decrease the risk of this bias,
triangulation was performed by supplementing the interviews with other data sources
and methods (cf. Yin 1994), such as repeated informal observations, speaking to the
venture founders, as well as checking the annual reports of the ventures as many years
back as possible. Thus, each of these four cases provided an opportunity for learning in

terms of access and different data sources, key criteria for case selection (Stake 2005).
Third, each of the cases had the potential of extending current theory through slight
variation among them, and one of the cases was chosen as a contrasting case (Miles and
Huberman 1994).
In the generation of new theory through case analysis, an overlap between data
collection and data analysis is fruitful (Eisenhardt 1989). In the present study, data
collection through the interviews took place over a four-year period, involving iteration
between the cases and collection/analysis (cf. Parkhe 1993b). A total of 30 face-to-face,
semi-structured interviews with 21 business angels, were undertaken from 2008 to
2012, on the topic of governance strategies in both times of harmony and conflict. The
good cop, bad cop strategy was unearthed during early interviews in the research
project. Analysis of the data was undertaken in three periods, during which there was
iteration between analysis and collection of new data. The first period was during the
first six months of data collection, when the strategy was first identified and tentatively
likened to the good cop, bad cop strategy from movies. After this, other potential
instances of this particular strategy were identified among the interviews, and three
more cases were selected.
The initial interviews – each of which ranged between 1.5 and 2 hours – were taped
and transcribed verbatim. During the second period, follow-up interviews were
conducted in order to deepen the understanding gained from the initial accounts
(Polkinghorne 2005), theory was searched, and the second wave of data analysis was
ensued. Because there was little evidence of this particular negotiation strategy in the
existing literature on post-investment relationships, follow-up interviews asked
respondents to focus on a particular recent episode of negotiations, in a total of six
follow-up interviews, typically around one hour long. The follow-up interview material
was partly transcribed, and therefore all the parts that were used in the final paper that
had not been transcribed were presented to the business angels for “member checks”
(Shah and Corley 2006) of the details. The iteration between data collection, immersion
in theory, and data analysis, and back again to more data collection, allowed for a partly
emergent design of the study (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Bruce 2007).
There are some limitations to the present study. It is based on a relatively limited
number of cases, and the business angels are Swedish, although active in an international
context. The cases were field studies, limiting the control available to the researcher.
There has been no inclusion of cases for comparison of the actual effect of the strategy.
Instead, the focus has been on describing the phenomenon, and not its impact.
The empirical section begins with a description of the context before negotiations
began: in each case, the business angels and ventures are described, as well as the
relationship between them. After this context setting, in line with the phase model by
Spector (1977) presented earlier, the empirical material is structured into three major
sections: background, process, and outcome.

The context before negotiations
This section of the paper starts with a description of the business angels in terms of their
experience as entrepreneurs, before becoming business angels. It seeks to confirm that
their unique individual entrepreneurial experience of learning through problem solving
has shaped their basic assumptions and the way they perceive ventures (cf. Schein 2006).
All four business angels have prior experience as entrepreneurs. As entrepreneurs,
they were involved in manufacturing, marketing/franchising and consulting, active in
industries including sports, IT, retail products, grocery, life science, and real estate.
In Table 2, rows 1 and 2 summarize the previous entrepreneurial experience of each
business angel and the kind of entrepreneurial exit generated by each business. Rows 3
and 4 provide data on each business angel describing his/her experience as an investor.
They all have prior experience of investing in ventures, and all have made exits from
earlier investments, foremost through trade sales, but in some cases, through an
undesirable management buyout – a last resort for the business angel (for an overview
of venture capital exits, see Cumming and MacIntosh 2003).
The four ventures are described in rows 1 and 2 of Table 3. They all have existed
nearly 10 years. The time since investment is between 3 and 9 years. In row 3, the
industry in which each venture operates is described.
In terms of their current business angel activities, the common background in all four
cases reported in this study is that a period of time has been passed since the business
angel first invested in the venture. During this time, the ventures have performed
according to expectations. In all the four cases, the business angel involved perceived
that there was a previous harmonic time of cooperation in developing the venture, with
the ventures and investors working toward a common goal. However, toward the end of
this time period, the ventures have not met expectations.
The background phase
Thus, the four cases have as a common feature that there has been a time of cooperation
that has come to a close. However, there are differences between the cases in terms of
how each business angel was involved during the times of harmony. In Table 4, the roles
of the business angels are described.
In cases 1, 2, and 3, the business angel is one of the largest shareholders, besides the
venture founder who is the majority owner. In cases 1 and 2, the business angels are also
lead investors, handling contacts with the venture on behalf of the other investors.
As can be seen in row 2, in cases 1, 2, and 4, there are several business angels who have
invested. While the titles board member and chairman of the board, respectively, simply
describes the formal position on the board of directors given to the business angel,
the final row in Table 3 describes the type of social exchange that existed between the
business angel and venture before negotiations commenced. In three of the cases, the

business angels were involved in solving problems, and had gradually earned the trust of
the venture. They are described as co-entrepreneurs or mentors. Co-entrepreneurs are
business angels who describe their working relationship with the venture as very active
and informal, where they have gradually become part of the entrepreneurial team and are
included in a trustful way as one among equals. Mentorship, on the other hand, denotes a
situation where the business angel describes the relationship with the venture as trusting,
but where the business angel holds a more senior position toward the rest of the venture
members. In these three cases, there is an ongoing, reciprocal, trusting exchange,
between the business angel and venture.
In the fourth venture, the business angel has not worked in close cooperation with the
venture, but rather has retained a distant investor role. In this case, where the business
angel had not developed any informal relationship, there is a negotiated exchange
between the business angel and venture taking place during discrete, formal episodes of
contact and transaction, as evidenced in board meetings and similar.
Perceptions and expectations on negotiations
The background phase also encompasses perceptions and expectations, such as how the
actors conceptualize and define the reasons for negotiation. In case 1, the venture had
repeatedly fallen behind in meeting milestones, and funding had run out. Given that the
venture had underperformed over and over again, the investors proposed that new
funding be supplied at a lower valuation if certain future milestones were not reached.
However, sensible this solution seemed, the venture founder-CEO opposed this proposal
vehemently, arguing that the venture’s inability to meet milestones was merely a
temporary setback and did not reflect the value of the venture. It seemed that for the
founder, the question of valuation was not neutral, but equivalent to a price tag on his/
her ability as an entrepreneur.

In case 2, the willingness of the investors to provide new funding no longer existed.
There was strife among the founders, and the venture team was not able to function
properly. Despite promises made over and over again, changes had not been
implemented. The investors felt that there was no potential in the venture and wanted to
recover as much of their money as possible. The venture founder felt that the company
was worth saving and had assembled a team to attempt a management buyout (MBO).
The negotiation in this second case was over the financial terms for this MBO.
In the third case, the venture had suffered from poor performance in cycles recurring
every year. Both sales and development goals had lagged, and there was a need to make
venture members renew their efforts in order to survive in the long run. The problem
arose in part because the venture members needed to manage both sales and production.
Thus, when they focused on sales, performance grew, but in order to deliver on those
deals, they needed to stop focusing on sales and start delivering value to customers. All
in all, however, the venture members had grown accustomed to this cycle, and did not
really feel the need to renew their efforts because current work conditions were
comfortable in the short run, and were sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle.
In the fourth and final case, the venture had also suffered from poor performance
over many years. Sales and developmental goals were repeatedly missed over the years,
and work was inefficient. However, it was deemed that the venture still had
technological promise, and the investors agreed on trying to help make the work carried
out in the venture more efficient through a change of work procedures.
As can be seen, in all four cases the perceived need for negotiation is triggered by a
lack of venture performance. It is interesting to note that all the four ventures have
customers, although this varies from having a few early R&D projects to a customer
base of more than a hundred regular clients. The end result in all four cases is a situation
that leads the business angel in each case to a negotiation of either the terms of
investment or work procedures.
Intentions for choosing a good cop, bad cop strategy
In the interviews, much of the time was devoted in discussing how the business angels
perceived the venture’s situation, along with their intentions for choosing the good cop,
bad cop negotiation strategy. In cases 1, 3, and 4, the intention of the business angels
was to rescue the relationship, while in case 2, the business angel was resigned to
withdrawing from the investment through helping the management in an MBO. Even so,
the need to negotiate the terms of the MBO made the business angel to choose a good
cop, bad cop strategy.
In cases 1 – 3, a bad cop is introduced as part of the negotiation strategy. As noted
earlier, case 4 differs from the other three in that this is the only case where the business
angel has remained distant from the venture, in a negotiated exchange. Thus, the strategy
in case 4 was to try to introduce a good cop, someone whose role would be to develop a
closer relationship to the venture. In all cases, the investors try to balance between the
obvious need to affect the venture forcefully, and the need to not increase the goal
divergence between themselves and the entrepreneur.
As can be seen from the quotations in Table 5, the intentions of the business angel
include sending a message while avoiding direct confrontation. Furthermore, in case 2 it
is stated that the intention is to utilize all relationships that the business angel has access
to and activate them against the venture, in order to achieve the investors’ long-term
goals. In the third case, the intentions are not primarily to achieve the investors’

Emotions and intentions of the business angel in each case.

Case 1

“I have to remain in the relationship and cannot afford to become enemies
with the entrepreneur”
“I want to make the venture team understand that there is a problem, but avoid
direct confrontation”

Case 2

“This investment has reached its maximum potential, and we should leave it”
“We could make use of the relationships we had with venture members other than
the CEO to gather information and create as good an end as the situation
could offer”

Case 3

“The venture team is too lazy. I need to stir things up a little and get them
working again”
“I don’t want them to trust me blindly and ask me about everything. They have
to make their own decisions and take responsibility for them”

Case 4

“I am pushing all I can as an investor but it is not enough. I need to bring
someone else into the relationship who can get closer to the entrepreneur”
“I want the CEO to start delivering. I will give support in the form of one of
the other investors who will work closely and build trust”

long-term goals, but to force the ventures to reconsider their actions and options and to
take full responsibility for both good and bad performance. In the business angel’s
experience, this would invariably lead to a situation where the venture finally accepted
the gravity of the situation, as represented in the objective figures in the performance
sheets, and took responsibility through measures to work harder. In the fourth case, the
business angel badly wanted the venture to start meeting milestones and perform better
and had the intention of wanting to help the CEO in his/her day-to-day work.

The negotiation process and outcomes
In this part, an in-depth description of the negotiation process in all four cases is
provided, with quotations from the business angels, finished with a very short description
of the outcome in each case.
In case 1, the business angel handled all communication. The business angel had
very a good knowledge of what was going on inside the venture thanks to a close
relationship with the CEO, and could report to the other investors when things were
starting to turn bad. This included actually suggesting some of the solutions. When the
other investors ratified these suggestions for solutions, they could be taken back to the
CEO, and presented as coming from the investors. The business angel told the CEO that
the other investors were growing impatient and were threatening to withdraw from the
venture. However, the business angels explained that if they cooperated, with the CEO
agreeing to the terms of the new funding, the venture could still be saved. The choices
for the CEO were to choose between killing his/her entrepreneurial dream by refusing
the investors, or to cooperate with the business angel, who was a trusted member of the
venture team, and accept slightly worse terms for renewed financing. As explained by
the business angel, despite the lack of previous performance, the new terms were
actually not unfavorable for the venture, as long as they met milestones. The CEO
eventually agreed to the new terms of funding, and the business angel – good cop was
able to remain in the entrepreneurial team all through and after the negotiation, untainted
by the pressure applied to the CEO by the other investors.

In case 2, the business angel handled the planning of the MBO in close cooperation
with the venture, over a time period of several months. However, when the time drew
near for the actual transaction, a fellow investor took over and negotiated the specific
final details of the MBO. In the mind of the business angel, they had become too much
like friends over the time period when the plans had been laid out, and the business
angel was unable to switch to toughness during the coming negotiations with any
credibility. By remaining involved in the final negotiation, the outcome would have been
far worse. Bringing another investor in, as a bad cop focusing only on the details without
any emotional ties, led to a better deal not only for the investors, but also for the venture.
The final deal ended up including some initial funding by the investors in order to get the
MBO up and running. The business angel involved in case 2 suggested that the venture
would have been unable to suggest such a solution to anyone other than a bad cop.
In case 3, the business angel made a tradition of inviting the venture accountant to
formal meetings from time to time. The business angel and accountant would show up
together, and then the meeting would begin. Closely following a formal meeting agenda,
the business angel would eventually come to the point where the current financial status
was to be discussed. The accountant would then be invited to speak in order to present
the almost always dismal financial report, and would finish the presentation with some
normative statements as to the extreme gravity of the figures and that the money would
run out in six months if nothing was done immediately. The accountant would then step
aside and not speak again. With the venture team taking the message of the accountant
to heart, in the discussion which followed the business angel could focus entirely on
constructive ways forward to get out of the difficulties that the business was in. This
strategy had the effect that the business angel was never attributed as being the
messenger of the poor performance and could stay part of the entrepreneurial team,
whereas it was the accountant who was completely associated with uncomfortable news
of the bad performance of the business. Each year, at the annual meeting, after the same
performance, the venture would change work procedures and increase performance for a
few months, before falling behind again.
In case 4, the business angel invited a co-investor to begin working on operational
matters with the venture, in the hope that this co-investor would become trusted by the
CEO and would be able to identify and suggest ways of working more efficiently. If the
co-investor was able to gain the confidence of the CEO, such suggestions could
eventually result in changes in work procedures, thereby improving performance. While
the co-investor worked alongside the CEO, in the hope of becoming a good cop, the
business angel continued to act as a distant, formal investor. By the introduction of the
good cop, the business angel hoped that there would be a contrast effect between them,
whereby more pressure could be put on the CEO to change work procedures. If the good
cop was able to become accepted by the venture, as an established insider, that pressure
could be channeled into changing work processes. In spite of considerable hands-on
involvement over nearly a year, the co-investor was never able to become a trusted
member of the entrepreneurial team, and was unable to become a good cop. Without a
good cop, any pressure from the business angel merely served to make the CEO even
more stubborn and defensive. In the end, the venture did not change work procedures.
Analysis
Referring back to the classification suggested by Rafaeli and Sutton (1991), we see that
in cases 2, 3, and 4, the good cop and bad cop are played by different people, in

sequence (variation 1) (Table 6). This is the same variation that was studied by Hilty and
Carnevale (1993) and Brodt and Tuchinsky (2000). In case 1, the bad cop is a
hypothetical bad cop (variation 4 in Rafaeli and Sutton 1991). The message from this
bad cop is thus only communicated by the good cop, but also in a sequence.
The main idea behind the good cop, bad cop strategy in ongoing relationships is
nicely captured by the business angel in case 1.
Sometimes I use the other investors as the bad guys and act more as a messenger than an
owner myself . . . It is a question of avoiding any unnecessary drama. As owners, we must
maintain a unified front, but it is simply easier to discuss a proposal if it comes from the
investor group instead of from me. I need to be able to sit on the company board of directors
in the future also, and cooperate with the venture team.

Three principal points can be made: that there is a need to accommodate both reciprocal
and negotiated exchange, the definition of the strategy process and its sequence in the
present findings, and finally, the way that the strategy enables attribution of negativity
beyond the dyad.
The need to accommodate both reciprocal and negotiated exchange
Empirically, in these four cases we see evidence that business angels feel that they
cannot adopt a position of negotiation vis-à-vis the venture once they have established a
trusted position. In the negotiation model by Spector (1977), expectations and
perceptions influence the way negotiations are carried out. Thus, choosing the good cop,
bad cop negotiation strategy would imply that business angels expect negative reactions
from the venture in case they should choose to bargain in person. In order to
accommodate the need to negotiate, insider business angels introduce bad cops and
become good cops themselves. Social exchange theory explains this in terms of two
incompatible forms of exchange; reciprocal and negotiated, where reciprocal exchange
produced higher levels of trust. The question posed was how these two forms of
exchange were to be accommodated in cases where reciprocal exchange had been
established and a need appeared to negotiate. The answer from these four cases is that
the two forms of exchange are indeed perceived as incompatible, and as a consequence
they are separated in different roles, the good cop and the bad cop. The two forms of
exchange coexist, but the cases suggest that they cannot be accessed by the same
business angel. This suggests that trust in the venture post-investment relationship is
personal, as argued by Ring and van de Ven (1994).

Defining the strategy and the sequence
In earlier studies of good cop, bad cop negotiations, the question of sequence has
proven of central importance. To reiterate, the effect has been strongest when the bad
cop is introduced before the good cop (Hilty and Carnevale 1993; Brodt and Tuchinsky
2000). In ongoing relationships, events and sequences are always tricky to define
(Langley 1999). However, drawing on the four cases, the following sequence of the good
cop, bad cop negotiation strategy in ongoing relationships is proposed. The first step is
when an investor who is an insider brings in a bad cop, and becomes a good cop at the
same time. Thus, the first communication is by the bad cop, either in person or as a
hypothetical bad cop communicating via the good cop. The second step is a
communication with the good cop.
The sequence is defined as bad cop, good cop, which is similar to earlier results.
In the first three cases, there are business angel insiders who become good cops by
introducing bad cops, and negotiation ensues. However, in the fourth case, there is no
reciprocal exchange when negotiations commence. Instead, there is a business angel
outsider, who tries to introduce a good cop, but fails. The fourth case suggests that in
ongoing relationships it takes time to become a good cop of any use during negotiations.
In this case, the relationship stays essentially negotiated. In the other three cases, where
there was a reciprocal exchange between the business angel and venture previous to
negotiations, the business angel became a good cop during negotiations and then
continued to have a reciprocal exchange after negotiations were terminated. The four
cases suggest that although the good cop, bad cop strategy may be powerful in its
emotional contrast effect (cf. Brodt and Tuchinsky 2000), in ongoing relationships, there
must be someone who is a venture insider or who is willing to play the good cop in order
for the strategy to work.
Attribution of negativity to the bad cop
A key to understand the function of the good cop, bad cop strategy in ongoing
relationships seems to lie in the preservation of the reciprocal exchange, by sheltering
the trusted business angel from negotiated exchange, primarily by attributing the
negotiated exchange to someone else. There is a need to negotiate, but for the business
angel who has reached the dimension of reciprocal exchange, access to the form of
exchange necessary for distributive bargaining is possible only indirectly, through
someone else or through attribution to someone or something else.
In all three cases, where the business angel has established a reciprocal exchange,
there is attribution of negativity to the bad cop. In our four cases, examples of the bad
cops include syndication partners, and legal-financial experts, enabling the good cop to
remain trusted. In this sense, the bad cop is used for scapegoating (Bonazzi 1983;
Chelliah and Davis 2010). The bad cop takes the blame, and assumes the negativity
associated with the pressure and toughness of the bad cop negotiation. If the tactics used
during negotiations are perceived as unfair by one side, that party may still harbor
hostility toward the other party, even after the dispute has been settled (cf. Kaufmann
and Stern 1988). In our cases, any such retained hostility is directed toward the
scapegoat bad cop. However, the scapegoat paradox is that even though it may be
obvious to most that there are others to blame besides the scapegoat, the blame assigned
to the scapegoat needs to be logical and credible (Bonazzi 1983). Providing a causal
account is associated with greater feelings of interactional fairness (Bies and Moag
1986), to the extent that it is perceived as adequate (Bies and Shapiro 1987). Thus, in

<-----Page 15----->322

A. Fili

Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:42 03 February 2015

line with interactional justice, causal attribution to a bad cop needs to be relevant and
credible in order to have any effect toward the venture.
In the cases, we see justification by attribution to an actor or a hypothetical actor
whose exchange is negotiated. Here, the present study could also link to procedural
justice in general, by arguing that the reciprocal form corresponds to certain legitimate
procedures and the negotiated form to others. Hence, a word of caution may be in order,
as the limits of this strategy are considered. In some situations, if the role-playing
involved in scapegoating gets too obvious, the reciprocal exchange could be tainted by
the negotiated exchange. In such instances, bringing in a bad cop could corrupt the
existing relationship.
Conclusions
The present paper contributes to the research on post-investment involvement of
business angels by analyzing negotiation strategies through social exchange theory,
presenting new empirical data and contributing to theory. The present study suggests that
the involvement of business angels in their ventures should be conceptualized in terms of
different roles, and that the good cop, bad cop strategy is a way of managing conflict
between these roles.
Specifically, an investor who has established an insider role, such as a coentrepreneur or a mentor, based on reciprocal exchange, will try to avoid reverting to the
negotiated investor role. This suggests that – right or wrong – investors believe that
such a role transition would be problematic, and that even if negotiations were
successful, the trustful relationship would have been changed into a relationship with
less trust. Instead, the negotiation needs to be carried out by someone else, hence the
introduction of the bad cop. An important function of the good cop, bad cop strategy is
to allow for scapegoating, as the bad cop is attributed with the negativity associated with
negotiations. Furthermore, the emotional contrast effect creates a situation where both
the bad cop and good cop can cooperate: the bad cop exerts pressure, and the good cop is
able to channel it into constructive action. Because the bad cop is used as the source of
all negative communication, the good cop can stay out of the negotiation, and focus on
constructive solutions as how the negotiations can be brought to a close.
The contribution to the negotiation literature is in the empirical focus of this study on
ongoing relationships. Criminal interrogation, bill collecting, and experiments share the
feature of dealing with single transactions, rather than relationships. In the present study,
the focus is on the good cop, bad cop strategy as it is enacted in long-term relationships.
To the extent that the parties are to stay in the relationship after the negotiation, this
means that the strategy needs to be played out in a way such that the retained hostility is
minimized in the future relationship. In the earlier studies, the good cops had to rely on
their ability to impress the adversary by dramatic effect during a single transaction,
whereas in the present study, the good cop, and to some extent even the bad cop, are
well known from long time periods of previous interaction in the relationship. To the
extent that good cop and bad cop behavior is congruent with earlier behavior, this might
increase the credibility of the strategy, and conversely, acting completely out of
character would presumably not be very convincing.
Yet, another perspective on the good cop, bad cop strategy may be in terms of how
perceived relative power influences negotiations. It has been shown that smaller power
difference will lead to agreements of greater integrativeness: when parties perceive that
they are of equal power, their negotiations will be more oriented toward cooperative

<-----Page 16----->Downloaded by [Temple University Libraries] at 12:42 03 February 2015

323

solutions (Wolfe and McGinn 2005). It has been argued that an investor holds more
power than the venture (cf. Saam 2007). In the present setting, one could conceive of the
business angel insider as being perceived as someone of more equal power than a
business angel outsider, who would presumably be regarded as a more stereotypical
owner. In order to increase the likelihood of reaching satisfactory agreements in
negotiations, the insider business angel would want to stick to that role as long as
possible. Continuing in this vein, one may speculate whether the introduction of the bad
cop, with a greater power distance, is in fact a way of using the emotional contrast effect
(Rafaeli and Sutton 1991) to create a perception of the good cop as even more equal to
the venture in terms of relative power. Such a perception of similarity may facilitate
negotiations.
One area of future research includes the understanding of why certain negotiations
are managed within the ordinary dyadic relationship, whereas others are instead dealt
with through the good cop, bad cop strategy. Are there certain negotiations that are
within the legitimate bounds of the action accessible to the insider, where there is no
need for a bad cop? Another area is to understand how common the strategy is within
ongoing relationships, starting with business angels and other investors. However, it may
not stop with investor relationships. The fact that the good cop, bad cop negotiation
strategy seems to be such a powerful way of preserving trust in ongoing relationships,
suggests that it could be a useful governance strategy in general, not only during
negotiations and in investment relationships.
