ABSTRACT
This paper describes an investigation during which 225 small and mediumsized enterprises were asked about their experience of cooperation with universities in dealing with technical and scientific problems. About a quarter replied
that they had had such experience in the last ten years. These were asked the
following questions:
- Were they satisfied with the cooperation?
- What were the arguments against cooperation?
- What especially important factors facilitated cooperation?
The results show that companies, in practice, ascribe the highest significance to
factors quite different from those which are emphasized in theoretical literature.

1. TERMINOLOGICAL
1.1. The concept

CONSIDERATIONS

of technology

transfer

The concept of technology transfer has been defined in various ways in the
literature [ 1, p.71. Common to all these definitions is the idea of technology
being transferred from a technology provider to a technology recipient [ 2-41.
Particular points where they differ are the way technology is defined and the
descriptions of technology providers and recipients. In addition, recent publications [ 21 point out that technology transfer is not a one-way process but
one which usually involves a reciprocal exchange between the partners to the
transfer. In the following, technology transfer is taken to mean the process of
transferring a technology, i.e. a technical process or product, within a given
system or between systems, with the aim of reducing the gap between potential

and actual utilization of a technology [ l,p.ll; 23,p.86]. In this study, universities are the technology providers and small and medium-sized enterprises
(SME’s) the technology recipients. The degree of technology transfer may
vary widely, ranging from a pure transfer of knowledge through exchanges of
staff to the transfer of complete plant with support for implementation and
start-up [ 5,p.80 ] .
1.2. Definition

of small and medium-sized

enterprises

There is no standard definition of small and medium-sized enterprises

( SME’s) in the literature [ 6,p.22; 7-91. In general, a distinction can be made
between qualitative and quantitative criteria for assessing size [S; lO,p.115].
A quali~tive criterion is the correspondence between ownership and management of the enterprise. Following Kiihler and Tebbe [ lO,p.115], this criterion is fulfilled if at least 50% of equity is in the hands of the company
management.
Quantitative criteria include:
- total payroll,
- balance sheet total,
- turnover,
- net product,
- number of employees.
The definition of an enterprise as small or medium-sized according to one
of these indicators is rather arbitrary [ 81. In line with the size classification
of the Institut fur Mittelstandsforschung (Small Businesses Research Institute ) , the number of employees is used here as the second indicator, with SME’s
being defined as those with less than 500 employees [ 9; 111. It goes without
saying that this limit should be varied depending on the sector. For example,
enterprises “with 100 or more employees in the retail trade, 200 or more in the
wholesale sector, and as few as 50 or more in the service industries, are classified
as large enterprises, whereas, conversely, all craft businesses are included in the
small and medium-sized sector” [ 81.
The present study is concerned solely with enterprises in the industrial sector. Consequently, SME’s may be taken to be industrial enterprises with less
than 500 employees and at least 50% of equity in the hands of the management
[lO,p.116].
There are numerous references in the literature to the economic importance
of SME’s [ 12; 131. This forms the basis for policy towards SME’s. Readers are
referred to the literature [ 13; 141 for the various arguments involved.

AND

The aim of the present empirical study is to evaluate cooperation between
universities and SME’s from the standpoint of the latter. On this aspect, a

<-----Page 2----->59

large number of arguments are to be found in the literature [ 1, p.53; 2; 15; 161.
Irrespective of the size of enterprise, the following points in particular are mentioned as obstacles to cooperation with academics:
- attitude of many professors,
essential unwillingness to cooperate with industry,
scientists and businessmen having different systems of values,
- inclination towards perfectionism,
- lack of practicality,
- lack of realism and hostility to compromise prompted by the search for scientific truth,
- lack of regard for deadlines and profitability,
- communication difficulties,
- confidentiality problems.
These provide the point of departure for an empirical study.
2.1. Arguments

in the literature

In general, it is assumed in the literature that large enterprises cooperate
more intensively with universities than small or medium-sized enterprises. An
investigation conducted by Strothman et al. [ 17,p.12] showed that cooperation with universities and polytechnics increased with the size of the enterprise. In addition, it is presumed that the problems of technology transfer from
universities to enterprises tend to be greater with small and medium-sized
organizations: “a priori, links with small and medium-sized enterprises would
appear to increase the difficulties already confronting universities in their relations with industry” [ 21. This argument is based on the differences in outlook
and objectives of universities on the one hand and industry on the other. For
SME’s, the following considerations would appear to be of relevance here:
“Firstly, for small and medium-sized enterprises, technology transfer is much
more frequently problem-oriented and based less on conceptional or ‘pure’
research. In addition, the problems addressed tend to be specific rather than
strategic in nature and, in view of the tight time constraints facing small businesses, solutions tend to be required as quickly as possible from consultants” [ 21.
An examination of the universities shows further that technical universities
or polytechnics traditionally possess good contacts with large businesses [ 151:
“Cooperation with large enterprises was simply easier for the technical universities because there they found well-equipped research and development laboratories in which the same language was spoken, where their own graduates were
often working and where initial approaches to solving problems were required
rather than ready-made answers. Such enterprises were also in a position to

systematically track down transferable research results and contact the appropriate bodies” [ 181.
In view of these considerations, it comes as no surprise that in a survey
conducted by Allesch [ 151 a mere 14% of the academics questioned stated that
they maintained contacts with small businesses:
“Practical contacts with businesses in the small and medium-sized sector represent less than 30% of cooperative links. Cooperation with universities is dominated by large enterprises with more than 500 employees” [ 151.
This finding corroborates the relation found by Strothmann et al. [ 171 between
size of enterprise and cooperation with universities. In contrast, a study by
Licentec found that in the Netherlands around 50% of the research contracts
of technical universities originated from small and medium-sized enterprises,
whereby most of these projects involved applied research and development
1161.
In what follows, the aim is to elucidate the causes of the obvious disinclination on the part of small and medium-sized enterprises, since only if these are
known will it be possible to develop and apply suitable instruments to
strengthen cooperation.

The enterprises covered by the study were selected at random from existing
addresses. The breakdown by sector is as shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows a
breakdown of the enterprises by size, based on the number of employees.
Of the enterprises surveyed, 103 (45.8%) stated that they regularly followed
up R & D findings of outside organizations; 124 (55.1%) regularly carried out

2.2.2. Analysis of relations between universities and SME’s
Of the enterprises surveyed, 53 (23.6% ) had worked together with a university on a technological or scientific problem since being founded, or in the last
ten years if they were established before 1976. Karbowski [ 19,p.34] arrives at
a similar result. Of those that had not so far worked with a university over the
period in question, 48 (21.3%) indicated that they intended to establish such
contacts in the near future (within the next two years). This thus confirms
the argument by Lindner and Lockemann [ 181 that there is a lack of contact
with SME’s: “inparticular, ways need to be found to actively stimulate the motivation and interest of small and medium-sized businesses” [ 21.
The enterprises that had previously cooperated with universities were asked
how these contacts had come about (Table 3 ) .
The table shows that graduates that have contacts with university departments from their period of study are highly important in bringing about cooperation between SME’s and universities. In addition, it transpires that around
2/3 of all contacts came about through personal relations, a finding that supports the arguments in the literature [ 181. The cultivation of personal contacts is hence also regarded by Allesch as the crucial starting point for the
university transfer agencies: “It is remarkable that most transfer bodies and
officers prefer, in the initial phase, personal contact with internal and external
partners to other forms - a factor that clearly contributes to the success and
acceptance of university transfer agencies” [ 151. This lends support to the view
that personal interaction between partners and the resulting trust are key factors in cooperation between SME’s and universities [ 21.
An analysis of cooperation as a function of enterprise size is shown in Table

4. The table shows that the use made of universities tends to increase with the
size of enterprise, thus corroborating previous empirical studies.
An aspect that may be considered to be an indirect indicator of the satisfaction of enterprises with cooperation with universities is the number of contacts
(Table5).
It may be assumed, broadly speaking, that enterprises that have had two or
more contacts with universities would have been satisfied with this cooperation. To obtain more information on this point, enterprises that had previously
worked with a university on solving a technological problem were asked to
what extent they were satisfied with this cooperation. Table 6 sets out the
results.
To arrive at a general evaluation of the degree of satisfaction, the following
index [ 2O,p.68] is used:

factor for assessment ‘i’; the values of Cyiare 0, l/3, 2/3 and 1, for i is ‘not
satisfied’, ‘not so satisfied’, ‘satisfied’ and ‘very satisfied’, respectively.
This
index can thus assume values between 0 and 1. The value of 0.63 obtained
shows that SME’s that have worked with universities are satisfied with the
cooperation.
A further aim of the present study was to find out what were the problems
seen by enterprises in cooperating with universities.
Both those enterprises
that had not yet cooperated with a university and those that had experience in
this area were considered (Table 7). A comparison between these two groups
would perhaps reveal differences, i.e. determine whether enterprises without
university contacts exaggerated the importance of certain problems.
To bring out the relative importance of the individual arguments, the following index [ 2O,p.75] is used:

‘j’ is not given by group ‘2, while ‘z’ describes the case where the entire group
gives just this argument and no other. Argument ‘j’ is of below-average importance if hji is less than 1 and, conversely, of above-average importance if the
index is greater than 1 (Table 8). These findings show that communication
difficulties are felt to be the most important problem by both groups. The call
for the encouragement of staff exchanges between the organizations in question to provide a basis for greater mutual understanding is hence quite justified
[ 16,p.31].
It is also interesting to note that only average importance is attached to the
argument ‘lack of financial resources’.

ence in the assessments of the two groups. Those enterprises that have previously worked together with universities attach less importance to this argument
than the other group.
There is a further clear difference between the two groups as regards the
argument ‘inclination towards perfectionism’, to which the enterprises that
have previously worked with universities attach greater importance than those
with no such experience, which assign below-average importance to this reason.
These findings show that it cannot be assumed generally that enterprises
with no previous experience in cooperating with universities overestimate the
problems involved.
Those enterprises that have previously worked with a university were also
asked about the factors they considered to be of particular importance for such
cooperation. Table 9 sets out the results.
The main factors are thus:
- personal interaction and trust,
- problems must be approached in a way specifically geared to the enterprise
concerned,
- cooperation must be flexible.
Personal interaction is thus of particular importance, a finding also supported
by the results in Table 3. This confirms the statement by Metzger [ 211 that
technology transfer via persons is especially important and provides a suitable

way of establishing interaction between the scientific community and research
institutes - a theme also taken up by the programme ‘Research Cooperation
between Industry and Science’ launched in the Federal Republic of Germany
in October 1984, initially for a limited period.
Encouraging such cooperation can increase staff mobility: “in my view, stuff
mobility can best be increased by continuing to promote joint ventures and projects in which various sectors of society, in particular higher education and
industry, work together to achieve common goals” [ 221.

3. CONCLUDING

REMARKS

The above analysis has shown that, on the whole, there is little cooperation
between universities and SME’s. It would thus seem important to generate
awareness on the part of SME’s of the possibilities of cooperation with universities and to motivate SME’s to establish contacts with them [ 21. The personal component appears to be crucial to such cooperation. The programme
‘Research Cooperation between Industry and Science’ takes this personal component as its starting-point for the promotion of technology transfer, the aim
being to encourage staff mobility between the sectors concerned.
However, although technology transfer from universities to enterprises has
an important role to play regarding the economic exploitation of technological
progress, “the universities should never forget ... that their primary task continues to lie in the fieldof scientific education and fundamental research” [ 181.
The universities should not be allowed to degenerate into engineering or business consultancy bureaus, thereby losing sight of their proper tasks.
