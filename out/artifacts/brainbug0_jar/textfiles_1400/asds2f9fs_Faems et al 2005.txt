Interorganizational Collaboration and Innovation:
Toward a Portfolio Approach
Dries Faems, Bart Van Looy, and Koenraad Debackere

In the literature on innovation, interorganizational collaboration has been advanced
as beneﬁcial for the innovative performance of ﬁrms. At the same time, large-scale
empirical evidence for such a relationship is scarce. This article examines whether
evidence can be found for the idea that interorganizational collaboration supports
the effectiveness of innovation strategies. This article empirically addresses this research question by analyzing data on Belgian manufacturing ﬁrms (n 5 221) collected in the Community Innovation Survey, a biannual survey organized by
Eurostat and the European Commission aimed at obtaining insights into the innovation practices and performance of companies within the various European Union
(EU) member states. Tobit analyses reveal a positive relationship between interorganizational collaboration and innovative performance. At the same time, the
impact on innovative performance differs depending on the nature of the partner(s)
involved. These ﬁndings strongly suggest the relevance of adopting a portfolio
approach to interorganizational collaboration within the context of innovation
strategies.

Introduction: Organizing for Innovation

nnovation, and more particularly technological
innovation, has long been acknowledged as one
of the critical driving forces in enhancing social
welfare; likewise, innovation is seen as crucial for the
long-term survival and growth of the ﬁrm (Baumol,
2002; Schumpeter, 1939). However, managing innovation is not a straightforward exercise (Tushman,
Anderson, and O’Reilly, 1997; Van de Ven et al.,
1999). The complexities that arise when designing and

implementing an innovation strategy are directly related to the multitude of objectives such a strategy
implies. Broadly speaking, innovation strategies not
only address the improvement and further development of existing technologies and products but also
the development of new technologies and competencies (Wheelwright and Clark, 1992). Stated in March’s
(1991) terms, ﬁrms need to engage in both exploitation and exploration. Whereas exploitation refers to
activities such as improvement, reﬁnement, efﬁciency,
selection, and implementation, exploration is best
captured by notions like search, variation, experimentation, and discovery (March, 1991, p. 102).
In order to meet the multiple requirements that innovation strategies entail, ﬁrms tend to adopt a portfolio approach toward organizing their new product
development (NPD) activities (Cooper and Edgett,
1999; Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995; Deschamps
and Nayak, 1995; Wheelwright and Clark, 1992). Innovation strategies are translated into a number of
projects addressing both short- and medium-term or

<-----Page 1----->INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION

long-term innovation objectives. At the same time, it is
noticeable that ﬁrms trying to achieve this broad spectrum of innovation activities are faced with multiple,
often opposing, demands that confront them with the
challenge of reconciling conﬂicting requirements (Benner and Tushman, 2003; Leonard-Barton, 1992). The
notions of incremental versus radical innovation (Dosi,
1982; McDermott and O’Connor, 2002); innovation as
continuous improvement through learning by doing
versus innovation as creative destruction (Abernathy,
1978; Anderson and Tushman, 1991; Arrow, 1962;
Bower and Christensen, 1995; Solow, 1997); ﬂexibility
to keep innovation options open versus commitment to
well-deﬁned innovation pathways (Ghemawat, 1991);
divergent versus convergent behavior (Van de Ven et
al., 1999); exploitation versus exploration (March,
1991); or path creation versus path dependence (Garud
and Karnoe, 2001) are at the core of the dualities being
outlined.
Several scholars have advanced the notions of
semi- or quasi-autonomous structures (Brown and
Eisenhardt, 1997; Schoonhoven and Jelinek, 1990)
and ambidextrous organizations (Benner and Tushman, 2003; Duncan, 1976; O’Reilly and Tushman,
2004) to handle the conﬂicting requirements encountered. Within those conﬁgurations, conﬂicting ingredients can coexist by adopting organizational designs
that allow for differentiating explorative activities
from their mainstream exploitation-oriented counterparts (Christensen and Overdorf, 2000). Recently, interorganizational collaborative arrangements also
have been advanced as highly relevant for dealing
with the aforementioned tensions. Brown and Eisenhardt (1997) pointed to the relevance of strategic al-

liances to overcome the tensions related to combining
short-term and long-term oriented developments.
Christensen and Overdorf (2000) advocated the idea
of complementing ‘‘traditional’’ organizational practices oriented toward exploitation with the creation of
new organizational structures, spinouts, and acquisitions in order to achieve the exploration-oriented objectives of an innovation strategy.
This article examines whether interorganizational
collaboration relates to the effectiveness of innovation
strategies. In other words, are ﬁrms that engage in
interorganizational collaborations within the framework of their innovation strategy performing better
in terms of innovative performance? In addition,
this study explores whether this relationship—if
observed—differs according to the nature of the innovation outcomes: is interorganizational collaboration as relevant for improving existing competencies
and products as for creating new ones? In this respect,
it is feasible to examine whether the notion of portfolio (i.e., pursuing a multitude of different projects
simultaneously) bears relevancy to interorganizational collaboration as well. These questions will be addressed empirically by analyzing data on Belgian ﬁrms
collected in the Community Innovation Survey (CIS),
a biannual survey organized by Eurostat and the
European Commission aimed at obtaining insight
into the innovation practices and performance of
companies within the various EU member states.
However, before describing the sample and the methods in greater detail, the article ﬁrst will provide a
discussion of previously reported empirical ﬁndings
on the role and impact of interorganizational collaboration on innovative performance, as this will allow
for the ability to deﬁne the research questions more
precisely.

The Role of Interorganizational Collaboration
When Innovating: Toward Specific
Propositions
Interorganizational collaboration has been recognized
as important in supplementing the internal innovative
activities of organizations (Deeds and Rothaermel,
2003; Dodgson, 1993; Hagedoorn, 2002). From the
present literature, it is clear that organizations can
improve their innovative capabilities by developing
interorganizational collaborations with a variety of
partners. Collaborations with existing suppliers and
customers (Shaw, 1994; Von Hippel, 1988), potential

lead users (Quinn, 1985; Von Hippel, Thomke, and
Sonnack, 1999), universities and research centers
(Gerwin, Kumar, and Pal, 1992; Santoro, 2000), and
even potential or existing industry competitors
(Dodgson, 1993; Hamel, 1991) all have been advanced
as relevant in this respect.
The reasons why interorganizational collaboration
can contribute to the effectiveness and efﬁciency of an
innovation strategy are numerous. First, interorganizational collaboration might imply access to complementary assets needed to turn innovation projects into
a commercial success (Hagedoorn, 1993; Teece, 1986).
Second, working together with other organizations
might encourage the transfer of codiﬁed and tacit
knowledge (Ahuja, 2000; Doz and Hamel, 1997;
Eisenhardt and Schoonhoven, 1996; Lambe and
Spekman, 1997). This might result in the creation
and development of resources that would otherwise be
difﬁcult to mobilize and to develop (Das and Teng,
2000). Finally, interorganizational collaboration
might help to spread the costs of research and development (R&D) among different parties (Hagedoorn,
2002; Veugelers, 1998), resulting, at the same time, in
a considerable reduction of the risks associated with
R&D-intensive innovation projects.
The observation that interorganizational collaboration has considerable potential to contribute to the
innovation strategies of organizations does not mean
that all collaborations are successful though. On the
contrary, estimates suggest that as many as 60 percent
of all alliances fail (Bleeke and Ernst, 1993; Harrigan,
1986). Unintended knowledge spillovers (Teece, 2002;
Veugelers, 1998), learning races between the partners
(Hamel, 1991; Larsson et al., 1998), diverging opinions on intended beneﬁts (Larson, 1992; Lorange and
Roos, 1992), and lack of ﬂexibility and adaptability
(Doz, 1996; Ring and Van de Ven, 1994) are frequently cited reasons for alliance failure.
Despite these potential drawbacks, prior research
provided evidence that interorganizational collaboration has a positive inﬂuence on the innovative performance of ﬁrms (Baum, Calabrese, and Silverman,
2000; Deeds and Hill, 1996; Rogers, 2004; Shan,
Walker, and Kogut, 1994; Stuart, 2000). Deeds and
Hill (1996) also illustrated that the relationship between the number of collaborative agreements and
innovative performance is characterized by diminishing marginal returns. After all, the larger the number
of a ﬁrm’s collaborative agreements, the higher the
risk of redundancy [i.e., the risk that different partners
provide access to the same information or comple-

mentary knowledge (Burt, 1992; Gomes-Casseres,
1994)]. Similar results were found by Baum et al.
(2000), arguing that it is not the number of collaborative agreements per se but rather the diversity of the
ﬁrm’s alliance network1 that inﬂuences the innovative
performance of the ﬁrm.
These ﬁndings suggest that organizations that
possess a diverse network of interorganizational
collaboration are better equipped to create and to
commercialize new or improved products. Hence, this
article presents the following hypothesis:
H1: Firms that engage in a variety of interorganizational collaborative agreements—within the framework
of their innovation strategy—will be more effective in
terms of innovative performance.

Applying March’s (1991) dichotomy of exploration
and exploitation, several scholars (e.g., Koza and
Lewin, 1998; Rothaermel, 2001; Rothaermel and
Deeds, 2004) distinguished between explorative and exploitative collaborations. While the intent behind
entering an exploration alliance involves a desire to
discover new opportunities, an exploitation alliance
involves the joint maximization of complementary assets (Koza and Lewin, 1998, p. 257). Applying this
distinction, Rothaermel and Deeds (2004) provided
evidence for the existence of a ‘‘system of new product development’’ within the biotechnology sector,
linking exploration alliances to products on the market
with exploration alliances predicting products in
development, products in development predicting
exploitation alliances, and exploitation alliances predicting products on the market. This result indicates
that explorative and exploitative collaborations have
different effects on a ﬁrm’s innovation strategies. This
section will extend this reasoning, developing hypotheses about the particular effects of both explorative
and exploitative collaboration on the innovative performance of ﬁrms.
In exploitative collaborations, the main purpose
relates to the enhancement of existing organizational
competencies. More specifically, exploitative collaboration centers on leveraging existing skills (Koza and
Lewin, 1998). Exploitative collaborations focus on
complementarities between technologies and products
1
In the Baum et al. (2000) study, the measurement of the diversity
of a ﬁrm’s alliance network was based on the Hirschman-Herﬁndahl
index. To be specific, diversity was computed as one minus the sum of
the squared proportions of a ﬁrm’s alliances with each of the nine
identiﬁed partner types divided by the ﬁrm’s total number of alliances.

<-----Page 3----->INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION

already present (Teece, 1992). Exploitation-oriented
collaboration processes beneﬁt from clear performance objectives that are translated into measurable
output controls and are monitored by formalized coordinating and control mechanisms (Koza and Lewin,
1998; Van de Ven and Walker, 1984). Hence, these
collaborative agreements typically are characterized
by clear job responsibilities, centralized procedures,
and highly engineered work processes. As the main
objectives of exploitation-oriented cooperation relate
to leveraging and further developing existing technologies, the following hypothesis is presented:
H2: The more a ﬁrm engages in exploitative interorganizational collaborations, the more effective it will be
in terms of improving and further developing existing
technologies and their implied products.

Explorative collaboration, on the other hand, is
seen as instrumental in creating new competencies;
learning processes and joint experimentation ﬁgure
prominently in this type of collaboration (Koza and
Lewin, 1998). Hence, a differential emphasis in the
direction of intangible or tacit knowledge exchange
can be observed. To achieve such learning objectives,
alliance partners rely more on personal and informal
modes of coordination and control (Koza and Lewin,
1998; Ring and Van de Ven, 1994; Van de Ven and
Walker, 1984). Such ‘‘organic’’ structures, in which
job responsibilities are less explicit and ﬂexible
working procedures have been introduced, seem
to suit innovation projects that focus on novelty
rather than efﬁciency (Burgelman, 1983; Burns and
Stalker, 1961; Christensen and Overdorf, 2000; Tushman, Anderson, and O’Reilly, 1997; Wheelwright
and Clark, 1992). Therefore, the following is
hypothesized:
H3: The more a ﬁrm engages in explorative interorganizational collaborations, the more effective it will
be in terms of developing new technologies and/or
products.

Methodology
Data
The data used in this study are drawn from the second
version of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS II)
conducted in several EU member states in 1997. The
survey sought to develop insights into the innovative

241

behavior of private organizations.2 For the Belgian
part of the CIS II survey, a representative sample of
2,164 Belgian manufacturing ﬁrms was selected, and
an 11-page questionnaire was sent out to them. The
response rate was 64% (1,377).3
In the CIS II survey, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) definition of technological innovation was adopted. In this
definition, technological product and process (TPP)
innovations comprise implemented technologically
new products and processes and significant technological improvements in products and processes. A
TPP innovation has been implemented if it has been
introduced to the market (i.e., product innovation) or
has been used within a production process (i.e., process innovation) (OECD/Eurostat, 1997, p. 32).
Only the ﬁrms that introduced at least one product or
process innovation needed to ﬁll out all questions in the
CIS II survey. In this study, the analysis therefore is restricted to ﬁrms within the Belgian manufacturing industry that introduced at least one product or process
innovation between 1994 and 1996. Restricting the
sample to these ﬁrms might lead to sample
selection if it was believed here that cooperation is
an important way to innovate for ﬁrms that would not
be innovative otherwise. This assumption is unlikely,
however, given that all ﬁrms that cooperate do have
some other innovation strategies, such as own R&D or
some form of external knowledge acquisition. Because
of missing values, the size of the present study’s sample
was further restricted. The amount of missing values was
particularly high on the question of ‘‘total number of
R&D personnel in 1996.’’ Sixty-two of the organizations
that introduced at least one product or process innovation did not report specific ﬁgures on this question. In
total, the sample of this study consists of 221 ﬁrms.

Variables
Indicators of the effectiveness of innovation strategies. In several studies that address the relationship
between interorganizational collaboration and innovative performance, patent activity is used as a measure of innovative outcome (e.g., Ahuja, 2000; Baum
et al., 2000; Shan, Walker, and Kogut, 1994; Stuart,
2000). However, given ﬁrm-specific variations in the

propensity to patent, and given the very real possibility that patents are inputs in the product development
process and not an output, equating the amount of
patent activity with innovation effectiveness can be
questioned (Deeds and Hill, 1996; Levin et al., 1987;
Mansﬁeld, 1977). Therefore, this study uses the composition of turnover as a measure of the effectiveness
of innovation strategies.
This turnover can be the result of (1) technologically new products introduced to the market from the
beginning of 1994 to the end of 1996; (2) technologically improved products introduced to the market
within the same period; or (3) unchanged or marginally changed products within the time period studied.
In this study, a technologically improved product is
deﬁned as an existing product whose performance has
been significantly enhanced or upgraded. A simple
product may be improved (in terms of better performance or lower cost) through use of higher-performance components or materials; a complex product
that consists of a number of integrated technical subsystems may be improved by partial changes to one of
the subsystems (OECD/Eurostat, 1997, p. 33). A technologically new product is a product whose technological characteristics or intended uses differ significantly
from those of previously produced products. Such innovations can involve radically new technologies, can
be based on combining existing technologies in new
uses, or can be derived from the use of new knowledge
(OECD/Eurostat, 1997, p. 33).
The proportion of turnover attributed to both new
and improved products is viewed in this study as an
indication of overall innovative performance or effectiveness. The proportion of turnover attributed to
new products is regarded as an indication of the effectiveness of the innovation strategy in terms of
creating new technologies and related products.
Likewise, the percentage of turnover attributed to
improved products is seen as an indicator of the
effectiveness of the innovation strategy in terms of
the further development of existing technologies
and products. The analyses do not incorporate the
proportion of turnover attributed to new/improved
products itself but instead the natural logarithm
of 1þ the proportion of turnover attributed to new/
improved products in order to obtain a normal
distribution.
Indicators of interorganizational collaboration. In
the CIS II survey, organizations indicate whether
they engaged in interorganizational agreements in-

volving innovation between the beginning of 1994 and
the end of 1996. Respondents speciﬁed whether they
participated in R&D or other innovation-related
projects with (1) other organizations within the same
group; (2) competitors; (3) customers; (4) consultants;
(5) suppliers; (6) universities; and (7) research institutes. For each of these different types of partners,
information is further categorized by geographical
location as follows: Belgium, EU, USA, Japan, and
Other Countries. In this way, 35 binary variables
become available, each representing a combination
of one specific type of partner with one specific geographical location. In order to test the relationship
between the presence of a variety or diversity of collaborative arrangements and innovative outcomes, a
variable is constructed, reﬂecting the presence of collaboration among the different types of partners
available. This variable labeled ‘‘s-collaborations’’
ranges from 0 to 7 since partnerships with similar
types of partners (e.g., customers) within different
locations (e.g., Belgium, EU, and Japan) are only
counted once.
Analyzing the relationships advanced in H2 and H3
requires additional indicators to reﬂect the distinction
between exploitative and explorative collaboration.
Based on insights from previous research, it is preferred here to label collaborations with customers and
suppliers as ‘‘exploitation oriented.’’ Such collaborations are assumed to be of a more exploitative nature
since development efforts remain predominantly sited
within a given value chain (Tripsas, 1997). In addition, collaboration with customers and suppliers has
been described as instrumental in optimizing existing
core competencies (Brown and Eisenhardt, 1995,
1997; Schoonhoven and Jelinek, 1997). Where collaboration with suppliers can significantly improve the
operational efﬁciency of existing production processes
(Dittrich, 2001), collaboration with customers puts
the needs of existing market segments high on the
innovation agenda (Shaw, 1994; Von Hippel, 1988).
Adopting a more exploration-oriented perspective,
Christensen and Overdorf (2000) convincingly argued
that collaborations with suppliers and customers will
not be helpful in supporting innovation projects of a
more novel nature. According to these authors, customers and suppliers often have an interest in the status quo and tend to preserve the dominant role of
existing technologies and competencies by developing
them further. Based on these insights, a variable
‘‘#Exploitation-oriented collaborations’’ was created
for the present study by adding together all the binary

<-----Page 5----->INTERORGANIZATIONAL COLLABORATION AND INNOVATION

variables representing collaborations with customers
or suppliers. Given the number of geographical areas
available (n 5 5), this variable has a range of 0 to 10.
On the other hand, collaborations with universities
and research institutes are considered to be of a more
explorative-oriented nature. Collaboration with such
partners focuses on the creation of insights relating to
new technologies that can be translated eventually
into commercial development (Bowie, 1994; George,
Zahra, and Wood, 2002; Wheelwright and Clark,
1992). In other words, the main focus centers on the
generation of new knowledge as opposed to the exploitation of existing knowledge. Adding together all
binary variables that include collaborations with
universities or research institutes results in the variable ‘‘#Exploration-oriented collaborations,’’ ranging
from 0 to 10.
For the other types of partners (within the group,
competitors), no straightforward diagnosis in terms of
exploration of exploitation seems plausible. Working
within the boundaries of the group might imply pursuing synergies with other business units (e.g., improving existing products) as well as cooperation with
corporate R&D, which might include projects aimed
at developing new products. Likewise, collaboration
with competitors might bring along both the creation
of new products (e.g., standard development within
emergent technologies/applications) as well as the optimization of existing products (e.g., bundling of
products/services).
While it is plausible to build on the insights from
previous studies to develop indicators that reﬂect the
different constructs under study, empirical validation
seems to be relevant. Performing an exploratory factor
analysis (see the Appendix), a two-factor solution was
obtained in which the presence of collaborations with
customers and suppliers strongly loads on the ﬁrst factor, while collaborations with universities and research
institutes strongly loads on the second factor. These
results corroborate this study’s arguments that collaborations with customers and suppliers differ from collaborations with universities and research institutes.
Control variables. Finally, several variables have
been introduced in order to control for possible confounding effects: ﬁrm size, appropriation efforts,
whether the organization is part of a multinational/
divisional entity, the intensity of internal R&D efforts, and industry effects.
Since the seminal writings of Schumpeter (1939,
1959), the relation between size and innovative per-

243

formance of ﬁrms has been much debated [for a comprehensive overview, see Freeman (1986)]. Economies
of scale in R&D, the ability to spread risks over a
portfolio of projects and access to a larger pool of ﬁnancial resources, give large ﬁrms an advantage over
smaller ﬁrms (Veugelers, 1997). Moreover, large ﬁrms
are more able to acquire the complementary assets
(e.g., distribution channels, raw materials, and specialized materials) that are necessary to guarantee the
commercial success of innovative products (Teece,
1986; Tripsas, 1997). At the same time, small ﬁrms
might outperform larger, incumbent, ﬁrms in terms of
creativity, speed, and ﬂexibility, especially when new,
disruptive technologies enter the stage (Bower and
Christensen, 1995). As argued convincingly by Freeman (1986), technology life-cycle stages seem to moderate the relationship between ﬁrm size and innovative
performance. Within the framework of the analysis
performed in this study, which pertains to a variety of
industries (and hence technologies), the variable size,
measured by the natural logarithm of the number of
employees, has been included within the different
models as a control variable.
For a ﬁrm to be successful over time with its innovative products, it not only needs to possess the
necessary complementary assets but also has to
appropriate the required technology (Teece, 1986).
In general, the more a company can protect its intellectual property from competitors, the more likely the
organization can derive profits from its product innovations (Katz, 2003). Therefore, it is expected that
ﬁrms that actively try to protect their intellectual
property will be more successful in terms of innovation. This study’s analyses included the variable
‘‘Appropriation Effort,’’ indicating whether the organization ﬁled for at least one patent between 1994
and 1996.
With R&D remaining a centralized function
within a multinational or divisional company, the
R&D strategy of subsidiary companies may be
seriously affected by the parent company (Veugelers
and Vanden Houte, 1990). Deeds and Hill (1996),
for instance, found evidence that ﬁrms, listed as
a subsidiary of another ﬁrm, performed significantly
better in terms of bringing new products to the
market than nonsubsidiary ﬁrms. To test the differential behavior of subsidiaries, a dummy, labeled
‘‘Subsidiary,’’ has been included within the different
analyses.
Studies examining the inﬂuence of interorganizational collaboration on innovative performance (e.g.,

<-----Page 6----->244

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:238–250

D. FAEMS, B. VAN LOOY, AND K. DEBACKERE

and 0.13. Taking into account this study’s use of
logarithmic transformations for these variables, the
implication is that, on average, the respondents
attributed 9.41% of their turnover to technological
new products and 13.88% to technological improved
products. From Table 1 it becomes apparent that the
variety of interorganizational partners reported was
rather limited. On average, the innovating ﬁrms used
less than two of the seven collaborative partners that
were included in the survey. Moreover, with regard to
exploitative and explorative kinds of collaboration,
ﬁrms engage on average in less than 1 out of the 10
combinations proposed.
As Table 2 includes the correlations as well, one
can notice that the amount of turnover attributed to
technologically new products is not only positively
correlated with R&D intensity but also with the different collaboration variables included in this study’s
analyses. Positive correlations between the amount of
turnover attributed to technologically improved products and both the variety of collaborative agreements
and the nature of exploitative-oriented collaborative
agreements can be noticed. This already provides a
ﬁrst indication that the collaborative behavior of organizations might be related to innovative performance.

Baum et al., 2000; Rogers, 2004) provided evidence
that the internal R&D activities of organizations also
act as a positive inﬂuence on the effectiveness of innovation strategies. Therefore, the variable ‘‘R&D
Intensity’’ was included, representing the ratio of the
number of R&D employees divided by total number
of employees.
Including industry dummies to correct for ﬁxed industry effects is now widely practiced, given the significant impact they often achieve (Veugelers, 1997).
These industry dummies may be capturing various
technology dimensions, such as technological opportunity, appropriability regimes, and dynamic aspects,
such as cumulativeness or the emergence of dominant
designs, along the technology life cycle. Table 1 provides an overview of the nine industries identiﬁed.

new products while at the same time controlling for
variables like size, appropriation efforts, industry,
R&D intensity, and whether the company is a foreign
subsidiary or not. In order to examine this relationship, a Tobit regression was conducted (McDonald
and Mufﬁt, 1980; Greene, 2000) as this allowed
accounting for the presence of censored values.
Table 3 summarizes the ﬁndings of the Tobit analysis whereby the total turnover resulting from new or
improved products acts as the dependent variable.4
As is clear from Table 3, the total number of collaborations is positively correlated to the effectiveness
indicator used, supporting H1. In addition, it can be
observed that organizations that have ﬁled at least
one patent between 1994 and 1996 are more performant in terms of new and improved products than
organizations who were not involved in such appropriation efforts.5

4
According to the decomposition logic of McDonald and Mofﬁtt
(1980), within the estimated model, 87% of the total change in innovation resulting from a change in the independent variables would be
generated by marginal changes in the value of innovation, whereas
13% would be generated by changes in the probability of innovating
anything at all.
5
The results that are reported in this article did not reveal statistically significant size effects (except for Table 5). This seems counterintuitive since most econometric analyses on innovative performance
have found statistically significant size effects. Upon inspection of
the size distribution of the sample, the present study concludes that the
results obtained may be explained by the fact that ‘‘really’’ large ﬁrms
are lacking in the sample. Only 4 out of the 221 responding ﬁrms report
more than 5,000 employees, the maximum being 11,423. As a consequence, one can hardly speak of many ‘‘large’’ ﬁrms being present in
the sample. At best, they should be considered solid mid-sized ﬁrms.
This size distribution is not astonishing given that the data are based on
a sample of Belgian ﬁrms (although some of them may belong to multinational groups).

H2 and H3 introduce a distinction between the
effectiveness of innovation in terms of new versus
improved products as well as a characterization of
the nature of the interorganizational collaborations
(explorative versus exploitative).

Toward a More Fine-Grained Approach
H2 states that the use of exploitative collaborations is
beneﬁcial with respect to the optimization of existing
technologies and related products. The Tobit analysis,6 in which the collaboration variables (# Exploration collaborations, # Exploitation collaborations)
are related to the amount of turnover resulting from
improved products, provides evidence in this respect.
As Table 4 makes clear, the number of exploitationoriented collaborations relates significantly to the
presence and amount of turnover resulting from improved products, while exploration-oriented collaborations do not. A significant negative relationship also
was observed between being a member of a multinational company and the amount of turnover resulting
from improved products.
H3 also stated that the use of explorative collaborations would be beneﬁcial in developing new
products. The results of the Tobit model, in which
the presence and the amount of turnover stemming
from new products is used as a dependent variable,
6
Within these two Tobit models, 59% of the total change in innovation resulting from a change in the independent variables would be
generated by marginal changes in the value of innovation, whereas
41% would be generated by changes in the probability of innovating
anything at all.

provides evidence for the hypothesis outlined, as
Table 5 makes clear. Whereas the presence and number
of exploitation-oriented collaborations does not relate
significantly to the proportion of turnover generated
by new products, this is clearly the case for exploration-oriented collaborations. A very significant positive effect from the presence of appropriation efforts
on the amount of turnover resulting from new products also was observed. At the same time, it can be
noted that size is negatively related to successfulness
of new products. As in the case of turnover of improved products, no effect was observed from internal
R&D activities. Industry effects were also absent.

Discussion
This study has tried to ﬁnd empirical evidence for the
idea that the variety of interorganizational collaboration relates to the effectiveness of innovation strategies. The analyses conducted in this study conﬁrm the
hypotheses outlined. Firms that possess a heterogeneous network of collaborative partners within the
framework of their innovation strategies perform better in terms of the proportion of turnover realized by
means of new or improved products. In addition, the
difference between exploitative and explorative collaborations has been introduced to examine whether

different kinds of collaboration relate to different
types of innovation outcomes. This study hypothesized that exploitative-oriented collaborations could
support the improvement and further development of
existing technologies and products, while explorativeoriented collaborations would be beneﬁcial for innovation objectives aimed at creating new technologies
and products. These hypotheses have, to a large extent, been conﬁrmed. Collaborations with customers
and suppliers—labeled as ‘‘exploitative’’—are associated positively with higher levels of turnover stemming from improved products, while collaborations
with universities and research organizations—labeled
as ‘‘explorative’’—are associated in similar fashion
with turnover levels related to new products.

Relevance for Practitioners
This study’s ﬁndings suggest that companies should
consider the idea of a portfolio of interorganizational
arrangements when implementing their innovation
strategies in order to be effective in developing improved and new technologies and products. It was
observed during this study that interorganizational
collaboration with different partners (customers and
suppliers versus universities and research centers) contributes to the innovative performance of ﬁrms, while,
at the same time, the observed relationships differ depending on whether one looks at performance stemming from improved or new development efforts.
Since the effects of collaborating with different partners are, at the same time, significant and of a different nature, the relevancy of extending the idea of
adopting a portfolio approach to interorganizational
collaboration comes to the forefront. This study’s
ﬁndings suggest a supportive role for a portfolio of
different, though complementary, interorganizational
arrangements for achieving innovation outcomes. To
the extent that ﬁrms strive for multiple innovation
outcomes, their innovation strategy might entail an
appropriately balanced set of interorganizational collaborative arrangements.

Issues for Further Research
The adjusted R2 of the tested models (see Tables 3, 4,
and 5) indicates that only part of the variation present
in the data was explained here. This amount of unexplained variance can be related to the absence of important variables that substantially inﬂuence how and
to what extent organizations innovate. Several schol-

ars (e.g., Burns and Stalker, 1961; Schoonhoven and
Jelinek, 1997) stressed, for instance, that organizational structures have a considerable inﬂuence on the
innovative behavior of organizations. In this respect,
Brown and Eisenhardt (1997, p. 28), studying innovation within the computer industry, concluded that
organizations that applied semistructures or organizational structures in which some features are prescribed or determined (e.g., responsibilities, project
priorities, time intervals between projects) but other
aspects are not (e.g., design process, communication)
were the most performant in terms of innovation. According to the authors, these organizational structures, representing a balance between mechanistic and
organic structures, allow the conﬂicting tensions
spelled out in the introduction to be addressed. As
the CIS II survey did not provide data on the organizational structure of the respondents, this type of
variable could not be included in the present analyses.
The fact that data were used from a survey that was
not specifically designed for these research questions
also has implications for the accuracy of the different
indicators used. In the CIS survey, organizations are
asked whether or not they use the different collaboration opportunities, without indicating the objectives
pursued (developing existing technologies/products,
or creating new ones). It is clear that the availability
of such indications would have been beneﬁcial for
analyzing the research hypothesis outlined in this
contribution. Following recent contributions (e.g.,
Rothaermel, 2001; Rothaermel and Deeds, 2004),
this study’s conceptual distinction between exploitative and explorative collaboration was based on the
type of partner involved in the collaboration. More
specifically, this research assumed that collaborations
with suppliers and customers will be more exploitative
oriented, while collaborations with universities and
research institutes will be more explorative oriented.
Although an exploratory factor analysis provided empirical support for these assumptions, a more reliable
way of making a distinction between exploitative and
explorative collaborations would be to assess explicitly
the objectives of collaborative agreements. This would
permit the integration of other kinds of collaboration,
such as collaboration with competitors, into the exploitation–exploration dichotomy.

Conclusion
Despite these limitations, the present study’s ﬁndings
revealed robust results in line with the hypotheses

<-----Page 10----->248

J PROD INNOV MANAG
2005;22:238–250

outlined. The purpose of this study was to assess
whether the collaborative behavior of organizations
relates to the innovative output of these organizations. Based on these results, it can be concluded that
the more ﬁrms engage in a variety of different interorganizational collaborations, the more likely they are
to create new or improved products that are commercially successful. Moreover, this study showed that
collaboration with different types of partners coincides with different types of innovation outcomes.
These results highlight the relevance for senior management of adopting a portfolio approach to interorganizational collaborations in order to achieve results
both in terms of developing existing technologies and
creating new ones.

Appendix. Exploratory Factor Analysis
By adding together all the binary variables representing one specific kind of collaborative partner, the variables
#Customer Collaborations, #Suppliers Collaborations, #Universities Collaborations, and #Research Institutes
Collaborations were constructed. Given the number of geographical areas available (n 5 5), these variables have
ranges from 0 to 5. Performing an exploratory factor analysis on these variables results in a two-factor solution
in which the presence of collaborations with customers and suppliers strongly loads on the ﬁrst factor, while
collaborations with universities and research institutes strongly loads on the second factor.
