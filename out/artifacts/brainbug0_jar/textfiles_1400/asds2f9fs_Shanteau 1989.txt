Abstract
The purposes of this paper are: (1) to provide background on the heuristics and biases approach to
decision-making;( 2 ) to describe some of the issues being debated in psychology concerningthis approach;
(3) to review relevant studies from the behavior auditing research literature; (4) to provide comments on
trends in the auditing literature; (5) to offer comments about the advantages and disadvantages of this
approach; and (6) to make some observations about future prospects for this research tradition.

vestigators have b e c o m e interested in cognitive
heuristics and bases. Before turning to a consideration of relevant auditing research, some background will be provided on the heuristics and
biases approach and the on-going debate in
psychology about its usefulness. The paper will
continue with comments about the current state
of affairs and conclude with observations about
the future of this approach.

BACKGROUND
Kahneman & Tversky described their view of
heuristics and biases as follows: "In making predictions and judgments under uncertainty,
people do not appear to follow the calculus of
chance or the statistical theory of prediction. Instead, they rely on a limited number of heuristics
which sometimes yield reasonable judgments
and sometimes lead to severe and systematic errors" (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973, p. 237). They
then defined three cognitive heuristics for risk
judgments: representativeness, availability and
anchoring-and-adjustment-

Representativeness
Representativeness refers to making an uncertainty judgment on the basis of "the degree to
which it is: (i) similar in essential properties to
its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient
features of the process by which it is generated"
(Kahneman & Tversky, 1972, p. 431). Supporting evidence has c o m e from reports that people
ignore base rates, neglect sample size, overlook
regression toward the mean and misestimate
conjunctive
probabilities (Kahneman
&
Tversky, 1973; Tversky & Kahneman, 1983).

Availability
Availability is used to estimate "frequency or
probability by the ease with which instances or
associations could be brought to mind" ( T v e r s k y
& Kahneman, 1973, p. 208). In contrast to representativeness which involves assessments of
similarity or connotative distance, availability

reflects assessments of associative distance
(Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). Availability has
been reported to be influenced by imaginability,
familiarity and vividness, and has been supported by evidence of stereotypic and scenario
thinldng (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979a).

Anchoring-and-adjustment
Anchoring-and-adjustment involves "starting
from an initial value that is adjusted to yield the
final answer. The initial value, or starting point,
may be suggested by the formulation of the
problem, or it may be the result of a partial computation. In either case, adjustments are typically insufficient" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974,
p. 1128). Supporting evidence comes from
biases in evaluation of conjunctive and disjunctive events, insufficient revision of probabilities
relative to Bayes' theorem (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) and framing (problem restatement)
effects (Kahneman & Tversky, 1984).
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the
role that the heuristics and biases approach has
played in behavioral auditing research on probability and risk judgments. Space does not allow
consideration, however, of the other contributions of Kahneman & Tversky, such as prospect
theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979b), which
involve utility or value judgments.

PSYCHOLOGICAL CRITICISMS
Given the popularity of this approach, it may
be surprising for some to learn of the extent of
criticism offered in the psychological literature
of the heuristics and biases research. Many of the
major investigators in the judgment and decision.making field have written negatively about
this work. For instance, consider the following
partial list of critics: Abelson, Anderson, Beach,
Cohen, Edwards, Einhorn, Hammond, Hogarth,
Humphreys, Jungermann, Manis, March, Phillips,
Christensen-Szalanski, Wallsten, Winlder and G.

negative comments.

BEHAVIORAL AUDITING STUDIES

By m y rough count, there have b e e n at least
40 studies o f heuristics and biases in the auditing
literature. Most of these have investigated representativeness and related risk phenomena,
with fewer studies of availability or anchoringand-adjustment. Interestingly, there are over 20
papers which provide reviews or commentaries
of this work. It is obvious that heuristics and
biases have generated considerable interest in
behavioral auditing.
Rather than reviewing all these papers, three
recent studies of heuristics and biases will be
considered briefly as examples of the approach.
Then m o r e global c o m m e n t s will be offered
about the research in general.
In a study of representativeness, Holt ( 1 9 8 7 )
reexamined the conclusions o f J o y c e & Biddle
(1981a) about auditors' use of base-rate information in judgments of m a n a g e m e n t fraud. Base
rates, because they are unrepresentative, are frequently underweighted relative to case specific
evidence (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973).Joyce &
Biddle found t h a t auditors underutilized base
rates c o m p a r e d to normative (Bayesian) standards, but that auditors did better than student
subjects. In a series of five experiments, Holt reported that it was the wording of the problems,
rather than any innate or learned ability, that led
to the J o y c e & Biddle results. She interpreted
these find!ngs as evidence of a framing effect
(see below).
The availability heuristic was examined in a
study of analytic review by Libby (1985). Professional auditors w e r e asked to generate hypotheses which might account for material financial
statement errors. Auditors w e r e also asked about
perceived frequency and r e c e n c y of their experience with various types of errors. The
results suggested that "perceived error frequencies play a major role in the accessibility of error
hypotheses in analytical review" (p. 663). The
data also revealed a positive relation b e t w e e n recency of experience and generation of hypotheses. The findings w e r e inconsistent, however,
concerning effects of m e m o r y structure on accessibility.

J o y c e & Biddle ( 1 9 8 1 b ) investigated the effects of anchoring-and-adjustment on probabilistic inferences in auditing judgment. They conducted six experiments to determine the extent
of effects on practicing auditors' judgments. The
authors conclude, "The results of these experi.
ments indicate that auditors sometimes make
judgments that are in violation of normative
principles of decision making, but that these violations cannot always be accounted for the an.
choring and adjustment heuristic" (p. 141 ). An
extension of this research by Wright & Anderson
( 1 9 8 2 ) did find that anchoring effects w e r e
robust.
These studies typify the somewhat confusing
state of affairs about the role of heuristics and
biases in auditing judgment. As Ashton ( 1983, p.
34) concludes, "the research on heuristics and
biases in audit decision-making has b e e n somewhat limited and the results have been mixed."
In the remainder of this paper, I will offer several
c o m m e n t s and observations which may be of
some value in reducing the confusion.

COMMENTS ON BEHAVIORAL AUDITING
RESEARCH
Based on reading through many of the papers
on heuristics and biases in behavioral auditing,
four c o m m e n t s seem appropriate. First, accounting researchers have frequently had difficulty
translating the Kahneman & Tversky demonstrations into an auditing framework. As Biddle &
Joyce ( 1982, p. 187) c o m m e n t e d , "our failure to
observe behavior consistent with availability
may be due, at least in part, to problems with our
experiment." These authors, in devising a task to
test for anchoring-and-adjustment, had selected
a p r o b l e m that was unrelated to risk, probability
or frequency judgments m the domains for
which the heuristics w e r e developed and
evaluated.
A related p r o b l e m can be seen in the research
by Libby ( 1 9 8 5 ) intended to study availability
(described above). The e x p e r i m e n t in fact manipulated accessibility, not availability. These two
concepts generally are differentiated by

<-----Page 4----->COGNITIVEHEURISTICSANDBIASES
psychologists. Libby apparently recognized the
distinction and is careful to use the term "accessibility" throughout the paper. Nonetheless, this
illustrates h o w difficult it can be to investigate
heuristics using auditing stimuli.
Corresponding difficulties with the word
problems used to test heuristics and biases have
been reported by psychological researchers.
Evans & Dusoir (1977, p. 130), for instance,
argue that "the construction of their (Kahneman
& Tversky) problems seems unnecessarily complex;" they go on to show h o w simplifying the
wording can almost eliminate a representativeness effect. Bar-Hillel ( 1 9 7 9 ) reported a similar
finding. This difficulty in devising appropriate
task examples suggests that heuristics and biases
may have limited applicability in real-world
auditing contexts.
Second, the results reported in many auditing
studies of heuristics and biases are often close to
normative (as seen for the Joyce & Biddle
studies described above). Consider the following examples: Gibbins ( 1 9 7 7 ) found that about
40% of auditors' respones were predicted by
representativeness, about half made the normative response and the remainder were inconsistenet with either. Bamber ( 1 9 8 2 ) found that auditor managers were not only sensitive to the reliability of information, they overcompensated.
Kinney and Uecker ( 1 9 8 2 ) observed results
contrary to anchoring-and-adjustment in two
experiments. Biddle & Joyce ( 1 9 8 2 ) f a i l e d to
find the effects predicted by the availability
heuristic. Similar results are reported by Abdolmohammadi & Wright (1982), Shields et aL
(1987), Tomassini et al. ( 1 9 8 2 ) and Wailer &
Felix (1987).
Even for studies which report findings consistent with heuristics and biases (e.g. Uecker &
Kinney, 1977), the effects are generally smaller
than those found by Kahneman & Tversky. Biddie & Joyce (1979, p. 31) suggest that ~this
superior performance by auditors may be attributable, in part, to their acquisition of professional skills in evaluating sample evidence and to
their familiarity with the decision settings portrayed in the experiments." Similarly, Tomassini
et aL ( 1 9 8 2 ) note that auditors are trained to

169

evaluate sample evidence as part of their professional responsibilities. Whatever the reason, if
the heuristics and biases research had started
out using auditors as subjects (instead of introductory psychology students), R is doubtful
whether the small effects observed would have
generated much interest.
Third, despite these generally inconclusive
results, many auditing researchers nevertheless
have argued for the heuristic-and-bias approach.
When Biddle & Joyce ( 1 9 8 2 ) failed to support
the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic, they
concluded that "some as yet unidentified heuristic was at work" ( p. 189). The possibility that the
heuristics approach may have been inappropriate apparently wasn't considered. It's rather
curious w h e n failure to support a hypothesis
only strengthens the resolve to find support.
Similar arguments against the Biddle & Joyce
conclusions were offered by Holstrum ( 1 9 8 2 )
and Lewis (1982).
There seems to be a tendency in behavioral
auditing research on heuristics to define success
or failure of a study by whether biases are observed or not. Normatively appropriate behavior
does not get the attention that normatively inappropriate behavior gets. For example, Ashton
(1983, p. 35) concludes "despite the mixed
nature of the overall results in the heuristics
area, findings such as these suggest that auditors
often have difficulty understanding the implications of sample information. ~ As noted above,
this same "bias" toward emphasizing poor decision behavior has been reported in the psychological literature (Christensen-Szalanski &
Beach, 1984).
Fourth, there has been a trend in recent auditing studies to cite framing effects to account for
the inconsistent results on heuristics and biases.
Framing was defined by Kahneman & Tversky
( 1 9 8 4 ) as a cognitive perspective elicited by
task characteristics. They present as an example
the framing of gambles in terms of status quo or
in terms of initial wealth. Empirical effects are
demonstrated by showing that subjects respond
differently to logically equivalent but restated
versions of the same problems. Auditing judgments, by this view, may depend on problem

<-----Page 5----->170

JAMESSHANTEAU

characteristics which are irrelevant to the decision itself. This could account for why biases
were observed in s o m e studies and not others
(see the Holt study discussed above).
Framing differences, in fact, may be able to account for some of the apparent inconsistencies
between studies. There is, however, a tendency
in auditing research to label any and all context
effects as "framing" (Demski & Swieringa, 1981 ).
Context effects have a long history of psychology, going back to the Gestalt approach to perception (e.g. Wertheimer, 1938). Context effects w e r e later quantitized in Helson's ( 1 9 6 4 )
Adaptation Level theory into three components:
( 1 ) stimulus factors, ( 2 ) background factors, and
( 3 ) personality factors. Framing appears to be
concerned primarily with sti .mulus restatements
e.g. is the glass half full or half empty? However,
all three of Helson's c o m p o n e n t s are likely to
have an important impact on auditing judgment
and deserve separate consideration.
In sum, it's relevant to ask about the contribution of the heuristics and biases' approach in increasing understanding of audit judgment. Mump o w e r ( 1 9 7 8 ) s u g g e s t s three questions that behavioral accounting studies might address: ( 1 )
What task variables influence accounting judgment? ( 2 ) W h a t individual difference variables
are important? and ( 3 ) H o w do task and individual difference variables interact? Added to
the list might be: ( 4 ) H o w can accounting judgment be improved? The heuristics and biases research has provided some answers to the first
question, but has not addressed the other questions.

TYPES OF BEHAVIORAL AUDITING RESEARCH
The study of heuristics and biases appears to
have b e e n of limited relevance for behavioral auditing research for several reasons. First, the
results have failed to reveal any consistent effects attributable to heuristics and biases.
Second, only a narrow range of auditing tasks
have been used in heuristics and biases research.
Third, it's not clear that heuristics and biases are
connected to central issues in behavioral audit-

ing. The latter two c o m m e n t s will be elaborated
on in this section.
As a psychologist looking at the field, there appear to have been three types of behavioral auditing studies (see Shanteau ( 1 9 8 7 ) for a m o r e
complete discussion). These are as follows.

Replication studies
The first type of project is a replication of a
previously conducted behavioral study, only
with auditors rather than introductory students
as subjects. The methods and procedures are
b o r r o w e d in total. The major research question
is: Will the original findings replicate with auditors as subjects? For the most part, behavioral
auditing studies of heuristics and biases fall into
this category. They offer little advance in
methodology, analysis, theory, etc., o v e r the
original Kahneman & Tversky studies.
One positive feature of replication studies is
that they have introduced many auditing investigators to behavioral research. On the negative
side, however, replication studies are limited in
two important ways. First, they investigate issues
which originate with non-auditors and may be of
questionable relevance to auditing. Second, replication studies ask auditing subjects to answer
questions which may have little relationship to
their professional skills and knowledge.

Adaptation studies
The second type of auditing study looks at a
research problem originating from accounting
and/or auditing concepts, but using methods
adapted from behavioral research approaches.
One example involves analysis of sunk cost effects (e.g. Thaler, 1980; Arkes & Blumer, 1985).
The topic is of direct concern in accounting and
auditing, but the methods and analyses reflect
procedures used in heuristics and biases, research.
Adaptation studies are obviously an advance
over replication research, since the research
problems originate from accounting and/or auditing. However, behavioral methods may be insufficient to investigate many c o m p l e x auditing
issues, e.g. the effects of a n e w auditing policy.
Instead, it may be necessary to combine be-

<-----Page 6----->COGNITIVE HEURISTICSANDBIASES

havioral and non-behavioral methods in novel
ways to investigate such issues.
Problem-driven studies
The third type of project involves research designed uniquely around the concerns of behavioral auditing. Such studies lead to their o w n
methods and procedures; in contrast, the first
t w o types of studies are largely spin-offs from behavioral research. Thus, the methods and procedures flow from important auditing problems,
not the other way around.
This type of research marks the dividing line
as far as a non-auditor is c o n c e r n e d - - as a
psychologist, I am no longer qualified to comm e n t on specific projects. I firmly believe, however, that this is the direction in which behavioral research in auditing should head.
In summary, behavioral auditing research on
heuristics and biases falls primarily into the replication category; such research can b e viewed
as a transition stage. Adaptation studies may
apply s o m e of the methods from heuristics and
biases research to accounting and/or auditing
problems; this is clearly an i m p r o v e m e n t over
replication research. Finally, problem-driven
studies represent the future of behavioral auditing research; it's not clear, however, that heuristics and biases will play any role in that future.

WHERE'S THE THEORY?.
A n u m b e r of judgment and decision-making
researchers have criticized the heuristics and
biases research for the absence of theoretical underpinings (e.g. Slovic et al., 1977;Jungermann,
1983; Anderson, 1987). As WaUsten (1983, p.
13) observes:
"We have n o w reached the point w h e r e it is necessary to
develop theories of problem reprer~*ntation and of judg.
menu.. T h e research o n heuristics should rely less o n individual w o r d problems, and m o r e o n t h e systematic
manipulation of features in a m a n n e r d e t e r m i n e d by t h e
theory u n d e r consideration?

It is troubling that after m o r e than 15 years of research on heuristics and biases, there is still no

171

general theory or even specific models of underlying processes.
This same concern applies to behavioral auditing s t u d i e s - - there doesn't appear to have b e e n
m u c h progress on theory development related
to heuristics and biases. Presently, there are
many b o r r o w e d concepts in behavioral auditing
research, but little in the way of original
theories. Although psychology and other behavioral sciences can provide methodologies for
answering questions about auditing, they cannot
identify which auditing problems are theoretically important to pursue.
Although the absence of theory has been commented on by auditing researchers (Swieringa &
Weick, 1982; Gibbins, 1984), there is a tendency
to look to psychology for the answer. For instance, Biddle & J o y c e ( 1982, p. 190) conclude
that efforts to improve audit decision-making
"are likely to be impeded until the psychological
theory of decision making is better formulated."
This may be true, but audit researchers should
also be looking to develop their own theories.
The lack of theoretical progress is troubling,
not only at the scientific level, but also at a practical level. Practitioners, no less than basic researchers, want answers to such theoreticallybased questions as h o w can judgments be made
with greater accuracy and what can be done
about systematic errors? It will be up to audit researchers to develop interesting theories and
models.
What is the theoretical status of cognitive Hlusions, heuristics and biases in behavioral accounting and auditing research? Let m e address
each of these concepts in turn.

COGNITIVE ILLUSIONS
Frequently, an analogy is made betwen perceptual illusions and the biases resulting from
the use of heuristics. In both cases, ~errors and
biases often reveal the psychological processes
and the heuristic p r o c e d u r e s that govern judgm e n t and inference" (Kahneman & Tversky,
1982b, p. 124). In parallel to a sensory-based
perceptual illusions, judgment errors are often

<-----Page 7----->172

JAMESSHANTEAU

labeled "cognitive illusions" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983).
There is, however, a serious problem with this
analogy. In the case of a perceptual illusion, the
subject is directly exposed to but misperceives a
stimulus object. The size of the illusion can be
measured by comparing the subject's response
with the actual stimulus value. With cognitive illusions, on the other hand, the subject is never
actually exposed to the correct value. Instead,
the correct answer is derived from normative
considerations, such as Bayes' theorem. Since
subjects are asked to make judgments about
things they have not actually experienced ( m o s t
of us don't have a Bayesian calculator in our
head), it shouldn't be surprising that responses
turn out to be inaccurate. But unlike the study of
perceptual illusions, such inaccuracies have not
been shown to have any necessary connection
to psychological mechanisms. Therefore, it
seems somewhat tenuous to offer psychological
interpretations of cognitive illusions w h e n the
basis of these "illusions" has yet to be established.
This argument was first offered by Shanteau
( 1 9 7 8 ) w h o concluded that it would be m o r e
convincing if subjects w h o had experienced the
relevant events w e r e used. For such subjects,
there would then be some basis for comparing
their judgments to a perceived standard.
This suggestion was later investigated by
Christensen-Szalanski et aL ( 1 9 8 3 ) . They found
that experienced physicians w e r e substantially
less influenced by availability than college students in making mortality estimates. Results
from Lichtenstein et aL (1978, experiment 2)
also showed that greater experience led to decreased errors. The extent of the "illusion" thus
depends on experience; those that have experience with the stimuli don't show the illusion and
those that don't have experience do show the illusion. Rather than an illusion, this pattern of
results suggest that the observed errors arise
from ignorance, not.an illusion-like process of
misperception.
A different argument can be made from the auditing study of Biddle & J o y c e (1979). When
they used tasks familiar to auditors, they found

less evidence of a representativeness bias. They
reported "contingent processing of information;
viz., assess sampling error using a representativehess heuristic based on the sampling fraction unless the sample sizes are significantly different"
(p. 17). This suggests a hierarchical decision
strategy under which the use or non-use of the
heuristic is under the auditor's control ~ hardly
the description of an "illusion", (Consideration
of contingent processing strategies has been receiving increasing emphasis in the psychological
literature (Payne, 1982; Beach et aL, 1986;
Tversky et al., 1988).
In short, the use of perception illusions as an
analogy of the "cognitive illusions" of heuristics
and biases appears unjustified from b o t h logical
and empirical perspectives. Subjects may be
making errors, but that doesn't mean that the errors are the result of an "illusion."

BIASES
There is little doubt that judgment biases can
be demonstrated in the judgments of undergraduate psychology students. Although there
has b e e n considerable debate about the size of
s o m e of these biases (Carroll & Siegler, 1977;
Manis et al., 1980; Beyth-Marom & Arkes, 1983;
Christensen-Szalanski & Beach, 1983; Wright,
1984), replicability is not the central issue in m y
view. The original examples of Kahneman &
Tversky are easily replicated in classroom settings and in fact provide nice teaching material.
A major question, however, is w h e t h e r the
biases observed with naive subjects also apply to
experts. According to Tversky & Kahneman
( 1974, p. 1130). "The reliance on heuristics and
the prevalence of biases are not restricted to
laymen. Experienced researchers are also prone
to the same biases - - w h e n they think intuitively." They go on to say, "Although the statistically sophisticated avoid elementary errors,
such as the gambler's fallacy, their intuitive judgments are liable to similar fallacies in m o r e intricate and less transparent problems."
Most of the research evaluating biases in experts has been b e e n conducted within medicine

<-----Page 8----->COGNITIVEHEURISTICSAND BIASES
and auditing. In medical decision-making, there
have been numerous studies of w h e t h e r doctors'
judgments are biased. In their recent book,
Schwartz & Griffin ( 1 9 8 6 ) cite o v e r 20 relevant
papers. In the majority of these studies, the
biases w e r e smaller ( o r nonexistent) than the
results observed for naive subjects (e.g.
Wallsten, 1981). Schwartz & Griffin conclude
that it is not clear which factors determine w h e n
biases will appear in expert medical judgment.
In behavioral auditing, there have been reports of both biased and non-biased behavior. As
noted previously, it is difficult to see many consistencies in the pattern of results. One trend
does emerge, however. Generally, auditors are
less biased in their judgments than naive subjects. For instance, Shields et aL (1987, p. 384)
conclude that their results are "generally consistent with previous research indicating that auditors' judgments are less p r o n e to biases than
most subjects in psychologial experiments."
Ashton (1982, 1983) arrived at similar conclusions.
The primary evidence of biases in experts
comes from Tversky & Kahneman's ( 1971 ) survey of psychologists at two meetings. The results
revealed a "prevalence of the belief in the Law of
Small Numbers... Apparently, acquaintance with
formal logic and with probability theory does
not extinguish erroneous intuitions" (p. 109).
They go on to explain this result in terms of representativeness. This research has b e e n widely
cited as showing that experts are biased in their
professional judgments (Slovic, 1982; Slovic et
al., 1985).
A former student of mine (Bowser, 1972) attempted to replicate this study using professional statisticians as subjects. He found that
statisticians w e r e less biased than the
psychologists in the original study. More importantly, several of the statisticians disagreed with
the "correct answers" given by Tversk'y &
Kahneman. There was even disagreement
among the statisticians about the appropriate
answers. Apparently, the problems used in the
Law of Small Numbers p a p e r w e r e ambiguous
enough to allow for multiple interpretations and
hence multiple solutions. If so, that is hardly a

173

convincing basis for concluding that experts are
biased in the same ways as naive subjects.
There is a growing debate on the question of
w h e t h e r appropriate normative standards have
b e e n used to define biases. The definition of base
rate, for instance, depends on the population
from which the sample is drawn - - a given sam.
pie might have c o m e from many populations
(Cohen, 1981 ). Since experts are m o r e likely to
be aware of these alternative populations, it
should not be surprising that they might disagree with the designated correct answer. But ff
the definition of the normative standard is un.
certain, then the identification of a Ubias" is
equally uncertain. Thus, it is not clear that experts exhibit the sorts of biases so easily demonstrated with naive subjects.

HEURISTICS
The c o n c e p t of heuristics was introduced by
Simon ( 1 9 5 7 ) in his discussion of "limited rationality." He argued that, because of cognitive
limitations, humans have little option but to construct simplified models of the worM. Heuristics
are a p r o d u c t of these simplified models and provide shortcuts that can produce decisions efficiently and effectively. Simon saw heuristics as
adaptive strategies used by humans to cope with
their limited information processing capacity. As
an example, Simon identified satisficing (select
the first available option that meets minimal
standards) as a strategy c o m m o n l y used in complex decision situations.
As described by Howell & Dipboye ( 1986, pp.
390-391 ), "In the 19.70's, Simon's original argument was rediscovered and given additional impetus through a series of studies by K a h n e m a n
and Tversky. What they showed was, in essence,
that behavior often does not even approximate
normatively optimal rules. Rather, people seem
to rely on handy rules of t h u m b or 'heuristics'."
Therefore, the presence of biases was used to
infer the existence of heuristics.
By connecting heuristics to biases, Kahneman
& Tversky took a different approach than Simon.
Several authors have c o m m e n t e d on the uncer-

<-----Page 9----->174

JAMESSHANTEAU

tainty of this connection: "Reification of biases is
logically strange. If the normative model is cognitively invalid, deviations from that model cannot have cognitive significance" (Anderson,
1987, p. 1). Anderson continues
UThestudy of heuristics, as observed by Kahneman and
Tversk'y(1982), was characterized by the study of errors.
But errors of judgment, being definable only relative to
some normative standard of correctness, cannot provide
an adequate basis for cognitive theory. The study of
heuristics, for the same reason, cannot provide an
adequate base for cognitive theory" (p. 17).
A similar argument was offered by Jungermann
(1983).
The p r o b l e m is that w h e n a bias ( e r r o r ) exists,
it is difficult to establish a logical connection to
any particular heuristic. That is because many
heuristics m a y lead to the same bias. Consider
the following "heuristic" explanations for ignoring base rates:
( 1 ) recency order effects may lead to underweighting of earlier information (base rates) and
overweighting of later information (case
specific);
( 2 ) subjects may misunderstand the instructions or be confused by the w o r d p r o b l e m and so
rely on the easier-to-understand case-specific information;
( 3 ) the base-rate information lacks salience
for the subject and is ignored in favor of the
m o r e relevant case-specific information; and
( 4 ) m e m o r y factors may lead to forgetting or
overlooking base rates and so leave only case
specific material available.
Only one of these explanations (identified
b e l o w ) corresponds to the representativeness
heuristic used by Tversky & Kahneman to account for base-rate effects. But what is w r o n g
with the others? The p r o b l e m is that heuristics
are offered p o s t h o c as an explanation of biases
(Schwartz & G ~ ,
1986). Representativeness
may, or may not, provide the best account of the
observed effect. Without further evidence, there
is no way to know.
Although the c o n c e p t of judgmental heuristics seems compelling, the connection b e t w e e n
representativeness ( o r other heuristics) and

specific errors has yet to be firmly established.
Therefore, the status of judgmental heuristics is
problematic.
(In the base-rate example above, explanation
1 reflects order or serial-position effects, explanation 2 represents instruction or context effects, explanation 3 corresponds to representativeness and explanation 4 is based on m e m o r y
or availability factors. Potentially, each could be
used to explain w h y subjects might ignore base
rates.)

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Although making predictions about the future
is presumptuous, if not foolish, I believe that
judgment and decision research generally and
auditing research specifically needs to m o v e in
several directions.
( 1 ) There is a need for m o r e and better experiments on decision processes, as opposed to
demonstrations of heuristics (Wallsten, 1983).
Ideally, these experiments will be theory driven
and based on quantitative concepts and models.
( 2 ) The goal should be to understand, not just
describe, judgment and decision processes
(Jungermann, 1983). Heuristics often provide
interesting behavior descriptions, but so far have
shed little understanding on the underlying
psychological processes..
( 3 ) This increased understanding should be
applied to improving decision-making through
training or decision aids. Without an adequate
understanding of underlying decision processes,
efforts orientated towards debiasing will continue to be unrewarding (Wright, 1984).
( 4 ) Unless m o r e convincing evidence is offered, there does not appear to be m u c h future
for the heuristics and biases approach in behavioral auditing research. Instead, the emphasis
should be on research which addresses the unique concerns of accountants and auditors.

FINAL COMMENTS
Let me conclude with several comments. It is
important to acknowledge the many contribu-
