Picking Business Partners

THE FIRST
COMMANDMENT
Limit the number of primary
participants to people who
can consciously agree upon
and contribute directly to
that which the enterprise is
to accomplish, for whom, and
by when.
There are many reasons people become involved in
young, growing companies as owners, investors, or
key employees. The broad range of satisfactions
sought runs from an opportunity for personal
expression on one end of the spectrum to capital gains
on the other. Unless there is compatibility between
what the primary participants want out of the
business, debilitating conflict is likely to ensue. The
process of trying to reach conscious agreement on
the purpose of the enterprise is often difficult and
revealing.

The primary participants in a young enterprise are
those people who share the initial ownership and/or management decision-making processes. The early months
and years in the life of a company are critical ones in
which the tone and shape of the venture are determined.
If the character formed during the early days is convoluted by too much compromise or scarred by too much
acrimonious debate, the foundation upon which the business is to be built will be less sturdy than it could and,
ideally, should be.
Here is a list of six common mistakes that would-be
entrepreneurs often make in piecing together participants at the start of a new venture:
•
•
•
•
•

•

The founding group is formed spontaneously.
Personal or family lawyers, insurance agents, CPAs,
and bankers are automatically used as advisers.
Harmony is sought at the expense of creative conflict.
Needed support people are given stock or stock options
before the people have validated their long-term value.
The board of directors consists solely or primarily of
insiders—company officers, their spouses, and friends
or relatives.
People with widely varying motives are mixed together
in the same financial lifeboat.

Let’s consider these six common mistakes in a bit
more depth.
The founding group is formed spontaneously.
It happens in real life and in novels. Visualize a buzzing
weekend cocktail party or an animated, after-work conversation in a car or café. Out of the blue a new product
or service or distribution idea materializes and takes
shape. It’s a euphoric moment, and the two, three, or
more souls present are each caught up in the conception. Too often, they are also included willy-nilly as investors or key employees in the new venture.

This spontaneous combination of souls may be just
what the venture needs; then again, it may not be. Experience suggests it is best if the choice of investors (if
any) and staff flow from a thorough understanding of
the requirements for success for the prospective business. Essentially random collections of folks seldom make
the right bedfellows for business building even if they
are coworkers, classmates, or professional cousins.
How does an entrepreneur go about exploring an idea
and triggering enthusiasm and interest, while at the
same time reaching the ideal of limiting the number of
primary participants to those who can consciously agree
upon and contribute directly to that which the enterprise is to accomplish? The answer is: Cautiously. The
proper mindset is one that says that the eventual blueprint for building the business—the Business Plan—will
dictate the desired specifications for investors and staff
alike (see Commandment Four). If a small, qualified
group can be organized to create the blueprint with a
clear understanding from the start that everyone may
not be on the actual construction team if construction is
started, then the spontaneity risk is at least addressed.
Here is an illustration of how Commandment One
was violated via an incompatibility of interests in the
founding group.
CASE A. A bright, energetic high school dropout conceived
a new athletic shoe for the jogger market. He sold his uncle,
an accountant, on the concept. Together they raised close
to $100,000 from individual outside investors, mostly friends
who were avid joggers.
The $100,000 represented essentially all the capital put
into the company. The shoe was introduced to the local
market and sold very well. The company became a regional
success story. The outside investors wanted to keep the earnings in the business and expand it. The founder/president
wanted to play with new shoe designs, do research and de(case continued on next page)

velopment, and give speeches on entrepreneurship at luncheon-club meetings. The uncle/general manager was happy
taking home $50,000 a year (his salary), and he didn't want
to travel very far to build the business. The company quickly
stagnated and eventually faltered. No one won. The founder
lost his hero status; the uncle, his interesting job; the investors, their money. Each participant had his or her eye on a
different star: ...that which the enterprise was to accomplish,
for whom.

Common mistake number two has to do with guidance on administrative matters.
Personal or family lawyers, insurance agents,
CPAs, and bankers are automatically used as advisers. Growth companies don’t just happen. There is a
lot of administrative expertise needed to glue the pieces
together and keep the enterprise on a peaceful course
among the snags and shoals of government requirements
and the law. Any average attorney, CPA, or insurance
agent can speak the language, give you advice, mail you
something to sign, and send a bill. Not many have the
professional interest and proven experience to help you
build a business. It’s a relatively narrow spectrum of
practice. An entrepreneur has enough to do without investing time and money to educate his or her advisers.
In any metropolitan area there are CPAs, attorneys,
and insurance people who have developed or are developing a reputation with embryonic companies. Seek them
out. Interview them. Discuss fees. Check their references.
Then select who you want and listen to what he or she
has to say. Your job as a modern entrepreneur is not to
have all the answers, but to know where to get them. Of
course it helps to know what questions to ask, too. This
book offers a condensation of the experiences of others,
to help you ask (and get answers to) solid questions.

How about bankers? In general, most of them do not
have particular, in-depth expertise in business building.
However, with the march of deregulation, some are
learning out of necessity. Good bankers know about
money, particularly debt money. And in Commandment
Eight you will be advised to cultivate all your potential
money sources on a continuing basis. So developing a
working relationship with a reputable banker is a smart
thing to do. But don’t confuse doing so with developing a
workable financial plan for your new enterprise. For a
comprehensive financial plan you may need assistance
from one or more people skilled in corporate finance—
particularly start-up and small business financing. For
example, investment bankers, venture capitalists, and
occasionally business school professors of finance or
accounting may be helpful. Someone who has worked
with numbers and lived through a start-up or two in the
same or nearly the same industry as your own is probably
the best single source of guidance.
Harmony is sought at the expense of creative
conflict. Entrepreneurs by nature tend to listen most
attentively to themselves, but this surely restricts the
input they receive. Business builders are wise to regularly seek counsel from others, including people who may
well raise contrarian points of view. With these people
participating, meetings can become downright uncomfortable. But managed well, such sessions can also be
quite productive. Friction produces heat and, ideally,
light. There are many experiments that show that groups
made up of people with complementary skills usually
produce more valuable solutions to problems than experts working alone.
The primary participants in a new enterprise need
to provide balanced, qualified input to the decision-making process. Harmony is not the measuring stick.

CASE B. A group of three prominent, academic scientists
spotted a major opportunity in the emerging bio-medical
industry. Technically it was within their combined spheres
of expertise. They mulled over the opportunity for nearly a
year and then latched onto a young MBA student with no
bio-med experience. The student was seeking a field project
for one of her classes. With the scientists guideance the MBA
developed an elaborate business plan with computer generated projections covering every conceivable scenario. The
four people got along well together in both business and
social settings. The projections looked good. Four months
later seed financing was obtained from an overseas venture
capital firm and the MBA was hired as the general manager
of the newly formed company. Everyone was giddy.

Now ask yourself: How reliable are the projections
and the business plan developed for the scientists by a
busy student in need of a job after graduation? How well
qualified is the new general manager to build a competitive, bio-med company? What is the probability of
business success for this cozy quartet? How could a modicum of creative conflict been woven into the formative
period of this potential growth company?
Needed support people are given stock options
before the people have validated their long-term
value. Cash is almost always tight in the early days of
a new enterprise. Among other things, cash is needed to
attract and hire key employees—experienced people who
can boost performance quickly. Often such people are
relatively expensive to hire, compared to rookies. A practical question then arises: How can you entice desired
people aboard with a minimum salary outlay? Often the
answer is to grant them company stock options in lieu
of part of their salaries. In general, this is a bad answer.
Here are four reasons why:

<-----Page 6----->The First Commandment

1. Some options will end up in the hands of people
you later have to release. Such people can become disagreeable shareholders. 2. Certain option holders may
be people who professional investors consider unacceptable equity partners. This could make it difficult for you
to raise needed outside money for your company. 3. Options may be converted to shares that could be offered to
back to the company via a repurchase option at a point
in time when the company can least afford to buy shares.
4. Employees with options can become shareholders who
end up working for a competitor, which could create some
difficulties for you and your enterprise.
Does this mean you should never use stock options
for key support people involved in a start-up? The best
answer is a qualified yes. Restrict the ownership risks
and potential rewards to just the primary participants
who, by definition, are making a unique, direct contribution. Then, once your enterprise has graduated into
positive cash flow and reached a point of relative stability, consider options for secondary company builders only
after giving the matter deep, detailed, long-term thought.
Options can rise and fall in value. In addition, they can
distort the true, balance-sheet value of enterprise. Options are a form of compensation. Handle with care.
CASE C. A young entrepreneur had an idea: Build a bungeejump tower at a ski area so skiers could add to their winter
fun. He sold the idea and forty percent of the new company
to an investor who put up the money to build the tower. He
also sold a significant amount of stock at the founder’s price
to a buddy who agreed to help operate the tower. Two years
later, bungee sales were good but below projections. The
investor wanted his money back and the buddy wanted to
leave the snow country for good. The entrepreneur now had
two unhappy shareholders who, together, owned over half
of “his” company, and he was short on cash to buy either
one of them out. He had a problem. The business died.

The board of directors consists solely or primarily of insiders—company officers, their
spouses, and friends or relatives. Legal questions
aside, the operating purpose of a board is to aid, challenge, and replace, as necessary, the chief executive officer (CEO) in the service of the stockholders’ interests.
Those interests usually revolve around the financial
health of the enterprise, so a board ideally concentrates
on helping the CEO optimize the financial performance
of the company over some finite period of time. If the
CEO/entrepreneur is open to seasoned advice (via creative conflict), he or she is unlikely to get it—at least
anything very unsettling—from insiders, spouses,
friends, or relatives. A properly constituted board can
inexpensively double the width of a young companymanagement’s point of view. One or two directors with
relevant experience can be equivalent to another key
person on the payroll. A strong board can be the single
best source of right questions as the enterprise learns
first to stand, and then to walk...and run.
People with widely varying motives are mixed
together in the same financial lifeboat. A huge
spectrum of people participate in small, growing
companies. Some of them are seeking long-term capital
gains; they understand that stock ownership is a prime
way to build one’s own net worth. Other people are happy
with a comfortable annual income. Still others are
interested in technical challenge and its tributaries,
including problem solving and personal expression.
Other people relish the prospect of fame. A smart
entrepreneur will illuminate the driving force in each of
his or her potential colleagues and think hard about
whether there is compatibility across the members of
the basic team.
It is completely honorable for a group of talented
people to join together to build a company with the in-

<-----Page 8----->The First Commandment

tention to give each participant a chance to do his or her
own thing and, incidentally, make a buck in the process.
Problems arise, however, if responsible outside investors are brought into the very same company under the
false pretense that management intends to vigorously
grow the enterprise and make everyone, including the
investors, rich in a certain number of years.
In summary, Commandment One is important because a new company is fragile. It needs a well-developed internal system of supports and braces to withstand
the pressures of entering and competing successfully in
a marketplace. Appropriate supports and braces can be
conceived and squeezed into place by dedicated people
with qualifications especially suited to the configuration
of the particular enterprise. An entrepreneur faces the
task of gathering just the right number of right people.
Too few result in weakness; too many create chaos; and
a collection of wrong ones can produce debilitating, and
perhaps fatal, dissension. Probably as many potential
growth companies fail because of internal weaknesses
as they do due to wounds inflicted by competitors.
