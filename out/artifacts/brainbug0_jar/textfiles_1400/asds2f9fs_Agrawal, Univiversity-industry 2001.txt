University-to-industry
knowledge transfer:
literature review and
unanswered questions
Ajay Agrawal1
This paper reviews the economic literature concerning university-to-industry knowledge
transfer. Papers on this topic are divided into four categories. Research in the `firm
characteristics' category focuses directly on company issues, such as internal organization,
resource allocation, and partnerships. In contrast, research in the `university characteristics'
stream pays little attention to the firms that commercialize inventions, but rather focuses on
issues relating to the university, such as licensing strategies, incentives for professors to
patent, and policies such as taking equity in return for intellectual property. The `geography
in terms of localized spillovers' stream of research considers the spatial relationship between
firms and universities relative to performance in terms of knowledge transfer success. Finally,
the `channels of knowledge transfer' literature examines the relative importance of various
transfer pathways between universities and firms, such as publications, patents, and
consulting. Each of these research streams is discussed and key papers are described
highlighting important methodologies and results. Finally, an outline of topics requiring
further research in each of the four categories is offered.

This essay provides a review and commentary
on the literature concerning university
knowledge transfer. The economic importance
of this issue provides significant motivation
for deepening our understanding of the
knowledge transfer system. It is well understood that the creation and application of new
knowledge is the primary factor that drives
economic growth. It is also commonly

International Journal of Management Reviews Volume 3 Issue 4 pp. 285–302

accepted that universities are an important
source of new knowledge, especially in the
areas of science and technology. Thus, it is
important to build as clear a picture as possible of the mechanisms by which university
science moves into the economy.
Evidence suggests that even knowledge
transferred through the formal university
technology transfer channel, patenting, which
many scholars argue represents only a small
fraction of the total economically valuable

transfer from universities, is quite significant.
For example, the Association of University
Technology Managers (AUTM) estimates that
the licensing of innovations made at academic
institutions contributed over US$40bn in
economic activity and supported more than
270,000 jobs in the fiscal year 1999.2
Perhaps the two most active areas of
university knowledge transfer are the life
sciences and electronics, including electrical
engineering and computer science. Examples
of notable successes in these two areas include
the innovation by Stanley Cohen (Genetics
and Medicine, Stanford) and Herbert Boyer
(Biology, UC San Francisco) for the process
of making recombinant DNA using genesplicing, and the innovation by Tom Leighton
(Electrical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, MIT) and his colleagues of a set of
algorithms for intelligently routing and
replicating content over a large network of
distributed servers without relying on
centralized servers.
The Cohen-Boyer invention is often
referred to as the cornerstone of the biotechnology industry; at the time of its expiration on 12 December 1997, the patent was
being licensed by 380 firms and, during its 15year lifetime, attracted a total of approximately 480 licensees. Professor Leighton’s
innovation led to the founding of Akamai Inc.,
which launched its first commercial service in
April 1999 and achieved a remarkable market
capitalization of US$35bn by December of the
same year.3 Owing to its significant economic
impact, both primary and secondary, it is clear
that university knowledge transfer warrants
much effort towards a deeper understanding.
The objective of this paper is to construct a
general framework of the research in this area
by: (1) providing an overview of the various
related streams of research and how they fit
together; (2) presenting a survey of the
literature associated with each of these
streams, including highlights from key papers;
and (3) offering a view forward in terms of
directions for future research. The framework
presented here categorizes the research on this

topic into four categories: firm characteristics;
university characteristics; geography in terms
of localized knowledge spillovers; and
channels of knowledge transfer.
The relationships between these streams of
research may be considered as follows.
Research in the firm characteristics category
focuses on issues relating to the firm, such as
internal organization, resource allocation, and
partnerships. In contrast, research in the
university characteristics stream pays little
attention to the firms that commercialize
inventions, but rather focuses on issues
relating to the university, such as licensing
strategies, incentives to patent, and policies
regarding taking equity in return for
intellectual property. The geography in terms
of localized spillovers stream of research
considers the spatial relationship between
firms and universities relative to performance
in terms of knowledge transfer success.
Finally, the channels of knowledge transfer
literature examines the relative importance of
various transfer pathways between universities
and firms, such as publications, patents, and
consulting. Each of these research streams is
discussed below and key papers are described
highlighting important methodologies and
results.

Firm Characteristics
There is a small but growing literature
concerning the characteristics of the firm that
influence its ability to utilize externally
generated scientific knowledge, such as that
which is transferred from universities. This
branch of research originates from a pair of
papers by Cohen and Levinthal (1989, 1990)
that introduce the concept of ‘absorptive
capacity’ 4 and argue that a firm’s ability to
apply university research for its own commercial gain is a function of its investment in
R&D. Cockburn and Henderson (1998) build
on this notion but add that the degree to which
firms are ‘‘connected’’ to universities is also
important for utilizing knowledge spillovers.
Lim (2000) restructures the above two

<-----Page 2----->concepts and argues that the absorptive
capacity of firms is primarily a function of
its connectedness, of which its investment in
R&D is just one of several components.
Zucker et al. (2000) investigate the
importance of connectedness to firms by
examining their location decisions relative to
star university scientists. Shane and Stuart
(2000) study university start-up firms and
examine the importance of connectedness, not
with the scientific community in this case, but
rather with the venture capital community.
Ziedonis (1999) does not consider connectedness, but rather examines the firm’s related
knowledge assets and its ability to evaluate
external technology in terms of its likelihood
of licensing a particular technology and its
likelihood of taking an option prior to
licensing. Finally, Audretsch’s (2000) study
is not at the level of the firm but rather of the
individual as he investigates the extent to
which university entrepreneurs are systematically different from other entrepreneurs.
These papers are now described.
Cohen and Levinthal introduce and develop
the concept of absorptive capacity and argue
that this characteristic of the firm is strongly
related to its prior related knowledge
generated by in-house R&D. The authors
present a model in which a firm’s absorptive
capacity is a function of its investment in
R&D. They apply this model to test predictions relating a firm’s investment in R&D
to the knowledge underlying technical change
within an industry.
The authors utilize a cross-sectional data set
constructed from a survey of R&D lab
managers in the American manufacturing
sector. They regress R&D intensity, measured
by the R&D-to-sales ratio, on various
measures of technological opportunity and
appropriability. Technological opportunity is
measured by the importance of 11 basic and
applied fields of science and the importance of
external sources of knowledge to technical
progress in a line of business, as indicated by
respondents on a seven-point Likert scale.
Appropriability is measured by the perceived

effectiveness of patents, secrecy, lead time,
moving quickly down the learning curve, and
complementary assets in protecting the
competitive advantages of new processes and
products.
The authors report ordinary least squares
(OLS), generalized least squares (GLS), and
Tobit regression results that support their two
predictions. First, in the case of technological
opportunity, the estimated coefficients for the
impact of the applied sciences on R&D
intensity are generally lower than those for
the basic sciences, since the basic sciences are
more relevant (of higher quality) and this
knowledge has a more positive effect on R&D
intensity. Secondly, the effect of increasing
appropriability on R&D intensity is shown to
be significantly greater in those industries in
which the applied sciences are more relevant
to innovation than the basic sciences. The
authors conclude that these results support
their hypothesis that R&D investments create
a capacity to assimilate and exploit new
knowledge.
Cockburn and Henderson argue that, while
investments in in-house R&D are necessary
for firms to develop their absorptive capacity
to utilize knowledge spillovers, this alone is
not enough. Firms must be connected to the
open science community by being actively
involved in sharing research results (publishing) and also engaged in research collaboration. They investigate the public–private
science interface, focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, using both qualitative and
quantitative measures. Their qualitative
studies include both case histories and interviews. The case histories examine 21 drugs
that two leading experts identified as having
had the most impact upon therapeutic practice
between 1965 and 1992. The authors reveal
that public sector research was important in
the development of 16, or 76%, of these drugs,
implying that absorptive capacity was
important in these cases. The authors also
interviewed research scientists and managers
from both the public and private sectors that
both confirmed the importance of absorptive

capacity in the classical sense, but also
identified three additional factors perceived
as being important for conducting leadingedge research within the firm. These include:
(1) recruiting the best people; (2) rewarding
researchers on the basis of their standing in the
public rank hierarchy; and (3) encouraging
them to be actively engaged with their public
sector counterparts.
The authors address two related questions
with their quantitative analyses concerning the
concepts of connectedness, the organization of
internal research, and research productivity.
The concept of connectedness is introduced to
express the degree to which the scientists at a
firm are connected to their counterparts
outside the boundary of the firm, including
in other firms, universities, and National
Institute of Health (NIH) research institutions,
amongst others. They measure connectedness
by the fraction of papers written by scientists
at the firm that are co-authored with scientists
outside the firm. They hand-code the
institutions associated with co-authors into
eight categories, the largest being ‘self’ (coauthors from the same firm), followed by
‘university’.
The organization of internal research is
measured on two dimensions. ‘Pro-pub’ is
the perception of scientists of the degree to
which their firm uses publication or individuals’ standing in the wider scientific
community as a basis for promotion and
compensation, and is measured on a five-point
Likert scale. ‘Dictator’ is the perception of
scientists of the degree to which their
management allocates research resources
versus a peer-review committee system; this
is also measured on a five-point Likert scale.
Research productivity is measured by the
number of important patents that are generated
by the firm where important patents are defined as those patents that have been registered
in at least two of the largest economic regions,
including the US, Europe, and Japan.
Using the above approaches to operationalize the concepts of connectedness, internal
organization, and research productivity, the

authors first investigate the effect of firms’
internal organization of research on the type of
institutions with which they are likely to coauthor. They regress the type of co-author on
pro-pub and dictator, including a variety of
control variables, using logit regression
models. Their results suggest that pro-pub is
positively associated with the probability of
co-authoring with external institutions,
especially universities. In contrast, dictator is
negatively associated with the probability of
co-authoring with external institutions.
The authors also investigate the relationship
between connectedness and research productivity. They regress the natural logarithm
of the number of important patents produced
by a firm on the degree of connectedness, propub, dictator, and a number of control
variables, using OLS regression models. Their
results indicate a positive relationship between
connectedness and research productivity,
which is arguably the most interesting finding
reported in this paper. Their results also
suggest that pro-pub is positively correlated
with productivity, while dictator is negatively
correlated.
Lim picks up from Cockburn and Henderson and argues that not only is connectedness
important but that it is in fact the main
ingredient for creating absorptive capacity.
Internal R&D is but one mechanism to foster
connectedness and it in turn generates
absorptive capacity. The author identifies
three additional mechanisms for fostering
connectedness, including: (1) cultivating
university relationships by way of sponsoring
research, collaborating with faculty, and
recruiting graduate students; (2) participating
in research consortia; and (3) partnering with
other companies that do related scientific
research. The key issue investigated in this
paper is whether firms are able to acquire and
exploit externally generated scientific
knowledge without conducting in-house
R&D, but instead by being connected to the
scientific community in other ways.
To study this issue, Lim conducts both
quantitative and qualitative analyses of copper

<-----Page 4----->interconnect technology that was discovered
by IBM but quickly diffused to some, but not
all, firms in the semiconductor industry. The
author measures R&D by patent and
publication counts and measures knowledge
flows by patent-to-patent and patent-to-paper
citation counts. With these measurement
techniques, the author offers evidence to
support a three-step logical argument. First,
some firms depended on knowledge spillovers
from IBM and other sources, and did not
develop copper interconnect technology from
their own R&D. The evidence presented to
support this is: (1) all commercial processes to
date use the damascene process developed by
IBM; and (2) a large fraction of patents in this
area belonging to firms other than IBM cite
IBM patents and IBM papers. Secondly,
firms’ prior R&D was insufficient to account
for absorptive capacity. The evidence
presented to support this is the lack of
publications and patents generated by many
of the firms competing with this technology.
Thirdly, the absorptive capacity of firms
depends on connectedness. The evidence
presented to support this is the variance in
the time it took for firms to adopt the copper
interconnect technology commercially. Firms
that were able to adopt it quickly were
connected in some way to IBM or other
institutions that were familiar with the
research on this topic but did not necessarily
conduct their own R&D.
Further, Lim suggests that different types of
absorptive capacity may exist within and
across firms. The type of absorptive capacity
depends on the mechanisms at work driving
the connectedness. The author differentiates
between disciplinary and domain-specific
knowledge, and suggests that internal R&D
may be best suited for generating absorptive
capacity suited to the former while other
methods are more suited to the latter.
Zucker et al. (2000) investigate the effect of
star university scientists, who either left
tenured positions to found firms or who
remained in the university but established
tight working relationships with their

colleagues in private industry, on the
performance of the firm. They investigate this
phenomenon in the context of the biotechnology industry using data from the
industry publication Bioscan. ‘Star’ scientists
were identified as those that had published 40
or more genetic sequence discoveries in
GenBank. The classification of the relationships between stars and firms is conducted by
examining the affiliation of the authors
associated with every article through 1989
reporting a gene-sequencing discovery written
by a star.
Stars are categorized as ‘affiliated’ with a
particular firm if they list that firm as their
home institution in the article. Stars are
categorized as ‘linked’ to a particular firm if
one or more of their co-authors of the article
are from that firm. The authors measure
productivity on a number of dimensions and
throughout the research and product
development life cycle, including the number
of patents granted, the number of products in
development, and the number of products on
the market. The primary result of this research
is that the number of scientists who are tied to
the firm, those that are either linked or
affiliated, have a positive and significant
effect on the productivity of the firm in all
three major stages of research and product
development.
Shane and Stuart examine the importance of
initial resource endowments on particular
major events in the growth of early-stage
technology companies. Specifically, they
investigate the importance of the founders’
social capital in terms of their personal relationships with the venture capital community.
The authors test for a relationship between the
degree of the founders’ social capital at the
birth the firm and whether the firm: (1) raised
venture capital financing; (2) experienced an
initial public offering; or (3) failed. The
authors conduct their experiment on a dataset
comprising the life histories of 134 technology
firms founded specifically to commercialize
inventions from MIT during the period 1980–
1996.

The authors employ event-history methods
to conduct their analysis. They carry out the
analysis in two parts: (1) a set of piecewise
constant models of the hazard of IPO and
mortality; and (2) a set of piecewise constant
models of the time until raising the first round
of venture funding. The results from this study
suggest that ventures with founders that have
direct or indirect relationships in the venture
capital community are more likely to receive
venture financing and are less likely to fail.
Also, firms that receive venture financing are,
in turn, more likely to experience an initial
public offering. Thus, the authors conclude
that initial resource endowments, at least in
terms of the social capital of its founders in the
context of the venture capital community, do
have significant influence on the likelihood of
two major events in the growth process of
young companies.
Ziedonis (1999) investigates two questions
related to the issue of firms licensing
technology from universities. First, he
examines the extent to which the firm’s
related knowledge assets affect the likelihood
that it will license a particular technology.
Secondly, he examines the degree to which
the firm’s ability to evaluate external technology determines the manner in which it
licenses, specifically whether the firm signs an
option agreement prior to licensing. He uses a
unique data set of 308 exclusively licensed
patents related to inventions from the University of California and 291 firms that signed
at least one secrecy agreement associated with
these inventions.
The author employs a nested multinomial
logit model as the econometric specification in
this analysis. His results suggest that the
following four characteristics of the firm’s
related knowledge assets increase the
likelihood of licensing a technology: (1) the
level of the firm’s expertise, which is
measured by the (log of the) citation-weighted
number of firm patents in the same primary
patent class as the patent under consideration;
(2) whether the firm sponsored research
leading to the licensed patent, which is

measured by a dummy variable; (3) whether
the firm previously licensed a patent in the
same class, which is measured by a dummy;
and (4) whether the university inventor has a
fiduciary or other executive relationship with
the firm, measured by a dummy. His results
also suggest that firms with the characteristics
described above will be less likely to take an
option prior to licensing. This is consistent
with theory since a higher level of related
technical knowledge reduces uncertainty,
resulting in a lower value of the option to
the firm.
Audretsch (2000) examines whether
entrepreneurs from university settings are
different than their counterparts from industry.
Specifically, the author suggests that
university entrepreneurship will occur at a
systematically later age for university
scientists because the incentive and reward
structures within the university system induce
scientists to invest in developing an external
scientific reputation by making research
public via publication.
The author tests this hypothesis using a
semiparametric hazard duration model to
estimate the following covariates: (1) the
cumulative citations of the scientist; (2) the
number of other scientists who started
biotechnology firms in the same geographic
region; (3) the number of new biotech firms in
the same geographic region; and (4) dummy
variables indicating the career trajectory of the
founders (university, industry, or mixed). The
author conducts this experiment on a dataset
of 101 founders associated with 52 biotechnology firms. His primary result suggests
that university entrepreneurs are generally
older and thus more scientifically experienced.
The author emphasizes the importance of this
finding in terms of policy implications given
the prevalence of government programs
specifically designed to foster and support
entrepreneurial efforts, especially in the area
of technology.
In terms of the applications for this work,
these papers collectively suggest frameworks
for contemplating firm strategies that may

<-----Page 6----->influence absorptive capacity. Companies may
experiment with various mechanisms (resource
allocations) to increase their absorptive
capacity such as modifying their patterns in:
(1) recruiting graduate students; (2) hiring
professors as consultants; (3) modifying
internal incentives to publish or patent; (4)
funding university research; (5) participating in
research consortia; (6) sending company
scientists to university labs as visiting
scientists; and (7) engaging in collaborative
research with university scientists that may
result in co-authored publications or patents.
Also, firms may experiment with metrics for
both evaluating their connectedness to the
greater research community, as well as
calculating their ROI from investment in inhouse research, including the intermediate step
of absorptive capacity, not just research output.
At a conceptual level, it is interesting to
note that the transfer of tacit knowledge, that
which is costly or impossible to codify, is at
the heart of the majority of this work.
Connectedness is only important because the
knowledge associated with an invention is not
completely transferred in the codified form of
patents or publications but rather requires
some form of interaction between the inventor
and the recipient firm. While there may be
gains possible from increased efficiencies in
transactions associated with codified knowledge, the focus on topics associated with tacit
knowledge transfer suggests that this is the
central issue, and it generates the majority of
the variance in terms of firms’ relative
abilities to utilize university inventions effectively. Thus, research that contributes to our
deeper understanding of tacit knowledge and
how it is transferred would offer a worthy
contribution to the work in this area.

University Characteristics
This stream of research focuses on university
policies regarding intellectual property (IP),
licensing strategies employed by university
technology licensing offices, and characteristics of the actual inventor-professors.

Most of the papers in this area refer in some
way to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, which
granted universities the right to license
inventions that result from federally funded
research. Economic scholars are interested in
the effect this act has had on university
policies concerning IP management and the
incentives of professors to commercialize
their research. In addition, there is considerable interest regarding whether the incentives
created by Bayh-Dole have shifted the average
type of research that is conducted at universities from basic to more applied science.
To this end, Henderson et al. (1998)
investigate the change in quality of university
patents since the act was passed. Thursby and
Thursby (2000) develop a model to examine
the extent to which the increase in university
licensing is due to a change in the nature of
research or just in the propensity to patent.
Feldman et al. (2000) investigate the recent
trend of universities that write licensing
agreements involving equity rather than
simply cash payments for the use of IP in an
effort further to align the interests of the
university with the firm. Jensen and Thursby
(1998) examine the degree to which university
inventions reported for licensing are at a very
early stage, thus requiring the co-operation of
the inventor by the licensee in order to
develop a product successfully. Finally, Di
Gregorio and Shane (2000) examine
performance across university licensing
offices and explore why some universities
generate more new companies to exploit their
intellectual property than others. Highlights
from these five papers are discussed below.
Henderson et al. (1998) investigate the
change in overall patent quality that accompanied the significant growth in university
patenting during the period 1965–1988. To
conduct this experiment, the authors use four
sets of patents: (1) all university US patents
granted between 1965 and mid-1992 (12,804
patents); (2) a 1% random sample of all US
patents over the same time period (19,535);
(3) all patents after 1974 that cited the
university patents (40,859 patents); and (4)

all patents after 1974 that cited the random
sample patents (42,147 patents).
The authors compare university patents
with a random sample of all patents along
two dimensions. First, they construct a
measure of patent ‘importance’ that involves
a count of the number of patents that cite a
particular patent. Secondly, they construct a
measure of patent ‘generality’, which is a
measure of the degree of concentration of
citing patents across patent classes. The
concept for the second measure is that patents
that are more general will be cited across a
greater variety of fields and hence the measure
will indicate less concentration.
Their data illustrate that, while university
patents used to be more highly cited and more
general than a random sample of all patents,
the difference has disappeared over time. This
implies that, over the period examined, the
rate of increase of important patents from
universities was much less than the overall
rate of increase in patenting. These results
suggest that, while the Bayh-Dole Act seems
to have successfully increased the propensity
to patent, it has not resulted in a shift in the
underlying rate of generation of commercially
important inventions at universities.
Thursby and Thursby (2000) investigate the
factors behind the rapid growth in university
patenting and licensing activity. The motivation
for this research is to determine whether the
source of this growth is due to an increased
willingness of professors to patent their
inventions without a shift in the type of research
itself or a much more fundamental change in
the type of research to be more commercially
oriented. The authors conduct this study by
developing an intermediate input model where
licensing is considered a three-step process, and
then using non-parametric programming techniques on survey data from 65 universities to
calculate the total factor productivity growth in
each state.
The authors supplement the productivity
analysis with survey data from firms that
license university inventions. Their results
suggest that the growth in licensing patented

university inventions is driven primarily by an
increase in professors’ propensity to patent (on
the supply side) and firms’ propensity to
outsource R&D by licensing (on the demand
side), rather than a shift in the average type of
research from more basic to applied.
Feldman et al. (2000) investigate the
variance across university technology licensing offices in the degree to which they write
licensing agreements involving equity, rather
than traditional cash in the form of royalty
payments, as a means for firms to pay for their
use of university intellectual property.
Specifically, the authors test the hypothesis
that universities that are more experienced and
successful at licensing are more likely to
employ equity in their contracts, as this is a
newer and more sophisticated means for
engaging licensees. They test this hypothesis
utilizing two data sources, including AUTM’s
annual survey and their own survey of 67
research universities.
The authors use Tobit models to estimate the
effects of a variety of explanatory and control
variables that are intended to measure the
effects of experience, performance, and
university characteristics on the fraction of
deals closed by the university involving equity.
They find three measures to have a positive and
significant effect. These include: (1) the age of
the technology transfer office measured in
years; (2) the cumulative total licensing
revenue; and (3) the average industrial research
support. They also find that being a ‘Carnegie I’
institution (highest category of federal research
support) has a negative effect on the fraction of
equity deals. Their results show that
experienced university technology transfer
offices are more likely to use equity in certain
situations because, although the use of equity is
more complex than cash, it may increase the
option value of some technologies and also
improve the alignment between the university’s
interests and those of the firm.
Jensen and Thursby (1998) investigate the
moral hazard problem associated with
university inventors and the transfer of their
inventions to industry. This research is

<-----Page 8----->motivated by the debate over the Bayh-Dole
Act and the associated royalty payments to
inventors that result from the university’s right
to license federally funded research output
under the Act. The authors utilize a dataset
generated from a survey of 62 US research
universities for which respondents were
university licensing officers.
The most striking finding from this survey
is that over 75% of the inventions licensed by
these universities were in a very early, or
embryonic, stage. That is, half of these
inventions were only a proof of concept and,
of the remaining half, over 50% were only a
lab-scale prototype. The authors report that
respondents believed 71% of the inventions
licensed required co-operation between the
professor and the licensing firm in order to
commercialize a product successfully. This
result underscores the importance of tacit
knowledge transfer associated with early-stage
inventions. The authors then present a
theoretical model to illustrate conditions under
which the development of an invention will
not occur unless the inventor’s income is
proportional to the licensee’s output by way of
royalties or equity.
Di Gregorio and Shane (2000) investigate
cross-university variation in new firm
formation rates over the period 1994–1998.
Specifically, they investigate the effects of: (1)
the availability of local venture capital
(number of local companies receiving funding
from venture capitalists in a given year); (2)
the commercial orientation of research (proportion of a university’s sponsored research
budget that was industry funded); (3) the
intellectual eminence of faculty (the Gourman
Report graduate school score); and (4) the
university policies regarding taking equity in
start-ups in lieu of royalty fees (minimum
percentage of total royalties). The authors
utilize survey data collected from university
licensing offices by AUTM and supplement
that with their own survey data of the same
universities to gather information regarding
their licensing policies. Their sample includes
101 universities and 530 start-ups.

The authors analyse the five-year period
using generalized estimating equations (an
extension of generalized linear models applied
to longitudinal data) with a count of the
number of new firms formed as the dependent
variable, the explanatory variables described
above, as well as several control variables.
The results the authors report suggest that the
two primary factors that have a positive effect
on the rate of new firm formation are the
intellectual eminence of professors and
licensing contract flexibility such that startups may offer equity rather than cash to the
university and inventors.
In terms of the applications for this work,
these papers collectively suggest policy
implications at both the university and federal
level. Perhaps the greatest of these issues, in
terms of impact on universities and firms, is
the one concerning policies that restrict the
commercialization of university research.
Related policies generally involve two types
of parameters: those that restrict by fiat the
degree to which intellectual property created
by university-employed professors may be
controlled for commercial purposes, and those
that create incentives (or disincentives) for
professors to engage in activities associated
with the commercialization of their research
by way of patenting, consulting, or otherwise.
A variety of related questions have been
explored both theoretically and empirically,
especially since the passage of Bayh-Dole.
This work also suggests policy implications
associated with the university sponsorship of
patent applications, given the findings that the
quality of university patents appears to have
decreased over time. The issue of universities
taking equity in young firms, rather than
licensing royalties, invokes a myriad policy
considerations and, at the time of writing this
paper, the practice is still too new to allow for
the empirical investigation of most related
questions. Finally, policies that appear to
influence the number of start-ups that
originate from a university have stimulated
great interest and inspired much interaction
across universities at the administrative level,

particularly noticeable amongst technology
licensing office directors. The rapid increase
in AUTM membership across universities, and
the association’s increased attention to startups, provides some evidence of this.
From a more general perspective, it is
interesting to note how the heavy focus on
patent-related knowledge transfer has shaped
this line of inquiry. This focus has resulted in
intense scrutiny of the effects of the BayhDole Act, related policies at individual
universities that influence the incentives for
professors to patent, and the consequent
behavior of professors in terms of their
research output. However, policies that affect
the vibrant trade in scientific knowledge for
commercial application that is not patented
and does not flow through the university
technology transfer office have been largely
overlooked.
This may in part be due to the absence of
policies, or at least policy enforcement, that
address non-patent channels of knowledge
transfer. In addition, value-added services
are increasingly being offered by private
sector organizations that indirectly compete
with university transfer offices. These include
services such as introductions to early-stage
financiers, business advice, and customer
contacts. Thus, some invention types such as
software, which often do not lend themselves
to patenting yet have direct commercial
relevance, are frequently developed outside
the radar of the technology transfer office.
Policies that do, or could, address this
phenomenon are potentially very important
and offer a wide array of interesting research
questions that would contribute greatly to this
area of inquiry.
One additional note for readers who are new
to this area concerns the asymmetry in
transaction styles between firms and universities. For example, readers may be surprised
at the simplicity of research questions
associated with university policies concerning
taking equity in return for intellectual property
rights. Universities are often far less experienced in deal making than their private sector

counterparts and are also subject to much
greater restrictions due to their objectives and
responsibilities that go well beyond profit
maximization. As a result, universities behave
quite differently from firms, even when they
are engaged in business transactions. Our
understanding of university–firm interactions
is less developed than traditional firm–firm
interactions and thus policy analysis concerning university-to-industry knowledge
transfer may not rely upon the usual firm–
firm interaction assumptions.

Geography in Terms of Localized
Knowledge Spillovers
A stream of literature has developed at the
intersection of the tacit knowledge concept in
the information literature and the localized
spillovers concept in the agglomeration
literature. ‘Tacit knowledge’ includes those
types of knowledge that are either impossible
or costly to codify. As a result, the transfer of
tacit knowledge generally requires direct
interaction: in person, by phone, or through
written correspondence. The literature in this
area examines the effects of the implicit
transaction costs associated with direct
interaction that often influence the spatial
relationships between the creator and recipient
of tacit knowledge.
The papers in this area generally measure
the variance in the levels of various
knowledge inputs and hypothesized associated
outputs and examine this relationship across
geographic space. The inputs and outputs
considered vary from study to study, as does
the geographic unit of analysis. Jaffe (1989)
relates the input ‘federal research funding’ to
the output ‘new patents issued’ and examines
the variance in this relationship across
geographic space at the state level. Jaffe et
al. (1993) relate the input ‘original patents’ to
the output ‘patents that cite the original
patents’ and examine the variance in this
relationship across geographic space at the
city level. Audretsch and Feldman (1996)
relate the input ‘local university research

<-----Page 10----->funding’ to the output ‘local industry valueadded’ and examine the variance in this
relationship across geographic space at the
state level.
Zucker et al. (1998) relate the input
‘number of local research stars’ to the output
‘number of new local biotech firms’ and
examine the variance in this relationship
across geographic space at the economic
region level. Branstetter (2000) relates the
input ‘scientific publications from the
University of California’ to the output ‘patents
that cite those papers’ and examines the
variance in this relationship across geographic
space at the state level. Agrawal (2000) relates
the input ‘hours of interaction with the MIT
professor associated with the patented
invention’ to the output ‘likelihood or degree
of success of commercializing the invention’
and examines the variance in this relationship
across geographic space in terms of distance
measured in miles. Key findings reported in
these papers are described briefly.
Jaffe (1989) was the first to examine
geographically mediated knowledge spillovers. The author modified the knowledge
production function approach introduced by
Griliches (1979) to account for spatial and
product dimensions. This conceptualization
changed the observation from the traditional
unit of the firm to the geographic level for an
industry. The author chose the state as the
geographical unit of analysis and patent
counts as the knowledge output metric.
Results from this study indicate that patents
occur in those states where public and private
knowledge-generating inputs are the greatest.
Even after controlling for industrial R&D, the
results indicated that the knowledge generated
at universities spilled over for higher realized
innovative output. The author also reports
results suggesting that university research
appears to increase industry R&D that in turn
increases the production of patents.
Jaffe et al. (1993) investigate the degree to
which knowledge spillovers are geographically
localized. They conduct this experiment by
examining patent citations of patents.

Specifically, they compare probabilities of
patents citing prior patents that are associated
with inventors from the same city with a
randomly drawn control sample of cited
patents. The authors report results suggesting
that the citations are significantly more
localized than the controls after adjusting for
organizational types, such as universities. These
results hold when the data are aggregated for
analysis at higher geographic levels.
Audretsch and Feldman (1996) test the
theory that innovative activity will cluster in
regions where knowledge spillovers are the
most prevalent. This would be consistent with
expectations in terms of the knowledge
production function. The authors calculate
Gini coefficients for the geographic concentration of innovative activity to test this
relationship. They report results that indicate
the relative economic importance of new
knowledge to the location and concentration
of industrial production. Even after controlling
for the geographic concentration of production, the results suggest a greater propensity
for innovative activity to cluster spatially in
industries in which industry R&D, university
research, and skilled labor are important
inputs.
Zucker et al. (2000) investigate the issue of
localized knowledge spillovers from universities to industry, focusing specifically on the
biotechnology industry. They conduct this
study by examining a dataset of 751 new
company or division formations over a 14year period from 1976 to 1989 and across 183
functional economic regions. Specifically, the
authors test the hypothesis that the entry of
firms into biotechnology will be determined
by the geographic distribution of research
stars. The authors define a research star as a
scientist that has discovered more than 40
genetic sequences as reported by GenBank.
The authors employ regressions on the
stock of biotechnology-using firms at the
beginning of 1990 by region, estimated in
the Poisson form (appropriate for count
variables with numerous zeroes). Their
reported results indicate that the number of

local stars and their collaborators is a strong
predictor of the geographic distribution of
biotech firms in 1990. Importantly, these
results persist when controls are added for
the number of top-quality universities in the
region and the number of faculty with federal
support in the region.
Branstetter also investigates the issue of
localized knowledge spillovers. The methodology the author employs involves analysing
patent citations to academic papers, which is
subtly different from most of the work of this
type, which uses patent citations to patents or
paper citations to papers. Specifically, the
author examines patent citations to academic
papers authored by scientists affiliated with
the campuses and laboratories of the
University of California system.
Poisson and negative binomial models are
used to estimate the effect of geographic
distance on the likelihood that a patent cites a
paper written at a particular location. The
results suggest that distance does matter, or at
least regions matter. While being in the same
state has a statistically significant impact on
the probability of a citation, linear distance
measured in miles does not. The results also
suggest that the temporal link between
academic science and patented innovation is
short. The modal lag in the raw data is only
two years, indicating that it is recent science
that is a driving force behind patenting.
Agrawal (2000) examines the importance of
geographic distance and direct interaction
between university inventors and company
scientists to the successful transfer and
commercialization of patented university
inventions. This study is motivated by the
hypothesis that geography matters because it
increases the transaction costs associated with
human interaction. Therefore, the geography
effect should disappear once controls for
interaction are introduced. The author runs
this experiment using a dataset containing 124
license agreements associated with inventions
from MIT. These data are augmented by
interviews with the associated inventors for
information regarding the amount of direct

interaction that occurred between the inventor
and scientists at the firm that licensed the
invention.
Using logistic and Tobit regression models,
the author reports results that support the
hypothesis that geographic distance, measured
in miles between MIT and the licensee, has a
negative effect on the commercial success of
the licensed invention. This effect becomes
statistically insignificant when a control for
direct scientific interaction, measured in
numbers of hours, is introduced. The
interaction explanatory variable does have a
positive effect on both the likelihood and
degree of commercial success.
In terms of applications for this work, these
papers collectively suggest a framework for
contemplating both policy and strategy in
terms of geography. Simply stated, the work
in this literature points to factors that influence
location decisions, from both private and
public perspectives. To what degree should
firms consider the location of universities that
are engaged in related research when they are
deciding where to locate their own R&D
facilities? To what extent should the
government consider the location of industry
clusters when they are deciding where to allocate university research funding? Knowledge
spillovers often have a significant tacit
component that remains geographically local,
since it requires direct interaction amongst
scientists and engineers. As a result, policy
decisions regarding the allocation of federal
research funds across geographic space may
have significant effects on local economies.
Perhaps the most interesting conceptual
issue that this literature raises is the variance
in ‘absorptive capacities’ at the regional level.
As discussed in the first section of this essay,
the concept of absorptive capacity is
traditionally considered at the firm level.
However, the evidence presented in this
stream of work directly implies that
localization of knowledge spillovers does
occur and indirectly implies that the degree
of localization varies across regions. Given
that knowledge localization is of central

<-----Page 12----->concern to government policy, especially in
terms of research funding at both the state and
federal level, the notion of regional absorptive
capacity should be of significant interest. The
work that has been done in this area is
preliminary, but sufficient to suggest many
fruitful directions for future research.

Channels of Knowledge Transfer
This stream of research explores characteristics of the various channels through which
knowledge is transferred from the university
to industry. The channels under consideration
in all of these studies include some subset of
publications, patents, consulting, informal
meetings, recruiting, licensing, joint ventures,
research contracts, and personal exchange.
Four of the five papers considered here
examine the relative importance of various
channels. Three of these emphasize the
relatively small role of patents and licenses
relative to other channels. This is, at least in
part, in response to the heavy focus on patents
as a technology-transfer mechanism due to the
accessibility of patent data that lends itself
well to quantitative analysis.
Cohen et al. (1998) and Cohen et al. (2000)
both examine the relative importance of the
complete set of transfer channels from the
perspective of the knowledge recipient, firms.
Agrawal and Henderson (2000) focus
particularly on the comparison between
patents and papers, but also examine the
relative importance of the complete set of
transfer channels from the perspective of the
knowledge creator, professors. Within the
context of licensed patented inventions,
Colyvas et al. (2000) examine the importance
of transfer channels that complement patent
licensing across different types of technologies. Finally, Shane (2000) investigates the
question of when it is best for a university to
license an invention back to the inventor by
considering the effectiveness of different
transfer channels subject to the nature of the
technology and its appropriability. These five
papers are briefly described below.

Cohen et al. (1998) examine the importance
of particular channels of knowledge transfer
from the university to industry as perceived by
industry. This component of the study
primarily draws upon a 1994 survey of 1478
US R&D lab managers in the manufacturing
sector. Respondents are requested to evaluate
the importance of different information
channels on a four-point Likert scale. The
channels include patents, publications, meetings or conferences, information channels,
hires, licenses, joint ventures, contract
research, consulting, and personal exchange.
The authors report the results in a tabular
format that lists the percentage of respondents
indicating that a given channel is at least
‘moderately important’. The results indicate
significant variance across channels in the
number of industries in which at least 50% of
respondents indicate that particular channel is
important. For example, while only one
industry (drugs) out of 34 rates patents
important at least half the time, 11 rate
publications important. Also, while some
channels are considered important by more
industries, the less frequently valued channels
are not necessarily subsets of the other. For
example, 11 industries value publications
while only two value contract research, but
one of those two is the steel industry, which
does not value publications (by at least half
the respondents). These results suggest that
some channels, such as publications, conferences, informal conversations, and consulting,
are considered more important overall for
knowledge transfer and also that different
industries value different channels differently.
Cohen et al. (2000) investigate the pathways
through which university research impacts
industrial R&D. This study utilizes the same
survey data that was used in Cohen et al.
(1998), described above. This paper emphasizes
the importance of publications, consulting, and
open meetings and conferences relative to the
licensing of patents and the recruiting of
students, which is somewhat contrary to the
conventional wisdom. Their data indicate that
the largest percentage of respondents rated

ß Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001

298

publications, conferences, and consulting as at
least ‘moderately important’ knowledge
transfer channels. These percentages are 41,
35, and 32%, respectively. The remaining
channels are rated at least moderately important
by a significantly smaller fraction of
respondents, less than 20%.
The authors note that the channels
considered important by the most respondents
are, with the exception of consulting, those
most commonly associated with open science.
The authors also investigate how the scores
for the different channels relate to each other.
They accomplish this by correlation analysis
of scores at the respondent level and factor
analyses at the respondent and industry levels.
The authors find significant correlation across
the scores for all channels, but the strongest
correlation (all above 0.58) are across the
channels they identify as most important,
including publications, conferences and
meetings, and informal information exchange.
Agrawal and Henderson examine the
importance of patents, relative to other channels,
as a mechanism of knowledge transfer from
universities to industry. This study is motivated
by the authors’ belief that the heavy use of
patents in empirical studies of university
technology transfer is disproportional to and
misrepresentative of the total knowledge
transfer from universities. They conduct this
study on a sample of 225 professors from the
Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Science departments at
MIT.
They report three sets of results. First, they
compare the number of patents with the
number of publications produced by these
professors over the period 1983–1999 and
discover that, although the number of patents
did increase significantly, it is still only a
small fraction (approximately 10%) of the
number of publications. Also, patenting is
concentrated amongst only a small percentage
of faculty. While more than 50% of the
sample publish at least one paper in any given
year and only 6% have never published, nearly
half of their sample have never patented at all.

To supplement this part of their study, the
authors interviewed a subset (68) of their
sample population who, on average, perceive
the patent channel to represent merely 7% of
the total knowledge transfer.
Secondly, by analysing patent and paper
collaborations as well as patent and paper
citations, the authors show that those firms
which take advantage of patented innovations
are often not those that take advantage of
published knowledge, suggesting that
different firms tend to use quite different
channels to access university knowledge. This
implies that a focus on patent citations or on
licensing behavior may offer only partial
insights as to the ways in which MIT interacts
with the private sector. Finally, the authors
find little evidence to suggest that patenting
distracts professors from publishing: faculties
that patent are no less likely than their
colleagues to publish, and their publications
are no less likely to be widely cited.
Colyvas et al. (2000) explore in significant
detail how particular university inventions
moved into practice. They accomplish this
by exploiting a unique and unusual data set
comprising 11 case studies of inventions from
Columbia and Stanford universities. These
cases were assembled from invention report
records and interviews with licensing officers
and licensee firms. The study is motivated by
the belief that the dramatic increase in
patenting (and knowledge transfer through
that channel), which is commonly attributed to
the passage of the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, was
actually caused by other factors, including the
maturing of important new areas and
techniques of university research such as
molecular biology, electronics, and software.
The Act merely amplified an increase in
university technology transfer that was
already occurring.
The authors argue that university inventions
vary from case to case and that there are a
number of factors that influence which out of
the set of transfer channels is most important
in any particular case. For example, while
direct interaction between inventors and

<-----Page 14----->company scientists is necessary for some
early-stage or embryonic inventions, others
that are most effectively transferred through
patent licensing do not require it. The latter
type was most common in the area of
biotechnology and pharmaceuticals. In this
paper, the authors provide preliminary
groundwork for the creation of a complex
taxonomy of university inventions and related
transfer channels.
Shane investigates the effects of licensing
university inventions back to the inventor
rather than to non-inventors. In particular, he
examines the conditions under which
inventors may be better suited than noninventors to develop and commercialize an
invention. This research is motivated by the
need to increase our understanding of the
variance in appropriability across invention
types and the effects of this variance on the
ability to advance early-stage university
inventions successfully. The author runs this
experiment using a dataset of 1397 patents
issued to MIT over the period 1980–1996. He
utilizes royalty, sponsorship, and invention
description data recorded by the MIT
Technology Licensing Office to supplement
this data.
The results support the author’s general
hypothesis that inventions that can be
effectively patented are more likely to be
licensed. Results also support the author’s less
obvious hypothesis that those that cannot be as
effectively patented are more likely to be
licensed to the inventor and, when this
happens, are more likely not to be terminated
and to be commercialized. In other words,
non-inventors more effectively commercialize
inventions when the inventions are appropriable through patents (implying noninventors are better managers, on average),
but the inventor best develops inventions that
are more difficult to appropriate. This result
has direct implications for the effectiveness of
various knowledge transfer channels, depending on the appropriability of the invention.
In terms of applications of this work, these
papers collectively suggest frameworks for

contemplating firm strategies associated with
leveraging public-sector research. While a
reasonably efficient market has been established for trade in patent-protected intellectual
property through university technology
licensing offices, transfer through the other
channels described is much less formal and
arguably much less efficient. As a result, firms
may benefit significantly by investing in the
types of relationships that are not necessary in
the presence of an efficient market. Such relationships may involve engaging in collaborative research projects, hiring professors as
consultants, sponsoring university lab
projects, and participating in research
consortia, amongst others.
As mentioned earlier, this literature
provides compelling evidence that non-patent
channels of knowledge transfer are economically important. Thus, there is a need for
further research that specifically examines the
nature of those transfer channels less studied.
In addition, many of the questions addressed
in the three research streams described above
must be re-examined from the perspective of
these channels. This will require a variety of
research techniques, since non-patent channels
do not leave a convenient paper trail that lends
itself to systematic, empirical analysis. Also,
even patent-related topics may require reexamination with alternative methodologies
so that this channel may be directly compared
with the others with similar types of data. In
cases where patent-channel knowledge
transfer is shown to be similar to other
channels, it may be reasonable to generalize
from patent data in order to offer empirical
insights into non-patent channel topics.

Future Research and Conclusions
It is clear from surveying the literature on this
topic that much has been learned about the
process of knowledge transfer from university
to industry. However, much work remains. In
this section, new research questions are
offered for each of the four categories
described above. These are, of course, not

intended to represent any form of an
exhaustive set, but rather provide a flavor for
the types of research that seem most fruitful
given past and current efforts. To this end, it is
important to point out that the author of this
essay purposefully included many examples of
very recent papers, some of which have not
yet been published, in order to provide a
snapshot of the current activity in this field, so
that this paper may prove a useful framework
for further work to build on.
The studies to date on firm characteristics
have inspired a focus on factors that influence
the firm’s absorptive capacity. All of these
studies have focused on a single industry, in
most cases biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, or
semiconductors. The field will greatly benefit
from future work that explores the degree to
which methods for building absorptive
capacity differ across industries, and also the
ways in which these methods differ. Also,
while there have been significant efforts to
investigate the mechanics of R&D investment
for generating connectedness, further study is
needed to understand the other methods for
building connectedness, such as university
links, research consortia, and industrial partnerships. Finally, variations in connectedness
across different political and cultural
environments remain to be explored.
Much of the work in the area of university
characteristics has focused on determining the
effects of the Bayh-Dole Act. While this is
certainly an interesting and important topic,
there are many others that have been largely
ignored. For example, we know very little
about the amount and type of technology
transfer that occurs outside the formal route of
the technology transfer office, but many
scholars have suggested that there is reason
to believe this could be quite significant. Also,
the field would very much benefit from more
detailed studies that investigate the variance in
licensing agreement terms across technologies
as well as across universities. While the equity
versus cash-only dichotomy is critical, there
are also great differences in other areas of
licensing contracts, such as the ‘use it or lose

it’ clause that defines development milestones.
Finally, given the importance of inventor
involvement suggested by several studies, it
seems clear that studies to understand better
the factors that influence the degree to which
professors become involved with the
commercialization of their inventions would
make a valuable contribution.
In recent years, it seems as though research
on geography in terms of localized knowledge
spillovers has attracted the most amount of
public attention. This is most likely to be due to
the direct policy implications of this work.
Further research in this area will certainly
include studies of the ‘Internet effect’ and the
degree to which this weakens the geography
effect due to reductions in transaction costs
associated with some forms of communication.
In addition, given the trend towards greater
globalization, studies of border effects on
spatial relationships and knowledge spillovers
will be in great demand. Finally, although the
current literature has collectively presented a
very strong case in support of significant
localization effects associated with knowledge
spillovers, there remain exceptions. That is,
there are notable examples in particular
industries and particular geographies, where
knowledge spillovers appear to defy the
otherwise ubiquitous forces of localization.
These exceptions demand further investigation.
Issues concerning knowledge transfer
channels may at one time be both the most
and least well studied. The existence of patent
and publication archival data in conjunction
with the associated citation data offers an
unparalleled research tool for objective,
quantitative analysis in the area of scientific
and technological development. However,
while patents and papers are certainly
important, such heavy use of these data as
has occurred in this field comes at the expense
of investigations into other forms of
communication of scientific progress and has
resulted in a severe lack of variety of research
questions. To this end, basic research into the
mechanics and characteristics of other
channels, such as faculty consulting and the

<-----Page 16----->recruiting of graduate students, would make
tremendous contributions to this area of
inquiry. It is also important to develop a
better understanding of complementarities
across channels as well as non-channel
complementarities, such as has been suggested
about venture capital in the case of knowledge
transfer in industries populated with young
firms. Finally, research on the different uses of
different channels across countries, owing to
variations in intellectual property rules,
university policies, and culture, amongst other
factors, would offer an interesting and
important contribution to this field.
To conclude, we have learned from the work
in this field that there are differences in the
degree to which firms are capable of effectively
utilizing university research to their benefit and
that these differences vary systematically with
the degree to which firms are connected to the
university. However, we have only begun to
investigate the various mechanisms by which
firms are connected and the relative benefits
associated with each mechanism. We have
learned that variations in certain university
intellectual property policies are related to the
degree of production and licensing of patents.
However, the field has yet to address the many
potential university policy issues that arise from
non-patent-related technology transfer, which
may be substantially more important from an
economic perspective.
We have learned that, despite the openscience culture that is prevalent in the
university environment and that results in the
regular publication and patenting of ideas that
are equally available across all geographic
space throughout most of the developed
world, the commercialization of university
inventions remains somewhat localized to the
region of invention. However, much work
remains to explain the persistence of ‘super’
high-technology regions such as Silicon
Valley and Route 128, and why all cities with
significant research universities do not enjoy
substantial hi-tech economies. Finally, we
have learned that university knowledge may
be transferred to industry through a variety of

channels and that the patent-related channel is
less important than commonly believed.
However, the field has only scratched the
surface by identifying that the other channels
are indeed perceived to be important by both
firms and professors, while virtually no
scholarly research has directly investigated
the characteristics of the non-patent channels.
Overall, it is the intention of this essay to
illustrate that the economic importance
coupled with the complex nature of this topic
combine to offer a wide range of interesting
questions and demand a multiplicity of
research methodologies.

1 Support for this research from the Center for
Knowledge-Based Enterprises at Queen’s University is gratefully acknowledged.
2 These statistics were generated from the AUTM
Licensing Survey: FY 1999. Respondents included
190 US and Canadian universities, teaching
hospitals, and research institutes.
3 It is important to note that the firm’s market
capitalization had reduced to approximately
$2.5bn at the time of writing this paper (16
February 2001). This dramatic devaluation is
reasonably consistent with other firms in this
sector, following the March 2000 market correction.
4 The concept of ‘absorptive capacity’ is prevalent
throughout the knowledge transfer literature. This
refers to a firm’s ability to recognize, assimilate,
and apply new scientific information for its
innovation and new product development.
