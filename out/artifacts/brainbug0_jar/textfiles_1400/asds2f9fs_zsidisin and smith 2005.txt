Many practitioners and academicians tout concurrent
engineering (Sobek, Ward and Liker 1999; Koufteros,
Vonderembse and Doll 2001, 2002; Gerwin and
Barrowman 2002) and three-dimensional concurrent
engineering (3DCE) (Fine 1998, 2000; Varley 1999;
Balasubramanian 2001) as essential tools for new product
development success. As a result, proactive purchasing
organizations increasingly view coordination with critical
suppliers in early supplier involvement (ESI) as important
enablers to product, process and supply chain structure
development (Wynstra, VanWeele and Weggemann 2001;
Millson and Wilemon 2002). ESI is a form of collaboration
in which purchasing firms involve suppliers at an early
stage in the life cycle of a product, generally at the time of
product concept or design (Bidault, Despres and Butler
1998; LaBahn 2000). However, adopting ESI practices may
offer organizations additional benefits as well, potentially
including the management of supply risk in new product
development and the upstream supply chain.

While there have been numerous reports of benefits
associated with adoption of early supplier involvement (ESI) in product design, particularly in reducing the duration of the design process and

research explores the extent to
which ESI reduces the likelihood

of supply disruptions and other negative supply
events for an aerospace supplier. Although initial
adoption of ESI was intended to reduce supply costs,
results indicated that ESI serves to reduce perceptions
of supply risk at this firm. Factors associated with risk
reductions are discussed in the context of agency
theoretic variables, and a series of research propositions are presented to build theory in supply risk
management.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of ESI
in managing supply risk. The linkage of ESI and supply
risk management is investigated by conducting an
in-depth case study for theory development (Eisenhardt
1989b). For purposes of this paper, supply risk is defined as
the potential occurrence of events associated with
inbound supply that can have significant detrimental
effects for the purchasing firm (Zsidisin 2003). First, ESI is
introduced along with explication of the positive and
negative aspects that have been attributed to its use. Next,
agency theory is introduced as a basis for investigating
how ESI can benefit a firm’s supply chains by enabling
more effective management of various facets of risk.
Given ESI is rooted in the interface between a purchasing
organization and critical supplier(s), and thus presents
relationships in which one organization (the supplier,
viewed as an agent in this context) is working to meet
needs of another (the buyer, viewed as the principal in
this context), agency theory offers a useful conceptual
foundation on which to build the paper. A comprehensive

<-----Page 1----->Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions

case study was the key vehicle to investigate the role of ESI
in supply chain performance. The selected firm had a
history of success in using ESI as an integral part of supply
chain strategy. The organization of the paper includes the
presentation of the case study research method, discussion of findings, followed by propositions grounded in
agency theory. The propositions offer suggestions for
further study into how firms can reduce the risk inherent
in new product development processes. The final section
includes conclusions and managerial implications.

the more notable drawbacks of ESI include increasing
product and development costs (Birou and Fawcett 1994;
Wynstra et al. 2001); improper sequencing of tasks
(Laseter and Ramdas 2002); mismatching resources and
requirements by implementing levels of supplier involvement inappropriate to the situation at hand (Bidault
et al. 1998; Laseter and Ramdas 2002); failing to anticipate
and effectively address significant organizational resistance (Wynstra et al. 2001) and selecting incapable
suppliers (Wynstra et al. 2001). These benefits and
drawbacks are summarized in Table I.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Recent attention has been directed toward additional
benefits of ESI associated with the risk of product and
supplier failures. More specifically, these failures may
include quality problems, supplier insolvency and product introduction delays. The risk of product failures in
new product development can be manifested in terms of
excessive costs (Balasubramanian 2001), quality problems
(Koufteros et al. 2002) and extended product design leadtimes (Droge, Jayaram and Vickery 2000). On the other
hand, firms can engage in ESI to reduce the risk of supplier
failures, such as those with low levels of technological
sophistication (Wasti and Liker 1997; LaBahn 2000) and
supplier leadership problems (Ragatz, Handfield and
Scannell 1997). Principles of agency theory are appropriate for investigating interorganizational relationships,
and can give insight as to how ESI can serve as a supply
risk management tool.

Benefits and Drawbacks of ESI
Some scholars have defined ESI as ‘‘a form of vertical
cooperation where manufacturers involve suppliers at an
early stage in the product development/innovation process, generally at the level of concept and design’’ (Bidault
et al. 1998, p. 719). This concept has been also tested
empirically as an integral part of concurrent engineering
(Koufteros et al. 2001, 2002). Prior research has shown
that ESI offers a plethora of benefits. Some of these
benefits include reducing new product development
times (Rigby 1996; Hartley, Zirger and Kamath 1997a;
Stundza 1998; McGinnis and Vallopra 1999; Callahan and
Moretton 2001; Wynstra et al. 2001); improving product
quality (Minahan 1997; McGinnis and Vallopra 1999;
Milligan 1999); utilizing supplier technological expertise
(Wasti and Liker 1997; Vonderembse and Tracey 1999;
LaBahn 2000; Wynstra et al. 2001) and managing cost
(Rigby 1996; Hartley, Meredith, McCutcheon and Kamath
1997b; McGinnis and Vallopra 1999). However, not all
firms have realized benefits from engaging in ESI. Some of

limited application in the realm of organizational risk
(Bromiley, Miller and Rau 2001). However, agency theory
has recently been extended to the study of supply risk
(Zsidisin and Ellram 2003), and provides a useful framework for understanding efforts and approaches to supply
risk reduction.

behavior-based techniques that reduce the probability
that detrimental events occur. ESI may serve as a behaviorbased supplier management technique, functioning to
reduce the likelihood of supply risk occurrence from
issues such as design flaws, extended development times
and cost overruns.

Agency theory applies to the study of problems arising
when one party, the principal, delegates work to another
party, the agent (Eisenhardt 1989a; Lassar and Kerr 1996).
The unit of analysis is the metaphor of a contract between
the agent and the principal. In the buyer–supplier
dyad, the purchasing organization serves as the principal
and the supplier as the agent. Thus, an agency-theoretic
analysis with respect to such relationships focuses on the
means purchasing organizations use to evaluate or manage supplier performance. Supply management organizations can utilize various strategies to modify the outcomes
and behaviors of suppliers in response to these variables.

From an agency theory perspective, factors that influence the choice of the approaches and efforts expended in
supplier management efforts by purchasing organizations
include information systems, outcome uncertainty, risk
aversion, programmability, relationship length, goal
congruence, adverse selection and moral hazard (Eisenhardt 1989a; Celly and Frazier 1996; Lassar and Kerr 1996;
Logan 2000). These variables are briefly defined and their
application to supply risk in the context of ESI is summarized in Table II.

Outcome-based management reflects the extent to which
purchasing organizations emphasize results and is an
efficient method for supervising suppliers when risk is
negligible (Eisenhardt 1989a). Complete reliance on outcomes signifies an exclusive concern with bottom-line
results, regardless of how agents achieve them (Choi and
Liker 1995). Behavior-based management, on the other
hand, focuses on processes and reflects the extent to
which principals emphasize ‘‘tasks and activities’’ that
lead to risk reduction (Eisenhardt 1989a). Evaluating
supplier (agent) processes often requires substantial
human and financial resources and close communication
in order to improve those processes. Such improvements
in processes diminish the likelihood of problems arising,
therefore reducing the probability of risk materialization
(Celly and Frazier 1996).
The focus of agency theory is the trade-off between the
cost of managing behavior and the cost of measuring
outcomes that have the effect of transferring risk to the
agent. Agency theory argues that as uncertainty becomes
insignificant, outcome-based management efforts are
appropriate (Eisenhardt 1989a; Lassar and Kerr 1996;
Logan 2000). A purchasing organization does not need to
intercede by managing risk with ESI when, given the
design of the new product, the probability of a detrimental supply event is low. For example, products classified as noncritical items (Kraljic 1983) would not be likely
candidates for extensive risk-management efforts by
means of ESI as such items generally have a relatively high
degree of certainty with respect to demand volume,
technology and supply chain structure. Supply risk
becomes a significant issue when purchasing firms pursue
a strategy based on providing innovative products, such as
those designed during new product development, and
when the purchased subassemblies are complex (Laseter
and Ramdas 2002). When supply risk becomes a central
factor, purchasing organizations need to embrace

46

The Journal of Supply Chain Management | Fall 2005

The variables associated with agency theory should be
expected to guide managerial selection of methods to
reduce supply risk, and impact managerial efforts with
respect to monitoring supplier performance. Thus, the
agency theory variables listed in Table II provide a framework for investigating how ESI can facilitate supply risk
management in new product development. For example,
the implementation of ESI is proposed to reduce the
threats of selecting suppliers that shirk in their contractual obligations (moral hazard), which subsequently
reduces the purchasing firms risk of supplier failures
during new product development.
When the required conditions and resources are present, ESI may provide both purchasing organizations and
participating suppliers with significant benefits during
and subsequent to new product development. Advantage
may be found in areas such as improved technology,
shorter product development cycle time, lower cost and
higher quality. Prior research has also shown that ESI does
not always manifest into organizational benefits, and at
times, can even contribute additional problems. An
agency-theory perspective on supply risk can serve to
illuminate specific situations wherein ESI may help purchasing organizations better manage and monitor relationships with suppliers.
The remainder of the paper describes the case study
research method and the use of this method to elucidate
how ESI helps Rolls-Royce (RR) (aerospace division)
manage risk, and the organizational benefits attained
from such efforts. From the insights obtained in the case
study, we then provide a series of propositions grounded
in agency theory that serve to encapsulate key findings
and provide bases for future research. The final section
addresses managerial implications and conclusions.

Yin (1994) suggests a single-case study is appropriate
when it (1) represents a ‘‘critical case’’ in testing a wellformulated theory; (2) consists of an extreme or unique
case or (3) is considered a revelatory case where the
investigator(s) have the opportunity to observe and analyze a phenomenon previously inaccessible to scientific
investigation. Additionally, single case studies have been
justified as an appropriate method for theory development (Eisenhardt 1989b; Stuart, McCutcheon, Handfield,
McLachlin and Samson 2002). Because of the conflicting
findings of ESI benefits, a singular ‘‘Effective Practice’’ case
study was chosen to propose how and why (Yin 1994;
Ellram 1996) ESI affects organizational performance in
terms of managing supply risk.
The case study firm was screened initially through a
face-to-face interview, and then subsequent e-mail and
telephone conversations. A case study research protocol
(presented in Appendix), based upon research and conceptual discussions presented in the previously reviewed
literature, was created prior to data collection conducted
at one of RR’s production facilities. Information-gathering
techniques implemented during execution of the case
study included obtaining historical data and documentation, as well as conducting structured interviews with
various professional supply management personnel and
other key informants.
Data generated through interviews were subjected to
open, axial and selective coding analysis, in accordance
with the guidelines set by Yin (1994), Miles and Huberman (1984) and Strauss and Corbin (1998). Open coding
breaks down case study data in order to analyze, conceptualize and develop categories for the data. Axial coding is
a technique that makes connections among categories,
groups issues developed during first-level
coding, and summarizes the issues into themes. Selective
coding consists of integrating the research findings into
an overall theory, which was grounded in agency theory
(Eisenhardt 1989b) for the current study.

RESEARCH FINDINGS
The research consisted of conducting a single case study
that exemplifies effective organizational practice of ESI
and examines how that practice facilitates supply risk
management. Initially, organizational background information is presented, followed by a description of the ESI
process at RR and an introduction to the supply risk
factors perceived by the case study respondents.

Organization Background
The Aerospace Division of Rolls-Royce is a major supplier of critical components in the aerospace industry,
providing vital technology for civilian and military aircraft. The industry is cost and reliability driven, and
requires extensive research and development. RR’s products represent significant cost and safety contributions

48

The Journal of Supply Chain Management | Fall 2005

to the aircraft where they are installed, and require
extensive sustained product development efforts, often
taking 3–4 years and with total investments of $500–600
million before returns are realized. Further, supplierprovided components represent approximately 65–80
percent of the value of RR’s products.
A newly hired purchasing executive introduced the ESI
initiative to RR in 1999. Since that time, ESI has come to
be considered a critical activity for RR, as it has been
estimated that 80 percent of its products costs are locked
in during the design phase. ESI is perceived as a vehicle for
RR to meet its goal of significant cost reductions in new
products. Organizational benefits from ESI include
obtaining leverage with the supply base, improving
design capabilities, instituting internal documentation of
best practices for organizational learning and managing
supply risk.

ESI at RR
ESI at RR is based and supported in the SCM department, and operates as a support function to the various
business units. Internal documents at RR present ESI as a
process that engages potential suppliers in the concept
design stage of new product development in order to
ensure meeting customers’ functional requirements for
the product at the lowest possible cost across the entire
life cycle. The ESI process at RR involves a 16-step process,
as shown in Figure 1. The ESI process begins with establishing critical customer needs, which allows RR personnel to identify projects appropriate for ESI. Generally, the
earlier in the product design cycle that ESI is implemented, the greater the potential benefits. A detailed description of this process is discussed by Smith and Zsidisin
(2002). The new product development process time in the
aerospace industry has been reported to last between 10
and 20 years (Fine 1998). However, most other industries
have much shorter NPD timeframes, such as the automotive (4–6 years) and computer (less than 6 months)
industries.
Interviews with six managers at RR revealed a number of
characteristics of ESI that help to reduce supply risk,
particularly with respect to risk originating with suppliers.
These findings were further refined in representations
from 12 first-tier suppliers during a supplier conference
hosted by RR. Issues impacted by ESI that significantly
influence supply risk perceptions include the threats of
excessive cost, legal liabilities, quality problems, supplier
capacity constraints, extended product development
times, the inability to handle product design changes and
supplier organizational leadership issues. Table III summarizes findings with respect to these characteristics.
Excessive costs were a major impetus for the ESI initiative
at RR. Prior to the initiative, the perception among RR
officials was that they were being priced out of an
increasingly competitive marketplace. This led RR to

Further, RR has found that ‘‘world class’’ suppliers generally have cost reduction programs in place. However,
this is not the case with less competent suppliers. ESI has
provided RR with means for working with suppliers both
to convince them of the importance of cost reduction

programs, and to help suppliers develop these programs
when they do not exist. As the ESI initiative has matured,
and RR has developed a solid supply base, RR increasingly
fashioned a cadre of suppliers and an approach to working
together that assures continued cost reductions in design
and redesign efforts. As the result of developing effective

relationships with suppliers, RR has significantly reduced
perceived risks associated with noncompetitive pricing of
critical supplies.
Legal liability issues represent a potentially significant
risk for firms involved in developing and marketing
advanced technology products. Officials at RR note that
the precise form of the liability depends on which party
or parties have critical expertise. Effective sharing of
expertise reduces risk associated with product failure in
the marketplace, and agreements that provide for the
sharing of gains reduces the potential risk associated with
intellectual property rights concerns. RR has found
that ESI decreases both the chance that there will be
legal liability issues and the resulting loss in the case
of their occurrence.
Quality problems can often be resolved by ensuring
alignment between designs and capabilities early in the
design cycle. Concurrent design engineering between the
suppliers and RR helps to ensure proactive resolution of
design problems that might lead to extensive rework and
yield problems. Further, by the use of scorecards such as
financial appraisal reports, sole-source registers, and an
‘‘At Risk Register’’ that records data about supply-base
execution, RR continuously tracks the performance of
current suppliers, and can use this information in determining which suppliers will be invited to participate in
new ESI projects. RR sees the effective utilization of
performance data in selecting suppliers for ESI as managing the risk associated with the potential for quality
problems by preventing their occurrence.

The Journal of Supply Chain Management | Fall 2005

Supplier capacity constraints represent a risk associated
with the production flexibility of a supplier. RR engages its
suppliers during the preselection process of ESI projects in
discussions about the planning process, past growth,
current status and investments aimed at the suppliers
future. RR views information about the planning and
implementation of supplier capacity expansion as critical
to their efforts to manage the risk of capacity constraints
by selecting suppliers who will meet the future needs of
their production processes. RR has noted that even during
times of difficult economic conditions, world-class suppliers may see substantial growth and could have capacity
problems. The information sharing that is part of effective
ESI efforts represents a valuable means for determining
the adequacy of the supplier’s capacity planning, and
providing the supplier with information to drive more
successful planning with regard to the buying organizations future requirements.
Extended product development times represent a risk to
RR in that they can increase development costs and delay
the delivery of the new product into the market. ESI helps
RR manage this risk by ensuring sharing of development
information. Thus, delays are readily recognized, and
steps can be taken to manage the process to mitigate the
risk, including sharing of resources and making material
and design changes.
The inability to handle product design changes on the part
of suppliers can jeopardize the entire product line. RR has
found that the information exchange that is part of the
ESI process helps it manage design changes efficiently and

effectively because awareness of budding problems allows
them to develop alternate strategies.
In the context of ESI, RR has found that it can more
readily identify risk associated with supplier organizational
leadership problems. RR has found that suppliers readily
provide information about their management structures
during the initial stages of ESI. One particular issue that
RR faced is that many potential suppliers have operations
in different locations. A well-managed operation in one
location does not imply that all of the suppliers operations function in a similar manner. In such cases, RR may
be faced with the challenge of determining the extent to

which the overall organization can be brought together to
accomplish what RR needs.

PROPOSITIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH
When organizations and their suppliers work together
as part of ESI projects, information exchange is enhanced.
With better exchange of information comes knowledge of
the situations surrounding the dynamics of a supply
relationship, and with that knowledge comes greater
potential for detecting, averting, and managing supply
risk. Given the nature of RR’s products, and the nature of
many of the components obtained from suppliers, the

<-----Page 8----->Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions

fact that ESI would be an effective tool in reducing
perceived supply risk fits well with previous research
reported by Laseter and Ramdas (2002). For example, RR
purchases products characterized by: (1) having critical
safety concerns and government oversight, (2) encompassing a high degree of technology content and (3)
displaying substantial complexity in designing, manufacturing and sourcing. Thus, given the clusters derived by
Laseter and Ramdas (2002), it is expected that early and
high-level supplier involvement would be beneficial, as
was found in RR’s ESI process. This is because products
such as aircraft jet engines and their respective parts have
critical safety concerns that have significant Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA) oversight, possess high
levels of technological sophistication, and have complex
interactions in the bill of materials. Under these circumstances, the involvement of technologically knowledgeable suppliers during the earliest stages of the product
development process can provide immediate benefits in
terms of reducing the time it takes to create a new design,
introducing alternatives to take cost out of the designs,
and providing understanding to suppliers as to how their
specific subassemblies fit into the overall engine. On the
other hand, integrating suppliers that provide commodity
and indirect supplies early in the product design stage
would not be beneficial because the value gained from ESI
would not offset the significant resource investments in
time and personnel.
From these research findings, we developed a series of
propositions to describe how ESI reduces the supply risk of
product and supplier failures, as mediated through several
variables grounded from an agency theory perspective.
Product failures arise from inabilities to meet consumer
requirements because of cost overruns and failure to meet
product launch deadlines. Supplier failures, on the other
hand, stem from supplier issues such as technological
problems and leadership concerns. As shown in Figure 2
and summarized in Table IV, ESI facilitates supply risk
reduction for strategic, complex products through
addressing agency theory variables (defined in Table II) as
follows: (1) reducing outcome uncertainty, (2) providing
task programmability, (3) creating goal congruency, (4)
avoiding adverse selection and moral hazard and (5)
monitoring supplier performance. Next, each of these
propositions is presented in detail.

Reducing Outcome Uncertainty
ESI reduces the outcome uncertainty associated with
outsourcing the production of a subcomponent. Having
suppliers involved early within the product design process
reduces the risk of product failures associated with not
achieving target costs and extending product design
lead times by integrating product, process and supply
chain design through ESI. Implementing ESI with
strategic supply sources allows buyer and supplier

52

The Journal of Supply Chain Management | Fall 2005

organizations to work together in deriving solutions to
outcome uncertainty from volume demand fluctuations
and technological advancements.

Proposition 1: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from product failures
by managing outcome uncertainty.

Creating Task Programmability
An established ESI program can provide suppliers a
template of activities necessary for the achievement of
new product development success. At RR, task programmability is accomplished using target costing and initial
meetings with supplier organizations. The target costing
process begins with a breakdown of allowable supplier
costs. RR provides aggressive target cost goals for its
suppliers, and relies upon its suppliers to provide suggestions before the product design is solidified in order to
achieve predetermined target cost goals. The sharing of
target costs presents suppliers with a clear goal. In the
past, the predominant focus in the aerospace industry has
been on quality and reliability, and while RR continues to
focus on these attributes, the use of target costs follows
RR’s realization that it must also address costs in order to
remain competitive in this industry.
Outcome expectations are also provided to suppliers
during the preselection phase of the ESI process. After
signing nondisclosure agreements, suppliers are provided
a briefing of what will be expected of them, such as target
costs based on rough order of magnitude estimates for the
required tasks, requirements to be met in creating design
specifications, and willingness to work with suggested
second-tier suppliers. These outcome expectations are
continuously monitored throughout the design development phase as a function of supplier personnel being
colocated at RR’s plants, and during quarterly meetings to
review supplier issues perceived as potential risks.

Proposition 2: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by programming and monitoring
supplier tasks and accomplishments.

Creating Goal Congruency
Within the context of this case, ESI initially provides an
outcome-based method for controlling or managing supplier behaviors. Before the supplier selection decision,
there is often no close relationship specified between RR
and its potential suppliers. The purpose of ESI at the
presupplier selection phase is to determine which suppliers will be best able to meet the specified outcomes in
terms of quality, delivery, cost, technology and time-line
goals. However, in addition to managing toward specific
outcomes, RR also includes managerial aspects that
are readily related to behavior-based management
technologies or methods. During the initial stages of ESI,

<-----Page 9----->Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions

before the actual supplier is selected, RR is most interested
in understanding the culture and philosophies of each of
the supplier organizations. This is because it is important
for RR to see that there will be goal congruency between
the two organizations, and that the philosophies and
organizational cultures provide for a sound match. In
addition, after making the supplier selection decision, it is
expected that a close relationship that is characterized by
the exchange of critical, timely, and sensitive information
will arise and that the relationship between the two firms
will continue for a long period.

Proposition 3: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by creating goal congruency
between the purchasing and supplier organizations.

technological sophistication of the products produced.
Specifically, the level of trust and past experience can
provide the purchasing organization information as to
whether or not adverse selection and moral hazard are
prevalent in a respective industry. In addition, if the
products produced are not technologically sophisticated,
the threats of moral hazard and adverse selection are
reduced because the reasons for supplier nonperformance
become readily apparent. In the case of RR, many of the
supply risk factors that can exist are effectively managed
early in the process. This portion of RR’s ESI process
facilitates selecting either a world-class supplier, or one
that is attempting to attain that status.

Proposition 4: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by avoiding adverse selection and
moral hazard.

Avoiding Adverse Selection and Moral Hazard
The ESI process also provides for managing the risks of
adverse selection and moral hazard. By having suppliers
involved at the earliest stages of the new product development cycle, RR is better assured that it will select the
most qualified supplier. RR expects that these suppliers
will bring engineering expertise to an aircraft subassembly, have an outstanding reputation for quality, and
possess a similar corporate philosophy to that of RR. In
addition, as the product development process is rather
lengthy, the suppliers involved in an ESI project must
initially demonstrate a significant level of commitment
and provide clear indication that this level of commitment will be sustained. If they are selected and consistently meet performance requirements, suppliers will
enjoy an assurance of continued business on a large scale.
Suppliers that either cannot meet requirements up-front
or are not willing to put forth the required effort to meet
RR demands are eliminated from further consideration
early within the process, which reduces the threats of
adverse selection and moral hazard.
In sum, eliminating the chance that RR selects the
wrong supplier reduces its exposure to supply risk.
Throughout the ESI process, when investigating which
firm to select for a specific subclass of items, RR is able to
obtain initial insights into which firms represent ‘‘worldclass’’ suppliers. From a supply chain perspective, this
facilitates concurrent product, process and supply chain
design (Fine 1998) by evaluating and selecting the most
capable suppliers available. By involving multiple suppliers from the initial stages of product conception, the
supplier selection process at RR is able to gather information about those suppliers philosophies, technological
and production capabilities, past experience and desired
goals. However, this may or may not exist in other
industries, because of factors such as historical buyer–
supplier relationships that affect the extent of trust that
exists between buying and supplying organizations and

Monitoring Supplier Performance
Prior to initiating an ESI project there is considerable
uncertainty about potential suppliers, their capabilities,
the exact nature of the actions required to obtain desired
outcomes, and even the precise outcomes to be obtained,
other than the previously established target costs. At RR,
initial relationship management initiatives are dominated
by the outcomes established by target costing. However,
as the relationship progresses during and after supplier
selection, greater clarity develops about the supplier,
including supplier capabilities and intentions, and about
the project, including actions required and the precise
description of the desired outcomes. Together with the
close working relationship implicit in ESI, the additional
clarity renders behavior-based monitoring readily part of
routine interactions with the supplier, and substantially
assures obtaining the desired outcomes. Positive results
over a period help to promote trust, which can serve to
enhance the working relationship as part of ESI. However,
diligence requires that the purchasing organization continue to monitor supplier performance with respect to
both their behaviors and outcomes, so that changes
related to any of the agency theory variables can be
detected and addressed.

Proposition 5: ESI reduces risk in new product
development from supplier failures
by allowing purchasing firms to
better monitor supplier activities.

MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
The ESI model developed by RR (Figure 1) represents an
effective approach to implementing many of the conceptual features presented by Dowlatshahi (1998, 1999),
and its explication provides a reasonable roadmap for
overcoming implementation barriers noted by McIvor
and Humphreys (2004). One particularly advantageous
aspect of the current model is its focus on ESI imple-

53

<-----Page 10----->Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions

mentation at the individual design project level that
provides a method for organizations to build capacity for
organizational ESI initiatives. The RR model provides
conceptually appropriate sequencing of managerial
activities in a generic process that can readily be adapted
to many settings.
One of the key benefits of properly sequenced activities
is that it allows detection of potential risks stemming
from both product design and supplier performance. Early
involvement of the right suppliers in product design
promotes utilization of the best expertise available in
individual design and specification decisions. Thus,
potential for product failure is minimized by problem
prevention rather than through remediation. However,
collaborative efforts also promote early detection and
correction of problems in the design as they develop,
considerably reducing costs associated with implementing required changes later in the product life cycle. These
properties of interorganizational concurrent design mirror findings in concurrent design at the organizational
level. However, such advantages can only be obtained
where well-founded trust and effective communication
are prevalent.
The development and effective monitoring of collaborative relationships are critical to both reducing the
potential for supplier failure and reducing the magnitude
of harm should such failure be realized. The ESI model
implemented at RR emphasizes the value of sequencing
activities to select the best suppliers, establishing effective
communication and using appropriate oversight that
is relevant to the stage of development for the buyer–
supplier relationship. ESI can be effective in preventing
problems with supplier performance.
The ESI model implemented at RR is relatively
straightforward from a conceptual perspective and effective from a performance perspective (Smith and Zsidisin
2002), as well as from a risk-management viewpoint. This
model may represent a reasonable initial guide for organizations considering implementing ESI, and provides a
general framework for organizations to utilize in modifying the current model, or in developing new models, to fit
their unique business environment.

CONCLUSIONS
By selecting the proper suppliers using an exhaustive
selection process, and then by developing solid information exchange within the context of a developing relationship with selected suppliers, RR has shown that it can
substantially reduce supply risk. Although cost reduction
was the original impetus behind the implementation of
ESI within RR, it has been instrumental in substantially
reducing the risk associated with products and suppliers
in new product development.

This case study has also demonstrated that aspects of
agency theory are applicable to studying the relationship
between purchasing organizations and supplier firms.
Specifically, the purchasing organization (the principal)
hires a supplier firm (the agent) to perform specified tasks,
such as the design, production, and delivery of a subassembly or component at a specified price and quantity.
This relationship between the two firms becomes more
complex when the product itself is not tangible, such as in
the instance of suppliers bringing engineering and product design expertise to their customers. Aspects of
agency theory that provide better insights into managing
supply risk through ESI are outcome uncertainty, task
programmability, goal congruency, adverse selection and
moral hazard and supplier performance monitoring.
Understanding the influence of these variables in new
product development can result in reducing the risk from
product failures in terms of cost and lead times, and from
supplier failures with regard to quality problems, technological capabilities, and leadership issues. As was previously observed for channel relationships (Celly and
Frazier 1996), a combination of outcome- and behaviorbased control methods may prove most effective,
depending on the nature of the purchase, relationship
with the supplier and risk associated with the product.
Supplier management may be dominated by outcomebased approaches at first, particularly with respect to cost,
and then develop toward a behavior-based orientation
after the supplier selection decision is made within the ESI
process. As a result, this focus on supplier actions tends to
promote a strong relationship between the purchasing
and supplier organizations, and is appropriate to the longterm orientation of ESI.
The major limitation of this study is that it is based
upon a single case study, which has allowed elucidation of
key aspects of ESI as an approach to supply risk reduction.
Future research on the degree to which these findings are
generalizable to other firms in the aerospace industry,
other manufacturing industries, and the service sector will
help clarify the extent to which supply management
practitioners should be encouraged to implement ESI in
order to manage supply risk. Further, research aimed at
determining the applicability of the propositions that we
advance should provide for extending the treatment of
agency theory as a theoretical underpinning for both
research and practical application in supply management.
Such extensions might include further research on the
benefits of ESI, including explication of industry-specific
practices, or cross-sectional sampling aimed at finding
shared practices. These studies may invoke research
methodologies such as multiple case studies or surveybased research.
Findings from the current research show that ESI has
important implications for the management of supply
risk when the right conditions exist in new product

<-----Page 11----->Managing Supply Risk with Early Supplier Involvement: A Case Study and Research Propositions

development. Agency theory appears to provide an
effective lens through which to assess future research and
the practical implications of supply management initiatives. Through the strategic implementation of ESI in
concurrent engineering, purchasing organizations can
achieve higher levels of performance by managing
supply risk.
