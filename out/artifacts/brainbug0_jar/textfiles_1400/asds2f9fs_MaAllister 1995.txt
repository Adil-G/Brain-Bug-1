AFFECT- AND COGNITION-BASED TRUST AS
FOUNDATIONS FOR INTERPERSONAL
COOPERATION IN ORGANIZATIONS
DANIEL J. McALLISTER
Georgetown University
This study addressed the nature and functioning of relationships of
interpersonal trust among managers and professionals in organizations, the factors influencing trust's development, and the implications
of trust for behavior and performance. Theoretical foundations were
literature on trust and the socialdrawn from the sociological
psychological literature on trust in close relationships. An initial test of
the proposed theoretical framework was conducted in a field setting
with 194 managers and professionals.

Trust ...

tends to be somewhat

like a combination

of the

weather and motherhood; it is widely talked about, and it is
widely assumed to be good for organizations.When it comes to
specifying just what it means in an organizationalcontext, however, vagueness creeps in.

Lawler, & Hackman, 1975: 497

Recent developments in the organizational sciences reflect the importance of interpersonal trust relationships for sustaining individual and organizational effectiveness. Researchers have recognized trust's influence on
coordination and control at both institutional (Shapiro, 1987, 1990; Zucker,
1986) and interpersonal levels of organization (Granovetter, 1985; Pennings
& Woiceshyn, 1987). Because economic action is embedded within networks
of social relationships (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Fichman & Levinthal, 1991;
Granovetter, 1985; Larson, 1992), researchers have argued that efficiency
within complex systems of coordinated action is only possible when interdependent actors work together effectively. Trust between such actors is
seen as a determining factor (Pennings & Woiceshyn, 1987; Seabright, Leventhal, & Fichman, 1992).
For managers and professionals in organizations, developing and maintaining trust relationships is especially important. As boundary spanners,
managers work through critical horizontal ties to external constituencies on
which their departments or organizations depend (Mintzberg, 1973; Sayles,
I am grateful to Jone Pearce, Anne Tsui, and Lyman Porter for their guidance and advice in
this research, conducted as part of my doctoral dissertation at the University of California,
Irvine. Special words of appreciation are due to Susan Ashford and two anonymous reviewers
for their insightful comments and constructive feedback on several earlier drafts of this article.

1979). Given the complexity and uncertainty inherent in managerial work
and the amount of mutual accommodation it involves, effective horizontal
working relationships within organizations are also critical (Gabarro, 1990;
Sayles, 1979). As Thompson (1967) observed, under conditions of uncertainty and complexity, requiring mutual adjustment, sustained effective coordinated action is only possible where there is mutual confidence or trust.
Although trust's importance has been acknowledged, the matter of how
it develops and functions has received little systematic theoretical attention.
The present work develops and tests a theoretical model based on the sociological literature on trust (Barber, 1983; Lewis & Wiegert, 1985; Luhman,
1979; Shapiro, 1990; Zucker, 1986) and social-psychological work on trust in
close relationships (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982; Rempel, Holmes, &
Zanna, 1985). The present research was designed to contribute to understanding of the nature and functioning of interpersonal trust relationships by
(1) distinguishing between two principal forms of interpersonal trustcognition-based trust, grounded in individual beliefs about peer reliability
and dependability, and affect-based trust, grounded in reciprocated interpersonal care and concern-(2) identifying factors influencing the development of each form of trust, and (3) examining the implications of each trust
form for coordination-relevant behavior, including monitoring to control
peers, defensive behavior, monitoring to assist peers, and interpersonal citizenship behavior.
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS
Interpersonal trust is a pervasive phenomenon in organizational life.
Trust enables people to take risks: "where there is trust there is the feeling
that others will not take advantage of me" (Porter et al., 1975: 497). Trust is
based on the expectation that one will find what is expected rather than
what is feared (Deutsch, 1973). Thus, competence and responsibility are
central to understandings of trust (Barber, 1983; Cook & Wall, 1980; Shapiro,
1990). At times an individual's trust in others is centered more on how they
make decisions that affect him or her than on how they behave: "Do they
consider my interests and welfare?" Finally, trust encompasses not only
people's beliefs about others, but also their willingness to use that knowledge as the basis for action (Luhmann, 1979). Combining these ideas yields
a definition of interpersonal trust as the extent to which a person is confident
in, and willing to act on the basis of, the words, actions, and decisions of
another.

Cognition-Based Trust

worthiness" (Lewis & Wiegert, 1985: 970). The amount of knowledge necessary for trust is somewhere between total knowledge and total ignorance
(Simmel, 1964). Given total knowledge, there is no need to trust, and given
total ignorance, there is no basis upon which to rationally trust. Available
knowledge and "good reasons" serve as foundations for trust decisions, the
platform from which people make leaps of faith, like those involved in
trusting (Luhmann, 1979; Simmel, 1964).
Past measures of trust in organizational settings suggest that competence
and responsibility are central elements (Butler, 1991; Cook & Wall, 1980).
Reliability and dependability have also been included in measures of interpersonal trust in close relations (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982; Rempel et
al., 1985). Reliability and dependability expectations must usually be met
for trust relationships to exist and develop (Zucker, 1986) and evidence to
the contrary provides a rational basis for withholding trust (Luhmann, 1979;
Shapiro,

1987, 1990).

Affective foundations for trust also exist, consisting of the emotional
bonds between individuals (Lewis & Wiegert, 1985). People make emotional
investments in trust relationships, express genuine care and concern for the
welfare of partners, believe in the intrinsic virtue of such relationships, and
believe that these sentiments are reciprocated (Pennings & Woiceshyn, 1987;
Rempel et al., 1985). Ultimately, the emotional ties linking individuals can
provide the basis for trust.
Empirical evidence from the social-psychological literature on trust in
close relationships supports this distinction between the two forms of trust.
Johnson-George and Swap (1982) identified, distinguished between, and reliably measured two dimensions of trust they labeled "reliableness" and
"emotional trust." Similarly, Rempel and colleagues (1985) distinguished
between "dependability" and "faith" (emotional security) as unique forms
of trust. Organizations abound with relationships based on dependability
and faith (Pennings & Woiceshyn, 1987) in which moderate expressions of
interpersonal care and concern are not uncommon (Granovetter, 1985; Griesinger, 1990; Pennings & Woiceshyn, 1987). Drawing on this theoretical distinction between forms of interpersonal trust, I hypothesized that

managers in organizations are characterized by two ditrust and affect-based trust.

Figure 1 outlines the theoretical framework developed in the following
discussion. The sequence of relationships is from peer attributes and behavior, through focal manager assessments of peer trustworthiness, to focal

performance alike.

depend on the success of past interaction, the extent of social similarity, and
organizational context considerations (Zucker, 1986). First, because working
relationships are typically personal and extend over time, it is possible for
people to consider the track record of peers, or how they have carried out
role-related duties in the past, when assessing trustworthiness (Cook & Wall,
1980; Granovetter, 1985). Evidence that a peer's behavior is consistent with
norms of reciprocity and fairness and that the peer follows through on commitments is vital (Lindskold, 1978; Stack, 1988). In working relationships
involving high interdependence, peer performance can have a determining
impact on personal productivity, and evidence that peers carry out role
responsibilities reliably will enhance a manager's assessments of a peer's
trustworthiness. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 2a: The level of a manager's cognition-based
trust in a peer will be positively associated with the extent
of that peer's reliable role performance.
Second, social similarity between individuals can influence trust development. Groups of individuals with similar fundamental characteristics,
such as ethnic background, may have an advantage over diverse groups in
their ability to create and maintain trusting working relationships. Light
(1984) documented the tendency of ethnic minority entrepreneurs to conduct business through co-ethnic rather than interethnic social circles. More
fundamentally, self-categorization theorists have observed that individuals
tend to group themselves with others on the basis of objective attributes such
as race, age, and gender (Turner, 1987) and that such internal classifications
influence beliefs and attitudes. Individuals are more likely to perceive outgroup members as dishonest, untrustworthy, and uncooperative than they
are to so perceive in-group members (Brewer, 1979). Notwithstanding the
potential beliefs of diversity for organizations, which include enhanced creativity, access to a broader set of environmental resources, and more, the
possibility that cultural similarity facilitates the creation and maintenance of
trust in organizations merits recognition. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 2b: The level of a manager's cognition-based
trust in a peer will be greater when the two are culturally
or ethnically similar.
Third, formal organizations, through formal role specifications, specify
boundaries for trust relationships (Baier, 1985; Fox, 1974) and professional
credentials serve as clear signals of role preparedness. Educational institutions, professional associations, and credentialing agencies manufacture
trust by providing guarantees to would-be trusters through certification that
individuals meet standards for acceptability in a larger professional community (Zucker, 1986). Professional standing can be maintained over time
through continued membership and participation in relevant professional
associations. Thus,

<-----Page 6----->1995

Hypothesis 2c: The level of a manager's cognition-based
trust in a peer will be greater for peers with higher professional credentials.
Antecedents of affect-based trust. Although external factors making the
behavior of relationship partners predictable provide foundations for cognition-based trust, insights into the motives of relationship partners provide
foundations for affect-based trust. Findings from attribution research indicate that behavior recognized as personally chosen rather than roleprescribed, serving to meet legitimate needs, and demonstrating interpersonal care and concern rather than enlightened self-interest may be critical
for the development of affect-based trust (Clark & Mills, 1979; Clark, Mills,
& Powell, 1986; Clark & Waddell, 1985; Holmes, 1978; Holmes & Rempel,
1989; Kelly, 1979; Rempel et al., 1985).
Such behavior corresponds well with descriptions of organizational citizenship behavior (OCB; Organ, 1988; Smith, Organ, & Near, 1983). Organ
defined OCB as behavior intended to provide help and assistance that is
outside an individual's work role, not directly rewarded, and conducive to
effective organizational functioning. Smith, Organ, and Near defined altruism, a specific form of OCB, as behavior "directly and intentionally aimed at
helping a specific person in face-to-face situations" (1983: 657). Altruistic
behavior may provide an attributional basis for affect-based trust. Being
extra-role, it can be viewed as being personally chosen, and not being directly rewarded, it cannot easily be attributed to enlightened self-interest
(MacKenzie, Podsakoff, & Fetter, 1991). Accordingly,
Hypothesis 3a: The level of a manager's affect-based trust
in a peer will be positively associated with the level of
that peer's citizenship behavior directed toward the manager.
Because affect-based trust is grounded in an individual's attributions
concerning the motives for others' behavior, it should be limited to contexts
of frequent interaction, where there are sufficient social data to allow the
making of confident attributions (Lewis & Wiegert, 1985). Thus,
Hypothesis 3b: The level of a manager's affect-based trust
in a peer will be positively associated with the frequency
of interaction between the manager and the peer.
The relationship between cognition- and affect-based trust. Although
much of the research on affectivity in organizations and on the relationship
between affect and cognition has focused on unanchored mood states (Brief
& George, 1992; Burke, Brief, George, Roberson, & Webster, 1989), increasing attention is being given to the interpersonal foundations of affectivity
(Isen & Baron, 1991; Longenecker, Jaccoud, Sims, & Gioia, 1992; Park, Sims,
& Motowidlo, 1986; Tsui & Barry, 1986). Research on affect and cognition in
close relationships has highlighted the development of interpersonal affect

<-----Page 7----->30

upon a cognitive base (Holmes & Rempel, 1989; Rempel et al., 1985). Cognition-based trust, or reliableness, is seen as "more superficial and less special" than emotional trustworthiness (Johnson-George & Swap, 1982: 1316).
Faith (Rempel et al., 1985: 98) is characterized by a greater investment of
time and emotion than are dependability and reliability.
For working relationships among managers, some level of cognitionbased trust may be necessary for affect-based trust to develop; people's baseline expectations for peer reliability and dependability must be met before
they will invest further in relationships. Where baseline expectations are not
yet established, individuals may be inclined to attribute extra-role conduct
to ingratiation and impression management rather than to care and concern.
Once an individual has established a track record for reliability and dependability, and thus some level of cognition-based trust exists, confident attributions concerning the motivations for that person's citizenship behavior
may follow. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 4: A manager expressing high levels of cognition-based trust in a peer will also report high affectbased trust in that peer.
Two comments qualify this developmental perspective on the relationship between affect- and cognition-based trust. First, given the distinctive
antecedents and consequences posited, affect-based trust should be viewed
as a distinct form of interpersonal trust rather than as a higher level of trust.
Second, as affect-based trust matures, the potential for the decoupling of
trust forms and for reverse causation (affect-based trust influencing cognition-based trust) increases. Zajonc observed that "once formed, an evaluation is not easily revoked....

Affect often persists

after a complete

invali-

dation of its original cognitive basis" (1980: 157). Holmes and Rempel (1989)
observed that as affect-based trust develops, key attributions, such as "This
colleague genuinely cares about me," become incorporated into a stable and
global picture of a partner's motives. In time, ascribed motives are taken as
permanent and left unquestioned, even in the face of disconfirming evidence. Transgressions are discounted in advance or explained away. Thus,
once a high level of affect-based trust has developed, a foundation of cognition-based trust may no longer be needed.
Consequences of Managerial Beliefs About Peer Trustworthiness
Control-based monitoring and defensive behavior. Where one person,
interdependent with another, cannot count on that individual to be dependable and reliable, he or she can take steps to manage the uncertainty inherent
in the situation. Monitoring to control the untrustworthy individual is one
likely response (Bradach & Eccles, 1989; Pennings & Woiceshyn, 1987;
Williamson, 1974). As Ouchi observed, "People must either be able to trust
each other or to closely monitor each other if they are to engage in cooperative enterprises" (1979: 846).
Besides assuring some minimal level of peer performance, managers

<-----Page 8----->1995

must perform their own duties with little disturbance, buffer themselves
from the influence of others, and protect their personal interests (Ashforth &
Lee, 1990). Individuals behave defensively, for example, when they make
requests for assistance well ahead of the time they are needed, draw upon
multiple and redundant sources when making requests for the assistance,
expend extra resources working around and avoiding others, and use official
and formal (rather than informal) means to document requests (Ashforth &
Lee, 1990). Two hypotheses follow:
Hypothesis 5a: A manager expressing a high level of cognition-based trust in a peer will engage in little controlbased monitoring of that peer.
Hypothesis 5b: A manager expressing a high level of cognition-based trust in a peer will direct little defensive behavior toward that peer.
Within this theoretical framework, control-based monitoring and defensive behavior are behavioral consequences of cognition-based trust alone. In
practical terms, for affect-based trust to develop, some level of cognitionbased trust must already exist, and it can be expected that where cognitionbased trust is present, levels of monitoring and defensive behavior will be
low. Likely consequences of affect-based trust are outlined below.
Need-based monitoring and interpersonal citizenship behavior. Relationships characterized by affect-based trust resemble so-called communal
relationships (Clark, Mills, & Corcoran, 1989; Clark, Mills, & Powell, 1986).
Research findings show that individuals in communal relationships are
more inclined to keep track of associates' needs than are individuals in
exchange relationships. What drives need-based monitoring is not the desire
to generate future obligations or to reciprocate benefits received, but rather
an understanding of the communal nature of the relationship: "In a communal relationship, the idea that a benefit is given in response to a benefit
that was received is compromising, because it calls into question the assumption that each member responds to the needs of the other" (Clark &
Mills, 1979: 13). In communal relationships, partners appear less inclined to
keep track of personal inputs on joint tasks (Clark, 1984) and to feel exploited by unrequited helping (Clark & Waddell, 1985). They take on their
partners' problems as their own, develop a tacit awareness of partners'
needs, and learn how to respond appropriately (Holmes & Rempel, 1989).
Similarly, in affect-based-trust relationships, sensitivity to the personal and
work-related needs of associates should be high. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 6a: A manager expressing a high level of affect-based trust in a peer will engage in a great amount of
need-based monitoring of that peer.
Individuals expressing high affect-based trust in peers may also direct a
great amount of interpersonal citizenship behavior toward them. Increased
assistance may follow naturally either from an increased awareness of peer

<-----Page 9----->32

needs (the product of need-based monitoring) or from a desire to assist peers
in meeting their personal objectives and to express felt care and concern tangibly. Although Organ and Konovsky asserted that "characteristic OCB has a
deliberate, controlled character, somewhat akin to conscious decision making rather than expressive emotional behavior" (1989: 162), I argue that
when a great amount of citizenship behavior is directed toward a focal individual, the behavior has expressive, noncalculated qualities. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 6b: A manager expressing a high level of affect-based trust in a peer will direct a great amount of
interpersonal citizenship behavior toward that peer.
It is important to note that no direct relationship between a peer's interpersonal citizenship behavior and a manager's citizenship behavior is
posited. Observation of a direct relationship would demonstrate the influence of reciprocity and exchange norms (Holmes, 1978; Holmes & Rempel,
1989). Within the proposed framework, peer conduct (citizenship directed
toward a focal manager) influences the focal manager's affect-based-trust
perceptions through its expressive qualities. Those perceptions in turn influence the manager's citizenship behavior toward the peer. The latter's
citizenship behavior becomes an expressive act rather than an obligationdischarging and equilibrium-restoring act of reciprocation.
Performance Implications of Cognition- and Affect-Based Trust
Apart from a general assumption of the efficacy of trust relations as a
lubricant to the social system, facilitating coordinated action (Arrow, 1974;
Ouchi, 1979; Williamson, 1974), existing research contains little on how trust
affects performance outcomes. The behavioral consequences of trust may
provide one line of explanation. Managerial and professional work involves
mutual adjustment and accommodation within a multiple constituency context (Sayles, 1979; Tsui, 1984). Trusting peers should receive enhanced performance assessments to the extent that the behavioral consequences of trust
further organizational ends. If trust helps to further organizational ends, it
should be associated with supervisor assessments of the performance of
trusting and trusted individuals.
Performance implications of defensive behavior and control-based
monitoring. In general, monitoring and defensive behavior represent nonproductive uses of finite managerial resources. Allocating work energies to
pursuits like monitoring (Alchian & Demset, 1972; Baker, Jensen, & Murphy,
1988) and defensive behavior (Ashforth & Lee, 1990; Kahn, Wolfe, Quinn, &
Snoek, 1964) involves a trade-off: Managers engaging in excessive monitoring and defensive behavior will have fewer resources remaining with which
to accomplish fundamental work objectives. Accordingly,
Hypothesis 7a: The level of a manager's control-based
monitoring of peer will be negatively associated with supervisor assessments of the manager's performance.
Hypothesis 7b: The level of a manager's defensive behav-

<-----Page 10----->1995

ior toward a peer will be negatively associated with supervisor assessments of the manager's performance.
Performance implications of need-based monitoring and citizenship
behavior. Organizations depend on the discretionary contributions of their
members to maintain efficiency and coordination; one has only to witness
the disruption that occurs when employees limit their contributions exclusively to what is specified in their job descriptions to realize that this is the
case (Katz, 1964). Organizations must also depend on employees to use their
skills and energies wisely so that contributions are maximized-organizations need employees who work not only harder but smarter. An essential
ingredient in working smarter is undoubtedly paying attention and looking
for opportunities to make constructive contributions.
Thus, need-based monitoring and citizenship behavior by focal managers may enhance assessments of their contributions, especially assessments
provided by supervisors and others whose interests are aligned with those of
the organization. Two hypotheses follow:
Hypothesis 8a: The level of a manager's need-based monitoring of a peer will be positively associated with supervisor assessments of the manager's performance.
Hypothesis 8b: The level of a manager's interpersonal citizenship behavior directed toward a peer will be positively associated with supervisor assessments of the manager's performance.
Performance enhancement is likely to be a principal motivator for needbased monitoring. Need-based monitoring arises when individuals feel responsible for the needs of others and wish to respond to those needs (Clark
et al., 1989). Pearce and Gregerson argued that "felt responsibility is a psychological state that may play an important role in numerous aspects of job
performance and deserves further research attention" (1991: 843). Indeed,
need-based monitoring and assistance behavior that addresses work-related
needs should enhance peer performance. Two hypotheses complete the
theoretical framework:
Hypothesis 9a: The level of a manager's need-based monitoring of a peer will be positively associated with supervisor assessments of the peer's performance.
Hypothesis 9b: The level of a manager's interpersonal citizenship behavior directed toward a peer will be positively associated with supervisor assessments of the
peer's performance.
METHODS
Respondents
A sample of 194 managers and professionals, including men and women
from various industries, reported on cross-functional dyadic relationships

with peers at work. Individuals enrolled in, and alumni of, the executive
master's of business administration (EMBA) program of a major university in
southern California were requested to participate and to nominate peers
from work to participate with them. In examining relations among middleand upper-level managers, I focused on relations of lateral interdependence
(Sayles, 1979), where the impact of trust's presence or absence was expected
to be pronounced (Thompson, 1967).
Each EMBA affiliate agreeing to participate nominated two peers, so
triads were formed. Triad members separately completed surveys describing
various aspects of their working relationships with one another. Respondents provided two forms of data: (1) information concerning one triad member from the perspective of a focal manager, and (2) information concerning
the second triad member from the perspective of a peer. Data collected from
respondents were combined to form manager-peer dyad records. Of the 197
individuals initially contacted, 80 agreed to participate, a 41 percent acceptance rate. Given the level of commitment involved (questionnaire response,
as well as nominating peers), this response rate is well within accepted
limits. The nominated peers were not associated with the EMBA program,
and the response rate at the second stage of the study was 81 percent (194 of
240 EMBA students, alumni, and nominated peers). From the data collected,
I constructed 175 complete manager-peer dyad records, which formed the
basis for the present research. The initial contacts also identified one person,
in most cases a superior, familiar with the performance of all triad members
to provide performance information; the superior's response rate was 86
percent.
The respondents were, for the better part, mature (an average age of 38
years), well-educated (57 percent with some graduate training, 28 percent
with undergraduate degrees) individuals with considerable organizational
experience (an average professional tenure of 11.7 years). The profile of
respondents by age and gender corresponds well with that of the population
of EMBA students and alumni (average age 37 years, 74.8 percent men).
Although further information on the population from which respondents
were drawn was not available, it appeared likely that they were representative of the population.
Procedures
Initial contacts agreeing to participate in this study were directed to
think of peers (not supervisors or subordinates), from functional areas different from their own, with whom they had significant work-related interaction. After a contact identified three to five people with whom he or she
"worked the best" and three to five with whom he or she "worked less well,"
the individual selected one person from each list to participate in the study
with him or her. The working relationships examined were task-oriented,
not limited to close friendships, and varied along the critical dimensions of
trust. By stipulating that the people chosen should interact with one another
at work, I ensured the existence of three separate dyads in each organiza-

<-----Page 12----->McAllister

tion.1 I used a randomization procedure to assign individuals to focal manager-peer dyads and to allocate reporting roles within dyads. The statistical
independence of observations was maintained by having no respondents
provide information from the perspective of one role (focal manager or peer)
for more than one dyad.2
Measures
Except for the performance data provided by superiors, dyad members
provided all data for this study. Given the dyad-specific nature of the information involved, I considered these sources most authoritative. Focal managers reported on peer trustworthiness and behavioral responses to peers
(control-based monitoring, defensive behavior, need-based monitoring, and
citizenship behavior). Peers provided exogenous data (interaction frequency, citizenship behavior, reliable role performance, educational attainment, and ethnic background).
Affect- and cognition-based trust. A new measure to assess affect- and
cognition-based trust levels was developed for use in this study. The measure consists of 11 items, 6 assessing levels of cognition-based trust, and 5
assessing affect-based trust; respondents indicated, on a scale ranging from
1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), their agreement with various statements about a specific peer at work.
Drawing on a review of the literature and on available measures of
interpersonal trust (Cook & Wall, 1980; Johnson-George & Swap, 1982; Rempel et al., 1985; Rotter, 1971), I created an initial pool of 48 items. Eleven
organizational behavior scholars, provided with definitions of affect- and
cognition-based trust, classified these items as tapping cognition-based trust,
affect-based trust, both forms of trust, or neither form of trust. Based on an
analysis of expert evaluations, I created a subset of 20 unambiguous items,
1

The procedure used here is similar to that used by Tsui (1984). Manipulation checks
revealed that it was effective in controlling self-selection tendencies and building variation
along the critical trust dimensions. Nominating individuals expressed greater affect- and cognition-based trust in peers selected from the people with whom they worked best than in those
with whom they worked less well (pairwise t-tests, p < .001). Also, nominated peers from the
first list expressed greater affect- and cognition-based trust in the nominating individuals than
did peers from the second list (pairwise t-tests, p < .05).
2
By random assignment, triad members were assigned roles as respondents (1, 2, or 3). The
three focal manager -> peer dyads addressed were as follows: 1 -> 2, 2 -> 3, and 3 -* 1. Thus,
respondent 1 provided information from the perspective of a focal manager for his or her
relationship with respondent 2 and information from the perspective of a peer for his or her
relationship with respondent 3. Although I collected complete data for all relationships within
each triad, dyad-specific data collected for use in hypothesis testing were collected first. By
collecting respondent l's assessment of his or her trust in respondent 2 before collecting information on his or her trust in respondent 3, the relevant assessment received was absolute rather
than comparative. This method allowed efficient use of respondents (data concerning three
dyads were collected from each set of three respondents) and maintained independence of
observations. Further, parallel data collected but not used in hypothesis testing could be used
for preliminary analyses of new measures developed in the study.

10 items for each form of trust. I used results of an exploratory factor analysis
of pretest data from a group of employed M.B.A. and undergraduate business
students to further reduce the measure to the 11 strongest-loading items.
Table 1 gives the wording and confirmatory analysis results for this trust
measure and for the behavioral response measures, which are discussed in
the next section. Reliability estimates (Cronbach's alphas) for the cognitionand affect-based trust measures are .91 and .89, respectively.
Behavioral response measures. The questionnaire contained 25 items
designed to measure behavioral responses associated with trusting or distrusting peers. Respondents reported the extent to which they agreed that
certain actions described their behavior toward a specific peer on a sevenpoint scale (1, strongly disagree, to 7, strongly agree). Fourteen items measuring control-based monitoring, defensive behavior, and need-based monitoring were original to the present study, developed from a review of the literature and pretested on the group described above. Eleven items assessed
citizenship behavior, 6 of which were drawn from Williams and Anderson's
(1991) measure and rephrased to address assistance to specific individuals
rather than organization members in general and 5 of which were developed
to more fully tap the domain of the construct.
Initial exploratory factor analyses were conducted on parallel data that
were collected but not used to test hypotheses in the present research (see
footnote 1). I extracted four factors with acceptable psychometric properties
(eigenvalue greater than 1.0, ax > .60) and retained them for confirmatory
analysis with the present respondents: control-based monitoring and defensive behavior items together (factor 1), citizenship behavior with strong affiliative content (factor 2), citizenship behavior involving congenial assistance (factor 3), and need-based monitoring (factor 4).
To assess the adequacy of the derived trust and behavioral response
measures for use with the present research sample and to test the discriminant validity of trust and behavioral response measures, I conducted a confirmatory factor analysis using LISREL 7 (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1989). I
computed the comparative fit index (CFI), a fit measure that prevents the
underestimation of fit likely to occur in small samples, to assess the fit of the
factor structure to the data (Bentler, 1990) and examined correlations among
factors to assess the discriminant validity of measures. Table 1 reports results.
Overall, the model fit the data well (CFI = .90). All factor loadings
(lambdas) on specified factors were significant (t > 1.96). Reliability estimates (a) for affiliative citizenship behavior, assistance-oriented citizenship
behavior, need-based monitoring, and monitoring and defensive behavior
measures were .79, .85, .69, and .87, respectively. However, several correlations among latent constructs were considerable, with off-diagonal elements
in the phi-matrix exceeding .60.
Because I obtained trust and behavioral response measures from a single
source, it was important to demonstrate substantive differences between
these measures. Within the LISRELframework, discriminant validity can be

assessed in part by constraining a single phi coefficient (4ij) to 1.0, refitting
the model, and testing the resulting change in the chi-square measure of
model fit (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988; Bagozzi & Yi, 1988). I conducted this
analysis for each of four correlations exceeding .60. With one exception,
constraining ij to 1.0 resulted in a significant worsening in model fit, indicating a real difference in the measures. The relationship between cognitionbased trust and monitoring and defensive behavior measures was found to
be -.85, and the constrained-coefficient model did not yield a change in
model fit (AX2 = .71, df = 1, n.s.). Because monitoring and defensive behavior could not be empirically distinguished from negative cognition-based
trust, I decided to retain the cognition-based trust measure and exclude the
monitoring and defensive behavior measure from further use in this study.
Exogenous variables. Reliable role performance was measured with four
items drawn from Williams and Anderson's (1991) measure of organizationdirected citizenship behavior and in-role behavior. Respondents assessed,
on a seven-point scale ranging from 1, "almost never," to 7, "almost always,"
the extent to which each behavior described was characteristic of their behavior on the job. Frequency of interaction was measured with four items
adapted from an instrument developed by Wilson (1988). Respondents described the frequency of various forms of their work-related interaction with
a focal manager on a seven-point scale ranging from 1 (once or twice in the
last six months) to 7 (many times daily). Citizenship behavior, affiliative and
assistance-based, was measured with items identical to those used for focal
manager citizenship behavior.
Table 2 reports confirmatory factor analysis results for the exogenous
scales and item wordings. The four-factor solution provides an adequate fit
for the data (CFI = .90, t > 1.96, all loadings). Reliability estimates for
interaction frequency, peer affiliative citizenship behavior, peer assistanceoriented citizenship behavior, and peer reliable role performance are .91,
.81, .82, .77, respectively.
Demographic data, including education level, age, gender, and ethnicwere
collected to develop a basic demographic profile of the responity,
dents. Further, I used these data to derive measures of cultural-ethnic and
gender similarity, and professional status. A binary variable for culturalethnic similarity was created, with focal manager-peer dyads whose members reported similar ethnic backgrounds (e.g., white-white, HispanicHispanic) coded 1 and those whose members reported different ethnic backgrounds coded 0. I created a similar binary measure for similarity in gender
and one for the assessment of professional standing (attended a university at
the master's or doctoral level = 1, at most an undergraduate degree = 0).
This breakdown was appropriate because only 16 percent of the respondents
did not already possess some sort of four-year university degree.
Performance. Tsui's three-item measure of reputational effectiveness
(Tsui, 1984) and one additional item were used to measure focal manager
and peer performance. Supervisors were asked to consider the total job,
including job-specified duties, additional activities not formally required,

framework, I fitted 11 nested models, each incorporating different assumptions about model parameters, to the data.
The first two models were used to assess measurement properties. An
initial null model specifying no relations among observable variables represented the poorest-fitting model and provided a baseline for computation of
the normed comparative fit index. A measurement model with the paths
between observable variables and associated latent constructs freed and latent constructs allowed to correlate freely was fitted to the data. As during
measure development, I assessed the discriminant validity of constructs by
constraining correlations among constructs to zero and examining the
change in chi-square.
To test hypotheses concerning the structural relationships among variables, I took a nested-models approach (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988). I arrayed nine nested structural models between the measurement model-the
best-fitting model, with structural relationships among latent constructs asthe null model and compared them
sumed to be perfectly estimated-and
using chi-square difference tests. First, the theoretical model, with all paths
not specifically hypothesized to exist fixed to zero, was specified. Figure 2
presents the structural relationships in this model from which four variables-defensive
behavior, control-based monitoring, social similarity, and
professional status-are omitted. The combined measure of monitoring and
defensive behavior was found to be insufficiently distinct from cognition-

based trust to warrant inclusion, and the categorical measures of social similarity (gender and ethnic background) and professional status were not suitable for inclusion within the LISREL model.3
In addition, three constrained-parameter and five relaxed-parameter
models were fitted to the data. For the constrained models, I fixed the sets of
relationships hypothesized to exist to zero and assessed chi-square difference tests between these models and the theoretical model. These tests indicated whether these models included paths that should have been omitted. The three constrained-parameter models can be specified as follows: in
model C1, paths from exogenous variables to affect- and cognition-based
trust are fixed to zero (Y11 = 'Y12 = '13 = '24 = 0); in model C2, paths from
cognition- and affect-based trust to behavioral response measures are fixed
to zero (P31 =

341

= p51 = 0); and in model

C3, paths from behavioral

response to performance measures are fixed to zero (P63 = 364 = 165 = 173
=
=
P74
75 = 0). Examining the impact of sets of constrained paths in
addition to examining the significance of individual paths is important
where the constructs involved are significantly correlated (Niehoff & Moorman, 1993). A significant difference in fit between structural models would
provide support for fundamental relationships hypothesized in the model.
For the relaxed-parameter models, I freed sets of structural paths fixed
to zero in the theoretical model and conducted chi-square difference tests.
These tests indicate the potential importance of relationships not yet specified. The five relaxed-parameter models examined can be specified as follows: in model R1, additional paths from exogenous variables to affect- and
cognition-based trust are freed (721', 22, '23, Y14); in model R2, additional
paths from cognition- and affect-based trust to behavioral response variables
are freed (332, 142, 152); in model R3, paths from exogenous variables to
behavioral response variables are freed (731, '32' 733, '34, Y41, '42' y43, '44,
Y51, Y52 'Y53, 754); in model R4, paths from trust to performance are freed (161,
and in model R5, paths from exogenous variables to perforP72);
162,
P71,
mance are freed (761', 62', 63' 764' '71', 72' y73, 74)'
Given my focus on theory testing, I made no attempt to develop a bestfitting model by adding paths based on modification indexes, deleting nonsignificant variables and paths, allowing observable variables to load on
more than one latent factor, allowing correlated measurement errors, and so
forth. It should also be noted that reversals in causal ordering and reciprocal
causation, especially as they concern the relationship between cognitionand affect-based trust, were not examined.4 Nevertheless, within the nested-

PRELIS provides for the computation of "polychoric" correlation coefficients between categorical variables and "polyserial" correlation coefficients between categorical and continuous variables as substitutes for Pearson product-moment correlations, but this procedure requires a sample of more than 200 subjects and considerable computational power (Joreskog & S6rbom, 1988, 1989).

models framework, considering constrained-parameter models allowed for
detection of potential errors of commission (specifying unnecessary relationships) and considering relaxed-parameter models allowed for identification
of potential errors of omission (excluding relationships that might have theoretical and practical significance). A specific advantage of the nested-models
approach to theory testing is its potential for exploring relationships, not yet
included in a model, that may have theoretical relevance (Anderson & Gerbing, 1988).
In addition to structural equation modeling, ordinary-least-squares
(OLS) regression analysis was used to examine Hypotheses 2b (the relationship between cultural-ethnic similarity and cognition-based trust) and 2c
(the relationship between a peer's professional status and a manager's cognition-based trust). I regressed cognition-based trust on all causally prior
(exogenous) variables. For this analysis, I computed scales as the average of
their indicator items. Multiple regression analysis is well established as an
acceptable method for path computation in path analysis (Pedhazur, 1982).
RESULTS
Assessment of the Measurement Model
Table 4 presents correlations among all study variables. Table 5 reports
results from the nested-models analysis, including structural path coefficients and model fit statistics.
The measurement model represents a confirmatory factor analysis of all
scales used in the study. The normed comparative fit assessments for the
confirmatory factor analyses of portions of the model (see Tables 1, 2, and 3)
all met or exceeded .90, a generally accepted standard for acceptability, but
the comparative fit index for the measurement model was .87. This finding
mirrors Niehoff and Moorman's (1993) observation that as the number of
latent variables included in a model increases, a researcher's ability to fit
models, even those with strong theoretical support, decreases. Given the fact
that this analysis included 11 distinct latent constructs, the achieved model
fit is reasonable.
Four correlations among latent measures exceeded .60: the relationships
between peer affiliative and assistance-oriented citizenship behavior, focal
manager affiliative and assistance-oriented citizenship behavior, focalmanager-reported affect- and cognition-based trust, and focal manager affectbased trust and affiliative citizenship behavior. In part, these excessive coefficients reflect the fact that measures were obtained from a single source.
As in initial scale development, I assessed discriminant validity by constraining phi coefficients ((ij) for pairs of constructs to 1.0 and conducting
have an instrument, an exogenous variable affecting one but not the corresponding variable
(Kenny,1979; Schaubroeck,1990). In the case of the relationshipbetween affect-and cognitionbased trust, I found no significant instrumentfor cognition-basedtrust and accordingly, could
not examine reciprocal causation.

chi-square difference tests. For each pair of constructs, constraining the correlation to 1.0 made model fit significantly worse. This finding that these
measures are better understood as distinct than joined, although not ruling
out the presence of common method variance, supports the argument that
method covariation alone cannot adequately account for the relationships
observed (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986).
Assessment of the Structural Model
Results from the nested-models analysis (Table 5) indicate that the theoretical model provides only a limited explanation for the structural relationships among the variables. The measurement model's comparative fit index
of .87 approximates the fit that would be achieved (given the present data)
with the structural portion of the LISREL model perfectly fitted. Accordingly, the theoretical model's index of .84 may appear reasonable. Yet a
chi-square difference test comparing the two models indicates that the measurement model provides a significantly better fit to the data than does the
theoretical model (AX2 = 189, Adf = 58, p < .001).
Figure 3 presents significant standardized path coefficients for the theoretical model. Also included are error terms (cs) for the structural equations.
In standardized form, error coefficients represent the proportion of variance
in each equation not accounted for in the structural model. Quite clearly,
portions of the model fit the data better than others-for instance, 54 percent
of the variance in affect-based trust was accounted for in the theoretical
model, but only 10 percent of the variance in peer performance was explained. The theoretical framework may best be viewed as addressing antecedents and consequences of affect-based trust and not as comprehensively
explaining the antecedents of performance.
Results from the nested-models analysis clarify the nature of the theoretical model's misspecification. In general, results of chi-square difference
tests between that model and the constrained models indicate that fundamental relationships do exist between peer attributes and a focal manager's
trust in peers, between the manager's trust in peers and his or her behavioral
responses, and between those responses and performance outcomes. For
each of the three constrained models, fit was significantly worse than the fit
of the theoretical model. Thus, the paths that were included in the model
should have been included. On the other hand, model fit assessments were
significantly improved with the freeing of additional paths; those from focal
manager trust beliefs (affect- and cognition-based) to behavioral responses,
from antecedents to behavioral responses, and from trust to performance.
Thus, considering additional relationships among study variables might enrich the model.
The Distinction Between Cognition- and Affect-Based Trust
Strong support was found for the distinction between cognition-based
and affect-based trust predicted in Hypothesis 1. First, exploratory findings

with parallel data and confirmatory analysis results with the present sample
(Table 1) indicate that the two-factor representation of affect- and cognitionbased trust fits the data well. The two factors were shown to be reliable.
Second, the pattern of relationships between the forms of trust and the other
variables included in the study differ considerably. In the theoretical model,
peer affiliative citizenship behavior was found to be positively associated
with focal manager affect-based trust in peers but unrelated to cognitionbased trust. Combining insights derived from the theoretical model with
observations from the relaxed model in which additional paths between
focal manager trust in peers and behavioral responses are freed suggests that
although a focal manager's affect-based trust in peers is positively associated
with need-based monitoring of peers and assistance-oriented citizenship
behavior, cognition-based trust may be negatively associated with these variables. Thus, affect-based trust and cognition-based trust represent distinct
forms of interpersonal trust.
Interpersonal Hypotheses: Relating Peer Attributes and Behavior to
Trust Perceptions
In general, peer attributes and behavior were found to be related to focal
manager assessments of peer trustworthiness (Table 5). Model fit assessments were appreciably worse with paths from hypothesized antecedents to
trust constrained to zero; the change in chi-square between the theoretical
model and the first constrained model was 36, p < .001. Further analysis
indicated, as is apparent in Figure 3, that relationships between peer attributes and affect-based trust in particular explain this finding.
It was hypothesized that a manager's cognition-based trust in peers
would be greater under three conditions: when peers exhibited high levels of
reliable role performance (Hypothesis 2a), when the parties had culturalethnic similarity (Hypothesis 2b), and when peers had strong professional
credentials (Hypothesis 2c). Hypothesis 2a was examined in the structural
equation assessment of the theoretical model (Figure 3). The path from reliable role performance to focal manager cognition-based trust was not significant. Hypotheses 2b and 2c were examined in the supplementary OLS
regression analysis and were also not supported. Regression analysis results,
in which level of cognition-based trust was regressed on all causally prior
variables, were not significant (F = 1.60, n.s.). Thus, findings do not support
Hypotheses 2a, 2b, and 2c.
Hypotheses 3a and 3b, however, were strongly supported. I hypothesized that focal managers would express strong affect-based trust in peers
engaging in interpersonal citizenship behavior (Hypothesis 3a) and in those
with whom the managers interacted frequently (Hypothesis 3b). Significant,
positive paths from interaction frequency and peer affiliative citizenship
behavior to affect-based trust (y1l = .22, p < .01; y12 = .24, p < .05)
supported predictions. Assistance-based citizenship behavior, however, was
not found to be associated with affect-based trust.

Intrapersonal Hypotheses: Relationships Among Trust Perceptions and
Behavioral Responses
Hypotheses 4, 5, and 6, addressing relationships among focal manager
beliefs about peer trustworthiness and focal manager behavior, were generally supported. First, the hypothesis that cognition-based trust would be a
positive predictor of affect-based (Hypothesis 4) was strongly supported (112
= .63, p < .001). Second, results of the nested-models analysis demonstrated that managers' assessments of peer trustworthiness were associated
with the managers' behavior toward their peers. Fit assessments were appreciably worse with paths associating focal manager trust perceptions with
focal manager behavioral responses (P31, 141, and ,51) constrained to
zero (Ax2 = 198, p < .001). As Hypotheses 5a and 5b, concerning the behavioral consequences of cognition-based trust, were not tested, this finding
is best understood as substantiating relationships from affect-based trust to
its behavioral consequences only.
Results supported the hypotheses predicting that the affect-based trust
focal managers expressed in peers would be positively associated with the
managers' need-based monitoring of peers (Hypothesis 6a) and interpersonal
citizenship behavior toward them (Hypothesis 6b). Paths from focal manager
affect-based trust in peers to need-based monitoring, affiliative citizenship
behavior, and assistance-oriented citizenship behavior were, as shown in
Figure 3, all significant

Performance Implications Hypotheses
In general, the behavioral consequences of trust were found to be related
to supervisor assessments of performance. As the results of the nested-models comparison of the theoretical model with the third constrained model
indicate (Table 5), model fit assessments were appreciably worse with paths
from behavioral

(P63,

P65, P73, P74, and P75) constrained to zero (AX2 = 29, p < .001). Hypotheses 7, 8, and 9 address specific relationships among behavioral response
and performance variables. Again, as Hypotheses 7a and 7b were not tested
in this analysis, findings are best understood as substantiating the relationship between the behavioral consequences of the affect-based trust and performance outcome measures.
Results also only partially supported Hypotheses 8a and 8b. Focal manager need-based monitoring of peers was not positively associated with supervisor assessments of focal manager performance as hypothesized (Hypothesis 8a). Nevertheless, consistent with Hypothesis 8b, the path from
focal manager affiliative citizenship behavior directed toward peers to supervisor assessments of focal manager performance was significant (174 =
.52, p < .001). An interesting, nonhypothesized finding was a significant
negative path from assistance-based citizenship behavior to focal manager

performance

(p75 =

p < .01). It may be that people see expressive

acts

<-----Page 28----->1995

of interpersonal help and assistance serving more of a maintenance than a
task function as aiding performance but see other practical acts of help and
assistance as detracting from performance. This anomalous finding suggests
that organizations may particularly value the expressive qualities of interpersonal citizenship behavior. It may also be that expressive conduct is more
salient to supervisors than task-oriented assistance.
Hypotheses addressing the relationship between focal manager behavior
and peer performance (Hypothesis 9a and Hypothesis 9b) were not supported. Nested-models analysis results do not show focal manager needbased monitoring of peers to be positively associated with peer performance.
Indeed, for the theoretical model, focal manager need-based monitoring of
peers was found to be negatively associated with peer performance (63 =
-.20, p < .05). This finding may reflect manager's tendency to look for opportunities to assist peers in real need of assistance (signified by their having
low performance assessments). That is, the true causal ordering may be the
reverse of that depicted in Figure 2.
Consistent with Hypothesis 9b, a significant positive relationship between focal manager affiliative citizenship behavior and peer performance
was observed in the theoretical model (p64 = .31, p < .01). Yet when I
examined this relationship at the same time as possible direct relationships
between trust and performance outcomes, in the fourth relaxed model, this
path was nonsignificant.
In summary, results did not support the hypotheses concerning the
antecedents of cognition-based trust (2a through 2c). They did support hypotheses concerning the antecedents of affect-based trust (3a, 3b, and 4). The
hypotheses concerning the behavioral consequences and performance implications of cognition-based trust were not tested. The hypotheses concerning the behavioral consequences of affect-based trust (6a and 6b) were supported. Partial support emerged for two of four hypotheses concerning the
performance implications of affect-based trust.
DISCUSSION
The Nature of Interpersonal Trust
The findings of this research indicate that the beliefs of managers about
the trustworthiness of peers can be measured along two dimensions, the
extent of affect-based trust and the extent of cognition-based trust. In general, levels of cognition-based trust were higher than levels of affect-based
trust, a finding consistent with the understanding that some level of cognition-based trust is necessary for affect-based trust to develop. Further, results
indicate that, although cognition- and affect-based trust may be causally
connected, each form of trust functions in a unique manner and has a distinct pattern of association to antecedent and consequent variables.
More theoretical work is needed to address the factors that can influence
the development of cognition-based trust; such information should enrich

peer performance were found to be strongly associated with a focal manager's cognition-based beliefs about peer trustworthiness (r = .40, p < .001).
Quite likely, what others think about the dependability of a peer will influence personal evaluations of that peer. Future research will need to address
reputational effects.
Observed differences in the pattern of relationships between forms of
trust and predictor and consequence variables underscore the importance
of considering not only the level but also the form of trust. In past research
on citizenship behavior in organizations, authors have argued that trust and
citizenship behavior are positively associated (Organ, 1990; Podsakoff et al.,
1990). The present research indicates that there may be negative relationships between a focal manager's cognition-based trust in a peer and his or
her affiliative- and assistance-oriented citizenship behavior toward the peer

Interpersonal Trust and Coordination
Focal managers expressing high affect-based trust in peers were shown
to be more inclined to look for opportunities to meet peers' work-related
needs and to engage in productive intervention. In the complex, uncertain
situations involving reciprocal interdependence, typical in managerial and
professional work, traditional mechanisms of coordination (rules, plans,
routines, and such) are usually inadequate as contingencies cannot always
be properly planned for (Katz, 1964; Thompson, 1967). Under these conditions, coordination is a continuous process in which all the actors involved
adjust their actions to one another (Follett, 1937) and self-initiated mechanisms of coordination are critical. Need-based monitoring and citizenshipbehavior represent self-initiated steps that can promote coordination under
turbulent conditions.
Findings did not generally support the hypotheses addressing the performance implications of behavioral responses to trust. One notable exception was the positive relationship found between focal manager affiliative
citizenship behavior and supervisor assessments of focal manager performance. Interestingly enough, focal manager assistance-based citizenship behavior was negatively associated with supervisor assessments of focal manager performance. As defined here, affiliative citizenship behavior differed
from assistance-oriented citizenship behavior in that it involved personal
5 This
finding may not be all that surprising. An individual who sees a peer as dependable
and reliable, competent and capable, may have little reason to offer assistance, as little assistance appears to be needed.

53

assistance, was affect-laden and expressive, and served more of a maintenance than a task function. The logic behind managers' placing greater value
on affiliative citizenship behavior than on more practical acts of interpersonal help and assistance merits systematic attention in future research.
The Social Fabric of Managerial Working Relationships
The current findings demonstrate the importance of affect-based trust
relationships and the expressive qualities of interpersonal behavior. These
findings extend current thinking on the nature of personal relationships
among managers and professionals in organizations. Management scholars
have recognized for some time that a considerable amount of managerial
work is accomplished through interpersonal interaction and that the nature
of the interpersonal relationships between managers and peers can determine their ability to get work accomplished (Gabarro, 1990; Mintzberg, 1973;
Sayles, 1979). Less acknowledged, however, has been the affective element
of these interpersonal relationships. The understanding has been that "because working relationships generally exist to accomplish tasks while social
relationships [do] not, task achievement, task instrumentality and taskspecific competence are especially important in work relationships, while
affect and self-disclosure are less important" (Gabarro, 1990: 79). Given this
view of affective factors as being somehow less important, their role in
ongoing working relationships has remained unaddressed. In contrast, the
focus here was on the inherent social nature of managerial work and on
enhancing understanding of working relationships in organizations by recognizing their commonalities with other types of social relationships.
The expressive qualities of behavior in organizations should receive
more systematic treatment in future research. Findings from the present
theoretical model show that peer affiliative citizenship behavior in particular, rather than citizenship behavior in general, is associated with managers'
affect-based trust in peers and that peer affiliative citizenship behavior is
associated with managers' affiliative citizenship behavior only indirectly,
through affect-based trust. Exploratory findings from a relaxed-parameter
model with paths from antecedents of trust to managers' behavioral responses freed show peer assistance-based citizenship behavior to be positively associated with managers' assistance-oriented citizenship behavior
(y53 = .37, p < .001) but not with affect-based trust. It appears that managers
distinguish between instrumental assistance from peers, which generates
debts, and assistance from peers that is primarily demonstrative or expressive. As Kahn (1993) observed, exchanges of resources, time, information,
counseling, and services can all serve more than instrumental purposes and,
with appropriate affective content, can function as essential mechanisms of
social support. In a study of interpersonal dyadic relationships within network-form organizations, Larson quoted an executive as stating, "The [extra]
effort to help is as important as the help itself. The relationship has to be
attended to" (1992: 89).
It appears that it is not unusual for managers, even those from different

<-----Page 31----->54

areas of functional specialization and different organizational units, to develop relationships of care and concern for one another and for such sentiments to constitute an important basis for trust. Indeed, over 60 percent of
the focal managers in this study, discussing their beliefs about their trust in
peers, believed that, to some extent, they could talk freely with a specific
peer and know that he or she would want to listen and respond constructively and caringly. Approximately 50 percent of the respondents believed
that both they and the specific peers had made significant emotional investments in the working relationships and that both would feel a sense of loss
if one or the other were transferred and they could no longer work together.
These findings support Seabright and colleagues' contention that "it is
hard to imagine the development of highly specific relationship capital that
does not engender some element of social ties" (1992: 155). Granovetter's
general observation that "continuing economic relations often become overlaid with social content that carries strong expectations of trust and abstention from opportunism" (1985: 490) can be given added specificity-the
sentiments of care and concern that connect individuals provide a principal
foundation for this trust. Despite the prevalence of relationships of affectbased trust, very little theory or data exist to either guide understanding of
the implications of such trust relationships for the individuals involved and
their organizations or to distinguish these relationships from those based
solely on cognition-based trust. The present research is an initial step toward
articulating a theoretical framework for future research on how relationships
of affect-based trust between managers in organizations influence their behavior and performance.
Study Limitations
The present findings should be interpreted in light of the study's limitations. First, because almost 75 percent of the study's participants were
highly educated men, the findings are best interpreted as evidence concerning working relationships between such individuals. Further research is
needed to establish the generalizability of these findings to other sorts of
working relationships. Second, given the cross-sectional design, causality
cannot be established from this study alone. My focus was on examining
whether the pattern of relationships among variables was consistent with a
specific causal understanding (Bobko, 1990). The present findings are an
initial step on the road to causality determination. Supplemental longitudinal field studies and controlled laboratory experiments will both prove useful in future research. Finally, the disciplined confirmatory assessment of
the theoretical framework through the nested-models analysis indicates that
there remains considerable room for improvement in the fit of the theoretical
model. Insights from the relaxed-parameter analyses, including possible
negative paths from cognition-based trust in peers to need-based monitoring,
affiliative citizenship behavior, and assistance-oriented citizenship behavior, indicate ways in which the model can be enriched, but these insights

<-----Page 32----->1995

must be understood as exploratory. Further theoretical and empirical work
is needed to demonstrate that these findings are not unique to this sample
and study.
Conclusion
This article assesses a theoretical framework for studying interpersonal
trust in organizations, the factors influencing the development of trust relationships, and the mechanisms by which trust influences behavior in interdependent relationships and ultimately, the efficiency with which coordinated action is maintained. Empirical findings from an initial test of the
framework support the fundamental distinction made between two principal forms of trust and the argument that each form should be understood.
Further, the results of the research point to the importance of understanding
the affective qualities of working relationships and the expressive qualities
of various forms of interpersonal conduct.
Over fifteen years ago Burns (1977) expressed concern over existing
conceptions of the role of the informal social relationships in organizations.
Burns noted that Roethlisberger and Dickson saw the informal organization
"as a receptacle for observations about the behavior, relationships, the sentiments and beliefs . . . taken to be irrelevant to the formal organization or
incompatible with it," and that Barnard saw it as "an essential adjunct to
formal organization." For Burns the theoretical and practical relevance of
the informal organization went much further. He argued that "essential organizational processes involving actual operations and work are grounded in
the person-to-person relationships formed by people at work, and as such
constitute the necessary counterpart and complement to the control systems
maintained by the management structure" (1977: 308).
In the present research, informal relations have been examined with the
understanding that they are central to the real work of organizations. Findings establish the affective foundations upon which trust between managers
is built as an essential counterpart to other foundations for interpersonal
trust and highlight affect-based trust's role in facilitating effective coordinated action in organizations.
