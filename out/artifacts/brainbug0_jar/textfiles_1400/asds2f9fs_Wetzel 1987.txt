CAPITAL MARKET:

Risk capital is a resource essential to the formation and growth of entrepreneurial ventures. In a society that is increasingly dqoendent upon innovation and entrepreneurship for its economic vitality, the performance
of the venture capital markets is a matter of fundamental concern to
entrepreneurs, venture investors and to public ofJicials. This article deals
with the informal venture capital market, the market in which entrepreneurs
raise equity-type financing from private investors, (business angels). The informal venture capital
market is virtually invisible and often misunderstood. It is composed of a diverse and diffuse population
of individuals of means; many of whom have created their own successful ventures. There are no
directories of individual venture investors and no public records of their investment transactions.
Consequently, the informal venture capital market poses many unanswered questions.
The author discusses two aspects of the informal venture capital market: questions of scale and
market efficiency. The discussion draws upon existing research to extract and synthesize data that
provide a reasonable basis for inferences about scale and ejiciency.
Private venture investors tend to be self-made individuals with substantial business andhnancial
experience and with a net worth of $1 million or more. The author estimates that the number of private
venture investors in the United States is at least 250,000, of whom about 100,000 are active in any
given year. By providing seed capital for ventures that subsequently raise funds from professional
venture investors or in the public equity markets and equityhnancing for privately-heldfirms
that are
growing faster than internal cashjow can support, private investors Jill gaps in the institutional equity
markets.
The author estimates that private investors manage a portfolio of venture investments aggregating
in the neighborhood of $50 billion, about twice the capital managed by professional venture investors.
By participating in smaller transactions, private investorshnance over$ve times as many entrepreneurs
as professional venture investors; 20,000 or more jrms per year compared to two or three thousand.
The typical angel-backed venture raises about $250,000 from three or more private investors.
Despite the apparent scale of the informal venture capital market, the author cites evidence

that the market is relatively inefficient. It is a market characterized by limited information about
investors and investment opportunities. Furthermore, many entrepreneurs and private investors are
unfamiliar with the techniques of successful venture financing. The author’s scale and efficiency
inferences, coupled with evidence documenting gaps between private and social returns from innovation, prompt questions about public as well as private initiatives to enhance the eflciency of the
informal venture capitul market.

INTRODUCTION
Entrepreneurial ventures require access to capital; venture capital in particular. Consequently,
the performance of the venture capital markets is a matter of concern to entrepreneurs and
to venture investors. These concerns extend to issues of public policy in a society that
increasingly depends upon entrepreneurs and venture investors for its economic vitality.
The market for venture capital consists of three major segments:
l

the public equity market,

l

the professional

l

the market for informal

venture capital market,

and

venture capital.

The public equity market and the professional venture capital market are visible,
efficient, and well understood. The informal venture capital market, on the other hand, is
often misunderstood. It is composed of a virtually invisible population of individual investors
who provide equity-type financing for entrepreneurial
ventures of all types, including those
that ultimately raise funds from professional venture investors or the public equity market.
Despite their low profile, wealthy individuals, (business angels), appear to represent
the largest venture capital resource in the United States. There are, however, compelling
reasons to believe that the high cost of information about investors and investment opportunities, and limited familiarity with the techniques of successful venture investing, constrain
the flow of informal venture capital.
Unanswered questions about the market for informal venture capital include the number
and characteristics of individual venture investors; the size of the capital pool they control;
the intensity of their interest in venture investing; the investment decision models they
employ; the number and characteristics of the ventures they finance; the size and structure
of their investment transactions; the performance of their portfolios; the relative efficiency
of the informal venture capital market; and the extent of regional differences in the market
for informal venture capital. Scattered pieces of data suggest the answers to some of these
questions.
The following discussion deals with two issues: the scale of the informal venture capital
market and market efficiency. The discussion draws on existing research to extract and
synthesize data that provide a reasonable basis for inferences about scale and efficiency.
The article concludes with a discussion of Venture Capital Network, Inc. (VCN), an experimental effort to enhance the efficiency of the informal venture capital market.

ESTIMATES

A sense of the scale of the informal venture capital market provides the background for
addressing other questions. Readers who are uncomfortable
with inferences drawn from
limited data, data that are at best suggestive, will be uncomfortable
with the following
discussion. Better data do not exist.

Supply-Side Indicators
The supply side of the informal venture capital market is composed of a diverse and diffuse
population of individuals of means, many of whom have created their own successful
ventures. For discussion purposes, individual venture investors (business angels) are defined
as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Net worth over $1 million and annual income over $100 thousand.
Substantial business and financial experience.
Capable of evaluating the merits and risks of prospective investments.
Unaffiliated with portfolio ventures, i.e. excludes founders, friends and relatives.
Willing to take substantial financial risks to earn substantial returns.
Willing to commit funds for extended periods to earn substantial returns.

There are no directories of individual venture investors and no public records of their
investment transactions. Despite the lack of hard data, clues to the scale of informal venture
investing can be found.
Millionaires and Mega-Millionaires
U.S. News and World Report (1986), reported that the U.S. population included 833,000
millionaires at the end of 1985, and that the number would exceed one million by the end
of 1986. Based on these figures, millionaires comprise less than l/2 of 1% of the United
States population. The net worth of 95% of U.S. millionaires is between $1 million and
$10 million. The following excerpts from the article are pertinent to a discussion of informal
venture capital:
l

“The typical millionaire is a self-made entrepreneur in his early 60s-fewer than 10%
are under 40. He works 10 or 12 hour days and, more frequently than not, his
business caters to the ordinary needs of ordinary Americans.”

Case in point: Samuel Moore Walton, Bentonville, Arkansas, claimed by Forbes (1986)
to be the wealthiest individual in the United States, opened a discount store with his brother
James in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. He now operates 950 Wal-Mart stores. Walton Enterprises, the family investment company, is valued at $4.5 billion.
The Forbes Four Hundred ( 1986) richest people in America represent a combined net
worth of about $156 billion. Their average net worth is $390 million and the net worth of

<-----Page 3----->302

the 400th mega-millionaire
is $180 million. Compared to 80% of all millionaires
who
apparently are self-made, only 44% (174) of the Forbes Four Hundred built their fortunes
without benefit of a significant inheritance. The six wealthiest individuals on the Forbes list
are all self-made and represent a combined net worth in excess of $14 billion.
In a study of consumer finances, Avery and Elliehausen (1986) found that the net
worth of 1.3 million U.S. families (almost 2%) is at least $1 million. According to their
data, most wealth is saved out of accumulated earnings, not inherited. The wealth, income,
and asset distribution of the top 1% of U.S. households (840,000 families) are displayed in
Table 1 and provide an approximation of the potential supply of informal venture capital.
Based on the data in Table 1, 3 11,000 families (37% of the top 1% of U.S. households)
have invested $151 billion in non-public businesses in which they have no management
interest. The nature of these investments was not discussed by the authors. If one third could
be described as venture financing, existing informal venture investments are in the neighborhood of $50 billion. Credence is provided to this inference by Avery and Elliehausen’s
data describing attitudes toward financial risk and liquidity of the super rich (top l/2%) and
the veq rich (next l/2%). These data are displayed in Table 2.
Based on stated attitudes toward risk and liquidity and the fact that the top 1% of U.S.
households have invested over $150 billion in non-public businesses in which they have no
management interest, it is not unreasonable
to believe that venture-type financing in the
portfolios of the top 1% may be at least $50 billion.

Informal Risk Cupital in the Sunbelt
Research conducted by Applied Economics Group, Inc. (AEG) (1986) provides further clues
to the supply of informal venture capital. AEG examined how and where small firms in
SBA Regions III, IV, and VI obtain equity capital for start-up and growth. Regions III, IV,
and VI include Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania,
Virginia, and West
Virginia; Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee; and Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas respectively.
AEG estimated that Regions III, IV, and VI contain 99,000 informal venture investors.
In a typical year 68,700 of these individuals provide equity capital to entrepreneurial ventures,
an average of one $38,000 investment every eighteen months for each investor. The annual
dollar value of these investments totals $2.6 billion, ten times the capital invested in these
regions by venture capital firms. AEG’s data indicate that informal investors extend another

$2.5 billion to portfolio firms in the form of loans and loan guarantees. The typical firm in
AEG’s sample raised $220,500 of equity and near-equity financing, typically from three
informal investors.
Since Regions III, IV, and VI represent 28.6% of the U.S. population, extrapolation
suggests that there are about 345,000 informal venture investors in the United States, an
inference not inconsistent with Avery and Elliehousen’s data. AEG estimates the median
net worth of informal investors at $75O,OOO and their median family income at $70,000.
According to AEG’s data, informal investors commit some lo-24% of their net worth to
venture investments. If there are 345,000 informal venture investors in the U.S. with an
average net worth of $750,000, and with lo-24% of their net worth available for venture
investments, the aggregate informal venture capital pool is between $25 billion and $62
billion.

Demand-Side Indicators
The demand side of the informal venture capital market is almost as elusive as the supply
side. The ventures funded by individual investors appear to fall into two broad categories.
The first includes technology-based
inventors and start-up firms of all types requiring less
than $1 million of seed capital. A few of these ventures survive and grow fast enough to
become substantial companies in a short period of time, five years or less. These high
pofential ventures typically attract second and third round financing from professional venture
capital firms before being acquired by a larger company or undertaking a public stock
offering.
The second category is made up of established, privately-held firms that are growing
faster than internal cash flows and retained earnings can support. Seldom can even the most
profitable firms rely exclusively on retained earnings when growth rates exceed 25% per
year. The most dynamic small firms are growing at annual rates exceeding 100%. Between
1980 and 1984, sales growth for the Inc. 500 Fastest-Growing
Private Companies (1985)
averaged 94% per year.
Indications that self-made individuals play an important role in the financing of both
categories of ventures can be traced at least back to the 1960s.

Small Technology-Based

Firms

Baty (1964) found that wealthy individuals were the largest source of capital for new,
technology-based
companies. Baty found that individual investors were not only more likely
to supply initial risk funds than venture capital organizations, but were likely to supply them
on more liberal terms. He also discovered that initial investors in new, research-based
enterprises were predominantly
affluent individuals,
and that those who were self-made
tended to be more venturesome than those with inherited wealth. Self-made investors tended
to invest in the industries in which they had made their wealth.
Brophy ( 1982), examined sources of financial support for new, technology-based
firms
incorporated and operating from 1965-1970. In a sample of Boston-area firms, Brophy found
that private individuals (excluding founders, friends, and relatives) provided 14.3% of total
financing, SBICs and private venture capital firms provided 15.1%. Regional differences
were evident in Brophy’s data. Figures for a sample of Ann Arbor/Detroit firms were 15.7%
and 2.3% respectively.
Charles River Associates (CRA) (1976) examined the composition of external funds
received by small, technology-based
firms making initial public offerings from 1970-1974.
CRA found that unaffiliated individuals accounted for 15% of external funds while venture
capitalists accounted for 12%. When the data were segmented by stage (age of venture),
CRA found that unaffiliated individuals provided 17% of external funds during the start-up
year, while venture capitalists provided 11%. CRA excluded “individuals who act informally
as providers of venture funds” from their examination of capital market imperfections.
Yet
CRA speculated that “they may represent the largest source of venture capital in the country.”

Start-up Ventures
Shapero’s study (1983) of the initial financing of new ventures in Columbus, Ohio and
Louisville, Kentucky sheds more light on the characteristics of angels. Shaper0 collected
data from 33 private individuals
who had made investments in start-up or very young
companies. Shaper0 found that the individuals most likely to invest in new ventures were
those who had made it themselves,-first
generation money. He also found that the decision
to consider an investment is highly related to personal knowledge of the business field or
the entrepreneur, or a high regard for the third party who brought the investment opportunity
to the investor for review.

SEC Data
Two reports prepared by the U. S . Securities & Exchange Commission ( 1983, 1984)) support
the conclusion that individual investors are a significant source of risk capital. Corporate
private placements reported to the SEC in 1981 under Rule 146, exceeded $1 billion. A
sample of Form 146 filings revealed that corporate issuers were engaged primarily in high
technology or in other manufacturing and nonfinancial services. They were generally young
companies employing few workers. 87% of the investors in corporate issues were individuals
or personal trusts. Note that Rule 146 data exclude offerings exempt from filing because of
their intrastate nature (Rule 147), or financing by closely-held firms under small-offering
exemptions (Rules 240 and 242).
On April 15, 1982, Regulation D replaced the exemptive provisions of Rules 146,
240, and 242. Issuers claiming exemption under Regulation D during its first year offered

<-----Page 6----->INFORMAL CAPITAL MARKETS: SCALE AND EFFICIENCY

305

$15.5 billion of securities in over 7,200 filings. Corporations accounted for 43% of the value
($6.7 billion) and 32% of the offerings (2,304). Under Rule 504 of Regulation D (limited
offerings under $500,000), I, 103 corporations reported offering securities totalling $220
million. The typical corporate issuer under Rule 504 had five or fewer employees (60.7%)
and an operating history of two years or less (68.8%).

Scale Inferences
Drawing on the data cited above, some simple mental exercises suggest the scale of the
informal venture capital pool. It the average net worth of millionaires is between $1 million
and $2 million, then, excluding borrowed funds, the total wealth controlled by the one
million or more U.S. millionaires is between $1 trillion and $2 trillion. If the average
millionaire commits 10% of his or her net worth to venture investing, the total informal
venture capital pool is between $100 and $200 billion. If only one fourth of U.S. millionaires
have any interest in venture investing, the pool of informal venture capital controlled by
these 250,000 individuals lies in the $25-$50 billion range, about twice the capital managed
by professional venture investors.
It appears that each year over 100,000 individual investors finance between 20,000
and 50,000 firms for a dollar investment totalling between $5 billion and $10 billion. The
typical firm financed by angels raises about $250,000 from three or more investors. The
typical investor provides between $25,000 and $50,000 per firm, about half in the form of
equity and half in near-equity (loans and loan guarantees). During 1985 professional venture
investors financed about 2,500 firms for a total of about $2.5 billion, an average of about
$1 million per firm.

CAPITAL MARKET EFFICIENCY
Perceptions that gaps exist in the equity markets serving entrepreneurs led to passage of the
Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The Act created the Small Business Investment
Company (SBIC) program. Though capital gaps have never been documented convincingly,
perceptions of gaps endure, at least in the minds of entrepreneurs. Perceived capital shortages
include product development financing for technology-based
inventors, start-up and earlystage financing for ventures that fail to meet the size and growth criteria of professional
venture investors, and equity financing for closely-held firms that are growing faster than
internal cash flows can support.
Research documenting
entrepreneurs’
perceptions of capital gaps include work by
Obermayer (1983) and Wilson (1984). Recent efforts to deal with the gap include the Small
Business: Investment Incentive Act of 1980, the Small Business Innovation Development
Act of 1982. and the SEC’s Regulation D.
The capital gap folklore is based upon the observable behavior of financial institutions,
including SBIC’s and professional venture capital firms. However, the folklore overlooks
the investment record of informal venture investors-business
angels. Angels not only exist,
they tend to invest in precisely the areas perceived as gaps in the capital markets for
entrepreneurs. For an expanded discussion of angel financing, Wetzel (1983, 1986).
Despite the apparent size of the informal venture capital pool, the effect of capital
gaps can be created when markets fail to function efficiently. Modem financial theory rests
on assumptions of efficient markets-markets
in which information about sources of funds
and about investment opportunities is fully and freely available to buyers and sellers of

<-----Page 7----->306

JR.

capital. The evidence suggests that this necessary condition is far from fulfilled in the angel
segment of the venture capital markets. In the absence of efficient markets, capital cannot
flow from less productive to more productive investment opportunities.
“At the heart of free market systems is the issue of whether or not prices accurately reflect all the
information necessary for scarce resources to be efficiently allocated among an infinite variety of
alternative and competing uses.” (Weston and Copeland 1986)

Bean, Schiffel and Mogee (1975), found little support for assertions that technological
innovation by new/small firms is impeded by an inadequate supply of capital. However,
they noted that the majority of venture capital firms do not fund start-up companies, a pattern
that still prevails. Venture Capital Journal (1986) reported that 13% of the funds disbursed
by all venture capital firms in 1985 were seed or start-up investments. Seed and start-up
investments represented 12.6% of Venture Magazine’s (1986) November, 1986 Index of
Venture Capital Activity. One of Bean, Schiffel and Mogee’s observations is worth quoting.
“The issue of little knowledge of the venture capital/new technological enterprise is multi-faceted.
Entrepreneurs and potential entrepreneurs seem to need better information on financial sources while
capital suppliers seem to need better information on new-venture/technological
investment opportunities.”

The Charles River Associate’s study (1976) also found ‘&no evidence of substantial
market imperfections that restrict the flow of funds to small, technology-based
firms.” Recall,
however, that they excluded from their study of capital market imperfections “individuals
who act informally as providers of venture funds.” Despite their conclusions, CRA made
the following point:
“It is not clear whether the existing system for generating
investment opportunities is efticient.

Networks and Market Efficiency
Data describing the channels through which information about opportunities for investment
in new/small companies is transmitted to individual investors can be found in several studies.
Without exception, these studies cite the dominant role of informal networks of trusted
friends and business associates in the referral process.
Early in the development of the venture capital industry in the United States, Rubenstein
(1958) found that private investors were more dependent on informal networks than were
large venture capital institutions.
“The fraternity of individual backers of small businesses appears to be rather close knit, at least on
a local level. A good deal of information is passed about by word of mouth. If one investor who
enjoys considerable prestige among his associates, believes a situation to be promising and recommends it lo others, his friends may participate merely on the basis of his recommendations
.”

The significance of a respected lead investor in attracting the participation of associates
was evident in a case study of the Taplin & Montle Development Fund, an informal association of individual investors in the Boston area (Wetzel 1983). The work of Baty (1964)
and Shaper0 (1983) also document the catalytic role played by respected lead investors.
The importance of informal venture investment networks was cited by the Panel on
Venture Capital of the U.S. Department of Commerce Technical Advisory Board (1970).
The Panel reported that they:

<-----Page 8----->INFORMAL CAPITAL MARKETS: SCALE AND EFFICIENCY

became increasingly aware of an informal network of people, institutions and relationships
that are significant in the process of financing new enterprises.”
“ ‘ . . it is apparent that the network does not operate with the same degree of effectiveness in
every geographic region of the country.”
‘1

.

.

Subsequent
research has documented both the significance of informal networks and
regional differences in the effectiveness of these networks. For example, Hoffman (1972)
explored the process by which individuai investors identify, evaluate and structure investments in new, small companies. Data were collected from 39 investors in Waco and Austin,
Texas. Hoffman found tbar friends and business associates referred more new and small
companies to these investors than any other source. He also found that differences in the
venture capital investment process between more developed and less developed areas relate
more to the dynamics of the local venture capital networks than to the absolute availability
of venture capital, the number of venture capitalists, the opportunities to invest, or the
absolute propensity to invest. Shaper0 (1983) also found that the existence or nonexistence
of investor networks was an important difference between communities in the propensity to
invest.
In a study of informal risk capital in New England, Seymour and Wetzel (1981)
collected data from 133 individual investors who fit the description of business angels. These
investors reported risk capital investments totalling over $16 million in 320 ventures between
1976 and 1980, an average of one deal every two years for each investor. The average size
of their investments was approximately $50,000, while the median size was about $20,000.
60% of their investments represented participations with other individuals in larger transactions.
52% of the New England sample cited business associates as a frequent source of
investment opportunities, 50% cited friends, and 41% cited active personal search. The next
most common source, investment bankers, was cited as a frequent source by 15% of the
sample. Al1 other sources, including business brokers, commercial bankers, attorneys, and
accountants were insignificant. Since individual investors tend to be found in clusters, these
data may understate the significance of professional intermediaries in the referral process.
While most investors learn of investment opportunities from friends and business associates,
the typical opportunity may be introduced to one member of the cluster by a banker, broker,
attorney or accountant.
New England investors totally dissatisfied with existing channels of communication
between entrepreneurs and individual investors outnumbered definitely satisfied investors by
over four to one. 58% expressed a strong interest in a service that would direct investment
opportunities to their attention. 38% expressed a moderate interest in such a service.
In their Sunbelt study, AEG ( 1986) found that informal investors’ most common and
reliable sources of investment info~ation
were friends and business associates. One third
of the Sunbelt investors were dissatisfied with information channels currently available. The
average investor wanted to invest 83% more than he did, but could not find sufficiently
attractive opportunities. Given sufficient opportunities, funds available from investors in the
three regions would total about $9 billion per year. Extrapolated to the United States, the
total would exceed $30 billion annually.
Krasner and Tymes (1983), replicated the Seymour and Wetzel study (1981) in the
San Francisco Bay area. Data were collected from 41 investors, 30 of whom were private
individuals and 11 were professional venture capitalists. California investors relied upon the
same informal network of friends and business associates for most of their investment

<-----Page 9----->308

opportunities. However, 61% of the California investors were either definitely satisfied or
basically, but not totally satisfied with the effectiveness of existing channels of communication between entrepreneurs and investors. Only 28% of New England investors shared
those opinions.

External Ekonomies and Public Policy
For public policy purposes, it must be noted that the absence of market imperfections does
not imply that the flow of funds to entrepreneurial
ventures is in some sense ideal. The
innovation process, of which venture investing is a part, generates significant extemai or
social benefits. The nature of the marketplace typically precludes an innovator from capturing
fully the benefits of an innovation,
implying that the market allocation of resources for
innovation will be suboptimal. Social returns that cannot be captured by private investors
include an enhanced flow of new jobs, innovative technology, and new tax revenues. See,
for example, The State of Small Business: A Report of the President (1982, 1983, 1984,
1985, 1986).
Mansfield (1983) was the first to measure the external economies associated with
technological entrepreneurship.
In a sample of 17 industrial innovations, Mansfield estimated
the median private rate of return at 25% and the median social rate of return at 56%.
Tewksbury, Crandall and Crane ( 1980) and Robert R. Nathan Associates, Inc. (1978) found
similar evidence of substantial gaps between the private and social rates of return from
innovation.
Building on the three studies referenced above, Romeo and Rapaport (1984), tested
the hypothesis that innovations carried out by small firms (under 500 employees) tend to
have a larger gap between private and social rates of return than the innovations carried out
by larger firms. Romeo and Rapaport’s results confirmed their hypothesis. While cautioning
that their results were suggestive rather than definitive, Romeo and Rapaport described the
public policy implications of their work as follows:
“This study suggests that the gap between private returns and social returns is related to firm size.
This would appear to provide some support for the argument that in designing policies to encourage
innovation, the government should pay particular attention 10 small firms. These firms are less able
Lo appropriate the economic gain from their innovations. The extent of market failure is greater here
and the case for government policy is stronger. Our results suggest that encouragement of innovative
activity by small firms would yield a larger social payoff than encouragement
of large firms.”

With respect to externalities

and information,

CRA (1976) raised the following

issue:

‘To the extent that investments in small, technology-based
firms produce external economies. too
few resources wit1 be allocated to ail phases of investing in them, including generating info~ation
about investment opportunities.”

For entrepreneurs prematurely abandoning the search for funds, the effective cost of
risk capital is infinite, and society bears the cost of lost opportunities
to establish new
ventures or rejuvenate old ones.

with the significance of entrepreneurial
ventures to the vitality of the U.S. economy in
genera1 and the New England economy in particular, prompted the formation of Venture
Capita1 Network, Inc. (VCN). VCN is a not-for-profit corporation managed by the Office
of Small Business Programs of the University of New Hampshire. VCN’s essential purpose
is to introduce entrepreneurs
to individual venture investors and to venture capita1 firms
interested in early-stage financing. VCN places no geographic restrictions on its services.
Financial support for VCN has been provided by the Business and Industry Association
of New Hampshire, the University Center for Technical Assistance, the U.S. Economic
Development Administration,
the Ellis L. Phillips Foundation, and a group of sponsoring
organizations. Sponsors include Deloitte Haskins & Sells; Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &Co.;
Price Waterhouse; and the Shawmut Bank of Boston, N.A.

VCN Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs most likely to benefit from participation in VCN require between $50,000
and $750,000 of equity-type financing. They are often referred to VCN by accountants,
attorneys, bankers, and venture capitalists. Entrepreneurs are required to submit an Executive
Summary of their business plan when they register with VCN.

opportunities represented by VCNs entrepreneur clients as of June I, 1986. Over 80% of
the ventures seeking financing through VCN are under five years old. Table 3 includes a
frequency distribution of the investment interests of VCN investors.

VCN Investors
VCN investors are primarily affluent individuals. Seed capital venture funds represent about
one fifth of VCNs investor clients. Since VCN permits investors to specify up to six business
categories, the Investment Interest column in Table 3 totals over 100%.
VCN investors are required to certify that they are accredited investors as defined in
Rule 501 of the SEC’s Regulation D (Rules Governing the Limited Offer and Sale of
Securities under the Securities Act of 1933) or that they have such knowledge and experience
in financial and business matters that they are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
prospective investments,
as specified in Rule 506 of Regulation D.

VCN Operating Procedures
VCN maintains a confidential data base of Investment Opportunity Profiles submitted by
entrepreneurs
and a confidential data base of Investment Interest Profiles submitted by
investors. Using a two-stage process, VCN submits to investors those investment opportunities that meet their screening criteria. Both parties remain anonymous throughout this
process. At the conclusion of the process, entrepreneurs are introduced to those investors
interested in pursuing an investment opportunity. VCN provides no assurances that particular
entrepreneurs will be introduced to any prospective investors. VCN’s role terminates with
the introduction of entrepreneurs and investors.
VCN is neither an investment advisor nor a broker-dealer of securities, and has received
the appropriate no-action letters from the SEC. VCN provides only an information service
for entrepreneurs and investors. VCN neither evaluates nor endorses the merits of investment
opportunities presented through its services. VCN conducts no investigations to verify the
accuracy or completeness
of information provided by entrepreneurs and investors. VCN
reports to entrepreneurs the reasons cited by investors for rejecting their investment proposals.

VCN Performance
From the inception of operations in July, 1984 through June, 1986, VCN arranged in excess
of 1,000 introductions
for over 200 entrepreneurs
from 30 states and over 300 investors
from 33 states. VCN maintains no systematic contact with clients once introductions have
been concluded. However, at least seven entrepreneurs are known to have raised funds from
VCN investors.

Nine individual investors and a small venture capital fund provided medium six

VCN Counterparts
VCN provides assistance to not-for-profit organizations replicating VCN outside New England. Through September, 1986 working relationships had been established with the Indiana
Institute for New Business Ventures, Inc., the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,
St. Louis University, the Atlanta Economic Development Corp., Northern Michigan University, the Ontario, Canada, Chamber of Commerce, the Kenan Institute for Private Enterprise at the University of North Carolina, and the Technology Commercialization
Center
at Northwestern University.
Additional groups exploring the creation of VCN counterparts are located in Arkansas,
Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Ultimately VCN expects to establish VCN-International,
a service
that will link regional networks, thereby contributing to the efficiency of the international
market for informal venture capital.

Lessons from VCN’s First Two Years
VCN is still an experimental project. While early results are encouraging, it can scarcely
be claimed that VCN has had a major impact on the flow of informal venture financing in
New England. Several lessons are emerging. First, VCN’s experience confirms the diverse
and diffuse nature of the informal investor population. Informal venture investors are tough
to reach. Second, new concepts do not sell themselves. They need to be explained, often
on a face-to-face basis. Where this has occurred participation tends to follow. Third, building
a track record takes time. But performance builds the credibility and awareness that in turn
lead to spreading interest. VCN’s second two years are expected to be significantly more
productive than its first. Fourth, the intensity of an individual’s interest in venture investing
appears to be dependent in part upon the investor’s familiarity with the techniques of
successful venture investing, as well as upon the availability of opportunities.
Venture
investing is not a full-time occupation for informal investors. Learning the tricks of the trade
takes time and time is scarce. Faced with more familiar alternatives, otherwise qualified
venture investors may pass up opportunities to back entrepreneurs. This dimension of market
efficiency was not anticipated when VCN was launched. During its second two years VCN
will experiment with a variety of methods to overcome this perceived obstacle. Much has
been learned during VCN’s first two years. Overriding the lessons is the conclusion that
VCN’s original premises are still sound.

CONCLUSION
The informal venture capital market poses many unanswered questions. Issues of scale and
market efficiency have been addressed in this article. The available data suggest that the
informal venture capital market is twice the size of the professional venture capital market.
The number of ventures financed by informal investors appears to be at least ten times the
number of ventures financed by professional venture capital firms.
Market efficiency is a more difficult issue to address. Limited information
about
investors and investment opportunities appears to be a significant obstacle to the financing
of particular types of entrepreneurial
ventures. The flow of informal venture capital appears
to be further constrained by unfamiliarity with the techniques of successful venture investing
on the part of entrepreneurs and potential informal investors. If Venture Capital Network
and its counterparts endure as self-sufficient
enterprises it will demonstrate that market
efficiency can be improved in a cost-effective manner. That face alone would confirm the
inefficiency of the random process that currently brings entrepreneurs and investors together.
Gaps between private and social rates of return from innovation justify public as well as
private efforts to enhance capital market efficiency, especially efforts directed at entrepreneurial ventures where the gaps are greater than for large firms.
Of equal significance, the survival of VCN and its counterparts will provide an international roster of informal venture investors. With this unique data base in hand, other
unanswered questions can be addressed: questions about the characteristics
of business
angels, the investment decision models they employ, the characteristics of the ventures they
finance, the structural characteristics of their venture investments, the performance of their
portfolios, and questions concerning regional differences in the informal venture capital
markets.
