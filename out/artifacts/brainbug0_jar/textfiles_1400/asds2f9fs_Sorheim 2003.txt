The pre-investment behaviour of business angels:
a social capital approach
ROGER SØRHEIM
(Final version accepted 2 June 2003)
Using insights from social capital theory, this paper examines the pre-investment behaviour
of experienced business angels in Norway. Previous research indicates there are
considerable inefﬁciencies in the informal venture capital market, notably information
inefﬁciencies related to the identiﬁcation of investment opportunities, and problems
associated with the screening or evaluation of new investment proposals. The empirical
ﬁndings show that an investor’s previous track record, to a great extent, determines how
they can operate in the informal venture capital market. It is quite rational for individuals
who have acquired most of their experience in one speciﬁc region to make the
overwhelming majority of their investments in the same region. It is this regional track
record that gives them a competitive advantage in the informal venture capital market. This
reasoning also seems to be valid with regard to individuals with industry speciﬁc
experience, where the regional track record is ‘replaced’ by an industry speciﬁc record.
Moreover, these industry speciﬁc investors take care of the initial screening themselves,
whereas regional investors are predominately generalists who rely more on information
provided by their regional networks. The business angels in this study are very concerned
with establishing common ground with entrepreneurs and potential co-investors. This
establishment of common ground can be viewed as a necessary antecedent for long-term
trustworthy relationships.

Introduction
A number of studies have indicated that emergent growth ventures face
considerable challenges in the process of obtaining ﬁnancing in the
institutional capital market (Binks 1996, Cressy and Olofsson 1997, van
Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). An alternative for these entrepreneurial
ventures might be to attract informal investors, termed ‘business angels’,
deﬁned as ‘private individuals using their own money directly in unquoted
companies in which they have no family connection’ (Mason and Harrison
2000: 221). The involvement of business angels, in some cases, can also be
of vital importance in attracting other types of capital such as debt
ﬁnancing or institutional venture capital. However, studies of informal

investors indicate that there are inefﬁciencies in the informal venture
capital market (Mason and Harrison 1991, Freear et al. 1997, Lumme et al.
1998) related to the fragmented nature of the marketplace. There is a lack
of, or uneven distribution of, information between actors in the marketplace (van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000, Sørheim and Landström 2001),
which results in high search costs, meaning that both investors and
entrepreneurs are hampered since they cannot ﬁnd a suitable informal
investor, while informal investors ﬁnd it difﬁcult to identify interesting
investment proposals (Freear et al. 1992, Lumme et al. 1998, Reitan and
Sörheim 2000, Mason and Harrison 2002). Moreover, it is not sufﬁcient
simply to identify investment projects; the new investment proposals also
have to be evaluated. Investors must evaluate the investment proposals in
view of both market and agency risk, where market risk is related to both
the competition and uncertainties in the portfolio ﬁrm’s market, and agency
risk is related to an entrepreneur’s inability to act in the best interests of the
investor (Fiet 1991, Landström 1992, van Osnabrugge 1999).
Yet, despite the inefﬁciencies, we do not observe a complete failure in the
informal risk capital market. Previous research has shown that informal
investors usually ﬁnd investment opportunities through personal and
business networks (Wetzel 1983, Mason and Harrison 1994, Harrison et al.
1997, Mason and Harrison 2000), and it is this informal network of friends
and business associates that seems to be most effective in identifying
quality investment proposals of interest (Landström 1993, Riding et al.
1993, Landström and Politis 2000). This notion is further strengthened if
one looks at the very wealthy and very experienced investors. They claim
that the best quality deal ﬂow comes from organizations or individuals they
have dealt with in the past (Kelly and Hay 1996, 1999). In concurrence
with this reasoning, Sørheim and Landström (2001) argue that competency-rich investors who are highly active, base their investment decision
solely on information from personal or business networks. Harrison et al.
(1997) emphasizes the role of the co-coordinator (this could for example be
a lead investor, archangel or business introduction service) in the preinvestment process, claiming that the merits and attractiveness of the coordinator may inﬂuence how the investment opportunity itself is perceived.
This implies that referral sources signiﬁcantly inﬂuence how business
angels perceive an investment opportunity. Business angels are generally
not very concerned about industry sector, but they need to understand the
generic business (van Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). However, they do
specialize, often by focusing on the area were they work and live (Mason
and Harrison 2000). A minority of investors tend to specialize in speciﬁc
industries; they receive fewer investment proposals but tend to have a
higher acceptance rate (Landström 1993). This may indicate that the
referrers of the deals, ex ante, know if the investor will be interested based
on knowledge about previous investments. Sætre (2003) studied the preinvestment process from the entrepreneur’s perspective and suggests that at
least some entrepreneurs are very conscious about what kind of investor
they prefer. These selective entrepreneurs prefer investors with industry
speciﬁc competency, considering it more valuable than general business
competency.

PRE-INVESTMENT BEHAVIOUR OF BUSINESS ANGELS

339

Previous research suggests that business angels have a ‘laid-back’ attitude
towards the evaluation of projects, relying more on instincts than on
outside opinion (Mason and Harrison 1995). Unfortunately, this laid-back
attitude leads to many worries after the investment has been made (van
Osnabrugge and Robinson 2000). Serial business angels tend to undertake
more extensive evaluations of their investment opportunities (van
Osnabrugge 1999). This must also be considered in light of the fact that
more experienced investors co-invest more than less experienced investors.
This indicates that there is a learning curve (Kelly and Hay 1996, van
Osnabrugge 1999, Sørheim and Landström 2001). Nevertheless, little is
known about how business angels perform these evaluations.
Though previous research indicates that social relationships are of vital
importance in the pre-investment process of business angels, there is little
research that has examined how experienced business angels actually
identify and evaluate investment opportunities. Moreover, the research that
exists has only limited links with theoretical concepts. This paper argues
that the insights from social capital theory will (a) enhance our understanding about how business angels identify interesting deals and (b)
enhance our understanding about how they evaluate deals (i.e. how they
deal with initial market and agency risk). The conceptual framework in this
paper deals with three speciﬁc aspects of social capital: a structural,
relational and a cognitive dimension. The structural dimension of social
capital is strongly related to ‘network ties’ and the fact that these ties may
provide valuable information. The relational dimension of social capital is
related to trustworthiness and motivation. Finally, the cognitive dimension
concerns to what degree the individuals involved have a common
understanding, a shared vision. With this as a background, insights from
in-depth case studies of ﬁve experienced business angels will be used to
focus on the following two research questions:
.
.

What is the role of social capital in the identification of investment
opportunities?
What is the role of social capital in the process of screening/evaluating
investment opportunities?

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the
conceptual background for the study. This is followed by a description of
the method used. Five cases are then presented, followed by a section
where the two research questions are addressed. Finally, the ﬁndings and
implications of the study will be discussed.
Conceptual background
The concept of ‘social capital’ has been applied to a number of areas within
social science (Adler and Kwon 2002). The term ‘social capital’ was initially
used in community studies, to explain the survival and function of
neighbourhoods where the development of personal relationships provides
the basis for collective cooperation in such communities (Jacobs 1965,

<-----Page 4----->Downloaded By: [University of Waterloo] At: 18:22 26 June 2007

ROGER SØRHEIM

Nahapiet and Ghosal 1998). Since then the concept has been used to
examine a wide range of social phenomena including: youth behavioural
problems, community life, public health and education (Coleman 1988,
Nahapiet and Ghosal 1998, Adler and Kwon 2002). Social capital is
composed of both actual and potential resources gained through relationship networks (Bourdieu 1986, Nahapiet and Ghosal 1998, Greene et al.
1999). Unlike many other types of capital, social capital cannot be regarded
as a commodity that can be traded on the market and it is impossible for
one sole actor to have ownership rights of this capital (Nahapiet and Ghosal
1998). However, while initial studies focused almost solely on social capital
as an important factor in the development of human capital, a number of
studies during the last decade have focused more on how social capital
inﬂuences the economic performance of organizations, geographic regions
and nations (Baker 1990, Putnam 1993, Fukuyuama 1995, Nahapiet and
Ghosal 1998).
While deﬁnitions of social capital are broadly similar (Adler and Kwon
2002), they vary in terms of whether their primary focus is on: (a) the
relations an actor establishes and develops with other (external) actors,
which could be labelled as the bridging view of social capital; (b) the
structure of relations among actors within a community or collective, which
could be labelled as the bonding view of social capital; or (c) frameworks
that include both type of linkages, neutral to internal or external
dimensions (Adler and Kwon 2002). The conceptual framework introduced
by Burt (1992, 2002) illustrates the bridging view. Burt deﬁnes social
capital as ‘friends, colleagues, and more general contacts through whom
you receive opportunities to use your ﬁnancial and human capital’(1992: 9).
The main focus is the connections between actors. Burt (2002) argues that
individuals who are able to ﬁll structural holes often gain access to unique
and timely information that enables access to information that is more
additive than overlapping. This framework (Burt 1992, 2000, 2002) draws
on networks concepts developed by sociologists in the 1970s, notably
Granovetter’s (1973) work on the strength of weak ties. The second group
focuses on social capital in some kind of collectivity (e.g. an organization,
community or a nation) (Adler and Kwon 2002), where the focus of
attention is on relations within a cohesive network (Coleman 1990, Leana
and van Buren 1999). In line with this reasoning, Fukuyama (1995: 10)
deﬁnes social capital as ‘the ability of people to work together for common
purposes in groups and organizations’. Coleman (1988) emphasizes the role
that trustworthiness (that actors can depend on each other), obligations and
expectations have in enhancing and developing human capital within a
family or a community. Overall, this forms a bonding glue that holds
organizations together (Putnam 2000).
However, Adler and Kwon (2002) argue that an internal vs. external, or
bridging vs. bonding view, of social capital is, to a large extent, related to a
matter of perspective and unit of analysis (Adler and Kwon, 2002).
Nahapiet and Ghosal (1998) introduce an integrated approach where both
the bridging and bonding elements of social capital are included. They
introduce three speciﬁc dimensions of social capital: a structural dimension,
a relational dimension, and a cognitive dimension. The structural

<-----Page 5----->Downloaded By: [University of Waterloo] At: 18:22 26 June 2007

PRE-INVESTMENT BEHAVIOUR OF BUSINESS ANGELS

341

dimension of social capital is strongly related to ‘network ties’, and the fact
that these ties may provide valuable information (Nahapiet and Ghosal
1998). The structural dimension is concerned with whether individuals or
groups of individuals are connected at all, while the relational dimension is
related to the characteristics of these connections and the development of
personal relationships. The cognitive dimension is concerned with the
extent to which there is an affective quality to these connections; a common
understanding that may facilitate future co-operation (Tsai and Ghosal
1998). This paper uses the conceptual framework introduced by Nahapiet
and Ghosal (1998) as a starting point for studying the pre-investment
process among business angels, and argues that an integrated approach is
required in order to examine how experienced business angels handle the
pre-investment process.
The structural dimension of social capital is related to the importance of
‘network ties’ (bridging), which means that an actor’s contacts in a social
structure may be advantageous for the actors involved (Tsai and Ghosal
1998, Burt 2002). Relevant information is often time consuming and costly
to gather. However, information channels developed for other purposes
may reduce these costs signiﬁcantly (Burt 1992). Burt (1992, 2000) suggests
that this kind of information can be important in at least in three ways:
access, timing and referrals. The notion of ‘access’ is related to how
information is accessed and used. Previous research on business angels
suggests that experienced investors rely on previous business experience,
and often, entrepreneurial experience, which means that they have access to
interesting investment projects through these networks (Mason and
Harrison 2000, Sørheim and Landström 2001). ‘Timing’ concerns the
extent to what extent an individual can get a hold of information more
rapidly than people without the necessary network ties (Burt 2000). This is
an element of vital importance for active business angels; they do not want
to be in competition to invest. Business angels often take part in the
commercialization of the entrepreneurial venture during the very early
stages in the life cycle of the venture and so can often be regarded as cofounders or co-entrepreneurs (Landström 1998, Politis and Landström
2002). This notion is related to the process whereby information is shared
within networks, providing relevant information to actors in the network.
The notion of ‘referrals’ is important for active business angels in at least
two ways: referrals regarding the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team and
referrals relating to potential co-investors. Overall, this means that network
ties enable members of the network to obtain non-public information,
providing the network with more information than they could gather alone
(Burt 1997).
When distinguishing between the structural and the relational dimensions of social capital, Nahapiet and Ghosal (1998), draw on the work of
Granovetter (1992), which asserts that structural embeddedness is related
to who you reach and how you reach them, where the relational dimension
is concerned with the development of personal relationships. This means
that key factors in the relational dimension of social capital are related to
trust, trustworthiness and motivation (Nahapiet and Ghosal 1998, Tsai and
Ghosal 1998, Bolino et al. 2002). The relational dimension is important in

order to clarify the motivation of individuals to involve themselves in
knowledge creation through the exchange and combination of resources
(Nahapiet and Ghosal 1998, Tsai and Ghosal 1998). Moreover, this is
related to the interpersonal attraction between a group of people, in other
words, that they like one another, can identify with one another, and trust
one another (Bolino et al. 2002). Trust can be deﬁned in many ways, but a
number of researchers have agreed that it requires a willingness to be
vulnerable to another party (Mishra 1996, Huemer 1998, Rousseau et al.
1998, Leana and van Buren 1999). Trust can be both an antecedent and
result of collective action, but where the levels of trust are high, people will
be more willing to combine different sorts of information (Nahapiet and
Ghosal 1998, Leana and van Buren 1999). Trust can be viewed as an
attribute of a relationship between two or more people, but trustworthiness
is an individual attribute of an actor (Tsai and Ghosal 1998, Barney and
Hansen 1994). An investor with a positive reputation or track record, often
in the region where he/she works and lives, will often be considered
trustworthy. A reputation embodies the history of other peoples experience
with an actor (Fombrun 1996). An individual’s reputation or track record,
as an investor will be affected by his or her previous or auxiliary experience
as an entrepreneur or an employee in a business or industry. Granovetter
(1985: 490) illustrates the importance of reputation: ‘Better than the
statement that someone is known to be reliable is information from a
trusted informant that he has dealt with that individual and found him so.
Even better is information from one’s own past dealings with that person’.
Thus, prior relationships may transfer expectations about an actor’s
behaviour from an existing relationship to a new activity (Uzzi 1996). The
embeddedness argument may explain why there is a preference for
transacting with actors with a known reputation and this explains why
few actually will rely solely on institutional arrangements or generalized
morality in order to avoid malfeasance in economic transactions (Granovetter 1985). The reputation of the business angel will affect what kind of
investment opportunities he or she gains access to. Nevertheless, when it
comes to the screening/evaluation stage, business angels still have to
perform some kind of due-diligence activities, though in early stages of a
business life cycle these activities will be limited (Riding et al. 1993). For
the most part, investors must largely rely on the information provided by
the entrepreneur/entrepreneurial team. Thus, investors will be very
concerned with the reputation of the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team.
The cognitive dimension is related to shared codes and language. In order
to stimulate the combination and exchange of information it is essential to
have some kind of shared context between the parties (Nahapiet and Ghosal
1998). Shared language and codes enables people to create a shared vision/
common ground (Tsai and Ghosal 1998). This creation of common ground
facilitates future co-operation and information exchange. This is important
because trusting relationships will be rooted in this common understanding
(Sitkin and Roth 1993, Tsai and Ghosal 1998). Previous studies of business
angels have emphasized that they make their investments in geographic
proximity to their home or place of work. This could constitute the creation
of common ground between the investor(s) and entrepreneurs. A shared

PRE-INVESTMENT BEHAVIOUR OF BUSINESS ANGELS

343

vision between the involved investors will stimulate further cooperation
between business angels.
This paper explores the role of social capital in the pre-investment
process of business angels. The paper has an integrative approach,
examining the pre-investment behaviour of business angels using insights
from both the bridging and bonding views on social capital.
Methodology
In line with the reasoning of Gartner and Birley (2002), the paper argues
that some questions will not, or cannot, be asked when undertaking
quantitative research. Thus, a comparative qualitative methodology has
been employed in the study of ﬁve informal investors that attempts to
discover how different aspects of social capital inﬂuence the pre-investment
behaviour of business angels. A qualitative approach is appropriate when
addressing the ‘why and hows’ (Yin 1984). Moreover, Eisenhardt (1989)
emphasize that a qualitative approach can make a signiﬁcant contribution to
theory development when key themes are weakly developed.
Previous research within the ﬁeld has shown that it can be extremely
difﬁcult to identify informal investors because they prefer to remain
anonymous (Mason and Harrison 1994). Moreover, Eisenhardt (1989)
points out that random selection is not necessary and not even desirable
when doing case studies. Sørheim and Landström (2001) categorized
informal investors in accordance with the investors’ investment activity and
competence using four categories for informal investors: (a) Lotto investors
(low activity, low competence); (b) Traders (high activity, low competence); (c), Analytical Investors (low activity, high competence); and (d)
‘pure’ Business Angels (high activity, high competence). Their empirical
ﬁndings suggest that there are considerable differences between the four
categories of investors in terms of, for example, the use of information
sources, involvement in the company, co-investing, time horizons and
geographic preferences. It can be argued that ‘pure’ business angels
represent ‘best practices’ as they have a high level of investment activity,
managerial and/or entrepreneurial competence, a high propensity to coinvest, are often ‘lead investors’, use personal and business networks as
their main information sources, and are actively involved their portfolio
companies. For these reasons this group can be argued to be the most
interesting and most important category of investors and justiﬁes the
compilation of more in-depth knowledge about how they operate in the
informal venture capital market.
Sample selection began with a list of 20 individuals who could be labelled
as ‘pure’ business angels. They comprised investors from both the central
regions of the country as well as some from a prosperous region. Five of
these investors were chosen to be case studies. Two of them work and live
in Oslo, the capital of Norway, and the others work and live in or nearby a
regional centre in the middle of Norway. The main reason for choosing
investors from different regions was to explore if, and to what extent,
geography matters.

Preliminary interviews were carried out in November and December
2001 to create, ﬁrst and foremost, a trusting relationship and to prepare the
ground for additional data collection. Further interviews were conducted
with all ﬁve investors in the period February to October 2002, with each
interview lasting from one to three hours. All investors were interviewed
twice during this period. This amounts to a total of ﬁve preliminary
interviews and 10 additional interviews. In the second and third interviews,
data were collected using a loosely structured interview guide, focusing on
the investment process.1 Emphasis was placed on the informal investors
telling their own story, using their own words and concepts. The
respondents were asked to link their ‘stories’ to projects that they had
actually invested in or had considered investing in. All interviews were
recorded and transcribed verbatim by the author in order to secure a
closeness to the material. All ﬁve investors were given the opportunity to
read and comment on their own case descriptions.
Analysis proceeded through the following four main steps. First, all text
units regarding pre-investment activities were extracted from the interviews on a case-by-case basis. Second, the pre-investment activities were
then codiﬁed with regard to the identiﬁcation of investment opportunities
and the screening/evaluation process, case by case. This allowed for the
development of a ‘pre-investment’ story for each investor, with unique preinvestment patterns emerging for each investor, as reported in the case
descriptions. Next, the framework was further developed, based on insights
from literature on business angels and social capital, resulting in the focus
on the three speciﬁc dimensions on social capital. Each case was then
evaluated along the three speciﬁc dimensions of social capital, still
separated as regards the identiﬁcation of investment opportunities and
the screening/evaluation process (tables 2 – 6). Finally, a comparison was
made of the ﬁve cases, searching for similarities and dissimilarities in the
pre-investment process (tables 7 and 8). However, this must not be
regarded as a linear process. One of the strengths of undertaking qualitative
research is the constant iteration between emerging concepts, data and
literature (Yin 1984, Eisenhardt 1989, Miles and Huberman 1994).
Some elements concerning the weaknesses of the study need to be
noted. First, in this study (as in almost any study of social phenomena),
there is a danger that respondents will try to rationalize their own
behaviour, reporting a desirable response, rather than their actual
behaviour. Having said this, there was a great openness and a trusting
relationship with the respondents. Second, since this study emphasizes
the role of social capital, other important elements might be downplayed,
such as the role of explicit contracts.2 Third, the study is based on a small
sample of male Norwegian investors. Accordingly, it seems appropriate to
brieﬂy present the Norwegian context. By and large, the development and
conditions for emerging ventures in Norway seems to be quite similar to
that of other small, developed countries in Europe. Moreover, the formal
venture capital industry is young and poorly developed. The Norwegian
government is trying to stimulate the institutional venture capital market
by participating in the establishment of new venture capital funds. The
attention given to informal investors has been limited, but the interest is

<-----Page 9----->Downloaded By: [University of Waterloo] At: 18:22 26 June 2007

now rapidly growing on account of the apparent availability of informal
venture capital in Norway (Reynolds et al. 2000, Reitan and Sørheim
2000). There are very few formal investor clubs, business angel networks
and the like. Yet, business angels in Norway are co-investing to a large
extent, indicating the existence of informal ad-hoc networks (Sørheim and
Landström 2001).
Presentation of the ﬁve business angels
This section presents the empirical ﬁndings. First, a summary proﬁle of the
ﬁve business angels will be presented in order to provide a snapshot of the
investor characteristics (see table 1). Each case presentation follow the same
basic structure: (a) a general presentation of the investor, (b) a presentation
of the empirical ﬁndings with regard to the identiﬁcation and evaluation of
investment proposals, and (c) an interpretation of how the empirical
ﬁndings are related to the conceptual background for this article.

Identiﬁcation/deal ﬂow: When he started out as an informal investor, most
of his deal ﬂow came from business networks and brokers situated in central
Norway. This gradually changed into a deal ﬂow from regional networks: ‘as
I got more in touch with regional actors as time went on, through personal
contacts, I came into contact with a regional venture capital ﬁrm and started
discussions with them . . . and I also got access to a number of projects
through my regional ﬁnancial network’. The importance of regional
personal networks has increased over the last decade: ‘I have been offered
many, many investment opportunities, the vast majority of them have come
through personal networks developed over time. These are networks
developed since I started to invest back in 1989 . . . after these networks were
developed, I have focused more regionally . . . I am now primarily making
investments in my own region’. Roar sees this as a consequence of previous
investments, ‘people in my network know what kind of projects I usually
invest in’. This suggests that his previous track record has a major impact on
what kind of deal ﬂow he gets. He also emphasizes that it is easier to
monitor, control, and follow up regional investments: ‘I have experienced
that it is important to be close by, work actively, almost on a daily basis—not
in details, but in strategy and development projects, this is essential’.
Screening/evaluation of projects: Roar relies on both his business
experience and his network when screening and evaluating projects. He
has worked with projects in a number of industries and this general
business experience is useful in this evaluation stage: ‘My strength in the
evaluation process is that I have business skills. I am able to focus on
income possibilities and the market, where and when we get income . . .
how we can reach the market . . . and then evaluate this against the risk I
perceive in the project’. He is also concerned about the other shareholders
in the venture: ‘I saw what kind of shareholders the company already had
. . . it was important that N.N. continued to involve himself, he had the
speciﬁc industry experience that is needed . . . This was a little guarantee
for me’. Roar is generally positive about making co-investments with both
business angels and venture capital funds as long as ‘we have the same view
of strategy and that I can feel sure that I can work together with them’. If,
after an initial evaluation, he ﬁnds the project interesting, he will perform a
number of activities, either alone or together with a potential co-investor, in
order to conﬁrm the information provided by the venture. This is primarily
achieved by contacting potential customers and suppliers, but can also
involve more indirect methods, where he relies on information provided by
his personal network.

businesses in several industries. Ragnvald gained his work experience both
from technological development and more prominently from the international sale and marketing of new innovative products. He is now the
managing director of the family business located in the middle of country,
near a prosperous region. He has made, during the last decade, a number of
investments in NTBFs, but will only invest in such ventures if he can offer
more than just ﬁnancial capital.
Identiﬁcation/deal ﬂow: Ragnvald has experience in the commercialization
of technology and emphasizes that he gets put in touch with a number of
projects because of his previous track record: ‘people know that we have
undertaken projects before’. He has undertaken projects together with
people from the university and this network has generated a number of
interesting investment opportunities. In addition, during the last two
decades, he has also worked together with the Norwegian Industrial and
Regional Development Fund in a number of projects: ‘They know that we
are able to undertake new projects, and so have often asked entrepreneurs
to contact us in projects where they think that we have something to offer.
So, in this manner I have had a stream of projects’. He arranges an
introductory meeting with many entrepreneurs, but turns down the
opportunity to invest in most cases: ‘I do not invest in very many projects.
I must learn there is a limit to how many projects you actually can be

involved in . . . and I have drawn the conclusion that in order to succeed, I
must be both ﬁnancially and ‘‘mentally’’ involved’.
Screening/evaluation of projects: Initial evaluation is carried out internally:
‘I am fascinated by many opportunities that I see. Often those related to
technology’. However, Ragnvald prefers to invest in industries where they
have already invested because ‘this makes it easier, we have a lot of input
knowledge in advance . . . it gives us an easier inroad to commercialization’.
There are exceptions to this, but he needs to see some kind of synergy effect
with other projects that he is involved in. He is conﬁdent that he, or some of
his employees, are capable of evaluating the basic technology content in
projects. With regard to market considerations, he relies on information
provided by his extensive business and personal network: ‘I have a world
wide network from previous projects which provides useful market
information’. Ragnvald is also focused on creating common ground
between both entrepreneurs and other investors ex ante. He has learned
his lessons in previous projects and provides an example: ‘You have the
researcher who loves to develop, then you have the short term investors
who want a quick return on the investment. Finally, it is me who says: this
looks good, let us start to produce. The other investors are terriﬁed and the
researchers claim: wait, this product is not ready, we have a better idea’.
This illustrates the differences in investment philosophy, which he will try
to avoid in the future.

Tord is in his early 50s and has an MBA from a reputable university in the
USA. He lives and works in a regional centre of prospering region. He
worked in a family business for 20 years, but is now only involved at the
strategic level as a member of the board. During the last six years, Tord has
made a number of investments in NTBFs, mainly through a business angel
syndicate established in 1998. Moreover, Tord has also founded an
informal investor forum with the aim of bringing together the most
signiﬁcant equity providers in his region.
Identiﬁcation/deal ﬂow: Tord beneﬁts from a good standing in his own
region. He is, however, aware that this can change if ‘I recommend projects
of poor quality and your friends and network associates lose money—
however the best alibi, is of course, that I have lost my own money together
with them’. He gets most of his deal ﬂow through the business angel
syndicate of which he is a member. He considers this as a good way doing
it: ‘it is difﬁcult, without considerable experience, to make this kind of
investment alone . . . You learn and you improve your analytical skills’.
Moreover, he emphasizes that: ‘You get better investment capacity, can be
involved in more projects’. This syndicate has been visible in his region and

they have had a comprehensive deal ﬂow since they started working
together in 1998. Although Tord has made investments independently
from the syndicate, these are always in close geographic proximity to where
he lives: ‘I put aside proposals from other regions, even if they are initially
interesting . . . There is a clear connection between geographic proximity
and success . . . It is easier to follow up and contribute actively . . . and we
speak the same dialect, which makes it easier to communicate’. Further, he
considers this as a kind of loyalty: ‘I want to contribute with something to
my region’.
Screening/evaluation of projects: Tord emphasizes the important role of
the business angel syndicate when it comes to the screening and
evaluation of projects. They have a managing director, who takes care
of the initial screening, and then put together a group of three or four of
the members who do a thorough screening and evaluation: ‘We have a
detailed screening of the business idea, introductory talks with the
entrepreneur or the entrepreneurial team, check out technology, market
and references’. Tord points out the importance of dividing tasks in a

close network: ‘you will not have to work day-and-night in order to
handle the incoming deal ﬂow’. Moreover, the most important element
for him, when he invests, is ‘the ability of the entrepreneur or the
entrepreneurial team to see things through. A good business idea without
the ability to see things through to completion will not be a commercial
success. You have to look at the management team and ask yourself: does
this team have stamina and can I trust them? It is in the management
team you usually ﬁnd the bottleneck’.

investments in NTBFs and claims that approximately 25% of his workload
is related to these investments.
Identiﬁcation/deal ﬂow: With Inge’s track record in mind, is it not
surprising that he has a considerable deal ﬂow: ‘I have never needed to be
proactive. I am centrally placed in the deal ﬂow. I have only the capacity,
willingness and ﬁnancial muscle to invest in a small fraction of the
opportunities offered’. A signiﬁcant part of his deal ﬂow comes from
entrepreneurs who contact him directly. He explains this, maintaining he is
visible and not difﬁcult to identify. Inge prefers to make his investments in
Norway: ‘I have made some investments outside Norway. They have all
been unsuccessful. You have to know the people involved and what kind of
external conditions they are working under’. He prefers to invest in medical
or pharmaceutical ventures, partly because of his previous experience, but
mostly because ‘. . .it makes me feel better if I lose half a million NOK in
this sector than in media, Internet, and so on’.
Screening/evaluation of projects: When Inge is offered a new project, he
makes an initial evaluation, emphasizing that ‘this is not an analysis, but I
ask myself: can I ﬁnd this interesting?’ If the answer is yes, he will
perform a more detailed analysis. Inge uses his own experience and his
business network to check the project out with regard to technology,
market, ﬁnancial status etc., but stresses that the most important thing is
that you are able create an atmosphere of trust and can cooperate with the
entrepreneur: ‘Good chemistry is of vital importance for me with, it is
important to have good relations with the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial
team. I am well off, so why should I spend my time working together
with someone I do not like?’ His main focus is on creating common
ground with the entrepreneur: ‘It is important to clarify expectations,
create a common platform and create a common vision. . . . Prepare the
entrepreneur for what he can expect from me, ﬁnancially and in other
ways. It is important that the entrepreneur feels safe, that they trust you
. . . it is easy for people from the ﬁnancial world, like me, to use
terminology that entrepreneurs do not understand’. Inge is also concerned
with what other investors are involved in the project: ‘One of my former
colleagues has an interesting project, he is an alright guy; then I realized
that he already has brought short term investors into the project . . . I will
not invest in this project before these people are removed from the
shareholders list . . . I will not have anything to do with short term
investors’.

proactive and having a track record in the process of identifying
interesting investment opportunities: ‘I shoot out arrows all the time . . .
the main thing is to know a lot of people and that these people know you
as a positive person that has a good track record and is capable of seeing
things through’. He is very well aware that in the long run this will
strengthen his position and ‘provides new opportunities to work with
even better people’.

Screening/evaluation of projects: Egil usually does the initial screening
himself. He is restricted in his investment focus, a conceptual knowledge
of speciﬁc technology areas, and tends to look for concrete ideas that that
match his own visions. Further, Egil makes a point of the fact that he has
no formal education: ‘this is a genuine a chip on my shoulder, I have not
got a piece of paper that actually proves that I know something, . . . but I
have learned a lot within a number of areas and I have had the privilege
to work with smart people’. Egil is able to meet entrepreneurs and carry
on a constructive dialogue, able to speak their language and explain how
their idea can ﬁt his conceptual understanding. Moreover, he emphasizes
the importance of personal chemistry between him or the entrepreneurial
team: ‘Take my last investment as an example, the entrepreneur, a super
person, incredible privilege to work with such a person . . . it took us only
a couple hours to become equal partners’. In order to convince the
entrepreneur, Egil is very conscientious about using other entrepreneurs
as references to conﬁrm his track record. New entrepreneurs are
encouraged to contact other ventures in his portfolio to conﬁrm that Egil
is: (a) a ‘good guy’ to start business with, (b) that he brings competence
with him, and (c) that he is capable of getting further ﬁnance for the
business.

Analysis and interpretations
This section summarizes and analyses the empirical ﬁndings. The two
research questions will be addressed by using the three dimensions of social
capital introduced in section 2.
Addressing research question 1: identiﬁcation/deal ﬂow

The empirical ﬁndings on the role of social capital in the process of
identifying interesting investment proposals are summarized in table 7.
These ﬁndings show that all of the investors have extensive social
networks that constantly provide them with new investment opportunities. The social network could be other informal investors, but other
important network sources could be, for example, governmental agencies,
VC ﬁrms, universities, etc. The importance of different network sources
varies among the business angels in this study. Ragnvald (investor 2) has
co-operated, during the past two decades, with several research groups at
the university as an investor, but has also hired relevant competence in
order to develop his own entrepreneurial ventures. Thus, he has a
reputation as an individual who is able to commercialize science-based
ideas. This means that he has access to interesting science-based ideas
already at the embryo stage. Then there is Roar (investor 1) who gets a
majority of his deal ﬂow from regional banks or VC funds. This arises

from the fact that he has cooperated with these actors in the past and
because the bank or VC fund will not get involved in ventures in the very
early phases of the life cycle. Tord (investor 3) gets the majority of his
deal-ﬂow from other equity providers in his region. This must be viewed
in light of the fact that he was one of the initiators of a formalized
business angel syndicate in his region. Inge and Egil (investors 4 and 5)
get a major proportion of their deal-ﬂow through industry speciﬁc
networks. This again, is related to their prior involvement in these
industries.
All of the investors are co-investing with other informal investors:
investors 1, 2 and 3 in the region where they work and live, and investors 4
and 5 primarily with individuals within their industry speciﬁc networks.3
These co-investors are people they consider trustworthy based on the fact
that they have dealt with them in the past, thus indicating that
Granovetter’s (1985) embeddedness argument is, to some extent, valid
when examining how business angels identify interesting deals. Furthermore, investors with a track record like that of the investors in this study
will often be visible in the marketplace, which means that entrepreneurs
contact them without prior relationships (directly or via someone in their

network). However, the average quality of this deal-ﬂow seems to be lower.
Thus, it is the combination of both strong and weak ties that secures an
interesting deal-ﬂow.
Following the reasoning outlined above, it is an intriguing point that
the track record (or reputation) of the investors seems to be of vital
importance in several ways. First, the fact that they have a long track
record and are experienced investors makes them more visible in the
informal venture capital market, and means that they get investment
proposals directly from entrepreneurs or entrepreneurial teams. Second,
and more importantly, their previous successes leads to an increase in the
quality deal-ﬂow and provides them the opportunity to work with even
better projects in the future. This is relevant to potential deals from both
strong and weak network ties. If the track record is related to a speciﬁc
region (or industry), is it quite rational for an informal investor to try and
beneﬁt from this. It is easier to follow up and work within a context
where the investor or group of investors is considered trustworthy. If an
investor’s track record constantly improves, then the quality of the
investment opportunities referred to them will increase. This indicates
that is difﬁcult be an investor in a context where you do not have a track
record. It further suggests that where someone has a track record and
where someone’s personal and business networks lie, strongly affects how,
and in which contexts, business angels identify interesting investment
opportunities.
However, geography matters. Investors 1, 2 and 3 work and live in or
nearby a regional centre, and they invest solely in opportunities in close
geographic proximity to where they live. The two most prominent reasons
for a narrow geographic focus seem to be: (1) the vast majority of their

<-----Page 20----->Downloaded By: [University of Waterloo] At: 18:22 26 June 2007

356

ROGER SØRHEIM

personal and business networks exist in the same region, and (2) it is easier
to follow an investment and to communicate with people from the region
where the investors work and live. Indeed, investors actually view this
regional knowledge as a competitive advantage. On the other hand, the
other investors who were studied Inge and Egil - work and live in central
parts of the country, yet are not focused upon investing in these.
Nevertheless, they are also concerned about geography, deeming the entire
country as their region. These investors have more nationwide personal and
business networks, but these networks are, to a large extent, related to
speciﬁc industries.
Addressing research question 2: screening/evaluation

The empirical ﬁndings with regard to the role of social capital in the
process of screening/evaluating interesting investment proposals are
summarized in table 8. Some of the investors in this study have derived
their experience and the preponderance of their business networks from
speciﬁc industries. These industry speciﬁc investors tend to take care of the
initial evaluation of projects themselves, whereas investors with a more
general business experience rely on information accessed and shared within
regional networks. However, if, after an initial evaluation they decide to go
further with the project, they all perform a more thorough investigation of
the technology, market, management team, ﬁnancial status, intellectual

property rights, and so on. An interesting aspect of investors with industry
related networks is that they tend to have access to and share information
with international partners.
The experienced business angels in this study emphasize that they are
investing in the very early stages in the life cycle of entrepreneurial
ventures. Consequently, they must by-and-large depend on the
information provided by the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team, and
are therefore very much concerned with the perceived trustworthiness of
the entrepreneur or entrepreneurial team. Furthermore, this study
indicates that there is a clear link between the relational and cognitive
dimension of social capital in the screening/evaluation process. The
investors in this study perceive the creation of some kind of common
platform involving shared goals and values as an antecedent for
developing trustworthy relationships between entrepreneurs and investors. If this common platform is found to be lacking they reject the
investment opportunity. The cognitive dimension seems be very
important when it comes to co-investments; the investors in this study
are long-term investors and they will not invest along with short-term
investors. They want to co-invest as long as they and their co-investors
identify themselves with common goals and values. Some of the
investors emphasize the importance of existing investors when they
consider making a new investment. Investor 1, Roar, illustrates this
when he says that he considers an existing investor as a kind of
guarantor; if he has worked with the investor before and considers him
to be trustworthy, Roar is likely to consider the venture to be
trustworthy as well. Moreover, this may explain why network ties and
previous track records are of vital importance when operating in the
informal venture capital market. The regional investors (or industryspeciﬁc investors) have a proﬁle that is well known in a speciﬁc context.
Entrepreneurs and potential co-investors can ‘check out’ what they can
expect from each other and this makes it easier to create a common
platform.
Discussion
The analysis has identiﬁed a number of intriguing ﬁndings that need
further discussion. Whereas previous research has suggested that it is
difﬁcult for informal investors to identify enough interesting investment
proposals, this study of experienced business angels has revealed a different
picture. The investors studied do not see deal ﬂow a problem; they are
rather more concerned about their limited investment capacity. The reason
for this seems to be rooted in the fact that their track records and the
information transferred through regional or industry networks constantly
provides them with interesting investment proposals. Furthermore, this
study indicates that the opportunities identiﬁed through regional or
industry speciﬁc networks are of higher quality than the opportunities
offered directly from other sources. Accordingly, the following propositions are advocated:

<-----Page 22----->358

ROGER SØRHEIM

Downloaded By: [University of Waterloo] At: 18:22 26 June 2007

P1a: Experienced business angels identify interesting investment
opportunities mainly through regional or industry speciﬁc networks.
P1b: Investment opportunities identiﬁed via personal or businessrelated networks are of a higher quality than opportunities gained
from other sources.
This study also ﬁnds that investors who are oriented towards investment
opportunities in the region where they live and work have general business
experience and track records related to speciﬁc regions. This means that an
orientation towards investments in geographic proximity is related to the
extent to which an investor has a previous track record from a speciﬁc
region. In contrast, investors with more industry speciﬁc experience are
oriented towards investment opportunities within a speciﬁc industry, that
is, within the industry where they have a track record and extensive
network ties. It can be argued that the regionally oriented investors in this
study are generalists in their own region, whereas the industry-oriented
investors are specialists in speciﬁc industries. This indicates that it is
difﬁcult be an investor in a context where you do not have a track record.
Accordingly, the following proposition is advocated:
P2: It is where the investor has a track record that determines how
and in which contexts business angels identify interesting investment
opportunities.
An interesting ﬁnding is that sector or industry oriented investors do the
initial screening themselves, whereas investors with a more general
investment philosophy rely more on the information from, or the judgment
of, individuals in their regional networks. This study’s analysis with regard to
the screening and evaluation of projects indicates that experienced business
angels, in general, are quite sophisticated when it comes to the screening and
evaluation of projects, thus supporting previous indications that serial
investors undertake a more thorough evaluation of the projects. Based on the
reported ﬁndings in this paper, the following propositions are offered:
P3a: Industry speciﬁc investors take care of the initial screening
themselves to a greater extent than other business angels.
P3b: Experienced business angels undertake a more thorough
screening and evaluation of interesting investment proposals.
Though due-diligence activities are considered important, investors are
very aware of the fact that they are investing in the entrepreneur or the
entrepreneurial team when engaging in this kind of early stage investment;
the investors studied also emphasize the perceived trustworthiness of the
entrepreneur. The empirical ﬁndings in this paper indicate an evident link
between the cognitive and relational dimensions of social capital. A
common platform (common goals and values) is necessary in order to forge
trustworthy relationships with both entrepreneurs and potential co-

investors. It is obvious that these relationships are easier to create if the
investor has a positive track record within the context where he or she
operates. Based on this, the following propositions are proffered:
P4a: The creation of common ground (goals and values) is a
necessary antecedent for the development of long-term trustworthy
relationships with the entrepreneur or the entrepreneurial team.
P4b: The creation of common ground (goals and values) is a
necessary antecedent for the development of long-term trustworthy
relationships with co-investors or a group of co-investors.
Conclusions and implications
This paper has examined the pre-investment behaviour of experienced
business angels using insights from social capital theory. One of the
most intriguing ﬁndings in this study is that, to a large extent, the
previous track record of business angels determines how they operate in
the informal venture capital market. It is quite rational for individuals
whose main experience stems from a speciﬁc region to make the
overwhelming majority of their investments in this region. It is this
regional track record that gives them a competitive advantage in the
informal venture capital market. Moreover, this reasoning seems to be
valid with regard to individuals with industry speciﬁc experience, where
a regional track record is supplanted by an industry speciﬁc record: they
are oriented towards industry rather than geographic proximity. Another
interesting point is that these industry speciﬁc investors take care of the
initial screening themselves to a large extent, whereas regional investors
are generalists who rely on information provided by their regional
networks. The business angels in this study are very much concerned
with creating common ground with entrepreneurs and potential coinvestors.
This paper suggests that insights from social capital theory enhance our
understanding of the pre-investment process of business angels. The
structural dimension plays a key role when accessing and sharing relevant
information within regional or industry networks. The relational
dimension is to large extent related to the perceived trustworthiness of
the investor, for in order to be considered trustworthy the investor must
establish a positive reputation (track record) within an industry or
regional context. With regard to the cognitive dimension, this study
suggests that the creation of common ground is a necessary antecedent for
developing trustworthy relationships with potential entrepreneurs as well
as potential co-investors. Another important point is that the three
dimensions are interrelated. This means that both the bridging and the
bonding view of social capital must be integrated in order to better
understand the pre-investment process among business angels. This
speaks for the type of integrative approach suggested by Nahapiet and
Ghosal (1998).

Practical implications

A question that needs to be asked is: what about the investors who lack a
track record, but have the will to invest in the informal venture capital
market? Track record is not only correlated to someone’s reputation as an
investor, but could also be related to previous experience as an
entrepreneur or experience from a speciﬁc industry. The implication for
novice investors is that they should try to identify potential co-investors or
groups of investors. The study indicates that experienced investors may be
willing to include less experienced investors if they share the same goals
and values. The potential investor’s previous track record as an
entrepreneur or employee will also inﬂuence the decision to include less
experienced investors in the experienced business angel’s investment
network.
‘Virgin’ investors could, of course, also use the various forms of
business introduction services, which can be found all over the world.
However, one of the problems with these services is that they are
organized in such a way as to be open to everyone, which means that
you may get ‘B’ proposals and ‘B’ ideas. As a result, these introduction
services are not attractive to experienced angels (Kelly and Hay 1999,
Sørheim and Landström 2001). The success of Business Angel Network
(BAN) models, which accept any investor and any entrepreneur, has
been limited (in terms of deals funded). However, they have probably
played a signiﬁcant role when it comes to raising awareness about
business angels as an important source of equity. This conﬁrms
Granovetter’s (1985) notion that building institutional arrangements is
not enough.
There has been a recent trend towards the establishment of more
structured angel groups, both regionally as well as with respect to
speciﬁc industries (May 2002). Cerullo and Sommer (2002) report on
experiences from an industry speciﬁc network that focuses on
innovative business start-ups entering a variety of healthcare markets.
This network was founded by three healthcare entrepreneurs and has
45 members, typically cashed out entrepreneurs, with the aim of
helping these ﬁrms ‘out of the garage and into to the market’ (Cerullo
and Sommer 2002). This network, like most structured angel groups,
has a paid staff member who takes care of pre-screening the projects,
but involves investors from the network in the due-diligence process.
Joining such structured angel groups may be the right solution for
those who need to gain investor experience. However, we have very
little evidence about the success of such groups (or BANs). Time will
show if they are sustainable (Mason and Harrison 2000, May 2002). A
particular problem in Norway is that such groups barely exist. The
government could potentially support the establishment of this kind of
arena ﬁnancially, but these arenas must be initiated and run by the
business angels themselves. These forums or ‘investor clubs’ should
have some kind of regional or, alternatively, industry/sectoral anchoring. Entrepreneurs will beneﬁt considerably from this, since investor
clubs or syndicates will be more visible in the regions or sectors they

in. At a minimum, they will be known to the various kinds of
and private ‘helpers’. Furthermore, these structured angel
could be linked to various forms of incubators, science parks,
on.
Implications for further research

This exploratory study has provided an enhanced picture of the preinvestment behaviour of experienced business angels. The study indicates
that insights from social capital theory seem to be viable in examining how
business angels operate in the informal venture capital market. Therefore,
future research should continue to examine business angels’ investment
behaviour using insight from social capital theory. Moreover, larger
samples can be used to test concepts from this study, thus, garnering more
reliable results to extend our knowledge about how business identify and
evaluate investment opportunities.
This study has adopted a supply side approach. It is therefore
appropriate for other studies investigating how entrepreneurs experience
the pre-investment process to be undertaken, in particular, attempting to
determine to what extent the entrepreneur actually is conscious about, or
capable of, discriminating between potential investors. A study by Sætre
(2003) shows that some entrepreneurs are actually very conscious about
involving investors with relevant background and experience. This is an
issue that needs to be further explored. Another issue to be explored entails
to what extent bonding and bridging social capital may inﬂuence the formal
agreements between investors and entrepreneurs. Finally, there is also a
need for an exploration into the role of bridging and bonding social capital
with regard to the value-added contribution from business angels.

Notes
1. The ﬁve basic themes in the second interview round were: background/career, pre-investment
activities and post-investment activities. In the third round, the focus was on pre and postinvestment activities. The pre-investment section had introductory questions or sub themes
like: how do you identify investment opportunities? Type of network? How do you evaluate
opportunities? Co-investments—why and how? What is decisive for go/no go? Probing and
follow up questions were, of course, also used when needed, suggesting that his kind of
research should be carried out by researchers with considerable experience within this ﬁeld,
and who throughout, try to be sensitive to the investors’ own stories.

2. For example, Sahlman (1990: 510) who emphasizes the role of explicit contracts in early stage
ﬁnance: ‘It would be foolish for the entrepreneur to accept such contract terms if they were not
truly conﬁdent of their own abilities and deeply committed to the venture’. However, this
approach seems to fall short in several ways (Shane and Cable 1999): (1) contracts are offered
rather late in the selection process, other mechanisms must be used in earlier stages; (2)
rigorous explicit contracts are mostly used by venture capital funds; and (3) over optimism
among entrepreneurial ventures will undermine the effectiveness of using explicit contracts.
3. Moreover, the business angels in this study are often ‘lead’ investors, thus it is usually they
who actually bring in other business angels.
