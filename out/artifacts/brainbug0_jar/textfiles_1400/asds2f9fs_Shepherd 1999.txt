MacMillan, Zemann, and SubbaNarasimha 1987); and (3) the likelihood
of failure (for example, Gorman and
Sahlman 1986; Meyer, Zacharakis, and
DeCastro 1993).
The limitations of this research include problems of retrospective reporting (for example, Tyebjee and Bruno
1984), use of questionnaire responses
rather than actual evaluations (for example, MacMillan, Zemann, and SubbaNarasimha 1987; Robinson 1987), and
biases and errors associated with selfreporting (Sandberg and Hofer 1987).
Self-reporting tends to overstate the
number of criteria actually used and to
understate the weighting of the most important criteria compared to more
sophisticated decision-making techniques (Stahl and Zimmerer 1984;
Riquelme and Rickards 1992).
Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) found
that venture capitalists' "actual" decision
policies explain more variance in new
venture performance than do "espoused" policies. As the information a
venture capitalist receives increases, the
gap between "espoused" decision-making policies and "in use" decision-making policies also increases. From their
nonparametric analysis, Zacharakis and
Meyer (1998) conclude that venture capitalists' understanding of their actual
decision-making policies may be low.
Tyebjee and Bruno (1984) found that
venture capitalists' investment decisions
can be predicted from the capitalists'
perceptions of risk and return. Return is
most often evaluated by venture capitalists in terms of profitability (Robinson
1987; Robinson and Pearce 1984; Roure
and Keeley 1990); risk is usually
assessed in terms of venture failure (Gorman and Sahlman 1986; Sandberg 1986).
This study extends the work of Zacharakis and Meyer (1998) by investigating
venture capitalists' introspection into
their profitability assessments (one of
venture capitalists' key perceptions from

which investment decisions can be predicted [Tyebjee and Bruno 1984]) and
through the use of parametric statistics to
determine the significance and strength
of that introspection.
Shepherd, Ettenson, and Crouch (in
press) empirically tested a model of venture capitalists' decision-making \vhich
included the following "strategy-related"
variables: industry-related competence,
competitive rivalry, lead time, key success factor stability, educational capability, mimicry, scope, and timing. This
model demonstrates both explanatory
and predictive ability for venture capitalists' assessments of likely profitability,
and is used here to investigate the following hypothesis regarding venture
capitalists' introspection:
Hypothesis: Venture capitalists' "espoused" decision-making policy is different from their "in use" decisionmaking policy in their assessment of a
new venture's likely profitability.

Research Method
This study follows suggestions that
venture capitalists' decision-making can
be reviewed through a decision-making
framework (Riquelme and Rickards
1992; Muzyka, Birley, and Leieux 1996;
Zacharakis and Meyer 1998, in press).
Conjoint analysis is a strong tool for
decision modeling research providing
significant, structured insight into venture capitalists' decision-making criteria
(Shepherd and Zacharakis 1997).
The conjoint technique analyzes data
that are collected on decisions at the
time the decisions are made. This data
collection method contrasts with that of
previous research in the venture capital
field, which relies predominantly on
retrospective reporting techniques. Conjoint analysis uses a variant of regression
to decompose a decision into a linear or
multi-linear equation allowing separation
of attribute weights used by a venture
capitalist from an overall assessment.
Respondents' judgments are then subjected to statistical analysis to discover
which attributes affected their assessments of new venture performance and
in which ways. The use of conjoint

support the statistical tests adopted (Anderson 1981; Louviere 1988).
Dependent Variable
For this study, profitability was
defined as net profit on sales using a tenyear time horizon. An eleven-point Likert
scale was used with end anchors describing "very low profitability" and "very
high profitability." A ten-year time horizon for profitability was chosen to exceed Biggadike (1979) and McDougall et
al.'s (1994) choice of eight years to
define a new venture, as it appears reasonable to assume that a ten-year period
captures sustainable performance.^
Attributes, Levels, and Performance
For this study, venture capitalists were
asked to evaluate a series of conjoint
profiles which describe new ventures in
terms of eight attributes: (1) timing of
entry; (2) stability of key success factors;
(3) educational capability; (4) lead time;
(5) competitive rivalry; (6) mimicry; (7)
scope; and (8) industry-related competence. These eight factors, defined in
Table 1, were each manipulated at t^^vo
levels. These levels were chosen to represent the variation that typically occurs
in the decision-making environment of
venture capitalists, thereby maintaining
believability and response validity. Discussions with venture capitalists, accountants, and academics confirmed the
face validity for the attributes and their
respective levels.
Experimental Design
Each of the eight attributes is varied at
two levels in an orthogonal fractional
factorial design consisting of l6 profiles
(Hahn and Shapiro 1966). This design

enabled analysis of both individual subject and aggregate subject. Each of the l6
profiles was fully replicated, permitting
estimates of individual subject error for
use in subsequent analyses of variance.
These 32 profiles were randomly assigned to avoid order effects. With one
additional practice profile to familiarize
respondents with the task and six holdout profiles, the subjects responded to
39 profiles.
Participants
Sixty-six individual venture capitalists
representing 47 Australian venture capital firms completed the survey. The distribution of respondents' ages was: 1.5
percent under 25; 20 percent between 25
and 34; 38 percent between 35 and 44;
36 percent between 45 and 54; and 4.5
percent between 55 and 64. Thirty-five
percent of the respondents held a bachelor's degree as their highest academic
qualification, while a further 31 percent
had attained a master's degree. An academic major in business predominated
(69 percent), followed by engineering,
science, and arts/humanities (13 percent,
8 percent, and 6 percent, respectively).
Experience in venture capital ranged
from six months to 30 years, with an
average of 7.67 years and a standard
deviation of 5.91 years.
This sample captures Australia's most
senior venture capitalists. Directors,
managing directors, executive chairmen,
general managers, and CEOs represent
52 percent of the sample. Senior managers constitute a further 42 percent,
with only 6 percent of the sample accounted for by analysts. Non-government firms represented 74 percent of the
sample, with semi-government and government agencies contributing 14 percent and 12 percent respectively. Ninety-

2 Venture capitalists often look to cash out of a business within five to eight years (Timmons
1994). Venture capitalists' capital gain is based on the value of the business at the time of exit. The
value of the business is dependent upon the future cash flows extending beyond exit (Shepherd and
Douglas 1999). Therefore venture capitalists typically want to invest in businesses that have sustainable profitability. The results of this study are not expected to differ between the use of an eightor ten-year time horizon, as it appears reasonable to assume both represent sustainable performance.

Research Instrument
The research instrument used contained instructions, the experiment instrument, and a post-experimental questionnaire that included questions to elicit self-explicated weights and questions
regarding characteristics of the respondent. Relevant definitions of terms were
also included on a detachable sheet that
could be referred to while completing
the survey. Once instructions were understood, respondents considered conjoint venture descriptions and provided a
rating for each profile's likely profitability on an 11-point scale. Table 2 provides
an example of a profile used.

scale from (1) very unimportant to (11)

Analysis of Variance
To identify the determinants of new
venture performance that are statistically
significant, an individual-subject analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was performed on
the decision-making of each venture
capitalist. Although two or more attributes may significantly affect the decision
process, it is unlikely that those attributes will be of equal importance. Therefore, statistical significance at the individual level was supplemented with a
measure of relative importance. Hays'
(1973) omega squared (a)2), a measure
of explained variance, was used to
assess the relative importance of the
eight attributes.

<-----Page 5----->Reliability
Because experimental formats of the
sort used here may have been unfamiliar
to venture capitalists, it was important to
test the consistency of responses for
each individual. This provides an indication of the consistency with which each
respondent applies decision-making strategies. Sixteen replicated profiles were
evaluated with the l6 original/ identical
cases and were used in a test-retest measure using Pearson r correlations. Discussions with respondents indicated that
they were unaware that cases had been
repeated.
Respondent's Introspection
Assessment of the venture capitalists'
introspection into their decision-making
was performed by comparing their conjoint-generated importance weights with
their self-explicated and self-generated
importance weights. A difference between conjoint and self-explicated models indicates that venture capitalists have
limited insight into their own decisionmaking.

Results
Since conjoint analysis is thought to
be a more valid assessment of a respondent's "in use" decision-making policy
than analysis dependent upon venture
capitalists' "espoused" policy, the following results report the relationship found
between the participants' importance
measures based on the conjoint analysis
and their self-reported attributions of importance. The relative importance of
each "in use" attribute was calculated as
a percentage of attribute importance
(that is, each attribute's omega squared
value) over the total importance of all
eight attributes.'' The same calculation of
relative importance was used for "espoused" attributes. Table 3 demonstrates
the relative aggregate importance of
attributes derived from conjoint analysis
(that is, the "in use" importance of attributes in venture capitalists' assessment of
likely new venture performance) compared to those relative measures calculated from self-explicated methods.

hypothetical ventures and environments
may reduce the external validity of the
study. However, paper representations
are often useful for capturing real policies (for example, Brehmer 1988; Phelps
and Shanteau 1978; Riquelme and
Rickards 1992). As Brehmer and Brehmer (1988, p. 89) point out: "Professional
judgment may therefore involve some
abstract coding of the cues (attributes),
similar to that provided by policy
capturing tasks."
A further limitation of the study may
be that coded dichotomous attributes
might eliminate perceptual elements
from the task, thereby placing less emphasis on the judges' ability to extract attribute information. There is also the
possibility that respondents could place
importance on some attributes only
because they are presented in the experiment. For practical purposes, however,
more detailed descriptions which would
allow for attribute extraction would increase the time to complete the experiment to an unrealistic and unmanageable level. Schepanski, Tubbs, and Grimlund (1992) show that experienced
judges are unlikely to place importance
on an attribute solely because it has
been presented in an experiment. While
both of these criticisms of conjoint analysis represent limitations of the technique,

presumably measures of the same thing.
Furthermore, since participants provided
their assessment of attribute importance
immediately after completing tbe conjoint task, their insight into the use of the
eight factors should be considerably better than might otherwise be the case for
retrospective data. However, while venture capitalists say that they perceive
each of the eight factors to be equally
important, in fact they consider some
factors to be much more important than
others. In particular, industry-related
competence was by far the most important factor "in use," while factors such as
key success factor stability, lead time,
scope, and mimicry of entry wedge
played relatively small roles. Results
from this correlation analysis of venture
capitalists' profitability assessments are
presented in the diagonal in Table 4.
From Table 4, it appears that venture
capitalists have only limited introspection into their profitability assessments,
with only one of the self-explicated factor weights significantly correlated with a
conjoint-derived factor weight. The
mean correlation across the eight self-explicated weights with their corresponding conjoint-derived factor weight is only

<-----Page 8----->the accuracy of venture capitalists' introspection is limited. This result has implications for venture capitalists, venture
capital firms, entrepreneurs, and scholars. For example, this study will hopefully increase awareness of the gap between venture capitalists' "in use" and
"espoused" decision-making policies, an
awareness that might encourage caution
in generalizing venture capitalists'
"espoused" policies to their actual decisions. Also, venture capitalists may be
able to improve their introspection by reducing the gap between their "in use"
and "espoused" decision-making policies
by altering the "espoused" policy to
coincide with the "in use" policy (assuming the "in use" policy has higher predictive ability than the "espoused" policy).
The implications of this study may be
useful to venture capital firms as well. A
venture capital firm may have developed
a decision-making policy it wishes its
venture capitalists to follow. This
research suggests that while venture capitalists might say and believe they are
using the firm's policy, they may not be
in their actual assessments. In this case,
venture capitalists may wish to decrease
the gap between their "in use" and "espoused" decision-making policies by
adapting their actual policy to the espoused policy of their firm. Doing this
may be useful in fostering organizational
learning—the knowledge of one generation of venture capitalists can be passed
down to the next generation within a
firm and may thus come to represent an
important strategic asset.
Feedback is important to fostering organizational and/or individual learning.
While there are many factors that can
affect the investment decision outcome,
this study suggests that a comparison of
a venture capitalist's "in use" decisionmaking policy with the outcome of that
decision is likely to provide feedback
superior to a comparison of "espoused"
decision-making policy with the outcome of that decision.
Parties interested in the venture capital process might benefit from a better

84

understanding of the way venture capitalists actually make decisions. Presently,
entrepreneurs attempt to target their
business plans and presentations
towards those attributes venture capitalists say they use when assessing new
venture profitability. The implications of
this study are that entrepreneurs are better off aiming for those attributes that
venture capitalists actually do use in
their assessments, which appear to be
different from those they say they use.
By targeting the attributes venture capitalists actually use in their assessment of
likely new venture profitability, the entrepreneur is able to present his/her investment proposal in the best possible
light (from the venture capitalists' perspective) and thereby increase the probability of obtaining venture capital. The
difficult task for entrepreneurs is determining the "in use" decision-making
policies of venture capitalists. The difficulty of this task represents an opportunity for scholars to conduct empirical research into the "in use" decision-making
of venture capitalists. This implies a
greater use of "real time" data collection
methods such as conjoint analysis.
This study may also have important
implications for the training and personal development of inexperienced venture capitalists. How should venture capital firms train their new employees?
Should experienced venture capitalists
lecture the inexperienced on the criteria
they use in assessing a new venture proposal? The findings of this research suggest that venture capitalists have limited
insight into their own profitability assessments, which makes it difficult for inexperienced venture capitalists to learn
from the "espoused" decision-making
policies of experienced venture capitalists. The information being taught should
be based, at least in part, on research revealing venture capitalists' "in use" decision-making policies. Training for venture capitalists could also involve experiential learning, that is, learning by doing.
While the benefits of experiential learning are well-documented, they appear all
the more important to venture capitalists

decision and their limited insight into
their own decision-making. Future
research needs to develop simulations
relevant to the venture capital industry.
Future research should also explore
whether there are situations or circumstances in which we would expect the
introspection of venture capitalists to be
more accurate. For example, do venture
capitalists have more accurate introspection for their survival assessments than
for their profitability assessments? Future
research could also investigate and apply
cognitive learning to the venture capital
context. Cognitive learning research may
lead to the creation of decision-making
aids based on the "in use" decision-making policies of expert venture capitalists.
Would decision-making aids increase the
quality of venture capitalists' assessments
of likely new ventures? While this study's
finding that the accuracy of venture capitalists' introspection is limited has important implications for venture capitalists, venture capital firms, entrepreneurs
seeking equity capital, and entrepreneurship scholars, there is still a need for
more cognitive research in the entrepreneurship domain.
