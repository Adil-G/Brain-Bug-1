A model hypothesizes why decision makers choose different decision
strategies in dealing with different decision problems. Given the motivation to choose the strategy which requires the least investment for
a satisfactory solution, the choice of strategy should depend upon the
type of problem, the surrounding environment, and the personal
characteristics of the decision maker.

People use a variety of strategies for making
decisions. Because these strategies are frequently suboptimal (25), a substantial amount of research has been devoted to developing techniques (decision aids) for improving decision
making effectiveness. While improved effectiveness is an important goal, we also must seek to
understand human decision making as it is, not
merely as it might be (18, 19). The latter endeavor
entails finding out why decisions are made in the
ways they are and devising a framework that can

accommodate the variety of strategies that introspection and observation suggest exist.
This article describes a framework for examining individuals' selection of strategies for
decision making. A decision strategy consists of:
(a) the set of procedures that the decision maker
engages in when attempting to select among alternative courses of action, and (b) a decision
rule that dictates how the results of the engaged1 This research was supported by Office of Naval Research

Decision Strategies
All of us possess repertoires of decision strat-

<-----Page 3----->Academy of Management Review - July 1978
egies; we have numerous ways to deal with decision problems even if they are not all equally
effective. Moreover, there are characteristics
that are shared by various strategies that, for the
purposes of discussion, permit the division of
them into categories and the ordering of them
within those categories. We have chosen to use
three categories: aided-analytic, unaided-analytic, and nonanalytic. We will define each of these
and give a few examples of their contents. The
examples are not intended to constitute an exhaustive list but to serve merely as illustrations.
Aided-Analytic Strategies - This category
contains strategies that require the decision
maker to apply a prescribed procedure utilizing
tools such as pencil and paper, mathematics,
calculator or computer, etc., in a guided, systematic attempt to analyze the decision and
evaluate its components. These strategies always
require training or invention, and frequently a
technician is employed to help. Decision analysis (and the aid of a decision analyst) is in this category as are all normative decision models considered optimal in some sense or other in economics, statistics, operations analysis, etc. Moreover, this category contains many complex procedures that may or may not be optimal, such
as some that are used in siting of highways, power plants, and similar large-scale institutional decisions. The latter are not necessarily optimal but
they are formalized, prescriptive approaches to
immensely complicated and information-laden
decisions and are, therefore, within the definition of the aided-analytic category.
We are all familiar with examples of some
of these strategies. In the business environment
there currently are available rather complex
forecasting models which are designed to help
the decision maker (2). Somewhat less grand,
but still within the aided-analytic category, are
strategies involving the listing and evaluation of
outcomes that could occur if each alternative
were selected. These strategies typically involve
decomposition of the problem through use of
decision trees. Finally, there are strategies which
simply involve the listing of pros and cons of al-

441

ternatives and some sort of balancing or weighting of these consequences (called "moral algebra" by Benjamin Franklin).While not as complicated as decision trees," "moral algebra" still
represents an aided-analytic strategy.
Unaided-Analytic Strategies - This category
contains strategies for which an attempt is made
to explore the dimensions of the problem but
for which no tools are used, and the decision
maker restricts processing to the confines of his
or her mind; these are the decision strategies
that have been studied most by psychologists
using the normative models from the aidedanalytic category as comparison models.
Examples of fairly structured unaided-analytic strategies are the various approximations to
the Subjective Expected Utilitystrategy (SEU)that
decision makers perform entirely in their heads.
In these strategies, the decision maker attempts
to think about the outcomes that could result
from the available choices as well as the chances
of those outcomes occurring and then chooses
the alternative that seems in some rough way to
offer the best potential. Gray (9) found that third
grade children's choices of arithmetic problems
to solve appeared to be arrived at by this strategy, and Tversky (29), Shanteau and Anderson
(22), Shanteau (21), Holmstrom and Beach (11),
and many others have found that adults frequently use something quite like it too. Research
stemming from expectancy models (8, 15)
(which are similar in conception to the SEU
model) reinforces the conclusion that people
sometimes attempt such strategies (16).
Most utility maximization strategies are
compensatory in nature: less of one aspect of
an outcome can be compensated for by more
of another aspect. This characteristic makes
them, quite cumbersome for the unaided decision maker because each outcome must be
evaluated separately for each of its aspects, and
then the utility of each aspect must be summed
to arrive at the outcome's overall utility. Strategies are available that are less demanding but
still compensatory in nature, such as Tversky's
additive difference model (30). A well known

<-----Page 4----->442
noncompensatory strategy is Simon's (24) "satisficing" strategy in which the decision maker selects the first decision alternative that exceeds
some "minimum aspiration level". This strategy's procedure consists of comparing the various aspects of outcomes to predetermined criteria rather than evaluating each of them, summing, and then comparing the summaries; the
decision rule is sufficiency rather than maximization. Related strategies have been proposed
by Coombs (3), Dawes (5), and Einhorn (7).
Similar yet simpler noncompensatory strategies are the Elimination by Aspects strategy (31)
and the Lexicographic strategy (30). When using
the former, the decision maker selects one aspect of the decision alternatives, eliminates all
alternatives that do not possess that aspect, selects another aspect, eliminates alternatives, etc.
until only one alternative remains. When using
the Lexicographic strategy, the decision maker
selects the most important aspect of the alternatives and eliminates all alternatives except the
one that is superior to all the others on it; if none
are superior on that aspect the decision maker
drops it and moves to the next most important
aspect, etc. These kinds of strategies have the advantage of reducing information processing by
restricting attention to only part of the available
information about the alternatives, but they have
the disadvantage of introducing possible irrationalities such as intransitivity of preference (30).
Payne (19) examined some of the conditions
that lead decision makers to shift from compensatory unaided-analytic strategies to noncompensatory ones. His task required participants to
gather information in order to arrive at a preference among alternative apartments to rent. The
results were that as task complexity increased
(i.e., as the number of decision alternatives and
the amount of information about them increased), there was a shift from compensatory
strategies to noncompensatory strategies that involved elimination of alternatives on the basis of
a subset of information. Moreover, having eliminated some alternatives in this way, thereby having reduced task complexity, some decision

A Contingency Model for the Selection of Decision Strategies

makers returned to a compensatory strategy to
decide among the remaining alternatives. The
importance of these findings to the present
model will become apparent later.
Finally,the least formalized of the unaidedanalytic strategies involves the construction of
mental movies or "scripts" (1) in which the decision maker imagines how things might be if
this or that decision alternative were chosen and
then picks the alternative for which the script
turns out best. The scripts can be simple and
sketchy or elaborate and detailed but the principle is the same for all of them - imagine how
things would be if x or y or z were the chosen alternative, and choose the one for which the imagined result is best.
Nonanalytic Strategies - This category con-

tains fairly simple, preformulated rules that are
applied by rote to decision tasks. They differ
from aided- and unaided-analytic strategies in
that little information is procured or processed,
little time is needed, and the rules do not require
that the decision be decomposed nor that its
multiple aspects be considered. Examples are
"Eeny, meeny, miney, mo .. .," flipping a coin,

or basing action selection such as whether to go
sailing or not on "Red sky at night - sailors'delight; red sky in morning - sailors take warning". Such homiletic rules frequently are heard
in organizational settings. Both "Better safe than
sorry" or "A bird in the hand is worth two in the
bush" represent conservative strategies in contrast to the riskierstrategy of "Nothing ventured,
nothing gained". Of course, there is the difficulty
that these rules often are quoted as rationalizations for decisions based on other strategies, particularly when the decision maker does not recognize or does not wish to defend his or her actual strategy. But quite frequently, simple rules
do serve as decision strategies, especially when
they apply to specific tasks; many rules are acquired to deal with specific tasks through experience, training, or instruction. Familiar examples of the latter are the lists of helpful hints included in the instruction booklets that accompany appliances, tools, cameras or the like, or

<-----Page 5----->Academy of Management Review - July1978
the "tips to homemakers" columns in newspapers.
More idiosyncratic rules might be such
things as alternating daily between wearing a
blue suit and brown suit or always going to the
restaurant that one has visited least recently. Not
having the same kind of meat for dinner as one
had for lunch is another example.
Other nonanalytic strategies involve compliance with convention. This may be conscious
(explicit) or unconscious (inexplicit); we each
know the rules of our culture and subculture,
but we do not always know that we know them
even though we may abide by them (10). Thus,
for example, we may consciously elect to comply with the new conventions of word use and
refer to people as "chairpersons", and we may
unconsciously comply with culture's conventions of leaving a stool between ourselves and
the next person at a cafe counter or maintaining
rather specific speaking distances between ourselves and others of different social status or sex.
Finally, the most nonanalytic strategy of all
is habit. Habit is not to be scorned merely because it is the extreme example of rote application of a rule. After all, it is efficient, and it possibly may be the product of an earlier, more
reasoned strategy which has become mechanical in order to realize the economy of not having
to go through the whole strategy selection process each time the decision task is encountered.
Because the majority of decisions are mundane
and made repeatedly, habit is a valuable strategy. Moreover, neither habit nor any of the nonanalytic strategies is completely without analytic
qualities - some analysis is necessary if the decision maker is to recognize that the present decision task is sufficiently similar to previous ones
for which the rule has been successful enough to
warrant using it again. This is why habit and the
other nonanalytic strategies are true strategies
and not just decision rules; they require at least
a little processing prior to actually making the
decision.
Differences and Similarities - The major
difference among these three categories is in the

443

differing degrees of analysisthat their constituent
strategies require, and, as a result, the amount of
required resources (time, effort, and/or money). Aided-analytic strategies use formal procedures to lay out the problem and to decompose
it into subparts for subanalyses. They often require extensive information procurement; they
rely on application of often complex logical procedures, usually mathematics, to decompose
the problem and to recompose it again and to
provide summary statements to which a decision rule can be applied in some precise manner. All of this is done using tools and at a cost.
Unaided-analytic strategies require attempts
to at least consider different components of the
decision problem, but in part because no tools
are used, the degree to which this is done systematically and thoroughly is dictated solely by
the abilities and desires of the decision maker.
The limits of unaided human information processing preclude complicated problems or procedures, and even simpler ones require sustained hard work. The strategy of using scripts as
a basis for decisions may be the most information rich procedure in this category because it
frequently uses both auditory and visual imagery.
But, even though they are easy to use, scripts
seldom are systematically composed, and they
run the danger of biased selection of information for inclusion (wishful thinking or "catastrophizing"), thus emphasizing the trade-off between ease of use and general accuracy.
Nonanalytic strategies require very little analshort
of mere verification that the rule is apysis
to
plicable the decision task at hand. How similar
or dissimilar the present task has to be to past
tasks before a rule is tried has been studied as
transfer of training and stimulus generalization
by learning psychologists. Nonanalytic strategies
are quick and require little in the way of resource
expenditure although the behavioral alternative
decided upon may itself be quite complicated.
There are some similaritiesamong the three
categories but they are fewer than the differences. First,the strategies in all three have decision rules. This is not merely because strategies

<-----Page 6----->444

are defined that way but because no decision is
possible without a decision rule. Some process
guides our action. Second, all three categories
involve pre-decision procedures; aided-analytic
strategies tend to involve a lot and nonanalytic
strategies tend to involve relativelylittle.
Third, within each category, the strategies
can be ordered from what, for want of better
terms, we shall call formal to informal. In the
aided-analytic category, strategies range from
full blown decision analysis through strategies
like simplified decision trees to "moral algebra."
in the unaided-analytic category, they range
from approximations to subjective expected
utility maximization through noncompensatory
alternative-eliminating strategies to the production of mental scripts. In the nonanalytic category, they range from rule-of-thumb through
adherence to convention to simple habit. Within each category, this range of strategies reflects
differences in the number of resources required
to use them; the resource requirements generally decrease both as one goes from the aidedanalytic to the unaided-analytic to the nonanalytic categories and as one goes from formal to
informal strategies within a category.
Why then would one ever choose a strategy
that requires much analysis and the investment
of a great deal of time and energy? The answer
lies in the characteristics of the task and of the
decision maker.
Characteristicsof the Decision Task
Because strategy selection is a subjective
process, the influence of task characteristics on
it is mediated by the decision maker's perception of those characteristics.Thus, while it is not
possible to entirely disentangle task characteristics and decision maker characteristics, it is possible to separate them conceptually by defining
task characteristics as the decision maker's interpretations of the demands and constraints of
the specific task at hand and by defining decision maker characteristicsas enduring aspects of
the decision maker that are not task specific.
Task characteristics can be further divided into

A Contingency Model for the Selection of Decision Strategies

two groups: those that are inherent in the decision problem itself (e.g., the number of possible
alternative courses of action that must be considered) and those that describe the decision environment (e.g., the significance of the decision). Both contribute to strategy selection.
The Decision Problem - While the number

of characteristicsthat might differentiate specific
decision problems is no doubt greater than we
presently envisage, we can at least sort out some
general ones that are likely to prove important.
Unfamilarity -

Is the degree to which the

decision problem is foreign to the decision
maker. Past experience with the same or similar
problems can, on the one hand, provide either a
specific strategy that has been used successfully
before or, on the other hand, it can rule out unsuccessful strategies. Lack of such experience
means that the decision maker must take more
care in approaching the problem.
Ambiguity -

Is the degree to which the

Complexity -

Is the number of different

problem is unclear to the decision maker. This
includes the ambiguity of the goals, decision alternatives, constraints, etc. as well as the unavailability, unreliability, and imprecision of relevant
information.
components of the decision problem: number
of alternatives to be considered and amount of
relevant information to be considered (recallthe
above discussion of Payne (19) as well as number
of criteria on which the decision will be judged,
etc. Also included in complexity is the degree to
which the problem will influence future decisions; if one must choose the best alternative
early on and also anticipate the consequences of
these decisions on later events, the situation is
complex.
Instability -

Is the degree to which the cri-

teria, goals and constraints of the problem
change during and after the decision, particularly if those changes are difficult to predict.
Many of the above characteristicshave been
reviewed and discussed by others. Although
MacCrimmon and Taylor (13), for example, discuss problem uncertainty and complexity in

<-----Page 7----->445

Academy of Management Review - July 1978
some detail and the various strategies that can be
used to deal with these problems, they do not
provide a rationale for why one strategy is likely
to be preferred over another, nor do any other
authors dealing with these characteristics at the
individual decision making level.
The Decision Environment - Besides the
specifics inherent in the decision problem, there
are also more general, situational factors that influence the selection of a strategy. These characteristics, which have generally been omitted
from the decision literature, are:
- Most decisions are not allIrreversibility
or-none; the decision maker usually can make
the decision, monitor its effects, and reverse the
decision if things go poorly. But when this cannot
be done, it increases the stress of making the decision by increasing pressure to be correct or
having to live with the negative consequences.
- The
Significance
significance of the problem is determined both by the magnitudes of
the outcomes involved and the breadth of the
decision's ramifications for other parts of the decision maker's life, e.g., making a correct decision may be important in and of itself and may
also influence future promotions, self-esteem,
etc.
Accountability - This is the degree to which
the decision maker is to be accountable for the
results of the decision. One kind of accountability is personally imposed and results from personal involvement with the decision and the outcomes related to it. Another kind is externally
imposed and results from being accountable to
others for the decision's results rather than for
the quality of the procedure used to make the
decision. High accountability increases the pressure to be correct.
Time and/or Money Constraints - Sometimes decision tasks allow ample time for deliberation and processing, but more often there are
deadlines. There are few opportunities that do
not expire, few decisions that must not be resolved before things can progress, few other persons willing to tolerate prolonged indecisiveness. When time is limited, an upper limit is

placed on the resources that can be expended
and, therefore, some strategies are eliminated
from consideration. By the same token, if there
are limits on the money one is permitted to
spend on information procurement and/or decision technology, some strategies cannot be
used.
Characteristics of the Decision Maker
While the list certainly is not exhaustive, it
seems that the following personal characteristics probably influence strategy selection. Note
that we have omitted most of the "personality"
variables that might be expected to be included
(e.g., risk-taking and risk-aversion). This is because few solid data exist that reliably relate personality characteristics to specific decision strategies.
Knowledge
Probably the greatest influence on strategy selection is the decision maker's knowledge, or lack of it, about the available
strategies and their relative promise of success.
Usually, aided-analytic strategies are only available through training; most of the other strategies are developed in the course of experience,
which also is a source of knowledge.
With knowledge about the existence of
strategies come opinions about their appropriateness and their relative likelihoods of yielding
a "correct" decision. Only decision scientists focus on making decisions correctly rather than on
making correct decisions; most people would
find little consolation in knowing that they followed the right procedure, gambled, and lost.
In general, people in our culture regard
the more formally analytic strategies as the ones
most likely to yield correct decisions even if they
seldom or never use them - the explictness and
prescriptive authoritativeness of such strategies
make them defensible and give the impression
of thoroughness and logical rigor. Of course, this
faith is misplaced if the wrong strategy is applied
to the problem, but the point here is the decision maker's perception.
Ability
Knowledge of and faith in strategies is fundamental, but the ability to exercise

<-----Page 8----->446
that knowledge is quite as important. For someone who lacks the ability, the time and effort
that must be expended in the use of a particular
strategy is greater for someone who has the ability. In short, the less able person must devote
more of his or her personal resources of time
and effort to using strategies and therefore can
be expected to be less willing to select strategies
with high personal resource requirements. The
more intelligent, cognitively complex, and analytic the individual is, the easier it should be to
use analytic rather than nonanalytic strategies
and, within a given category, formal rather than
informal strategies (20).
Motivation - Whatever their intelligence,
cognitive complexity, or characteristic approach
to problems, people making decisions strive to
expend the least personal resources compatible
with the demands of the decision task. It is not
merely that they are lazy: often there are other
demands; sometimes there is a personal need
to appear resolute and decisive, and often there
is a tendency to avoid the emotional aspects of
- what William James
prolonged deliberation
called "the impatience of the deliberative state"
(12). Of course, countering impetuousity is what
James called "the dread of the irrevocable" (irreversibility), but unless the latter is fairly strong,
the press to decide, to get the matter settled and
to cease working on it often is a powerful motivator for selecting the fastest and easiest strategies within reason. This motivation serves as the
mechanism for linking the parts of the model we
have described thus far.
Linking the Parts
At this point, the model consists of the following proposition: the selection of different
decision strategies (aided-analytic, unaided-analytic, and nonanalytic) is contingent upon the decision problem (the characteristics of the task
and the environment) and the decision maker
(his or her knowledge, ability, and motivation).
Given the motivation to choose the strategy
which requires the least investment for a satisfactory solution, different strategies will be

A Contingency Model for the Selection of Decision Strategies

chosen depending upon the type of problem,
the surrounding environment, and the personal
qualities of the decision maker. The next step is
to link these parts.
The Decision

Task -

To facilitate discus-

sion, we are going to impose some oversimplifications. First, we will deal with the characteristics of the decision task only in terms of the extreme (e.g., high in ambiguity, complexity, instability, and unfamiliarity or low on these dimensions). Second, we will assume that there
always is ample time and money to execute
whatever strategy the decision maker would
prefer to use. Third, we will assume that the relationship between the felt pressure to use a
more analytic technique and the task or personal characteristicsis positive and linear. Increased
task demands, situational demands, or knowledge and ability should increase the pressure to
use analytic procedures. (While this generally
linear relationship is posited to hold in most circumstances, it probably breaks down at extremes. For example, when the problem becomes too complex, too ambiguous, unfamiliar

and unstable, the individual may just give up or
revert to a simpler decision strategy.) We will
discuss some of these points more thoroughly
after the following examples.
When we consider decision tasks that are
consistently high or low in these task characteristics, the predictions are rather simple. Unfamiliar, complex, uncertain, irreversible, and significant decisions should demand more from the
decision maker. Analytic strategies are more
likely to be used. The opposite of this setting (e.
g., simple, certain, reversible, insignificant problems) should result in less analytic procedures
being used.
In some cases, the variables might present
a more complex mix. Consider a task in which
the problem is unfamiliar,ambiguous, complex,
and unstable, but reversability exists, the decision is of little significance, and there is low accountability. The task demands would suggest
an analytic procedure, but the environmental
demands would not. The leniency of the envi-

<-----Page 9----->Academy of Management Review - July 1978

ronment and the muddle of the problem might
encourage selection of the least analytic strategy
that will result in a satisfactory answer; since the
decision is not very important, why should one
spend a lot of time trying to analyze this difficult
and complex problem?
Finally,consider a decision task in which the
problem is familiar, unambiguous, simple, and
stable, but the environment imposes irreversability, high significance, and high accountability.
Here the task characteristicsare such that a nonanalytic or informal unaided-analytic strategy
might be favored (e.g., use an old solution), but
the environmental demands are sufficiently
stringent to encourage caution and use of a
more analytic approach.
Most decision tasks would involve a range
of states of their constituent characteristics,and
different characteristics would be in different
states. But these examples may serve to convey
the general idea that the choice is contingent on
the characteristics of the problem and its surrounding environment.
The Decision Maker - Continuing the use
of extremes and assuming no time or money
constraints, consider a decision maker who is
highly knowledgeable about decision strategies
(perhaps even understands and has faith in decision analysis),who is highly intelligent and capable of applying his or her knowledge about strategies, who is cognitively complex and given to
systematic, analytic thinking and who, therefore, has the ability to use analytic strategies
without expending too much in the way of resources. Call this constellation an A person and
the opposite a B person.
Again, using the extremes we would expect
that individual A will typically select analytic over
less analytic strategies and formal over informal
ones within a given analytic level. Individual B,
on the other hand, should prefer less analytic
strategies to analytic ones and informal strategies to formal ones.
The Model - As can be inferred from the
foregoing, strategy selection is viewed as a compromise between the press for more decision

447

accuracy as the demands of the decision task increase and the decision maker's resistance to the
expenditure of his or her personal resources.
We will attempt to make this more explicit but
first an important caveat: Clearly the variables
we are combining are not wholly independent,
but we are treating them as such and using an
additive formulation. Both assumptions may require modification, but as a first step this may
provide an approximation that can be made
more precise as research proceeds.
The demand of the decision problem (D dp)
is the weighted (W) sum of the problem's unfamiliarity (Uf), ambiguity (Am), complexity (C),
and instability (Is). High Ddp represents a demand for a strategy that will help clarify the problem and make it tractable.
Ddp = WUf Uf + WAm Am + WcC
W s Is.

+

The demand of the decision environment
(D de) is the weighted (W) sum of the decision's
irreversibility (Ir), significance (S), and the decision maker's accountability (Ac). Time constraints, while they are part of the decision environment, are not included in this equation because they play a separate role that will be described later. The quation is:
Dde = W Ir lr + Ws S + WAc Ac.
High Dde represents a demand for a strategy
that will yield a correct decision.
Task demand (TD) is the weighted (W) sum
of the demands of the decision problem (D dp)
and the decision environment (D de).
TD = Wdp Ddp + Wde Dde.
The following seven statements link the task
demands with other parts of the model:
1.

The decision maker's utility for making
a correct decision, Uc, is an increasing
monotonic function of Dde.

2.

For a given strategy, the probability of a

<-----Page 10----->A Contingency Model for the Selection of Decision Strategies

448
correct decision, Pc, is a decreasing
monotonic function of Ddp. Generally,
analytic strategies are perceived as having a higher probability of yielding a correct decision than nonanalytic strategies,
and formal-informal strategies are similarly perceived.
3.

The decision maker's disutility for personal resource expenditure, Ue, is an increasing monotonic function of amount
of expenditure.

4.

The cost of resources (Ue) is a positively accelerated function of the perceived
probability of being correct (P ). Use of
a less analytic strategy requires, on the
average, less expenditure of personal
resources than does use of a more analytic strategy (i.e., the former are quicker and easier).

5.

For a given level of Ddp all strategies in
a decision maker's repertory can be
evaluated in terms of: first, the perceived probability that they will yield a
correct decision, and second, an estimate of the amount of personal resources they may require in their execution.

6.

For a given level of utility for a correct
decision associated with a given level of
Dde, the tendency toward selecting
strategies of ever increasing probability
of being correct is checked by the disutility for increased resource expenditure. Thus, the difference between the
expected benefit (Pc Uc) and the expected cost (Ue) is the expected net
gain. The strategy that maximizes expected net gain is the strategy that will
be selected, i.e., the strategy associated
with the Pc and Ue which determine
the maximum.

7.

time and
Environmentally imposed
money constraints automatically exclude some strategies from considera-

tion (although compensation for one
constraint by increased expenditure of
the other may limit the number of excluded strategies). Both constraints exclude those strategies that require a high
degree of analysis, and they thereby exercise their effects primarily on strategies that have a high perceived probability of success. This may force selection of a strategy that yields less than the
maximumgain.
To summarize, strategy selection is contingent upon a (cost/benefit) compromise between the decision maker's desire to make a
correct decision and his or her negative feelings
about investing time and effort in the decision
making process. The desire to be correct is seen
as contingent upon the demands of the task environment. Environmentally imposed time and
money constraints reduce the number of strategies that can be selected. The choice of a strategy
also reflects the decision maker'scharacteristics,
particularlyknowledge of and faith in the various
strategies, as well as his or her opinion about the
resources each requires for implementation.
The decision maker's knowledge determines
the strategies in the repertory, while faith can be
seen as the decision maker's perception of the
probabilitythat each strategy could lead to a correct decision of it were selected. The estimated
resource requirement is the price the decision
maker thinks will have to be paid to use any particular strategy. The strategy that is perceived as
yielding the maximum net gain is the one selected; one that costs more would be a bad investment of resources, and one that costs less
would unnecessarily increase the risk of an incorrect decision.
Obviously this is a complex model. We have
also used a number of assumptions to simplify
things. The next step is to test empirically the
general propositions of the model. But stimulation of research was only one of the goals of
this article. The other goal was to prompt investigators to consider a general theoretical reappraisal of decision making research. Instead of

<-----Page 11----->449

the current focus on normative models and decision aids, we suggest that understanding what

strategies are actually used and why they are
used is an equally important task.
